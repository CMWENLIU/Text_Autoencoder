I have been a loyal fan of Product 19 for at least seventeen years. It is the only really healthy thing I eat, but I eat about four boxes of it a week. There was a number of years when I could not easily find Product 19, and in that span of time I gained almost seventy! pounds, had my BP jump to 180/110, my sugar to 260, and my triglycerides to almost 800. Now that I am back on the wagon, my weight is dropping about 1/2lb./week, my BP, sugar, and triglycerides are dropping, and I am beginning to feel human once again.<br /><br />YMMV (Your mileage may vary), but P19 is a Godsend for me.<br /><br />Props to Amazon too, for providing. I used to have to drive about thirty miles to get my twice-monthly supply, and then even that store stopped selling it. Faced with the prospect of a fifty mile supply line, I turned to the Net for surcrease, and found it here. Thanks Amazon, and thanks to you too Kellogg.
