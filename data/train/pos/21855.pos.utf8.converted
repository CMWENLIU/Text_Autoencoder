From all I have ever been able to learn, Lundberg is a first class operation.  I have tried (I think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that I have been buying their products.  While I didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />There is one problem, which is not Lundberg's fault, but is worth noting.  Too often, in local grocery stores, the Lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality.  I assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the "good stuff" is removed).  The symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like Play-Doh smells.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V64HZ2">Play-Doh 24 Pack of Colors</a>  In order to avoid this problem, I started ordering my Lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used.  So, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than Lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go.  If you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like Play-Doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.<br /><br />Of all the Lundberg products, Countrywild is my absolute favorite.  It is a nice blend of flavors, and I sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal.  It has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.<br /><br />One more thing.  For years I was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice.  I finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods.  It really made a huge difference, and if you are a rice lover, you may want to try something like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SNWJ3A">Sanyo ECJ-PX50S 5-Cup Micro-Computerized Pressure Rice Cooker and Steamer</a> or if your budget can stand it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZZGW">Zojirushi NP-HTC18 Induction Heating 10-Cup Pressure Rice Cooker and Warmer</a><br /><br />(I use the Sanyo and like it pretty well.  A search on "pressure rice cooker" here, or a visit to any large Asian store, will reveal other makes and models, but there are no inexpensive pressure type rice cookers because of the substantial construction and safety requirements.)
