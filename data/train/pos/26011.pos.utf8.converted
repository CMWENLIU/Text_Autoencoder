This is the only instant noodle that everyone I know who tried it absolutely loves! It's spicy (to make it less spicy, put the packet in only at the end, and put in less powder.), and the noodles are nice and thick. I like to cook mine a bit longer so the noodles get thicker. Note: The closer to the expiration date, the longer you'd have to cook it to get the same texture. The noodle bag comes with 2 packets, one with veggies and seaweed and one with flavor powder.<br /><br />From what I can tell, this is the exact same product as Nong Shim's "Seafood" noodle. It just has the non-English name, "Neoguri"...<br /><br />The difference between this and Shin Ramyun (another one of my favorites) is it has seaweed instead of mushrooms in the veggie packet.
