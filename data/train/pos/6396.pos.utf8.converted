Been having a horrible craving for taffy for quite a while, and this kind is rather difficult to find in stores around our area, man I am pleased with this purchased, arrived 2 days earlier than estimated and is really chewy stuff, has an amazing taste like the taffy I had as a kid down by the beach, would definitely buy another 5lbs of this stuff.
