It is closed to impossible to find freeze dried mangoes.  I love these and my children love them too.  Was happy to be able to find these delicious & healthy snacks here on Amazon!  As far as them being made in China, please we can't trust the FDA anymore than we can trust another country!!  Our FDA allows our food supply to be genetically modified without allowing us to know which items they are modifying. They also passed aspartame and splenda when everyone knows that it is poison and slowly killing us.  Really, I have as much faith in products made in China as I do in the U.S.  thanks to the horrible job of our FDA!!!  They can't be trusted for sure.
