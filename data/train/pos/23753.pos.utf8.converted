I love licorice, and just the smell of these licorice mints when I opened the box from Amazon was heavenly... So was the taste! They didn't melt instantly in my mouth as another poster said, although they're small and won't last for long (mainly because other common ingredients to slow down disintegration are thankfully missing, so it's just xylitol and natural flavors). But the licorice flavor lingers for quite a while. Gosh, I can just sniff the container periodically for a quick fix.... :) You just can't go wrong with something that is just xylitol plus natural licorice extract, natural anise, and natural fennel oil - all my favorites!<br /><br />I didn't buy them as candy (although I can see they will be quite suitable as a licorice fix when the craving hits) or as a "breath mint" but rather to use for preventive dental care, to help preserve and repair my teeth. The recommendation (see the zellies site with the link down at the bottom of the home page to the Ask Dr. Ellie blog for more information) is 3 to 6 grams of xylitol per day, preferably in small amounts after each meal, snack, or non-water beverage. These will do just fine for reaching my goal of 6 grams xylitol per day, since they have 0.4 grams (400 milligrams) of xylitol in each tiny tablet. One or two of them per dose will work well.<br /><br />They also do not have any sorbitol in them (a common ingredient in many products marketed as containing xylitol), which is a big asset because sorbitol can cause digestive problems and also can promote growth of the mouth bacteria (they can easily metabolize it) we're trying to reduce with xylitol (which can be eaten in much larger amounts with no problem by humans but the bacteria don't seem to be able to manage it). Xylitol also helps alkalinize your saliva after acidic foods or drinks, a good thing because that helps remineralize your teeth.<br /><br />The Amazon price is good, also, especially with Subscribe&Save.
