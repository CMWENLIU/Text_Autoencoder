After lots of research, for Ceylon cinnamon sticks, Indus organics was the supplier I was looking for.<br />I had discovered previously, that real cinnamon was from Ceylon, the true and healthy quality is from India, but I was unable to find it anywhere else on the market. Wholefoods and many other health food stores did not even know the difference between CASSIA and CINNAMON from CEYLON.<br />Cassia is the cinnamon from China, it is harder & darker brown color,(.5% of coumarin),when real cinnamon is more brittle and lighter brown, and from India(.004% of coumarin) beside is healthier.<br />Cassia is mostly what is sold in the States, still called "cinnamon".<br />Indus organics knew exactly what I was looking for, not only they sale quality products but they know what they are selling.<br />I highly recommend this company.<br />Catherine Salacuse
