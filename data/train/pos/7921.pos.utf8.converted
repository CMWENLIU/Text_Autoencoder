lovely aroma and fruity flavor with the tiniest hint of a peppery finish is making me think that the best olives are grown in spain rather than italy.<br /><br />ever since the scandal broke in the New Yorker magazine (august 13, 2007 - Slippery Business by Tom Mueller.  google it.) about the fraudulent practices of italian olive oil merchants i have been looking for ways to identify good sources of untainted olive oil.  recent reviews in Cooks Illustrated confirm that the truest and most consistent flavors found in the EVOO market today are coming from spain.  at a price.<br /><br />this Zoe Arbequina varietal brings both flavor and value back to us, the amazon consumers.  priced to compete with the italian junk in the grocery store, this line of oils meets my unfairly high standards.  (i hate to be a snob, but a bad oil can ruin a meal.)<br /><br />yes, this is a plastic bottle.  so what.<br /><br />thanks to Tom Mueller, the New Yorker, Cooks Illustrated, Amazon, and Zoe.  great oil.  tonight it gets drizzled on baby creamer potatoes, with sel gris and fresh dill.  bon appetit.<br /><br />five stars
