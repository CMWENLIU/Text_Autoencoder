Ever since discovering that I had Celiac disease, I have become quite thin(which is nice) and quite resigned to my sad, cakeless fate. I have tried a number gluten free cake mixes and have been profoundly disappointed by all of them. Some fall to pieces when you slice them, some are gritty, some have an awful aftertaste from the unfamiliar flours used in making them.<br /><br />I was browsing the shelves at my local Target store when I saw this mix. It was the last box in the back row of the top shelf, and it was on sale. In short, it was calling for me. The employee who had to help me get it down turned out to be gluten intolerant as well and had good things to say about it. She recommended I use only egg whites, as the cake was a bit heavy otherwise.<br /><br />I baked up a batch last night and it made 17 normal sized cupcakes and might have made eighteen if I hadn't spent so much time tasting the batter. Mixing it up was a breeze and the Betty Crocker website has no-butter variations on its website if you're concerned about that sort of thing. If this keeps up, I probably will be in a while.<br /><br />The cupcakes came out moist and not even a little bit grainy or dry. They came out looking and tasting exactly like glutinous cupcakes. My gluten-loving boyfriend ate two and said they were excellent. The next morning they were a little dryer and firmer, but still very good. Microwaving them for a few seconds restores them to their fresh-baked state.<br /><br />I got my first box for just under 4 bucks, about the same as it is here only I had to drive to get it. For 4 bucks I got 17 cupcakes that taste better than the baked goods at the gluten free bakery in town. The bakery charges about as much for one pastry as I paid for this box, so I figure I got a good deal. I don't understand everyone who is complaining about how you don't get as much cake as a conventional Betty Crocker cake mix. Don't you all remember how much cake you get from a similarly priced Bob's Red Mill bag? Or GF pantry? Or how much a flourless chocolate cake costs at the natural foods store? A hell of a lot more.<br /><br />As much as I want to support the smaller specialty companies and their small, ethical companies...I'm going to have to pass and go to Betty Crocker for my cake needs. Sorry folks.
