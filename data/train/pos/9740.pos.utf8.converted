This tea is so good! I had always had a giant mug of matcha tea that I got from Whole Foods. That tea was Allegro brand. I thought it was good until Whole Foods was late getting my order in, and I bought this tea from Amazon.<br />I will never drink anything else! This tea is so smooth and not at all bitter.<br />I use a whisk to blend it in the almost boiling water, add stevia powder to sweeten, and a generous splash of vanilla soy milk.<br />What a great way to start the morning!
