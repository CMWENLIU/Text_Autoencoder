Bigelow isn't the cheapest tea around, but they are the best tasting (Altho I like Twinings' Earl Grey blend better than Bigelow's). Foil packs keep them fresh tasting pretty much forever. Lemon Lift's hint of spicy lemon is always a hit with company, and has won over many coffee drinkers. Also great, and hard to find in stores, is Bigelow's Chinese Fortune. Plantation mint, for spearmint lovers, is great in the Summer months. I know this sounds like a commercial, but Bigelow deserves it!
