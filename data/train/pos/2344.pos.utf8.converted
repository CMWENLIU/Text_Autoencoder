This cake tasted as good as a home-made (or better!) cake but took 1/2 the time.<br />Seriously. And I'm a total baking (as well as natural foods) snot!<br />Not convinced of my credentials?<br />You should see the rye, sourdough and challah breads out of my oven today.<br />Not to mention the batches of cookies.<br />The amount of flour and butter I go through on a weekly basis for cookies, cakes and breads would let you know: i'm the one person in 100 whom you'd classify as a good home baker. I'm definitely not a "mix" baker. And while baking my own birthday cake just seemed un-festive,  asking someone else to bake my cake seemed like it'd spell disaster.  But Someone else offered. And that Someone Else, not as comfortable with my cake pans as I, used Naturally Nora. And both of these baker "elves" agree: "it was delicious and easy to make." And from my guests' opinions,<br />no one could tell the difference between this mix and home-made. Soooooo tasty. And the icing mixed up as a breeze.<br />Next year, when I'm considering mixing up my own birthday cake or using a Naturally Nora Mix, the decision is easy. Nora. All the way.<br />!<br />You won't believe how easy and tasty it is.<br />I'd show you a picture, but there's none left.
