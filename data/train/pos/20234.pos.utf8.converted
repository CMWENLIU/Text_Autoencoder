Very Happy to have finally found Bob's "Big Jim" Giant Peppermint Stick, 5 oz.) on Amazon.  This Old Fashioned candy is impossible to find in local (Oregon) stores whereas it was once a commonly found candy particularly for Christmas stocking stuffers.  I wanted these for two grandchildren to share a treat from my childhood and was very happy to find them on Amazon.  Shipper was very prompt and the candy sticks arrived in Germany before Christmas.  The children were so surprised and excited to find these Giant Peppermint Sticks.  Will definitely order again.
