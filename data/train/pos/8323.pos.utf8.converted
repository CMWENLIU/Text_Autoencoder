After several dismal failures using a pot on the stove, I finally had great success after firing up the big turkey fryer kettle/propane burner in the driveway, using about 8 inches of peanut oil.  Taking advice of others - refrigerate the dough for several hours, and then make sure you roll out the dough to EXACTLY 1/8th inch thickness like the instructions say, about the same as a piece of corrugated cardboard - no thinner (don't puff up and turn out like cookies) and no thicker (too heavy, flat and thick - like they serve at the Cafe Beignet and some other places).  I started test frying them at 320-340 degrees, but finally got the best result at higher temperature of 380-400.  First time I've ever had them puff up perfectly like at Cafe du Monde, light and fluffy like little pillows with one inch vertical rise.  Good luck.
