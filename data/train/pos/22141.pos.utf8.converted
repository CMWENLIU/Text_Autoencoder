I've tried various English and Irish breakfast teas, and this one is my all time favorite.  The tea is packaged either in bulk or in silk pouches.  Because I have this tea to start every morning, I have been buying it in bulk.  The quality of the tea is excellent.  Mighty Leaf does not use ground up tea leaves, rather the leaves are full and filled with flavor.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  It will get your morning off to a great start.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5Y0M">Mighty Leaf Tea, Organic Breakfast, 15-Count Whole Leaf Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>
