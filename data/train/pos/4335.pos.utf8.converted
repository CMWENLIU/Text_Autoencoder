I just finished my last Vita Coco that I odered on Amazon...and now have to reorder more! The 100% pure is so delicious. The twist off is very functional. I went to the beach last week and threw it in the cooler and did not have to drink it all at once (even though that is not hard to do it all, since it is so yummy). Keep up the great work Vita Coco. Finally someone is paying attention to what goes in our bodies to hydrate us!!
