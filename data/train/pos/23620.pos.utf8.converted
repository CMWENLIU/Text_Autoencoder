The changeover from 30 years or so of drinking V8 regular to low sodium was impossible for me until someone mentioned adding a little pepper to the low sodium V8 made the drink, drinkable.<br />The pepper made my beverage of choice, low sodium V8, delicious enough to keep drinking it until I no longer need the pepper.<br /><br />The value of a low sodium V8 cannot be overstated, in my opinion.
