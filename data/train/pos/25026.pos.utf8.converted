I am by no means a food critic or expert, but these Toffee-ettes are the most addictive yummy candy I've had in years! I can't even think of anything to compare them to. There is just enough toffee to get the flavor but none of the tooth gumminess, and the coating of almonds is just salty enough mixed with the chocolate that... well it's perfection and that's that!! I never want to eat any those large-brand toffee candy bars again!
