I LOVE HARIBO Gummi Bears as well as cherries, alphabets, and coke bottles.  One thing I have noticed, is that HARIBO is one of the best producers of Gummi candies EVER.  They are nice and firm and very flavorful (the cherries tast like cherries, the coke bottles taste like coke, and the alphabets and gummi bears are just fantabulous)!
