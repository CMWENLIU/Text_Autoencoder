I love this product.  My dog drops bombs in the house on a regular basis.  Perhaps he does it just to let me know that he needs more attention or maybe he does it to piss me off.  Poop Freeze has saved the day!  It makes picking up poop easy and fun.  Did I say fun - YUP.  My kids love picking up after the dog outside in the yard with Poop Freeze.
