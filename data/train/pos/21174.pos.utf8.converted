This is an excellent cracker, chip, garnish for any and all meals - GREAT for dipping hummus or plain snacking.<br />I really like the naked chips, but the whole wheat ones, which they do not have here, are even better.<br />These are very expensive - over $3/bag - in the regular supermarket. The prices here are really about 1/2 of everywhere else (including the warehouse stores)
