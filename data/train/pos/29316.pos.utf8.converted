I purchased PB2 after finding a recipe for a Butterfinger Smoothie.  I had heard about the smoothie from a friend who is a personal trainer.  I made the recipe immediately when I received the PB2 powder.  It was wonderful!  It really tasted like a Butterfinger.  For anyone trying to increase her protein intake and avoid adding fat, this is the perfect product.  There are tons of recipes on the web for smoothies using this product.  I also used it mixed with a tiny bit of water as a dip for apples as a much lower fat alternative to apples and peanut butter.  I just placed another order for the PB2 combo pack with original and the chocolate flavor.  My next order will be the 6 or 12 pack.
