Got mine today.  Supplement facts, serving size, and proportions of Iodine (389 mcg) Sodium (40 mg) and Potassium (95mg) ALL on the label.<br /><br />One little mistake I made early in the game  was...  getting my mcg and mg mixed up.  My original old school civil defense KI (Potassium Iodide) pills were 85mg and the dose at the time was two a day for 14 days.  Kind of difficult to achieve with powdered kelp.<br /><br />BUT no one in the USA is going to need an emergency supplement of this nature, anyway.<br /><br />Did notice that in less than a week the price jumped quite a bit!<br /><br />Am going to make an attempt at soup with this as one of the ingredients.  Will let everyone know how it turns out.  I really like Japanese Nori (seaweed) and I used to use fermented fish sauce in things to get an authentic and particular flavor. Hoping this does the trick.<br /><br />Should be interesting.
