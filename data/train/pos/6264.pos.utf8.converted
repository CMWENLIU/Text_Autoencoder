I got addicted to this stuff when I was living in Japan, and one of my big regrets about being back in the US is how hard, and how expensive, it is to lay my hands on some yuzu kosho.<br /><br />Yuzu kosho is made from the citrus fruit yuzu, which has a distinct flavor, different from a lime or lemon.  Kosho basically means "pepper", and this paste has a peppery flavor with a distinct yuzu bite.  It is soooooo good, and goes with almost everything.  It is especially good on chicken and fish, which is what I mainly use it for.  I also use it for a ranch-style dressing that is fantastic.<br /><br />This brand here is a high-quality version, rather than the ubiquitous cheap tube form you can find anywhere in Japan.  You don't use a lot of it when cooking, and a little goes a long ways, so this little jar will last awhile.  I am really glad to have a place to buy it here in the US, because frankly I don't want to go back to cooking without it!
