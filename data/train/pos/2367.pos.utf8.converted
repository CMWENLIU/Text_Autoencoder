I was excited to purchase BPA free canned beans from a reputable company, Eden Foods, who I must admit I think I have a brand preference towards, because I appreciate the effort they put into setting high standards for their products and finding growers who can provide them with that. While I do want to eventually switch to using dried beans because I think that its less packaging and better price versus the canned, I am busy sometimes and find that to have some canned beans in the pantry on stock has been very helpful. The kidney beans in the can are nice big beans, and taste delicious.<br /><br />Kidney beans are great cold out of the can in salads with kale, red onion, avocado, and sprouts and I love them in soups! (But shortly before the soup is ready as you dont want them to get too mushy) I was happy about my purchase and will continue to buy Eden Kidney Beans, whether it be canned or dried.
