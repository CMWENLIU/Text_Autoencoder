Vegan. Natural. From Norway. Great rye flavor, which is the most traditional Scandinavian variety. Beautiful rye flakes adorn the top of each piece. Two airtight packages per box. Wafers are the size of half of the front of the package standing upwards, comparable to a graham cracker. Low fat. 30 Kcal with only 2.5 Kcal (0.25g) from fat per wafer. About half the thickness of a saltine, but stronger. Very enjoyable with chili or soup or for appetizers. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
