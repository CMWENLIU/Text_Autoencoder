Moon Pies are a classic treat that taste great. And why not? They are essentially graham cracker cookies filled with marshmallow cream (Fluff) and dipped in chocolate. Amazingly, not even unhealthy! No cholesterol or trans fat. 220 calories but we all have to live a little and each one is bigger than a hockey puck after all.<br /><br />So let me cut to the chase:<br /><br />Both sellers here charge as much for shipping as they do for the product! That effectively doubles the price of a 12-pack box to more than fifteen dollars.<br /><br />Here's the solution. I found Moon Pies in all three flavors (Chocolate, Vanilla, Banana, though I only buy the original!) at the Cracker Barrel Old Country Stores which are attached to the restaurants. The cost? Four ninety-nine plus tax for the same sized box. That was last year. Also, Chattanooga Bakery (they invented the Moon Pie eighty years ago) indicated these are available at many Wal-Marts across the country. Buying locally would prevent some of the shipping damage (i.e., melting) some people have reported.<br /><br />If you are not located near a Cracker Barrel or Wal-Mart which sells these, you can buy them direct (moonpie dot com) for six bucks per box plus shipping.<br /><br />Enjoy!
