Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is a good gluten-free substitute for gluten-based linguine. This corn-quinoa blend looks like gluten-based linguine when cooked, and while not the same as gluten-based, the texture is much better than most rice-based pastas - it doesn't have an al dente bite, but it does twirl up on a fork, if not overcooked.  The flavor is not typical of linguine, but it's also not off-flavored - it's neutral-flavored and pairs well with red sauces, and is also acceptable with delicate or mild sauces.  To prevent the pasta from sticking or clumping, follow the directions, and in addition, stir the water while adding the pasta, so that it doesn't have the chance to stick together.  For those on gluten-free diets, this quinoa linguine is the closest I've tasted to gluten-based and can be served to the whole family without complaint.<br />Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is organic, made in the USA, and manufactured in a gluten-free facility.<br />Each serving has 205 calories, 46 g carbs, 4 g protein, 1 g fat, 4 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol.<br />Ingredients: organic corn flour, organic quinoa flour.
