I wondered when Amazon might get around to offering this product. I've loved eating these basic fried and dehydrated noodles for decades, and will be glad to order them by the case. These simple noodles are great with tons of Tabasco--quick and satisfying.<br /><br />The instructions are plain silly, though. My family has always prepared these noodles this way: 1. boil water in a pot, 2. add in the soup base, 3. add in the noodles, and then cook them together till the noodles are soft enough to eat (I like them slightly undercooked). Cooking the noodles in the soup base makes them taste better. Do not overcook, and do not let noodles sit in soup for too long while eating (e.g., longer than half an hour), or noodles will become too soft and fat.<br /><br />Then I pull the noodles out first and douse them with hot sauce--so the hot sauce will cling to the noodles as well as the soup--and then pour in the soup. That vinegary Tabasco taste mixed with the salty noodles and soup is very good. The noodles are also good with an egg--cracked into the pot after the soup base, and cooked together with the noodles.
