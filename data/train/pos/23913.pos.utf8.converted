In a nutshell:  Energy gel that keeps you going when going gets you tough. Well, until your knees give out or something.<br /><br />What it is:  It's an energy gel formulated for endurance athletes (never mind that not a lot of us who use the products like these will ever win a New York Marathon or something; if you participate, you're an athlete, right?)  I've got the Chocolate Outrage version, which has 32g of mixture containing various carbs, amino acid, and rather marginal amount of caffeine.  The price comes down to roughly $1 per pack, which might be a bit hard to swallow (no pun intended).<br /><br />What it's like:  It's a chocolatey paste that's easy to squeeze out and suck on from the pouch while running.  It recommends you to drink water while eating this; I recommend the same (and try for water instead of sports drink; water works better for washing this down).  I used this for my first (and last?) marathon, at the recommended pace of one pack 15 minutes before the race, and every 45 minutes of activity... it was cut closer to an hour than 45 minutes, as it does take some time to get absorbed to your body.  Thanks to it, I was able to finish the marathon despite my body basically refusing to run the last few miles.  If nothing else, I had the energy to go further, if not the joints.  And that's probably due to my inadequate training; this is no miracle worker in that it lets you do things you normally wouldn't do.  Or maybe it does... it's just that having the energy to do things doesn't translate to having the physical capacity to run ridiculous distances.<br /><br />Does it work?:  I think so.  But it doesn't seem to have replenished any electrolytes... so I guess you should use sports drink with this, after all.<br /><br />In conclusion:  these packs work wonders in keeps you going in the energy department--follow the instruction and I'm sure you won't bonk halfway through.  Don't forget to train, though!
