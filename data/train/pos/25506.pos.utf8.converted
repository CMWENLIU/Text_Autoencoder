Having recently been persuaded by several of my closest friends to try a beverage other than coffee, I decided to experiment with several different tea flavors. Although I tired many flavors, I discovered Earl Grey to be among my most prized favorites. This elegant tea dose not boast a subtle flavor, rather, it has many very noticeable and expertly blended flavors that demand to be noticed. Overall, there is a definitive taste inherent in most regular teas but underneath this strong and invigorating flavor there is a more subtly interwoven element of citrus and perhaps a smoky flavor as well. Because of these complementary tastes and the overall flavor they combine to make, I found this tea to be most satisfactory. It should be savored, steaming in a cherished red mug, while sitting beside a roaring fireplace with a cozy kitten snoring in a basket, the picture of utter feline contentment rolling off her in warm luxurious enveloping waves, while you indulge in a favorite book as you curl beneath the old family quilt as layers of snow cascade from the sky outside in the frigid night air. It is the quintessential tea for the most cozy of occasions and should be savored to the last drop.<br /><br />A NOTE ON BREWING : Because of the strong and sometimes bitter nature of this tea, it should not suffer over brewing! I find that it is best brewed for about two minutes; however, others with a preference for stronger tea might hazard three minutes brewing. If you wish to make it even stronger, I recommend brewing it for a greater amount of time for each individual cup until you encounter the perfect combination. Also, you will note that even the tea bags smell divine and are almost irresistible themselves.<br /><br />- Ravenova
