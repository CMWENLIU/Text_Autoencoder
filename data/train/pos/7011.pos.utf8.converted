This knife/cutting board combo is awesome.  Not only is it beautiful (red alder with maple and walnut accent), it's amazingly functional!<br /><br />Knife stashes in the board when not in use, board leans nicely against counter backsplash.<br /><br />When ready to use, simply pull the knife from the indentation, plop your fresh bread onto the board and slice away.  The knife is sharp, long, and simple to use.  Thick or thin, all slices look like professional cuts.<br /><br />When you're finished, dust the crumbs off the board, place the knife in it's holder, and replace it against the backsplash.  Looks good and works great!
