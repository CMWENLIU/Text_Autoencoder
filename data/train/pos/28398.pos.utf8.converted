Short of making your own at home, I don't believe you'll find a better gluten free pasta. This pasta has great texture, great flavor, and I like that it's organic and made of brown rice instead of white rice and tapioca flour like most gluten free pastas. If you're going to eat pasta, at least this one allows you to get whole grains instead of filler. This pasta even stands up to a bit of overcooking, so if you put it in a mac & cheese or baked dish, it still comes out great and not mushy. I highly recommend this to any person who is gluten free.
