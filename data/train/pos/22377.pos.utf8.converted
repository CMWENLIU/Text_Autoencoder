this is a wonderful product!  it is a basic scone mix that only needs water;<br />but so far we have made:<br />sun-dried tomato, basil, and feta scones,<br />cranberry-orange scones,<br />spinach and parmesan cheese with garlic scones, and<br />pecan scones with maple icing.<br />easy and delicious.  they bake up with a very tender quality.  the big box contains 4 plastic bags of mix that each make 12 scones.  will definitely keep this staple in my pantry!
