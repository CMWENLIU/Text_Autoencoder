I am a popcorn fiend!  I love popcorn very much, and wanted to try some new types.<br /><br />Last year, my wife got me a gourmet popper, and I have been experimenting with different kinds.  I got a couple of specialty popcorn from Williams-Sonoma.  They were great, but on the expensive side.<br /><br />Now, this popped up a bit on the small side.  If you are expecting big pops like from Orville Reddenbacher, you will be disappointed.  What will thrill you, though, is the flavor.  This tastes so very good, with just the hint of oil and salt, I have gone thru buckets of this stuff!!!<br /><br />Next, to try it with cheese.  Hmmmmm.....
