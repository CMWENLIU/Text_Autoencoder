This is an outstanding English Breakfast tea.  I normally never stray from Twinings but wanted to try an organic fair trade tea.  This tea far exceeded my expectations.  I find the tea's fragrance and flavor much more appealing than my old Twinings favorite.  I drink my tea straight and find this tea aromatic with a solid flavor and kick.
