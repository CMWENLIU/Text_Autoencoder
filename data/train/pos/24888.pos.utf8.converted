I like this drawer, it is well constructed, nothing is flimsy on this product. It's lightweight and easy to move around. My coffee maker fits on the top of it and if water spills on this drawer, its easy enough to wipe off. I bought this in addition to the 3-drawer stack (also sold by Nifty) and it holds all my k-cups. I tend to order in bulk and had a problem storing all those k-cups and of course rotating them with my teas and cocoas in my standing k-cup holder. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their k-cups in reach and don't have a lot of counter space.
