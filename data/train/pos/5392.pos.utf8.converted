Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea is a favorite in our house.  My cats LOVE the taste and I love that it doesn't have any by-products or fillers like corn, wheat or soy.  My guys eat this food as part of their regular rotation.  They have shiny, silky coats and they hardly shed at all.  The litter box is easy to clean, even with 2 cats.  I thought at first that this food was really expensive, but considering that I only have to feed 1/2 as much as the "grocery store brands" to get the same amount of nutrition, it all evens out in the end.  And I also can't put a price on the health of the animals I chose to care for.  They also love the other Natural Balance canned flavors, as well as the Natural Balance Ultra dry kibble.
