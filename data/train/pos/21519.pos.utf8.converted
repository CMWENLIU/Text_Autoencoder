I was introduced to Emily's chocolate covered dried fruit and nuts when my friend gave me some as a gift. Now it's my new favorite candy.  This stuff is so good, especially the cranberries and strawberries.  I've had chocolate covered dried fruit before, but the chocolate wasn't nearly as good as what Emily's uses.  This tastes like good, high-quality chocolate.  This is a great and unique gift to give someone who has it all.
