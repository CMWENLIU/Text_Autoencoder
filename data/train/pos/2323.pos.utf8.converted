I bought this tea after hearing about reported health benefits and because herbal teas have never really worked for me and I wanted to give another go at it. This tea really blew me away with it's complex melody of flavors, lack of bitter overtones and ability to steep for a long period only making it for the better. I'm actually surprised at my response and feel fortunate to have come across this product (thanks Amazon!).
