Vegan. Natural. Big beautiful butter beans. Nice texture and flavor. Great for pasta with your favorite tomato veggie sauce. Butter beans also make a great topping on vegan (cheese-less) pizzas. I like them as a combo with spinach for pizza. Can also be used to make hearty butter bean burritos with salsa. Approx 627 calories and 45g protein per 14.28 oz/400g can. Case of 24 cans. Made with butter beans, water, salt. Product of Italy. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
