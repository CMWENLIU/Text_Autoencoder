I have only used one bag so far, but I put in a 2-lb salmon fillet glazed with an apple juice reduction and the results were so delicious that my family of three ate the entire fillet in one sitting.  Neither my husband, nor my daughter have ever even liked salmon before.  It was incredibly easy, the directions are very clear, and best of all:  no mess to clean up!
