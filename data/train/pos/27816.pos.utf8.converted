I discovered this product when I was shopping in a supermarket in a Spanish neighborhood. Since I'm always looking for something new in the way of ingredients I bought some. This is the greatest beef flavoring product on the market. I use it in a lot of different recipes. One reviewer said it's as healthy as eating salt, but I disagree. If you use it in a recipe and cut back on the salt called for in the rest of the recipe, I think you'll be Okay.<br />For example, one thing I use it in is sauce bolognese. A teaspoonful or so in the sauce gives it an all day cooked flavor without cooking all day. In cocktails, a drink called a Bullshot is made with bullion, lemon juice and vodka. Serve it to your friends and they will wonder about the great flavor.<br />Everyone has a secret ingredient in their recipes that when someone asks you for the recipe you sort of forget to write down. This is mine. If the recipe calls for bullion, I don't tell them I use Maggi and they still wonder why mine tastes better.
