I found a link to the tofu shirataki in an article on MSN.com talking about foods to stay away from.  Of course they weren't talking about staying away from the tofu shirataki noodles, but to steer clear on pasta, even whole wheat, claiming it to be a glorified junk food that quickly turns to sugar once digested.  Being Italian and an avid pasta fan, I quickly "googled" and found a link to Amazon.com on www.house-foods.com.  I ordered 5 packages of the noodles, because I have been eating health food for awhile and despite the poor reviews, I was ready to give these a shot.  I am so glad that I did.  They are like tough spaghetti.  By tough I do not mean, tire rubber, but more like over cooked.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I cooked them in marinara sauce, put them in broth and made an Asian style soup and served them with teriyaki chicken.  These things are so versatile and fabulous.  I am on weight watchers and an entire bag of these noodles has 0 points and only 40 calories with 4 grams of fiber.  You can't ask for a better alternative to pasta.  The expiration date is about 4 months from when you order, so you don't have to gobble them up immediately. It also makes stocking up more convenient.  I will be stocking up on these indefinitely!  My only complaint is that shipping is kinda high, but I guess they do have to be cold packed to stay fresh.
