It's an outstanding product, I used this and another product on a trip to South Dakota and never once had a single bug touch me, what I really love about this is the climbers clasp attached to it, you can rig it to you anywhere, and after it's used just remove the clasp and you have a key ring!<br /><br />Good value, function and recycling all in one.<br />I think you could do allot worse than this right here.<br />If you're planing a trip and need to kick the bugs off your turf "body", I say go for it, the stuff may need to be rubbed on, but there's no chance of failure like there is with a pump bottle.<br /><br />Awesome item.<br />Bugs ante'  going to touch me xD
