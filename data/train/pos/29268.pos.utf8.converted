I would rate this product as five stars without hesitation.  Nutty and full flavored, it resembles very little what consumers have come to expect of rice.  It's actually much better.  I would rate Amazon a zero for offering such a fine product and then failing to continue to provide it when it is still readily available from the producer.  For a truly reliable source for this wonderful product, visit the Lundberg Farms website.  Their products can also be found in many grocery stores around the country, not just "health food" stores.<br /><br />Update to original review:  The reviewer who reported a darkening of the cooking water was not reporting a fluke.  This rice is not dyed, but requires washing in cold water several times before cooking to make sure that all residue on the outside of the rice is removed.  This is not actually a problem.  Just something that should be done as a matter of good practice in cooking all brown rices.  Dark rices give you more visible evidence of the residue, but it is inherent with the lighter colored brown rices as well.  The lighter colored rices produce a kind of milky solution when first washed which clears with repeated washings.<br /><br />After rinsing a few times, the black rice will retain its original color and the wash water should be relatively clear.  Use your hands to rub the rice together when rinsing to do a thorough job.  Removing this residue helps the individual rice kernels to cook without sticking together.<br /><br />Another tip is to coat the washed rice after the final washing with enough olive oil to produce a light sheen on the rice before cooking it.  This also helps the rice to cook without sticking together and adds the flavor of the olive oil to the rice.  Choice of olive oil should complement the underlying flavor of the rice being cooked and the dish being prepared.
