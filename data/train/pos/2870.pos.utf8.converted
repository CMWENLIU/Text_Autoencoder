We tried a preparation containing bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) 10-15 years ago to kill grubs in the lawn.  It was a failure.  I later read that manufacturers were shipping dead preparations.  (Bt is a family of bacteria living naturally in soil.  The bacteria in the preparation must be live to be useful.)<br /><br />Now (June 2011) we had cabbage worms eating the leaves of our young Brussels sprout plants.  Extension services recommended Bt, so we bought this product.  It worked!  The directions are not very thorough, but the package is a very effective dust sprayer.  Shake the package, aim the orifice and give the bottle a good steady squeeze and you get a nice dust spray.  Focus on the new buds.  Our plants are doing fine without worm damage in the new growth a week after treatment.<br /><br />Bt breaks down in sunlight [...].  We sprayed the dust just before nightfall.
