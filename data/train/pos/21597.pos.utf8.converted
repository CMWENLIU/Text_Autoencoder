Having recently been diagnosed with diabetes, it's been difficult to find something to eat for breakfast that won't shoot my blood sugar through the roof.  My one & two hour post prandial glucose has been consistently below 140 after a pancake breakfast with this product. Half of a whole grain English muffin shoots it up over 180. My diet choices are complicated by that fact that, in addition to a diabetic diet, I'm also on a low salt, low fat low cholesterol diet (I'm sure I'm not alone, however).  I agree with prior reviewers that the pancakes are a little eggy but they taste really good nonetheless; light, fluffy and yummy.  I substituted Eggbeaters for the eggs (reducing further the calories, fat & cholesterol); they still taste great but maybe not as fluffy.  Next batch I'll try half eggs & half Eggbeaters.  Wonderful product!
