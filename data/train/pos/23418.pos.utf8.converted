My ex 2 years ago bought me 750 of these babies. It was the best gift i have ever gotten. Honestly. You know how you go the the 25 cent machine and get one of these guys out, and you honestly try your best not to lose it while your seeing how high you can bounce it. Then when you do (like 10 mins later) your pissed off. Well you dont have to worry about that when you buy a couple bags of em. Then you start getting crazy ideas like getting out the tennis racket and (when i was in college) seeing if you can hit people going into the cafeteria for dinner while your so far away no one knows who did it. Another good one is while your driving (on an empty road) throw one out in front of your car and see how many times you can hit it while it bounces down the street. Or have someone in the passenger seat bounce it out the car and into open shop doorways on the side of the road. Many have jumped off the top of the 'sunshine skyway bridge' in st. petersburg florida, they say hitting the water from that height is like hitting concrete, so did they bounce? dumping dozens off of roofs is pretty cool too, ive bounced one off a roof 16 floors up to the ground accross the street and into the 8th floor or so of a parking garage. I only have about thirty left rolling around my apartment from bouncy ball fights so im planning on buying more. I think everyone should have a bag. wow. who writes this much about bouncy balls.
