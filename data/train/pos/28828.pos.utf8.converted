The major difference between the Lavazza Qualita Oro Espresso (the gold can) and the Lavazza Italian Coffee, Caffe Espresso (the black can) coffees is that the Gold can Lavazza uses 100% Arabica beans from two different countries and the Black can Lavazza uses 100% Arabica coffee beans from only one country.<br /><br />The Lavazza Gold AND Black canned coffees BOTH are:<br />1. Lavazza coffee<br />2. Made using 100% Arabica coffee beans<br />3. Blended from 100% Arabica beans.<br />4. Blended to make espresso<br />5. Roasted and Packaged in Italy.<br /><br />Differences:<br />The Lavazza Gold can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from two countries:<br />1. Central America and,<br />2. Africa.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the Central American beans in this blend contributes a floral aroma.<br /><br />The Lavazza Black can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from only one country:<br />1. South America.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the South American beans in this blend are sweet and aromatic.<br /><br />Opinion:  Both coffees are excellent.  They have different characteristics and while everyone pretty much agrees that both are excellent coffees, some will favor the Black Can variety over the Gold Can - and vice-versa.  NEITHER are bad coffees, they just appeal to different tastes and one might perform better in your coffee making procedure/equipment than the other.  That still doesn't make either one "bad", it just makes one variety better suited to a particular brewing procedure and to personal taste.<br /><br />I prefer one variety to the other MOST of the time - primarily because of the excellent result/taste I get from one using my primary coffee making procedure.  When I use a completely different system AND procedure for making coffee, I prefer the other variety.  BOTH are excellent coffees but one is more likely to perform better in your coffee making method and system and give you better results than the other.  Properly made, I sincerely believe that BOTH coffees are EXCELLENT!  Now, please excuse me while I go make myself a fresh mug of Joe (quadruple espresso, nothing added). MMMmmmmmmmmmm....
