As a fan of the "After Dinner Linda's Lollies" I thought I'd start a new adventure and try 48 exciting flavors. These are perfect for every occasion and especially if you crave a wide range of flavors, but don't have time to always make Coconut Cr&egrave;me Pie or run to the store for Root Beer.<br /><br />Some of the flavors in this delicious 48-count box (mine arrived in a plastic bag) include: Watermelon, Buttered Popcorn, Green Apple, Caramel, Spearmint, Fruit Punch, Cotton Candy, English Toffee, Apple Cinnamon, Root Beer, Red Hot Cinnamon, Pink Lemonade, Pineapple, Peppermint (perfect), Blueberry, Wild Cherry, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry, Raspberry, Pink Grapefruit, Vanilla (so creamy), Limeade, Root Beer Float, Lemon Meringue Pie, Orangeade, Tutti-Fruity (cute and fun), Peanut Butter, Banana, Lemon Lime, Cherry Cheesecake, Butterscotch, German Chocolate Cake, Licorice, Chocolate Covered Banana, Concord Grape, Chocolate Marshmallow Sundae, Bubble Gum, Cinnamon (deliciously spicy), Pina Colada and Peach.<br /><br />Sound delicious? They are all dreamy sweet and smooth and taste delicious. One of the lollipops actually has coconut in it, so that is the only one I've noticed so far that had an interesting texture. I'd love to be able to buy a bag of any specific flavor - because you may notice you have favorites!<br /><br />A lollipop for every mood and occasion! Also try the Dessert and After Dinner varieties to get the full range of flavors.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review, enjoying Banana Cr&egrave;me Pie
