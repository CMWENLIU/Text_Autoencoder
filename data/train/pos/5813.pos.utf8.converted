I've been using SAF yeast for 15 years.  I keep the unopened pouches in the freezer.  When I open a pouch, I pour it onto a pint-sized plastic jar to keep in the refrigerator.  I use the plastic jar to refill a smaller jar, from which I get yeast when I make dough.  That way, I don't have to open the larger jar often.  It may sit in the refrigerator four years before I finish it.  It still seems as potent as freshly purchased yeast.
