I really really like these brownies - they are 75% organic (at least that is what the package says).  I just received my second shipment of 2 boxes yesterday.<br /><br />Question for the manufacture:  why all the waste and individually wrapping these?  Not only are they individually wrapped but there is also a plastic holder for the brownie inside - this just seems to add to the landfills needlessly! Even my husband commented to me about the waste.
