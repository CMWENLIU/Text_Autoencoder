This is the same product as used to be carried at Williams-Sonoma, for half their price.  The only difference is that there is picture of a waffle on the can instead of a happy child.<br /><br />It makes tremendous waffles and pancakes, and I know of what I speak, because I am a mediocre and inexperienced cook and can make marvelous breakfasts with this mix.
