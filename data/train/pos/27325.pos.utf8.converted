I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price. I bought 3 packages of nuts from this company and 2 packages from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7LVM">Bergin Nut Company Brazil Nuts Whole Raw, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> to compare them. I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful! They were fresh, crunchy and absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Then I opened Bergin nuts. There was no flavor to them. What a waste that was! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled. It takes 3 teeth brushing to get rid of that awful taste! Avoid even trying Bergin nuts!<br /><br />So, if you want good Brazil nuts, buy the product you are currently looking at:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br />I've bought from them 5 times and each time nuts are fresh and tasty, just like they are supposed to be.<br /><br />Now, if only they didn't have so many calories... :)
