I read about this jam on the internet that RAF pilots would consume some Bilberry jam and somehow this would increase their night vision. I don't know if any of that is true, but what I can say is that it is very delicious and I will purchase more Bilberry jam. The problem is the shipping cost for a jar of the stuff. Come on, twice the price of the product? Even without the consumption of Bilberry jam it's easy to see that this is not a good value, and this somehow leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
