Alpine Sugar Free Spiced Cider mix is a very good tasting hot drink mix that is perfect for those looking to cut calories and carbs. I am a Type 2 diabetic and am always happy when something tastes just as good as the regular version (my wife likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BS29S">Alpine Spiced Cider Original Apple Flavor Drink Mix, 10-Count Packets, 0.74-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>). These only have 15 calories and 4 carbs per packet!<br /><br />I find that it mixes much better when you add hot water to it, instead of adding the packet into a cup of hot water.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
