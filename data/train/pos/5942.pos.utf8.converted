Xylitol, besides being an innocuous non sugar substitute (in contrast with some other sugar substitutes), also has the benefit of being an anti-cavity anti-bacterial, although how strong I don't know.  In addition, the cinnamon<br />flavor is delicious, and while the sweetness doesn't last, the hint of cinnamon flavor does. Altogether, a very worthwhile product.
