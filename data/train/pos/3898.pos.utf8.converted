These are excellent.  I am a St Louis native (but now reside in Virgina) and have been a customer of Bissinger's Chocolate for over 20 years.  I have never had better quality chocolate (okay I have had some amazing Swiss chocolate).  All their products are excellent, we really love the black sesame crunch, especially my Arabic husband, who may be a little bit of a sesame seed snob.  Did I mention this is GLUTEN FREE!!!  Bissinger's web site specifies gluten free on many items.  The service from Bissinger's is truly 5 star.
