I bread these with bread crumbs and just brown them lightly on both sides. If you over cook them they will be tough. Then serve them in a sandwich or on a hamburger bun with a slice of onion, tomato, lettuce, cheese and whatever condiments you would a hamburger. I like mine with mayonnaise and ketchup.<br /><br />They do not taste like a hamburger, and I don't think they were intended to. They taste good on their own.<br /><br />A great, healthy alternative to meat. Lots of protein and low fat. I even serve them to my 'meat & potatoes' eating husband.
