Ah, Indomie Mi Goreng.  The crack of the ramen world.  How can something this cheap be so bloody good.  And why isn't it easier to find??<br /><br />Seriously, this stuff is mondo good.  The noodles are even good dry.  You can mix it with just about anything you want too.  It's ramen, so it's  as healthy as styrofoam.  But oh it is so worth it
