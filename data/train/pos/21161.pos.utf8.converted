I bought this product only because others said it was good.  I was surprised how well it worked as an oven bread.  I also had trouble with the rise as did many reviewers, but by adding some of my own yeast and proofing it in a 150 degree oven for double the time created a really nice not-too-dense bread that baked up beautifully.  I baked mine in the oven and made them into rolls instead of a loaf.<br /><br />Another note:  I added to my last batch 1/2 cup each chopped nuts and diced dates for a more mediteranean flavor.  After the first rise when you punch it down just put the add-ins and knead a few times to incorporate, then mold it how you like (loaf or rolls) and let rise another hour to 1 1/4 hours and bake as directed (shorter time for individual rolls) and enjoy.
