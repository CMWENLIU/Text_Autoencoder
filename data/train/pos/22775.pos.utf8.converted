This dark roast blend makes an awesome cup of coffee that will get you ready to face the day or an outstanding espresso that even Scorsese or Cornholio would envy. This stimulating brew is equivalent to a fine wine and has a robust flavor with a whisper of sweetness. Makes a wonderful gift or sip and savor it yourself. A little more expensive than store bought coffee but you're worth it aren't you? You WILL NOT be disappointed.
