Well, I have five of these gardens now, so obviously this is a product I've been very happy with.  I started out with tomatoes and salad greens, and the salad greens were so tasty I added a second garden of those and two strawberry gardens (the second one is on order).<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pumps or noise, and everything has grown beautifully.  With five gardens going at once, it's so bright in that area of my kitchen that it looks like a UFO landing site, LOL, but they are all scheduled to go off at 11 p.m. so it's no problem at night when we're sleeping.<br /><br />These gardens are so cheerful to have around.  They add a nice moisture and a green, fresh smell, and I find the lights cheerful too.<br /><br />The salad greens grow very quickly and are so tasty that my biggest problem is resisting the urge to constantly pluck off leaves and eat them all day long.  That's why I got a second one -- so there would be plenty.  With four in my family, one garden did not produce quite enough for us.  Our first salad crop also did not grow for very long, only a couple of months, but I think that's just the nature of the plant.  The tomatoes took a long time to go to the fruiting stage (13 weeks), but now they are producing two or three ripe tomatoes each day, and they are delicious.<br /><br />I love having food growing indoors.  No bugs, no bird poop, no dirt, and everything can be eaten right off the plant.  Tonight over dinner we literally watched our first strawberry turn from white to pink on the end.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly economical way to grow food, but it's loads of fun and has been educational and exciting for my kids, who are much more interested in fresh produce than they used to be.<br /><br />I've had no trouble with either the pumps or the customer service.  In fact, everyone at Aerogrow has been very kind and helpful, both over the phone and in e-mail.  I hope the company continues to thrive because I just love these little gardens and hope to use them for years.
