We are heading to Italy in Sept and bringing our coffeemaker and these mini moos along! I bought these at Sam's, for half the price, so FYI.  The expiration date is 3 months from now, early Dec.  I don't think these items ever are more than 3 months expiration.  That is the nature of the beast.  It cannot last months and months up to a year b/c it is real dairy. If you get these with an expiration time frame of 2 or so months to use up, as others have 'complained' of, then you are in the ballpark. What I like about this product vs. others that came before it, is that this is the real deal which is so much better than imitation non-dairy creamer substitutes.
