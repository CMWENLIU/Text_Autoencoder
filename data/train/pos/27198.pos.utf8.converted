Breakfast time in our household is very busy, so often I've been setting up our rice cooker with a timer the night before to cook hot cereal that's ready when we are.  This works great, but we wanted to expand the cereal choices.<br /><br />Not ready to order a multi-pack of Quinoa (pronounced keen-WAH), I got a single box of these Ancient Harvest Quinoa Flakes at the local health food store.  It wasn't til I got home that I read on the box that a single serving (1/3 cup dry and 1 cup water) cooked in the microwave in only 2 and 1/2 mins.  Cool.  I was also pleased with the protein content - 4.3 grams per serving, not as good as oatmeal but better than all the other common hot cereal grains.<br /><br />Not an issue for us, but if it is for you, you should know this cereal is gluten free, and per the manufacturer's website, processed in a gluten free facility, as well as Kosher and organic.<br /><br />My husband found the taste a bit odd.  I loved this cereal myself.  To me the taste was ok, but the best part was the texture - it is extremely smooth and creamy, and a bit of Splenda and half and half made it perfect.  It's far finer than Cream of Wheat or grits.  The flakes really don't have a lot of taste which should make folks who like to creatively dress up their cereal happy, and if you like a chunkier breakfast there's always fruit and nuts to add if you want.  If you have ever had bitter quinoa, you should know these are pre-washed and the bitter coating taken off, resulting in a very mild taste.<br /><br />With this cereal, because of its quick cooking time, I don't use the rice cooker, just the microwave.  It's no fuss, meaning a single stir when it's done is sufficient, you don't need to check and stir as you go.<br /><br />The flakes can also be used to make pancakes or waffles, coating for cooking fish or chicken, baked muffins or cookies.  There's recipes on the box.<br /><br />If you're looking for a way to enliven your breakfast easily, a box of Quinoa Flakes is very worth a try.  I can tell this will be a staple for me.
