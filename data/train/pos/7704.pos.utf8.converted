This stuff has a  really really great taste!!!!!!  At first, I was a bit worried about what it was going to taste like by the Reviews that were posted here on Amazon.com.  But like most things, everyone has different taste buds, and what one person might dislike, another might love.  So, I gave it a try, and I found that I really like the taste of this honey substitute.  One of the the first things I tried Nature's Hallow Honey Substitute on was a piece of buttered toast Wow! I was really surprised.  So, I had to have another piece, but this time I added cinnamon (King Arthur's Vietnamese Cinnamon, which was also was another new product for me.) Wow WOW. . . .that was the best Cinnamon Honey Toast ever.<br /><br />Now, I did personally feel that this product mimicked the texture of Honey. . .and If any one has tried different varieties of honey, they know that honey comes in a variety of taste and texture.  I myself prefer a lighter tasting HONEY, and I felt for me this Honey Substitute mimicked that very closely.  No it was not completely Honey in texture, but close. . . .<br /><br />I know there are going to be others, who will not agree with me and that's OK. . .But those of you who have not tried Nature's Hallow Honey Substitute, please don't let the negative reviews stop you from at least trying it once.  I think some of you will be pleasantly surprised, and in a good way.<br /><br />My next plans are to bake with Nature's Hallow Sugar Free Honey Substitute, and hopefully it will replace honey and Agave Nectar in recipes where it is asked for. . .It's worth the try!!!!!!!
