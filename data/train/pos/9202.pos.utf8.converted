These boneless and skinless sardines packed in pure olive oil from Crown Prince are simply the best in the world (at least the VERY BEST I've ever encountered)! They are big, meaty, and bursting with flavor and nutrition. Best of all, Amazon's price was about 15% less than what I have paid at my local supermarket! I would unhesitatingly and enthusiastically recommend these sardines to anybody. YUM!!!
