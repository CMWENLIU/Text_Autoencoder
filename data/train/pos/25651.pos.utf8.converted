I have been researching salt for some time, and was amazed by the health benefits of Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Not only is it good for you (in small doses) your body needs this type of salt compared to the table salt we are use to that is processed, and has more chemicals added to it. Table Salt is a side product of most salt companies it is mainly shipped to processors like Kellogs etc. so they can add it to their boxed products.<br /><br />Celtic Sea Salt is harvested off of the coast of france and naturally dried by the sun, and the sun gives the salt "energy". Yes it sounds strange, but this energy is beneficial to our bodies. Energy charged minerals go directly to where they are needed in our bodies. This salt is actually "guiltless salt".<br /><br />The taste is like any other salt or sea salt.
