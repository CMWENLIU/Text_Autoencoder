I agree with the review above. It's really difficult to find this type of authentic flavor in the US. This box is ready to cook and is super easy to work with. I like to use two boxes, throw my own fresh meat/veggies in it. The results are restaurant quality. I will be trying the rest of the Prima Taste Curries now.
