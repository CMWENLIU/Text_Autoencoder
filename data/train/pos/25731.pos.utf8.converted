This cracker curbs appetite like no other. I have it in the morning with some low fat cheese on it, in the afternoon with some peanut butter and jelly on it and then in the evening with some cream cheese and salmon on it. I make sure to drink plenty of water too as it expands in your stomach and gives you the full feeling. It truly is a great product and it's quite a deal being sold on Amazon - especially with the free shipping! I'm looking forward to their new product which they are going to release soon called Sprinkles. It's the crushed up version which you can have on salads, yogurts, and ice cream. It's much better than granola, especially if you are trying to lose weight.
