Eden Foods is a great company if you ever research up on them.  They take care to ensure that the products they sell are pure and clean.  This is the only brand of Khombu, seaweed, and nori that I use, and it comes from Japan, not China.  These strips are great for adding into soups for extra flavor...the umami like the previous poster said.  I would not trust the other brand of seaweed I see at the coops...the Emerald one, because it comes from China, and there is hardly any oversight over there.  Eden Foods also makes a good gomasio blend if you ever have a chance to buy it.
