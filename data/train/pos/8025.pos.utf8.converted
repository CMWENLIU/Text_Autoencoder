I'm from Greece and there's no such thing as "instant greek coffee". There seems to be a confusion among reviewers between "frappe" and "greek aka turkish coffee", we are talking about two completely different kinds of coffee. To make frappe,which is cold coffee, you can use ANY KIND of instant coffee, add cold water, milk (if you want), and ice cubes,shake and serve in a tall glass. To make traditional greek aka turkish coffee (the one served in a small cup like espresso) you need a DIFFERENT TYPE OF COFFEE (eg Loumidis papagalos greek coffee). This kind of coffee is made by adding coffee, sugar (if you want) and water in a tiny boiling pan (called ibrik) and slowly bring it to a boil until the coffee rises. Nescafe classico is a very nice coffee, but it's totally different than the traditional greek/turkish coffee.It can only be used for cold frappe or hot instant, NOT traditional greek coffee.
