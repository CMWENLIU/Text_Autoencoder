Hi, I just wanna say I found this liquid smoke to be great.  It gave me exactly what I was looking for--that natural smoky flavor.  If you want to know, I didn't find it tasting synthetic or artificial.  It tastes very natural because it is natural.<br /><br />The only catch is you need to calibrate your quantity when using this product.  I recommend starting off conservative and adding more as you go.  If you put too much to start with, you may ruin your dish.  For a stew or chili, you can probably fix it by just adding more ingredients to make a bigger pot to reduce the smoke concentration.  Don't pour it directly on something your grilling.  Pour it into a small bowl or dish and brush it on evenly and lightly.  You can always brush on more as you grill.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a wonderful product and I recommend it highly.  I will be buying more once my 4oz bottle runs out.<br /><br />I hope my review has been helpful.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Scott
