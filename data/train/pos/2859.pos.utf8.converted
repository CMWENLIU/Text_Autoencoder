OK, here's the review: 4 oz has 6 calories, zero fat, 1 gram carbohydrate, zero sugar. 8 oz is a more realistic serving so double that. No taste or smell at all. Texture reminds me of a bean sprout-crunchy, not rubbery. They soften a bit when cooked. I stirred some into a bok choy stir fry, and they kind of disappeared into the crunchy veggies. Very filling. The bag recommends them in salads. That makes sense. I can imagine a sesame ginger dressing and some shredded carrot, no problem. $2.99 a pound where I am, from Sea Tangle Noodle Company. I think these will definitely replace some or all of my shirataki purchases. But don't plan to put spaghetti sauce on them.
