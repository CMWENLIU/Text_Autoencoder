Hey Bacon Lovers,<br /><br /> The original BACONNAISE is absolutely delicious!  There is NOTHING else like it on store shelves!  No, I am not the maker of this product or associated with it in any way other than being a HAPPY CUSTOMER!  YUMMMY!<br /><br />  The LITE Baconnaise, just like most calorie restricted products, doesn't taste as great as the original, fattier Baconnaise!  I suggest you go to J&D's website & buy the original BACONNAISE and not the lite variety.<br /><br />  I was hooked on FAST FOOD, especially McDonald's Big Macs!  I got a jar of original Baconnaise (looks darker than the lite jar that is pictured here)  after seeing it featured on Oprah.  It was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!<br /><br /> Although it's NOT a diet food, I have lost almost 10 pounds in only 3 weeks because I'd rather eat at home using my Baconnaise than grab something at the drive-thru!  I especially like a lean Roast Beef sandwich with Baconnaise.<br /><br />No fast food means no french fries or super sized Coke, so I think that's why I'm dropping the pounds!  Financially, we're saving a lot of CASH $$$ because I have DISCOVERED something that makes me SATISFIED with what I'm putting in my mouth.  Does that make sense?  Seriously, it costs us about $20 a fast food meal & we used to eat out several times a week.  We still do pizza every so often, but fast food has lost its allure!<br /><br />  I even went so far as to dab on some Baconnaise on a stalk of (ugh) broccoli yesterday & it was EAT-ABLE for once!  I can assure you I am NOT a veggie eater AT ALL!  Thanks to this tasty product, I now have hope that I can break my ADDICTION to fast food.  Even eating some veggies is NOW a possibility (almost an unbelievable statement from a junque food junkie!)<br /><br />  I took the time to write this because I could NOT believe the negative reviews and wanted to CLARIFY for all of those thinking about trying Baconnaise to purchase the ORIGINAL Baconnaise formula.  It has HELPED ME a great deal & I am now hooked for life!<br /><br /> Good Luck & Happy Eats! :D
