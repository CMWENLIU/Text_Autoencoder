<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112ILZM">Amazing Grass All Natural Drink Powder, Green Superfood, 8.5-Ounce Container</a>  I've been using this product for about 6 months, and have hooked at least 4 others on it.  I'm 53 years old, and have more energy, better/healthier physical appearance and overall well-being than many of my younger acquaintances.  I do free weights 4 mornings a week, 20 minute mini sessions.  I also split the rest of my aerobics between kickbox-interval training, zumba, ballroom dancing, and a weekly 3-mile walk/jog.  I understand that energy be-gets energy when working out.  But this product makes a good fuel supplement.  I still have to read up on the sexual effects of the MACA (as cited by another user), but I won't dispute his word.  My hair care technician says my hair & scalp are in great condition.  I always get compliments on my skin--I've stop wearing cover-up foundation.  I take one dose in the morning, and it carries me until about 10 p.m., then I sleep like a baby.  The texture is a little gritty, but I also stir after each swallow, and that helps a lot.  I mix mine with 100% cranberry juice or orange juice, and it's very easy to swallow like that for me.  I haven't tried the chocolate, but I've tried the berry--yuck!!  I prefer the lime flavored.  I'm totally satisfied with my results, and intend to continue using this product.  Last note--each of us are different, what works for me may/may not work for the next user.  Each of us have to learn our bodies; then learn what works for us, based on our environment, activities, current health, and health goals.  DRINK UP AND STAY HEALTHY!!!
