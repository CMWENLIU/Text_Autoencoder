I would prefer freshly made brown rice, but that takes a long time to make and isn't easy. This makes it convenient, and takes all the guess work out of making it. I generally have been buying frozen organic brown rice, but that takes up lots of freezer space. The fact that this is easy to store at room temperature is a big plus. I'll be buying more.
