I've always enjoyed couscous, but I never tried the "pearl" version of it until I went to Walt Disney World and ate at an all-u-can eat Moroccan buffet at one of the parks!  It's absolutely delicious!  Most recipes I've seen for Israeli couscous have you adding things like tomatoes or olives, but I bought this pearl couscous from Amazon (Barry Farms) and just cooked it up using some plain chicken broth...amazing!!!  There were no cooking instructions on the back of the bag so be sure to cook it 10-12 minutes using a 1-cup couscous to 2-cup liquid ratio until all the liquid is absorbed.  Or I guess you could try one of the numerous recipes you can find online at various websites ([...], etc.)<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot to mention that my husband was so pleased with the pearl couscous, he asked me to buy a lot more of it off Amazon!  It makes a terrific side dish and it's a nice change from plain veggies or seasoned rice.  Enjoy!
