If you've eaten Peruvian food, you've tasted aji pepper spice- it is the cornerstone spice of Peruvian cooking it.<br /><br />it is more flavorful than spicy.<br /><br />I use it when doing a ground beef fry up, and when making traditional Peruvian empanadas.<br /><br />This spice can be difficult to find, and the quality is very fine.  A good purchase at a decent price.
