Okay, I'm a homeless bumstress and I live in the woods, steal electricity, and have wireless internet.  (Yes really.  Pix linked at my profile).  Since money is not a problem for me (because I only have to pay for food), I like to eat REAL food (as in, real GOOD food), instead of flavorless food-bank and soup-line junk like those other bums. I soon discovered that with an electric fry-pan but no refrigeration, it is actually much harder than you think to make yummy dinner-for-one.  Sweet piquante peppers were a godsend!  They are extremely sweet, but also have vinegar--just like ketchup.  They look like cherry tomatoes.  Somehow, they manage to create these things without cooking them (like deli dill pickles), so they're REAL crunchy.  Their small teeny size makes them excellent snack food.  I just eat them one after another out of the jar, they're THAT good.  They're literally the only food I know which is both savory and sweet at the same time.<br /><br />"Peppadew" is a trademark.  The generic fruit is "sweet piquante peppers", but Peppadew is the only product which includes them because t(according to their site) these things were unknown to science until 14 years ago.  They ONLY grow in one county in South Africa, out in the jungle, and the guy who discovered them is the same guy who sells them as the Peppadew brand.<br /><br />Right off the vine, they're unusually sweet, and mild, and when pickled in sugar and vinegar, they become even sweeter.  You could actually serve them for dessert.  But since they're savory, you can use them to add a unique sweetness to sandwiches and pizza.  I LOVE Italian sausage sandwiches, and I slather them in cooked onions, olives, and peppadew peppers.  These days, Italian sausage sandwiches make up about 50% of my diet. If these peppers make up 10% of each sandwich, then one out of every 20 bites of food I ever eat is this product.  How's THAT for an endorsement!<br /><br />I can't make spaghetti here in my cozy cave, but YOU can, and I urge you to try and then tell how it came out here at Amazon. I'd LOVE to know!  I also put them in cheese fondue, along with white wine and cherry liquor.  WOW!!<br /><br />I always hate to throw away the juice because it tastes the same as the peppers, but I read on their site that other people feel that way too and use it as salad dressing.  Now that's a good idea!<br /><br />The sales of sweet piquante peppers has doubled each year since they started selling them.<br /><br />You know, laying around naked in the woods eating these things with crispy French bread and Tilsit cheese while you unhappy suckers work in quiet desperation at a god-forsaken office full of stupid people, evil people, and liars makes me really, REALLY happy I abandoned so-called "humanity".  There's even office politics in astrophysics.<br /><br />The only downside to Peppadew peppers is that they have no preservatives, so once you open them, they loose their crispness in just a day and become the texture of rotten tomatoes.<br />:-(<br />But that might not happen if you can refrigerate them--or eat the whole jar the same day, which is my solution!<br />:-)<br /><br />They just started selling yellow ones, and I'm ordering them now, which is why I'm here at Amazon.  I can't WAIT to see the probably-subtle difference between the yellow ones and the red!<br /><br />TRY SWEET PIQUANTE PEPPERS!!  Seriously. They're YUMIEEEEE!!<br /><br />-- faye kane homeless brain<br />  Read my blog!
