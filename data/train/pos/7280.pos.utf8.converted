My Frenchie loves it.  She eats almost all of it (we feed her 2x/day) and stops when she's full.  I usually add 1/2 tsp of greek yogurt to her breakfast portion.  Her stool is firm and she's eats and goes on a pretty regular schedule.  It's pretty stinky when she passes gas, but it's not that frequently.  I haven't found a dog food to solve that problem though!  Overall, I'm very happy with this food for now (we've only been on it for a little over a week).  FYI stats: our pup is 12 weeks, eats 1-1.5 cups per day, about 8.5 lbs
