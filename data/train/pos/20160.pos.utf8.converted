I thought I would get these truffles for a Christmas treat, I am so glad I did! They are spectacular! The chocolate is to die for, I couldn't stop eating them. Out of all the candy we had at Christmas time, my 3 boys enjoyed these the most. When their friends come over now I hear them asking for "those truffles. Do you guys have any more?" My kids don't eat a lot of sweets but they have commented several times to me on how good these truffles were. I will certainly buy them again as long as I can find them available to order. In fact, I am going to order a few boxes right now for Valentine's Day as gifts for my sons.
