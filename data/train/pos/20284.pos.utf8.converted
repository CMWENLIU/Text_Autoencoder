This starter is an amazing and well-balanced culture. You can smell the potential in it when it first arrives.  It's supposed to revive by the second day of feeding it, but I found that it almost immediately picked up with bubble action after the initial feeding.  I am going to give this creature a name and invite it into the family.  I'm going to walk it everyday and groom its shiny coat.  I love it!  I'm moderately experienced with sourdough starters and the only starter I've ever used that rivals this starter is one that I was given as part of a baking class years ago from a baker in Boulder, CO -- and that starter had a San Francisco lineage.  Comes with clear instructions.  I would recommend finding the perfect jar for this baby the way you would buy the perfect pet bed for your prize-winning Shi-Tzu.
