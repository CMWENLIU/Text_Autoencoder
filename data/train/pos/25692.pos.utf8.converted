I never chew fruit-flavored gum.  In fact, I'm not a big gum chewer at all.  I think the last time I ever chewed a flavor other than some mint-based thing was Bubblicious when I was ten years old.<br /><br />So I was completely blown away when I tried a piece of my coworker's Trident Tropical Twist gum.  My life will never be the same.  I feel like I've been sleepwalking all these years.<br /><br />It's not just me either.  I took a pack of this gum on a group trip last weekend and everybody who tried it fell in love with it.  They all bought packs of it and introduced it into their office environments.  And these are some of the smartest people I know.<br /><br />Not only is Trident Tropical Twist delicious, it lasts for a good 30 minutes without losing flavor.  Somewhere, some time ago, in some chewing gum lab, the scientists involved with making this gum uncorked a big bottle of champagne and received massive bonus checks.<br /><br />Is there such a thing as gum Nirvana?  Perhaps.  And if there is, it's Trident Tropical Twist.
