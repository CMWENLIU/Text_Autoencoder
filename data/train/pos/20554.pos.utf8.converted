First off, I'd like to explain that I am not a professional, but do try to make fantastic cakes at home and for friends. I have worked as a cake decorator in a small town before, but did not get started in fondant until the last few years, on my own at home.  I started with Wilton (YUCK!), and then found Satin Ice, which is good stuff.  But, I kept reading reviews that raved on Fondarific Buttercream flavored fondant, and how much easier it was to work with, etc.  So, I bit and bought some via the subscription ($10/2 lbs and free shipping??  Awesome!)<br />When it arrived, I immediately checked for an expiration date.  My heart sank. 06312.  That means "63rd day of 2012".  I thought that meant it had expired, but before I went to send it back, I double checked the manufacturer website.  Come to find out, that is the *manufactured* date, and it would expire 1-2 years AFTER that date.  So... my fondant batch was MADE on the 63rd day of 2012.  Fresh!  Awesome!<br />Upon first opening, I actually let out an "OMG".  The smell was divine!  It smelled of vanilla and buttery goodness, like good homemade buttercream icing.  It seemed like a hard ball of fondant inside the packaging, but I was able to break a small piece off.  Upon rolling around in my fingers just a few seconds, it softened beautifully and was very pliable.  No crust fell off, no crumbles.. just smooth.  And surprisingly, not sticky!  I even stuck a fingernail in to see if it would stick under my nails, and it wouldn't.  I keep my nails super short, but it always seems like I get fondant under my fingers when I work with it.  Not with this test.  So, of course.. I had to try some.  And it was as good as it smelled! Sweet buttercream flavor, but not ungodly sweet like most fondants are. And it tastes authentic... not like artificial butter or super strong vanilla. No weird off flavors, either.  And the aftertaste was just butter and vanilla, not "chemicals".  I don't know how to describe it, but some fondants can taste "chemical-y".  This stuff doesn't have any of that.  Usually, I tear off the fondant from cake I eat.  This stuff?  I'd almost definitely eat with the cake, especially if it rolls as thin as the manufacturer says it can.  According to the website, it can take almost 50% less than what the Wilton Fondant chart calls for.  More bang for your buck if that holds true.  The taste was so impressive, I bought some more to try out that others had mentioned was a good flavor (has not arrived yet).<br />I bought this fondant ahead of time for a cake I'm going to make at the end of May, so I have not yet rolled it out and covered a cake yet.  But so far?  I'm impressed.  I plan to update this review once I have covered a cake.  (if you look at my other reviews, you'll find that I have a habit of reviewing and then updating after with what I have learned).<br />Keep in mind this, though:  unlike Satin Ice, Fondarific is meant just for flat decorations. It stays soft, so any 3d stuff you try and make will never harden.  If you need to make 3d fondant figures or flowers, they recommend 1/2 Fondarific to 1/3 gumpaste, which will be what I try.  They also recommend Tylose powder to firm it up, but from what I've read on cake decorating boards, no one has had any luck with this method.  Worst case scenario?  Go all gumpaste, or buy Satin Ice to do 3d figures.  But for what this is, and the price compared to other fondants online (and considering free shipping), this is a good buy.<br />Also, this color "Antique White" really is an off white.  I want to make a "story book" cake, so this is perfect for that color of book pages. It's like it has just the slightest beige tint to it.  If you want something really white, consider their "Wedding white" color.<br />Stay tuned for my update on it's performance in cake coverage and fondant thickness used!
