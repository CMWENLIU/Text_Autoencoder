I signed up for the subscription and received my 4 bottles for only $11.77 with free shipping. With a subscription you can choose to reorder in 1,2,3, or 6 month intervals and cancel at any time. Ordering this way saves 15% plus free shipping. I ordered on the weekend and received my package in 5 days with the box and contents in very good condition.<br /><br />The honey is exactly as described by the company. While it is unfiltered it is strained, which the company does state. So, if you're looking for honey with pieces of honey comb and such this honey is not for you. The important thing is that they heat the honey at a lower temperature which preserves the enzymes (destroyed in supermarket type honey). Side by side comparison to store bought honey there are notable differences. It is darker than store bought honey (the darker the better), the taste is quite different, as well as a more natural texture.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a healthy honey without the pieces of stuff in it I highly recommend this honey!!!!!
