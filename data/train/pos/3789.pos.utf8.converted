I hate artificial sweeteners, and I'm not absolutely crazy about Stevia, which has a very strong, sweet taste (different from sugar) but I really wanted to break my mocha habit and cut back on sweets. Two drops of this in skim milk and coffee makes an excellent substitute for my old heaping teaspoon of sweetened cocoa.<br /><br />I'd like to carry this in my purse to change those impulse Starbucks Mochas into Skinny Lattes, but the bottle says to refrigerate "for freshness" after opening, so I'm not sure how perishable it is.
