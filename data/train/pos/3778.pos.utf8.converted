Dark Muscovado sugar is fabulous !<br /><br />It's important to note that it is absolutely necessary to store it in a sealed plastic or glass container so it doesn't turn into a sugar boulder.<br /><br />Bought this sugar on a whim thinking it MIGHT be good and it certainly looked like something a different than you'd ever find in a supermarket.<br />What a thrill it is. Granted, the packaging is plain, nothing at all fancy about it but what's inside is very fancy with a flavor so divine that it invites you to try it in everything.<br /><br />Here are a few of the things I've used it for since it arrived in my kitchen.<br /><br />Adds an elegant, gourmet flavor when used as a topping on french toast.<br />On hot cereals such as oatmeal, cream of wheat, cream of rice it tastes rich and the steam rising smells so good.<br /><br />And here's a news flash: Mix a rounded teaspoon or two in hot or cold milk for a real treat. Or if you're like me and  into making from scratch hot cocoa, instead of mixing granulated sugar into the cocoa powder mix about 1/2 as much Muscovado sugar for an out of this world cup of hot cocoa. The flavor is deep and heady with an aroma that will knock your socks off.<br /><br />Want to add some pizazz to your beef stew? Add a half teaspoon of Muscovado to it about 1/2 hour before it's finished cooking.<br />It also will add great flavor to chili when you add teaspoon full to it near the end of it's cooking time.<br /><br />Cut up a few apples, an orange and add a 1/2 cup or so of dried cranberries and a handful of crushed walnuts or pecans, sprinkle a rounded teaspoon of Muscovado sugar on top and give it a light toss. Let the mix sit in the fridge for an hour or so and you have a grand fresh dessert OR - and let me tell you this is so good you'll want to do it again....instead of serving that mixture cold (it's winter here), pour it all in a sauce pan and simmer it until the apples are soft. Serve it warm. OMG! it's good.<br />I've also tried the warm mix with a splash of Peach Schnapps and a dollop of whipped cream added right before serving and the flavor blew me away. All of our dinner guests have given it rave reviews.<br /><br />The next thing I'm going to try it in is whipped cream - I'll come back and let you know how that goes.
