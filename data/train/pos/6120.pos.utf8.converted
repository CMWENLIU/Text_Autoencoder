I've done a lot of research and I've tried a lot of products.  This is it.  I have a friend that owns a movie theater and he told me this is what is used.  There are slight variations in theaters across the nation but this is the product used.  He said they do not use real butter because it melts down the popcorn when it is hot.  Real butter also tastes funny, yes, it's true.  He said the theater tried it for a month and customers would come back complaining that the butter tasted funny and get a refund.  The topping is the way to go.<br /><br />Trade secret number #2:  Flavorcol.  You won't get that salty seasoned flavor from this topping alone.  Nor from a combination of this topping and salt.  Flavorcol is a salt seasoning that is put in the mix while popping.  Get it use it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there's a 3rd secret too: Use red coconut oil.  It's similar to what McDonald's uses.  Pay attention to how similar the smell of the nuggets frying and popcorn is.  That smell in the movie theater is actually the coconut oil frying.<br /><br />Never said it was healthy.
