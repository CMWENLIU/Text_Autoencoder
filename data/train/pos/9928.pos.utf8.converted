I am VERY happy with these chews and that's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide. My Great Dane normally devours most rawhide treats in 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me.<br />These PetAg chews are truly CHUNKY - they are very large, made with super thick rawhide, and designed in a way to prolong chewing pleasure. The knots make it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries them all over the house, plays with them by throwing them in the air (which is very loud, these are HEAVY), and then settles down for some chew time -- they keep him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap. In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! We also purchased one of the beef basted braids (and will be posting a review with pics there) -- the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it also does not come off on his legs, which are white, or my carpet, which is beige --- WONDERFUL!<br />I feel it is important to note also that these chews are MADE IN THE USA (Illinois to be exact). Yes they do say "a product of Brazil" on the outside of the package but they are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company). These are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow.<br /><br />They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews we already have -- I will happily purchase more!
