I have tried EVERY kind of Wasabi additive to highten the taste of the Mustard I serve in my restaurant (Waba Grill in Yucaipa).  This is the ONLY stuff that works.  I have tried 5 different kinds of "powdered" Wasabi, AND THEY SUCK).  I squeeze 6 bottles of this stuff into a gallon of regular mustard, and serve it, and my customers just love it.  I can buy it on E-Bay by the tube, but first it comes from Japan, and second, it takes 2 weeks to arrive, and third, it is too damn expensive.  This stuff from (Roland) is cheaper, and I get it in 3 days or so.  Love it alot!!  Keep it in stock for me...........Thanks<br /><br />[...]
