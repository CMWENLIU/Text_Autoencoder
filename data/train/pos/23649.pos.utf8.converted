Being an afficionado of Oriental cuisines, I can say I've tried many different sauces claiming to be "Hoisin Sauce" and that the Koon Chun brand is without a doubt the best I have ever eaten.  Whether used for moo shu dishes, a marinade for ribs, chicken or spread onto a Peking Duck pancake, its thick, rich flavor is surpassing.  Used sparingly, a little goes a very long way, and puts many of the thinner, sometimes watery, imitators to shame. Even given the seemingly high shipping price I recommend trying this out and think you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was the first time I spied it on the shelf of a local oriental supermarket and decided to try it out.  Since I no longer live within comfortable distance of an oriental market, I now order this through Amazon every few months and always try to keep a supply on hand.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I always have.
