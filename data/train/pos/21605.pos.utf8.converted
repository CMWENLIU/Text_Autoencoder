This is the most addictive stuff I have ever eaten in my whole, entire, very long life.  I can't keep my spoon out of the jar.  The butter itself is just sweet enough, just mellow enough, just velvety enough, and the finely chopped pecans make it ecstatic.  Please do yourself a favor and buy it.  Buy lots of it.
