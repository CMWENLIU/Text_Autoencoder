This is wonderful salt!! It is filled with more minerals than any other salt on the market. The taste is quite strong, so less salt is needed in cooking.  If you use a salt grinder for this, remember that this is a wet salt, and it  may get a bit stuck or clogged up in many salt grinders. I recommend getting one that is good with wet salts. :)
