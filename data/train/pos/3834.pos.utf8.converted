I was a little concerned about buying these in bulk after reading some of the previous reviews.  My concerns were unfounded, I was delighted with the product.  There was no musty taste in any of my bags, (I bought 4 1# packages).  They taste exactly the same as what I buy in the smaller snack packages from the grocery store.  This is a great product, sweet and crunchy, and WAY less expensive to purchase this way.
