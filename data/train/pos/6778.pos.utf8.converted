So excited that there is an easily accessible product that is good and GF!  Now it will be easy for those that want to bake for GF friends/family.  Here are the ingredients for those that are interested:<br /><br />Rice Flour, Sugar, Potato Starch, Leavening (baking soda, sodium acid pyrophosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Xanthan Gum, Salt.  May contain soy ingredients.<br />It calls for water, 1 stick of butter, 2 t of vanilla and 3 eggs.<br /><br />Hope that helps!
