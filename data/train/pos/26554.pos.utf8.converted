These Jordan almonds arrived quickly.  When I opened the package, I was surprised the almonds were packed only in bubble wrap.  I expected them to be somewhat crushed, but the packers must know what they are doing, because every piece was perfect!  There is a difference of quality in Jordan almonds, but these are fresh, good sized, and top-notch quality.
