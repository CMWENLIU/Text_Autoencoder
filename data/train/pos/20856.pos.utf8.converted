I am a very health concious mom and these are one of the few "cookies" that I allow my toddler to eat on a regular basis.  I can feel good that there is nutritional value in what my VERY picky 3 yr. old begs for.  You have to try them to believe that healthy can and is good when it is made by Barbara's Bakery!
