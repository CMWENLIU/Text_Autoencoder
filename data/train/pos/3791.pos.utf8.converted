My chiropractor recommended Stevia as an alternative to the artificial sweeteners I had been using.  I had been having chronic migraines, which he deduced were a result of my use of Aspartame.  Initially I was skeptical, but decided to give it a shot anyway.  I am happy to say that since I now use Stevia instead of any artificial sweeteners, I'm headache free!  Stevia comes in lots of flavors, even rootbeer, which I've used in sparkling water in place of diet soda - it's delicious and no headaches!  What could be better ...highly recommend! (PS this is the best price I've found anywhere ...)
