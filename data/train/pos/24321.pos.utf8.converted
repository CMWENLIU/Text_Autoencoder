My dogs just aren't into the plastic bones and other chew toys - but they love the cow hooves!  This pack of 10 contains hooves that are thicker than I have seen other places, which is important because they are less prone to splitting and chipping.  You do have to watch your dog when they are chewing, in case a piece breaks off, but this is the only product that I have found that my dogs love.  I have two labs, one is an agressive chewer, and if we have the hooves around I don't worry about her chewing something she shouldn't (my shoes!).  I do have to warn you that the smell isn't great when they chew it for a while, but its worth it for them to be happy.  I would absolutely reccommend this product to anyone with a dog!
