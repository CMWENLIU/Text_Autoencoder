Steeping the cocoa bean shells into a fragrant and delicious tisane is such a stroke of genius. The pure chocolate flavor and aroma is outstanding. For those who say it is watery, thin, bitter etc...This is not Swiss Miss Sweetened Hot Cocoa. If you appreciate a natural chocolate flavor extracted from the cocoa shells thus also rendering all the known health benefits of chocolate, without the sugar and preservatives then this is a must try. Sure you can add milk and sweetener if you desire but please, do try it plain first. It needs nothing. I also left the shells in my mug and let them settle at the bottom with no negagtive effect on the flavor. It is impossible to oversteep this. The flavor only becomes more intense and stays smooth. Also a big Thank You to Bill at Tisano who was super helpful & friendly in our email exchange.
