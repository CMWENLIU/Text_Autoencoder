If you're one of those folks who craves chocolate bars with some protein as a snack or dessert or on-the-go emergency mini-meal, and you need no gluten, and you want it to taste nice, and you don't want a lot of sugars, and you do not mind soy (this has both soy and whey isolates), this is a nice option.<br /><br />I can't have a lot of soy. But sometimes, ah, well, I will give in--for some grilled tofu or some tofu red curry or nice miso soup. Well, the other day, I was at Whole Foods, looking for gluten free bar options for my purse (emergency snack ration options), and decided to give it a go, despite the soy. And whoa, liking it.<br /><br />If you just care about taste--this tastes good.<br /><br />If you're a crunch fiend--let's say that you like chocolate crunch candies or bars--this fits the bill.<br /><br />I have used Larabars, Quest bars, Kind bars, and Paleobars, and now I can add this to the arsenal of "What can I dump in my purse when I'm out on a day of errands to stem temptations for utter crap when I'm hungry."<br /><br />Wish it was just whey in there, but at least the soy is non-GMO. :D<br /><br />Vegan, gluten-free, kosher, dairy-free, low sugar, moderate-carb, high fiber, with protein and real dark chocolate.... and tasty. That's pretty durn good for a processed, convenience food.<br /><br />Here are the stats:<br /><br />Calories  180<br />  Calories from fat  55<br />Total Fat 6g  9%<br />  Saturated Fat 2.5g  13%<br />  Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg  0%<br />Sodium 135mg  6%<br />Total Carbohydrate 21g  7%<br />  Dietary Fiber 9g  36%<br />  Sugar 2g<br />Protein 15g<br /><br />Vitamin A 0%, Vitamin C 0%, Calcium 6%, Iron 8%<br /><br />Hope that helps. Be well..
