I LOVE hibiscus tea and was a loyal customer to another brand that I frequently purchased on Amazon.  They changed the formula so I had to go on the hunt for another brand.<br /><br />I couldn't find a replacement tea with good reviews until I found this one.  It is expensive to me though - About $1 per tea bag.  I bought it anyway because I had my heart set on hibiscus tea for a summer dinner party I was throwing.  I'm so glad I did! It is REALLY delicious!<br /><br />This tea looks so beautiful in a clear glass pitcher with fresh oranges, sliced in wheels, floating in it. I also serve it over ice in water goblets with an orange or lemon wheel as it's garnish. It kind of looks like wine or a mixed drink, so it is a nice non-alcoholic option to have on hand.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of friends say they don't know how to make hibiscus tea taste like the tropical libation they've had in other places.  Below is my recipe for Hibiscus tea by the pitcher in case it is helpful for others.<br /><br />Hibiscus Tea by the Pitcher<br /><br />48 ounces water<br />8 - 10 hibiscus tea bags (I use 10)<br />2 whole cinnamon sticks<br />1/8 cup sugar (or 6-8 packs of stevia)<br />1 small orange, sliced in wheels (or 2 clementines)<br />ice<br />1 lemon, cut into wheels<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Bring water to light boil, turn off heat add the hibiscus flower tea bags and cinnamon sticks. Cover and steep for 20 minutes.<br /><br />Strain tea into desired container, add sugar and orange slices.<br /><br />Serve tea in a nice glass over ice.<br /><br />Garnish each glass with a lemon wheel.<br /><br />This tea recipe can easily be doubled for a larger serving. When using hibiscus flowers in tea making, longer is not better. Heating the hibiscus for an extended time can release unfavorable qualities and bitterness. The key is to add MORE hibiscus to strengthen the flavor.
