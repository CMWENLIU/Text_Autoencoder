I am always looking for healthy treats for my Wheaten and the fewer ingredients the better. I thought I found the best product when I found Waggin Train Chicken Jerky at Costco. Then I read the reviews on Amazon and, well, it scared the crap out of me. So now, I look for healthy treats with few ingredients, that are made in the US. I feel comfortable giving my dog these treats because I know the ingredients used are regulated. My dog LOVES these and so do I.
