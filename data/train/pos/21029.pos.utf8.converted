I bought these in NYC during the great blizzard of 12/26/10, to take with me on Amtrak, as my flight home was canceled.  I shared them with my seat mates, and we all thought they were delicious.  Different from regular Nature Valley granola bars, sort of a cross between a granola bar and a candy bar.  As I was packing up to get off the train (after a 9 hour trip!) I still had one pack of 2 bars left, and heard a woman with a french accent ask the snack bar operator if he had any chocolate left.  He said "no", and I handed her my last pack, told her it was as good as a chocolate bar, and left feeling good about sharing something so delicious.
