I ordered this assortment for my brother's triplets who are five.  We all had a blast remembering the candy from our childhood, including the candy from my mother's era!  It was great fun watching them experience pop rocks for the first time and reminiscing on our "first time."  I am ordering for all my friends for Christmas.  It comes in a neat gift box!
