I'm allergic to milk, eggs, yeast and all grains (except rye), and this is SOOOO much better than trying to mix all the other non-wheat flours together to get the right combination. Even better, I used it to make dumplings and I couldn't tell the difference from my White Lily flour dumplings! My husband said they were "almost" better than my regular dumplings!  This flour is a God-send for me, the best of the wheat-free flours.  One less tear I have to shed for all the things I can't eat!!
