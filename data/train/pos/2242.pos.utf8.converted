At the time of my original comment, the product description did not appear to match the item that I received, in that it was advertised as 100% Wasabi, but the product I received appeared to have horseradish and mustard in it. So it seems that there may have been a mixup between the product and description, which may have been entirely unintentional and an accident. The product itself and description apparently have changed, apparently all for the better. So, I am changing my rating to a 5 star. I have to wonder if the color of the iodine-starch reaction produced is not merely based on 1) the amount of starch, but also 2) the ratio of iodine concentration to starch concentration to insure there is enough of each reagent to react, 3) the temperature, 4) the type of solvent, and 5) the type of iodine used. I did my test with a special low concentration organic iodine, Iodine Trichloride. That said, I'm glad that the seller has sorted this out and is now selling a product that matches its Amazon description. I hope everyone trys this product now, because it looks like a great deal for dried 100% Wasabi powder. Enjoy!
