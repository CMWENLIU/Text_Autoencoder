We originally bought this brand due to the claim that it uses "All Natural Cage Free Chickens" as well as the "No Hormones" and "No Antibiotics," etc.  But the items were surprisingly better in quality than the package claimed.  These strips are real strips of dried chicken, not just processed "meats" as some companies may use.  This particular flavor became our household favorite due to the effect it has on our easliy excited black lab, Hayden.<br /><br />At first I thought the ingredients were just light flavoring, since all of the packages seem to contain the exact same looking treats.  But, the smell is very strong.  This flavor contains chamomile and lavender - which claims to calm your dog.  This claim is very true for our dog.  Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don't believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can't be predicted for really young dogs or "unfixed" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to "battle through" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.  This product contains taurine - like Redbull - so maybe that's the reason.  I'd recommend that Happy Heart flavored treats should be avoided late in the evening.
