A friend who has recovered from a stroke and prostate cancer is trying to eat really healthy food.  He told us about Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Rolled Whole Grain Hot Cereal, Plus Flaxseed. We found some in a local store -- 16 ounces for $2.09!<br /><br />Following the directions on the package, I cooked a batch of it tonight. What a delicious and filling meal!  The package instructions recommend serving it with milk and honey.  It also tastes good with other things, such as cinnamon, brown sugar, raisins, toasted almonds, and bananas.  It tastes good plain, and it does not require large amounts of butter or sugar to taste good.<br /><br />The ingredients are whole grain oats, wheat, rye, barley, triticale, and flaxseed.  quoted from the side of the bag:  Scientific evidence suggests that eating whole grains reduces the risks of some cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers.  Antioxidants contained in whole grains may work with fiber and other compounds to reduce your overall  risk of heart disease.<br /><br />A few more bits of information:  There's a neat cookie recipe on the package.  Since it is all natural, it keeps best in the refrigerator or the freezer. A serving made from 1/3 cup dry cereal has 120 calories and 5 grams fiber.<br /><br />We're glad our friend told us about this cereal, and we highly recommend it.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.
