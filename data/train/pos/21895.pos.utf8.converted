this product came fast and was sealed, a lot of people dont mention if a product comes sealed or not but you need to know with coconut oil because if you live in a hot state it will be in liquid form and you dont want it spilling all over the place ok now on to the product when i first opened it, it smelled so good and it does kinda smell like roasted nuts but the smell is not too strong to turn you off and then i tasted it but it had no taste and i havent cooked with it because im using it for my body. after i shaved it put some on and it made my skin smooth and mosty importantly it wasnt greasy you just dont know how much i hate greasy oils that sit on top of your skin and do nothing oh and i put this on my hiarline and it made it feel soooo soft, i know in my previous reviews i've said that im giving up on oils but i was just using the wrong ones the whole time and now i've found an oil that gonna be sticking around<br /><br />ps. when it arrived it was in soild form so i just put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and it didnt turn into complete liquid but wasnt soild i think its easier to use this way because when you rub it in your hands it turns to liquid anyway<br /><br />pss. i hate the fact that this organic coconut oil came in a plastic jar it would have been nice if it came in a glass jar
