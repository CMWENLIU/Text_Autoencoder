Great rice - smells like popcorn, great with all kinds of beans.  Authentic all the way.  Great to buy in bulk.  Can't go wrong.  The rice is IN a plastic bag INSIDE the burlap bag - so it IS clean rice...they should tell you that...I think the burlap bag is cool, but I think people will think bugs could get into the rice...they can't it in a plastic bag inside.  Easy to cook - tastes good.
