I switched to this drink as this is one of the few no sugar drinks that doesn't contain aspartame.  Splenda is the primary sweetener for this.  For me it's got the right blend of flavor, sweetness and caffeine.  Being in packets it's easy to carry with you and compared to the cost of pre-mixed energy drinks (monster, amp, etc) it's a great value*.  I love all three flavors, citrus is what you'd expect tastes similar to original Gatorade.  I was most surprised by the orange flavor, I'm not a big fan of orange flavored drinks, but this one is really good.  Berry however remains my favorite, but I enjoy the others just as much.<br /><br />*Please note, it looks like this isn't sold by Amazon LLC anymore and the new seller's price is way more.  I was paying anywhere between $14 and $18 for a 3 pack.  It's now cheaper to get this from the manufacture's website.
