I love this little tree.  My husband got it for his birthday about 3 years ago, and it's traveled with us from Boston to California.  We do NOT have green thumbs, and the tree has had to struggle back from drought and drastic climate change and overpruning and inexpert attempts at wiring, and there were times I confess I thought I'd killed it for good, but each time it's magically brought back all its leaves and continued being one of the most beautiful green things I own.  The shape is lovely, and I remember it arrived packaged incredibly well.
