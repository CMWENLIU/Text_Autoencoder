Since I was a kid I always loved eating this candy. But when I moved to a city that didn't sell these, I was devastated. Just a few days ago I recently came across one of these from a friend and have fallen in love with them all over again. I decided to look online for this candy and voila! I can't get enough of them! My all-time absolute favorite Mexican candy, and even possibly my favorite candy period!
