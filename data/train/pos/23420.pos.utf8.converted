...I've never written a product review before, but this is such amazingly good coffee I just had to say so. From the first sip I knew this was coffee like I had never tasted before. And in Seattle - where coffee falls from the sky like so much rain - that's saying something.  I had planned to serve this as the perfect cap for a recent dinner party with friends, but it didn't last in my house long enough to make the dinner.  So I'm back for more.<p>Now I'm wondering if the folks at Hawaii Roasters have any openings.  I work cheap...you can pay me in these wonderful, rich coffee beans!
