THESE ROLLS WERE GREAT.  THE LOBSTER MEAT WAS FLAVORFUL WITH ONLY A SMALL AMOUT OF MAYO TO HOLD IT TOGETHER.  HOWEVER, IT WAS THE BUN THAT MADE THE SANDWICH.  IT WAS A PERFECT SIZE AND DID NOT INTERFER WITH THE GREAT TASTE OF THE LOBSTER.  IT MADE A MIDWESTERNER FEEL LIKE HE WAS BACK IN ARCADIA.  I WILL BUY MORE.
