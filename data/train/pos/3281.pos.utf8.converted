It cracks me up reading some of the reviewers that compare this to regular pasta. Being calorie free OF COURSE there is going to be some trade off on taste. My advice to those people is to stick to the real thing. For the rest of us this is a great option to help you feel full and offset a major amount of calories. Yes, there is some texture to them, but, considering the health benefits it is well worth it. A good option is to actually mix some into regular pasta to offset some of the calories. It is a good trick to help "trick" your mind while eating healthy. For me, a 50-50 ratio usually works. Add in even more to help feel fuller without any additional calories. Personally, for me, it doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No calories<br />Helps you feel full<br />Fiber<br />Healthy<br />"Almost" the consistency of real pasta<br /><br />Cons:<br />You need to wash the noodles in water for 30-60 seconds to dissipate the "open bag" smell<br />No taste (but it absorbs the flavor of your food)<br />Not the "real thing"
