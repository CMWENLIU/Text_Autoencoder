My two year old son is severely allergic to mosquito bites. Within minutes the bites open like a soar and begin to oozz. They last for days and usually leave scars so we need something to keep the msquitos away and these cutter wipes have been great. We live in a hot humid climate so we have mosqitos almost year around. Every time we apply the wipes he has stayed bite free. We love the wipes because we don't have to spray anything that could possibly get in his eyes. I can't say enough about these wipes!!!
