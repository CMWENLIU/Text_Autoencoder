At first I was a little taken aback by the price of this item (more in my grocery store), but once I bought it I was definitely pleased. I always found myself throwing the majority of those little cans of tomato paste away, because I never used more than a little bit at once. With this product you can squeeze out what you need, put the cap back on and save the rest for next time (and next time, and next time!). A great way to always have what you need on hand, and eliminate wasting food.
