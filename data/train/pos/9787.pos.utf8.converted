Ordered this with some trepidation, as the only other powdered whole milk we've tried was pretty bad, sort of rancid smelling, and ruined two batches of yogurt to which it had been added. (The second time I used less, but it really didn't help,) The Peak, however, is wonderful. Smells a bit like ice cream in the can, and thickens the yogurt perfectly. No off-taste. I'm a happy camper. May even try making yogurt with this milk alone.
