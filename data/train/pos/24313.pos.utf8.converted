I have to maintain a gluten free diet and am always looking for alternative flours to use in my baked goods.  I ordered the Chestnut Flour to use in cookies and breads along with the other special flours I have to use.  I use just a small amount of the Chestnut Flour in the recipes and it really gives you a nice nutty flavor.
