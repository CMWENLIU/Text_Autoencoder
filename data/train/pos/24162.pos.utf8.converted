This water is really wonderful.  I enjoy drinking it and have noticed many positive effects.  Most quantifiable though is the impact this water has on our herb garden which is producing delicious, fragrant, beautiful herbs on our deck.  We enjoy drinking the water and then refill the bottles with tap water - this is what we give to the plants - and they are thriving! So a little indeed goes a long way.
