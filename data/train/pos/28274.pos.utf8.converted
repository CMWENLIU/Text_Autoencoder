but don't have 40+ minutes to wait for it. It is also for people that want to get the health benefits of brown rice, and don't like the overpowering taste. The cooking time is only 20 minutes.<br /><br />I have no problem buying a case of this as it isn't on my store shelves. In fact, this is my second case.<br /><br />My husband, who doesn't like brown rice, eats this and asks for seconds, When I first told him it was brown rice, he said "This stuff is good- I don't care."<br /><br />This company knows rice- thanks for a great quality product.
