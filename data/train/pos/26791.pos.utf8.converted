Who the hell wants to buy pickle or nacho cheese flavored seeds? Yet, for some reason, they are sitting next to every cash register in America. Meanwhile, this is the greatest flavor to ever exist, and you have to scour the internet to find them.  The taste of these things is simply irresistible. There are no other seeds or flavors I have tried that will ever compare. And for those who say that Reds or other brands are better tasting, they must have some seriously screwy taste buds, because I have tried them all, and these blow them out of the water. Can't wait to get my 12 pack in the mail.
