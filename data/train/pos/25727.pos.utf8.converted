Listen to me!  I've got nothing to gain by writing this, but I need to tell you to give this chocolate milk powder a try.  I lived in Spain for a year and had been craving this for 5 years until I stumbled upon it here at Amazon.  This stuff is amazing.  It's very rich and real cocoa.  Almost tastes like you melted a chocolate bar in hot milk.  Great cold, but hot is where it really shines.  Give it a try, you won't regret it. Just think how cool you'll sound when you have friends over who try it and say, "Man, what kind of hot chocolate is that?  Where'd you get it?"<br /><br />That's when you look them straight in the face and say, "oh, that stuff, just a little something I picked up in Madrid last week."<br /><br />You 1, Friends 0
