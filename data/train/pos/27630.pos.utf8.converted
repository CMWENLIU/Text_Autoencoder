This is one of those crazy testimonial stories.<br /><br />I suffered a bad case of bronchitis about two years ago, it lasted for three months and my doctor was a little baffled because the antibiotic treatment and vaporizer weren't helping much.  I picked up a box of this tea on a whim, desperate to try anything that might help.  I drank the max dosage per day, and within a week, my symptoms began to fade.  I believe this tea helped boost my immune system to fight off whatever was attacking my lungs.  In one month, I was able to stop drinking the tea all together and breathe with ease, my doctor was surprised. What has shocked me even more is that I've not had a recurrence of lung infection or bronchitis (which I am prone to getting even after the most minor colds,) since taking this product at first sign of a cough.<br /><br />The taste isn't entirely pleasant, but can be helped along with a helping of honey, I prefer blueberry honey and a little bit of milk added to my tea.
