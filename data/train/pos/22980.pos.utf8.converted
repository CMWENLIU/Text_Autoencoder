I love this product but the vegetable pieces are a little too big for my dogs to digest.<br /><br />Every time I get a new bag of Sojos Grain Free (previously "Europa") I grind up the whole bag using my spice grinder.  This makes it easier for them to digest and I don't have pieces of bright orange carrot in their poo anymore.<br /><br />When I grind it up like this it also hydrates much more quickly, which is important. If it's not properly hydrated, the dog can get constipated.<br /><br />I always feed this with raw meats such as chicken, beef, or lamb.  I sometimes add it to cooked fish or scrambled eggs, but I don't do this more than once a week.  Also, I add a little bit of organ meat a few times a week.  You should use organic liver because this is where the toxins build up.<br /><br />To make it less expensive, I get chicken necks and trim meat.<br /><br />I hope this helps!
