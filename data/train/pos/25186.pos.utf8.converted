I purchased these for my children, to pack a sweet yet relatively healthful snack in their lunch sacks.  I am giving 5 stars by the recommendation of myself & three sons (age 7, 5 & 3).  When I tasted these, my first thought was that they were going to be gone FAST.  My children and I love these little cookies ... Crunchy little gems without all the trans-fats & preservatives, that I try to keep out of my children's diets as much as I can.  These will definitely remain on my grocery list.
