When my block arrived, I was excited to try it out immediately. First thing I did was serve sushi on it. Stellar reception. The salt delicately rubbed off onto the rice, and gave a fantastic flavour. Then I tried green mango. Even better! Smoked aubergine. Lovely. Omusubi? Divine.<br /><br />Mind you, the brick isn't huge huge, so you're only going to get two rolls (long rolls of sushi) on there after slicing it up, but what a presentation it makes! I'm quite excited to continue discovering ways to use my salt block. When I'm not using it to serve, I set it in a sunny spot, so that the light can shine through it and show off the pretty marbling.
