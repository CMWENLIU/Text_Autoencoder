I picked these up at the local health food store.  They cost about $3.59 there.  The taste is amazing. I am the mom of a child with Celiac's Disease. I eat both gluten and gluten free products.  The taste is actually a bit better than regular pretzels and does not have the after taste that some of the other Gluten Free pretzels on the market have.  I highly recommend this product.
