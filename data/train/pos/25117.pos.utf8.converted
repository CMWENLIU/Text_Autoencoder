This particular malt powder is wonderful.  If you like malted milk drinks, or just like the flavor of malt, this is for you.  Malt is mainly a blend of more complex sugars and doesn't generally cause blood-sugar spikes for diabetics.  While it tastes quite sweet, 1.5 tablespoons of this powder has only 15 calories and 3 gm of sugars.  This particular powder is super-fine and dissolves easily in even cold liquids.  Highly recommended.
