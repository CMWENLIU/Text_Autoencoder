I hadn't tried Numi teas prior to this, but I will definitely be purchasing this particular tea in the future.<br /><br />I'm a bit of a tea junkie, and use a dedicated Zarafina tea brewer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJNJNO">Zarafina Tea Maker Suite with Ceramic Tea Pots, Cups, and Serving Tray</a>) for making both loose-leaf and bagged teas, as I find I get a more consistent cup of tea this way - this may or may not be the issue some of the other reviewers were running into with their cups.<br /><br />I've found this tea to be a very pleasant surprise.  I don't typically like "flavored" teas, such as blueberry or strawberry, but this tea caught me off guard.  After pouring the tea, I noticed a very pleasant chocolate scent coming from the cup.  While most flavored teas have a stronger odor and weak taste, the chocolate and vanilla taste in this tea is definitely pronounced without being overbearing or cloying, and really didn't need sweetening.  If you do decide to sweeten it, I would recommend something simple, such as raw sugar or a half packet of Splenda.  Anything more aggressive would probably ruin the taste of this tea; definitely don't use a creamer.<br /><br />The chocolate and vanilla flavor is pretty complex, especially for a bagged tea.  I found it a very pleasant change from my standard English breakfast and white teas.  It's a black tea, but not as aggressive as most black teas are.  My wife is a die-hard coffee drinker, but even she got hooked on this one, and it's become a habit to have a cup of this after dinner.<br /><br />It *would* be nice to have a loose-leaf variety of this tea for the tea elitists like myself, but it's not a dealbreaker for me.  I'm a big fan of this one, and it has me considering other bagged teas for the future.
