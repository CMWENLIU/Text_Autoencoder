I am a first time sausage maker and I bought these casings.  They worked great.  They were easy to clean.  There were nine casings lengths in a package.  They were roughly the same length.  The bag said it would make 25 lbs of sausages and we made 25 lbs with no left over meat or casings even though we were not very consistent with our thicknesses.<br /><br />We followed the directions and soaked them for 30 minutes and rinsed them twice.  The casings were flexible but strong.  We ripped the casings only three times when stuffing, but each time I wasn't paying attention at the time.  Like I said first time sausage maker.  The casings smoked and bloomed nicely.  They worked great and were the cheapest I could find.  I would use them again and I am trying to find a local supplier.
