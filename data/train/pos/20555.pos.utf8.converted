This is, by far, the best tasting fondant I've used. It has a really great, almost real, buttercream icing flavor.<br /><br />It's also can roll out pretty thinly without cracking. It also stays pretty malleable after covering the cake, which is especially great if your embossing or impressing details on the cake. I mostly use Satin Ice, which is also great, but can start to crack a little when you're covering the cake or pressing in details. I wish the Fondarific was a little less expensive, but I understand why it costs more. This fondant is great-tasting and easy-to-use, a great product.
