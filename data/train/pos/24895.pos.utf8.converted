We've enjoyed Eight O'Clock French Roast Whole Bean coffee daily for about ten years.  We love its bold taste and aroma, and, although we're not coffee connoisseurs, we've tried many different coffees and have not found any we like more at any price.  The only dilemma was when we moved we were unable to purchase the 36 oz. bag in our new location.  No store carries it in the 36 oz. size, only the smaller 12 oz. bag which was inconvenient since it would only last about a week, and was costly.  I had located on-line vendors, but they charged a premium price to what we were used to paying before we moved, and added shipping on top of that.  When traveling on business I used to buy a 3 to 4 month supply at a time to keep us in coffee.  Then I learned of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and found it at a lower price than we've ever payed, and shipping is free.  So far we've received three shipments, two regularly scheduled monthly orders and one extra shipment that I ordered because we were going to run out before our regular order shipped.  Amazon even emails me to let me know when my regular order will arrive and allows me to delay a shipment or place an order early if running low. We couldn't be happier with the coffee or with Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.
