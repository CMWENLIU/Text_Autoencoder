Given the lack of response to some key criticisms, though relatively few, of this food, I'll focus my review on why this nutritional powerhouse is classified as a SUPERfood and why, for what are obvious reasons, some folks do not like this awesome Organic Raw Maca. Maca is surely classified as a superfood, and why that is the case pertains to its exceptional potency. General speaking, the "better" a superfood tastes, the lower (that's right, the lower) the nutritional density. And why would this be the case? Well, simply because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as Maca, chlorella, spirulina, broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas, processed fruit juices, etc.<br />Fortunately, since it's abundantly obvious to me that not everything that's good for me is going to taste like a Ritter Sport chocolate bar, I've been able to get past the subjective definitions or pronouncements on Maca's taste or flavor -- and most reviews by far out there, by the way, indicate a much more neutral, even positive assessment of Maca's taste. I for one, like so many Americans, want really good and sustainable energy, not the kind that comes at any kind of unnatural price, e.g., sudden crashes, nervousness, the jitters, stomach aches, headaches, cramps, etc. Fortunately through Maca, I've found significantly increased energy, overall alertness, focus, and enhanced powers of concentration....not to mention the physical energy for my lengthy & strenuous workouts. Though I jus' luvs me my coffee, there are numerous ways of getting that energy without the price of the smaller dives, total crashes and inevitable burn-outs.<br />If this entirely natural, special Maca-kind-of-boost is not important to you, then you don't need to try it.<br /><br />Having communicated all this, careful readers of all of the reviews here will probably be able to see why some do not like Organic Raw Maca Powder, often linked to questions about taste, culinary expectations, etc. To note, it's difficult for me to place much weight on reviews by those who have tried out a food (and I view Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, not as a product, but as an exceptional nutritional food) for only a few days (only 3!, in some instances) or a few weeks. Generally speaking, the better a superfood tastes, the lower the nutritional density, and this is because the most nutritionally dense superfoods -- such as wheat grass, spinach, barley grass, chlorella, spirulina, green tea (extract), broccoli sprouts, etc. -- often have very strong tastes that seem unusual to people used to drinking sugary beverages like sodas or processed fruit juices.
