Before ordering this product I compared the reviews between this product and the dozens of similar products containing the Ghost Pepper.  Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked.  At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain.  Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price.  So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I received my bottle in only two days using Amazon Prime.  It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging.  After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room.  The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time.  Our mouths watered immediately.  Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away.  The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste.  My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage.  My money did not go to waste.<br /><br />At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken.  I only wanted to pour a little on.  I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle.  I was wrong.  A big glob covered my meal.  My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken.  But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife.  I did not want to waste it.  So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing.  What a dumb thing to do.  The next half hour was torture.  My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not.  I drank all of my soda fast.  I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough.  I was in bad shape.  I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies.  Dave...You got me.<br /><br />On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning.  Use a drop at a time.  Bah! Stupid me.  Well...you know what they say.  Good stories usually start out with a bad decision.<br /><br />This product should come with a dropper.  It is definitely a favorite in my book.  I will buy it again but with more respect for the sauce.
