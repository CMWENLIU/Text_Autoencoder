I made this a couple times as is out of the box with great results.<br /><br />I live with my brother, who shares my love of heated foods; he suggested adding a little heat to this mix. What a great idea it turned out to be.<br /><br />My first try was some dried, ground chili peppers (I dry my own in a dehydrator); not bad.<br /><br />Next, I tried some fresh, finely chopped jalapenos. Wow, what a great loaf!<br /><br />Here's the thing; if using dried peppers, put them in at the beginning. If using the fresh peppers, put them in at the time for add-ins (according to the instructions for your machine).<br /><br />Enjoy...
