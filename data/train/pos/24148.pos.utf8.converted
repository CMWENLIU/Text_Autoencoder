For the past few months I've had a sore on my face that would not heal. I had it biopsied a few weeks ago and the doctor told me it was Basil Cell Carcinoma and would need to be surgically removed. I've been applying Trivedi Water for the past week and a half to with amazing results: the sore is drying up and healing. I have faith that it will heal completely using the water.<br /><br />Also, I tend to get headaches when I drink a lot of water. With Trivedi water I can drink as much as I like and it's very hydrating and nourishing to me.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
