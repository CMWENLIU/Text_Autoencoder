Butter flavored popcorn salt is an important part of the popping process!<br /><br />I find the product works best when added to the kernels before popping; rather than trying to add it to popped corn. I use 1/4 tsp. for every 1/4 cup of kernels. With the oil already starting to heat in the kettle (just long enough to liquify it), I spread the kernel/salt mix evenly over the oil.<br /><br />When I ordered this, I thought it was a small bottle. Note that it's actually a liter bottle, which is pretty big when you see it. However, that just makes the value even better.<br /><br />It isn't the same exact flavor that is used at my theater. However, it is very similar and still very good.
