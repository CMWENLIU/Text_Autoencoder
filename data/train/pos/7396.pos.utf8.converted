My two kitters love Fancy Feast cat food and because most of its varieties can be had on Prime, that is about all they get to eat. When they were lowly kittens who had just arrived from a rescue facility, Any Kind of food was Good Food. They were just thankful to eat. Kibble would have been OK with them forever had they known no better. But one kitty is a male and I know males tend to have problems with their urinary tracts especially if they do not get enough fluids, so I made the fateful decision to include "wet food" in their diets for the sake of the male. Fancy Feast was one of the few vendors who makes kitten food and so that is what they got and how this tale got started. One variety of food led to another variety of food and the next thing a doting mother could do was get downright fancy meals for her kids. All were available on Subscribe and Save and so came in at a reasonable cost. So, as things went along, mom fell for the more and more expensive types of Fancy Feast and the kitties went right along with her. But then, lo, something was amiss. Sometimes there was not satisfied smacking going on. Instead there was silence. No kitty mom likes silence. Silence indicates "the stare." And the kitty stare is quite similar to the "human stare."  No matter what the subject, the stare Always boils down to something very simple but very deadly: "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN....?"...When you bought the Ferrai?; When you got married THAT guy?; When you bought shares in "American BuggyWhip?; when you ....when you went overseas without me? The stare always indicates something of untold gravity as is indicated by the previous questions. So I get The Stare for: What were you thinking when you bought this cat food FOR ME? Great Gravity involved don't you see. The poor little kitty who had nothing to eat, now wants to know why he is getting some variety of Fancy Feast that does not quite suit his palatte. Me? I ask. Why darlings it is the same thing you always had. Eat for mommy. Nope. Silence with the Stare. So, like most other cat mommies, from time to time, I throw up my hands and figure, male urinary problems or not, kibble is what you get. But then, Fancy Feast came out with this grilled seafood pak. Best deal in a long time from Fancy Feast. I don't know why, but my kitters love it. It is nice meaty morsels of tuna, salmon and seafood.<br />Generally they do not care for these varieties, but love them in the Grilled Group. Maybe it is just the novelty. I spread it out and they do not get it very often. One case every 3-6 months on Subscribe and Save which makes the cost very low. I even send a case to my favorite charity once every six months. Those kitties love it too. The ferals who live out back get the leftovers and they scarf it down. So all kinds of kitties are thrilled with this particular variety of Fancy Feast. So, if you wish to hear the happy sounds of smacking and not get The Stare, then, right away, sign up. You and yours' should all be happy. Hope so. But then, you know kitties.....
