I LOVE this stuff! It is so handy and goes a long way. It has a syrupy consistency and is packed with vanilla bean caviar. This gives your food that extra special gourmet taste. I love putting it in whipped cream, frosting, icing, cakes and scones. It would be great anywheree you use vanilla extract or vanilla beans. If you like to make desserts, you really need to try this!
