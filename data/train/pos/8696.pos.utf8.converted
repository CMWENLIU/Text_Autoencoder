Despite Mr. Moose Hole's eloquent description, Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard is one of the best available to spice up a sandwich, a salad, or a cooked entree, for example, a chicken dish. It's also quite good for prepping a ham to be baked. [I wonder where Mr. Moose Hole dines and on what he dines. Oh well, chacun a son gout.]
