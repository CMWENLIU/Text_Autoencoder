One of my friends bought a case a few weeks back, and could not get the mind over matter to drink it once he realized it was actually black so I grabbed it and stuck a bottle in the fridge for a few hours. When I pulled it out and took a swig I nearly melted. I grew up on a farm with a natural artesian well, so when I moved out of state and into a big city for Uni a few years ago I thought there was something wrong with it, as it reeked of chlorine. blk. tastes like what I grew up on. I could see why it might taste off, if you know what copper and iron taste like you will taste them, but its in trace amounts and only really noticeable if 1)you WANT to taste them, or 2)you grew up on city water and have never had actual fresh water that has not had absurd amounts of chemicals pumped into it.
