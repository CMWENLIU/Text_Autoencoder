My husband and I have tasted potato chip brands from one end of the country to the other, but these are absolutely THE BEST!  I agree it is hard to consume only one serving at a time... hubby and I ate the whole 5 oz bag!  And we are not big eaters of anything - haven't done something like this in years, but then we've never had such tasty chips ever.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
