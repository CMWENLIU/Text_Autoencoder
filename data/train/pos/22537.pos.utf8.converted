Coffee People has the best k cups if you like extra bold coffee. The Jet Fuel is the boldest of all with little bitterness and a real kick. It is smooth and rich. You can't beat the price on Amazon 2 - 24 count boxes for $21.00. If you like Dunkin' Donuts coffee, I would also recommend the donut shop blend from Coffee People. Jet Fuel is more like a Starbucks cup of coffee without the rude Barista's and enormous price tag.
