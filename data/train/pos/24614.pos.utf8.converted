The Green Mountain Cafe Escapes chocolate is my current favorite among the chocolate flavored coffees and cocoa available for the Keurig coffee makers.  Note that this product is "dark chocolate" cocoa, not chocolate flavored coffee or "milk chocolate" cocoa.  It has a more intense chocolate flavor than the milk chocolate version.  Sometimes I like to add to the rich chocolate flavor by adding 1 tablespoon of Coffee Mate Sugar Free Hazelnut non-dairy coffee creamer. For calorie counters that's about 90 calories for the cocoa and the creamer.  An occaisional dash of cinnamon is also very good.  Delicious and very easy to make.
