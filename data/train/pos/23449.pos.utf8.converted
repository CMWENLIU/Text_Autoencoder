This great mayo alternative has gotten hard to find in grocery stores, so I was pleased to see that Amazon had it available in 12 packs for a reasonable price.  I've used this for years instead of mayonnaise on sandwiches -- its light flavor isn't as pungent as regular mustard and it has a nice creamy texture with virtually no calories.<br /><br />Since I now don't have to worry about running out, I decided to try some as a baste for baked chicken.  I mixed a full jar of Dijonnaise with about a quarter cup of honey, and liberally covered a large package of skinless chicken breasts before popping into the oven.  Wow -- the chicken was moist and delicious and had a nice sweet/tangy glaze of the honey-mustard mixture.  A quick and easy way to give chicken breast a great option for a busy weekday dinner.
