Everytime I visit Slough (UK) from the US I eat at Nando's.  In fact, I eat there nearly everyday.  Why? Well...the only other viable food choices in Slough are: spread meat sandwiches (with butter, sweet corn, free-range eggs, rocket, and mature cheese) at Amys (yuck!)..."unnamed" department store (made me sick)...or McDonalds/Burger King/Pizza Hut/Subway (I can get those down the street). But most importantly, it's the Peri Peri Sauce!<br /><br />Though created for Nando's chicken, Peri Peri sauce is especially tastey as a dipping sauce for french fries.  Thanks to Amazon.com, I can enjoy Peri Peri sauce everyday right here in the United States.<br /><br />Warning: the "hot" is plenty hot enough.  The extra hot is ridiculously hot!
