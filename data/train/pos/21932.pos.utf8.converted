I received a tin of this tea from my cousin who had brought it over from Germany. I have honestly never tasted a better tea, and the aroma is amazing. The most notable flavors are bergamot and vanilla, making this a very soothing tea with just the right amount of fruity flavor without tasting overly sweet. I love it on its own (no cream or sugar with this one!), but it pairs wonderfully with orange-laced chocolate. Really a wonderful tea - I'm thrilled I can get it on Amazon!
