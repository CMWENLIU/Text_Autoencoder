Fiendishly good.  Smooth, rich and ridiculously delicious.  Sweet tooth candy.  Not for someone with a drinking problem, as you can smell the rum when you open the wrapping.  We inhaled three boxes of this fudge in a shamefully short time.  Don't buy this product, it's too good, and, unfortunately, reasonably priced.
