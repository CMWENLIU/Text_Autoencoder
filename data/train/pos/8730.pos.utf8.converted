i love my oatmeal cookies and porridge but i couldn't enjoy it in a while due to the allergy. well now i'm happy. it's real oatmeal without the contamination of wheat and i just love it. i can enjoy it without having to deal iwth joint pain and bloating etc. it's exactly like old fashioned oats just without gluten contamination.
