Since this is/was  my first experience tasting hummus, I have no basis for comparison. It was with some trepidation that I took my first bite of Wild Garden hummus in the individual squeeze packet.<br /><br />I liked it. I liked it. After the first cracker spread with hummus, I ate another and another until all of the hummus was gone. The tast reminds me of the Frito Lay bean dip we sometimes have, but the tast of the hummus is a little milder.<br /><br />The size of the packet is perfect for an individual's lunch or a nice pick me up snack. The user is directed to refrigerate any leftover hummus, but with the size of these packets I doubt there will be any refrigerating done around her.<br /><br />It may not be potato based, but I can certainly recommend this product based on taste and convenience.
