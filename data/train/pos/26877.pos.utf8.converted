These sugar cookie ornaments are no longer available in my state (Florida), after being used for decades, somebody decided that the silver on the "Silver Dragees" was not a substance that should be consumed.  I have been making Christmas cookies for 40 years using them to decorate sugar cookies and Spritz wreath shaped butter cookies, and searched everywhere for them.  I was very happy to find them here at Amazon.  My traditional Christmas cookies will once again, look like they always did, and my family members are all still alive and well, after consuming them for decades.  Happy Holidays..........
