Sounds from my title that I am going to trash these olives.  I love green olives and the anchovies just sounded worth trying.  They honestly don't taste like there are any anchovies in there.  Even when I pick out one of the things they claim are anchovies, they don't really taste much like anything.  The olives more than make up for any lack of stuffing.  Some green olives are fairly firm and kind of bitter.  These are soft and buttery with a mild flavor.  And they are some of the best olives I have had.  The cans are kind of small as they are only 3 oz.
