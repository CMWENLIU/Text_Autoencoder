After doing much research to find the best food for my cats I decided on this one. The ingredients are far more superior for cats than many that proclaim their products to be premium. Cats need meat, not a bunch of cheap grain fillers. [...]*Note* There's never been a recall on this food.<br />The price is lower than most of the "premium" foods, too. My cats all look great & eat it very well.
