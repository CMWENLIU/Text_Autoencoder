Oh yum!<br />This sugar is divine and so versatile.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Muscovado sugar and this Molasses sugar is almost identical in flavor and texture to that but I'd say it has a deeper molasses flavor than the Muscovado we have been using.<br /><br />Natural dark brown sugar adds wonderful flavor to many dishes made with beef such as chili, beef stew and such.  It's also truly delightful when added to a glass of milk (hot or cold) - just stir it in as you would with a powdered chocolate milk mix but just use less than you would of those mixes.<br />Mix it up in a blender until it's foamy and kids LOVE it -<br />Add a sprinkle of nutmeg or a bit of grated chocolate to the top for a pretty look and an extra layer of flavor.<br /><br />A tablespoon or two substituted for white sugar in a chocolate cake mix enhances the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />It is also knock your socks off good in when mixed into heavy cream and whipped -<br />A dessert all by itself.<br /><br />Try a spoonful in your coffee instead of white sugar.<br /><br />Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this often hard to find sugar.<br />It's the real thing and it's wonderful.<br /><br />Please keep it stored in an airtight container or it will turn into a brick.
