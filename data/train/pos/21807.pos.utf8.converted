Vegan. Natural. Yummy in or on nearly everything. [Moderation can be a problem. Sprinkle with care.] Vegan delight. Mauna Loa is a top "mac" brand. For sweet Hawaiian dreams. Six 6oz packages equals 2 lbs 4 oz total, which is a great value. Mauna Loa is the largest volcano on earth located on the Big Island of Hawaii, which is my favorite. Awe inspiring. [Go to Maui for the scene, the Big Island for natural wonderment.] Definitely worth a visit. Enjoy this Hawaiian macadamia delight anytime when you can. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.
