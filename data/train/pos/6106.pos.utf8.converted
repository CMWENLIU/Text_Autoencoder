I suffer from anxiety almost constantly and am always looking for ways to ease my days a bit followed by ways to ease my already anxious stomach. Basically looking for both, relaxation and soothing my digestive. I have used Yogi teas for ages now! They should be in my medicine cabinet rather than my pantry. I've used Yogi Kava Kava Stress Relief and Bedtime - both are strong and will sleep you or make you really mellow unable to be social. I only take them when I am about to panic and trust me, they will ease you... to sleep lol.  Calming and Relaxed Mind tea are good and more for taste and a light relaxation. Eh, can't complain. But this one, THIS ONE has it all. Definitely for the mind (chamomile and lavender) and body (lemon balm, lemongrass, etc and of course the MINT). Don't need to take two teas. This will sooth my nerves, NOT drowse me, calm any digestive disorder that might be present.<br /><br />Taste: Definitely the lavender comes in first but not overpowering like Relaxed Mind. Mellowed by the chamomile, mint with the "tail" being the honey? Not sweet though just sorta smells like honey. (Shhh! probably honeybush but they didn't include it lol :X) Red tinted due to rooibos. Has that earthy-ness of rooibos too. Very beautiful tea. The combination dances well with one another, and we are talking about strong herbs here. Good job Yogi! Lately, Yogi's been coming up with awesome new teas. Must be a new tea chef!<br /><br />I am buying two of these at a time till they go 6 pack and then I'll stock up. I am drinking this every single day and am scare to run out. For this price? You just can't go wrong. I KNOW I won't find this in stores just yet as it's a new tea. I had low expectations for it's job, but for my surprise, it taste like it says and does what it suppose to do... relief my stress.
