9 out of 10 Grandpas agree that Werther's Original Creamy Caramel Filled Hard Candies will stick to their false teeth, but is still well worth the battle.  Most Grandpas will opt to remove their dentures and just gum the sweet treat.<br /><br />I am not a grandpa, nor do I wear false teeth, yet I still enjoy these little chewy delights because they will fit inside my Fabric Waist Pack Many Colors! and the thin hard shell offers a moderate layer of insulation to the caramel when I am out and about on a hot day, such as at the largest flea market West of the Mississippi.
