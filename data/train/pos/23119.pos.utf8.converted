Cesar Canine Cuisine Varety Pack Food Review<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />I was questionable about buying these at first, seeing that I'd be paying a dollar for an incredibly small meal my miniture dobermans would surely eat up in a minute. So I took a chance and bought the 12 pack-which includes Filet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak flavors-and my dogs ate them up! Yes, they did eat them fairly quickly, but I found that mixing two of the dinners and a big bowl full of dry food will still be tasty enough for them. Do that, and you'll get more use out of these-dogs seem to like their flavor. So although they aren't that healthy for dogs everyday (I made sure to read the inredients on the back), they're perfect for a snack or to mix with dinner.
