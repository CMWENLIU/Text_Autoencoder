I bought my first SproutMaster years ago at the Dowling Orchard Market when passing through Banning, California (back when they sold them).<br /><br />Through a bit pricey for a plastic tray, I cannot complain about the ease of use or the quality of the sprouts grown. The divider IS helpful to grow different sprouts, BUT it is more helpful to grow the same type of sprout in two different stages of growth. This way, you can always have fresh sprouts handy at anytime.<br /><br />They do grow fast and the Sprout Master makes it so simple to care for them.
