My parents used to buy the Underwood Roast Beef spread every so often when I was growing up. Sadly, the stores around here don't sell it anymore- it's become quite difficult to find anywhere, really. On a whim, I decided to see if Amazon had it, and as soon as I saw that they did, I had to buy it. The stuff is still as tasty as I remember it to be. We always spread it on bread with mayo, as the spread itself can be a bit rich. I sometimes like to mix it with a little mayo and use it as dip for carrots or spread it on crackers.  When the package came, the whole family decended on it like a pack of wolves. lol The 12 cans didn't last our family too long, but it was well worth the cost. I plan on buying more sometime in the future- I just wish I could find it in my local stores.
