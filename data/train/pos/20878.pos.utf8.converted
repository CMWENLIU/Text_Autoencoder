I don't know why this product isn't in our area stores, so I'll buy it from Amazon. This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever had. And it's low fat too. I lost 77 lbs on weight watchers and a whole bag of this stuff is only 3 points. I'll pop a whole bag in the AM and put it in smaller covered bowls and snack on these all day long.
