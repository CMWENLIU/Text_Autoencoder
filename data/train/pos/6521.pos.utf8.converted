This fudge was very good.<br /><br />A friend brought it back from a Cruise.  Lucky her got to taste test I'm sure many other varieties of Tortuga fudge.<br /><br />The fudge has a good consistency.  It's appearance is like a brick of hard chocholate but it has a perfect fudge texture.  It's not too hard nor too soft.  It's the type that flakes if forced.  The flavor - amazing.  I read someone complaining it tasting like cheap rum.  I disagree.  I've drank cheap rum before and that's a taste you can't forget.  The rum flavor is heavenly divine. It's saturated in the stuff which makes it a real treat above the other fudges you may have ever had.  The price is not bad at all - considering where it's imported and all.  Generally with other fudges you are paying for quantity and- not quality.  However in this case you are paying for quality, quantity, and a rum filled experience. mmmmm :) boy it's good.  BUY IT, I'm going to. Too bad it doesn't have a subscribe and save option, ha-ha.  My hips I guess are grateful for that.
