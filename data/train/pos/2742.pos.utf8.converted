I was turned on to this balsamic 5 yrs. ago by a friend who worked at Sur La Table. Since then I've turned many others on to it.  My husband loves it too though he refers to it as liquid gold because of the price.  It is the perfect balsamic, thick and slightly sweet, it's great on strawberries or a spinach salad.  It's great for plating too as it is thick enough to pool. It is dark and rich and worth every penny.  One bottle last us two for about 2-3 mos. and I'm sure to re-buy before it gets too low. If you took a high quality balsamic and let it reduce and mellow that's about the flavor you'd get in this balsamic.  Highly recommended.
