Me and my wife have been buying Bench and Field cat food for years. My one cat had a hernia in his stomach as a kitten and as such has a sensitive digestive system. After trying many different brands, Bench and Field was the only brand that seemed to work, which allowed for a much less smelly cat box.<br /><br />Also, my cats have always had a shiny, beautiful coat while eating this product and love the taste. They are in great health because of this food in my opinion.<br /><br />To save money go to [...] and order the 30 pound bag for $55.00. Shipping is included and they always ship it out promptly.<br /><br />I would recommend this food to anyone with a cat or cats.
