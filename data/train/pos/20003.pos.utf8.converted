These are like their other Cheese flavored pretzel pieces, but better! These are actually full nibblers (no not the character from "FUTURAMA", although cute just the wrong nibbler anywhoo...). The flavor is much more smokey than the bright orange counterpart. I also like how most of the cheese is concentrated at the crack of where the pretzel separated so you can experience the flavor at your own pace.<br />To sum it up, for me these are an adult version of the ever popular chip that is bright orange and has a cheetah for a mascot, and they don't leave cheetle behind, although a good licking session may have to be re-visited, but I digress...Buy a pack try 'em out.
