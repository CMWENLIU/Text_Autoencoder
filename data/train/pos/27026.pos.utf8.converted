It isn't often when we're pleasantly surprised by a substitute food product.  This is one of those rare surprises.<br />I'm admitting I haven't tried it everywhere I would use sugar. But then, I'm not much of a baker so I'm not worried there.<br />I was simply trying to find a decent, healthy substitute for sugar in my morning coffee.<br />This easily fills that need. I've tried everything, including the forest packets... which just didn't taste right. Truvia, blechhh.. (and I don't want to support Cargill). Pink stuff is nasty and the blue stuff is dangerous.<br />I'm so happy to have found this that I filled up my sugar bowl with it, and I brought a package to work to use there as well. I even gave a package to my ex-husband who's diabetic and I don't even like him! That's how excited about it I am.<br />Overall, I could not be more pleased. I'm pretty sure you will be too.
