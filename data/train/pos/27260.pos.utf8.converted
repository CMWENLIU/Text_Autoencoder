First let me say that this is only my opinion, and you know what "they" say about opinions...<br />A while ago I found that I had to give up coffee, which for me was tough because coffee and water are about the only two things I drink. I've never been a milk drinker, nor have I ever been big on juice. And forget tea - maybe some herb tea before bed but it's nothing I want during the day while I'm working. Enter the "coffee substitute". I found numerous brands on line. All of them claim to taste "just like the real thing" and have plenty of reviews by people just like you and me saying how wonderful the stuff is. You could probably serve these people a cup of hot yak urine and tell them it was coffee and they would tell you it was delicious. The truth is, NOTHING but coffee tastes like coffee, and anyone that tries to tell you otherwise needs a new set of taste buds. All of the coffee substitutes I've tried taste like exactly what they're made from - roasted grains, nuts and roots. Most of them contain roasted carob. Carob DOES NOT taste anything like coffee; for one, it's way too sweet. You don't want anything that contains carob. Substitutes made with dates and figs are equally as repulsive. Again - way too sweet. One of the things that gives coffee its appeal is its bitterness. A good coffee substitute has to have some bitterness. So far the only thing I've found that comes close is Orzo brand roasted organic Italian barley. If you drink it black it satisfies like coffee. It takes a few cups but it starts to "grow on you"; after drinking it for a week I've found I like it just as much as, and maybe even prefer it to, coffee. For one thing, it doesn't upset an empty stomach the way coffee does, and you can drink it after dinner without fear of it keeping you up all night.
