Imagine Chicken broth is as close to homemade stock as I can find. Cooks Illustrated rates it very high also. My only complaint is I am unable to get it in a larger size. A 1 Qt. box would be nice.<br />Having family members with MSG allergies is what prompted me to start making my own stock. Slowly I started finding stocks/broths with no MSG added but the taste was not always true. I re-order this often so I can always have it on hand in my pantry.
