I am very choosy with picking green teas. I have tried a few before I came across Lipton's Green Tea. I always felt that Lipton makes tea more along the lines of "mass production" and misses on the exclusivity. But this tea beats my expectations. It has a nice flavor - very subtle - no coloration to turn the tea into a PINK liquid, a nice flavor and very light aroma. Really like it - This is going to turn into my favorite.<br /><br />the only downside, if you like variety and happen to buy this pack alone- then you are stuck with 120 berry flavored green teas :) But of course this is not even a negative :)<br /><br />Enjoy!
