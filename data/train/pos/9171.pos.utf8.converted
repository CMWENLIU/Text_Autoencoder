I have been drinking Soy Milk for about 18 years.  I don't think there is a single soy product in the grocery, natural food, organic food stores that I have not tried.  Recently I found that my favorite Silk Soy had cross contamination from coconut & almonds both of which I am highly allergic to.  After a trip to the ER I went on a quest for another product and purchased Soy Dream from amazon. I purchased three (3) cases and not one was broken unlike the other reviewer.<br /><br />For Baking I use West Soy Unsweetend as who wants their scalloped potatoes sweetened.  For those of you who bake & cook Soy acts just like milk in cakes, scalloped dishes, etc.  I never use milk.<br /><br />But for my cereal, a pick me up during the day, to drink with my evening snack I use Soy Dream.  The taste is great and it has a little more substance than other soy products.  I often drink a half a box for a lift during the day when I am busy.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it.  My husband drinks it too and loves it on his cereal and uses it also for his Oatmeal Muffin snack in the evening.<br /><br />Amazon's shipping is great on this product and as a prime member I receive mine in two days.
