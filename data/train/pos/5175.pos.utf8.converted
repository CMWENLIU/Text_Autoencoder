Recently we dined at a Brazilian restaurant and enjoyed this wonderful soda. Both my husband and sister-in-law  grew up in Brasil and have fond memories of enjoying Guarana.  On a whim, I searched amazon.com on the off chance that Guarana might be available. What a pleasant surprise to see that it is available!  The flavor is something like ginger ale - but oh so much better and refreshing. We ordered for ourselves and for our family in IL. We will order again.
