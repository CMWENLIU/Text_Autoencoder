If you like hummus, you will love this little ready to eat meal.  It is convenient, lightweight, packed to go anywhere (work, car, backpacking, picnicking, survival kit, etc.), and really fun and tasty.  You get a little bag of gluten free rice/seed crackers (about 7), a tubie of hummus (which was surprisingly good!), a little bag of roasted, salted soybeans, a bag of hot/sweet nut mix with a few dried cranberries, and a small (.43 oz.) 60% cacao dark chocolate bar, all packed nicely in a sturdy little box. And inside the box is a Sudoku puzzle. All in all, worth the money at $3. a box with Subscribe and Save.  The expiration date on my unit, purchased March 2011, is August 13, 2011.  I agree with the other reviewer that you could snack on this throughout the day, or eat it for a lunch.
