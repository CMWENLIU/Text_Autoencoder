The base of the tree was thicker than the one shown in the picture.  The I received has a nice taper.  A nice touch, there was a little bit of moss growing over the dirt.<br /><br />The tree came packaged in a tall box with an inner Styrofoam base to protect the pot.  The pot and base of the tree were wrapped tight in a thick plastic and the soil was damp upon arrival.  The rest of the space inside the box was filled with a biodegradable type of foam peanuts (watch out, they get everywhere when you take the tree out).<br /><br />Fantastic tree!
