These dried cherries are as good as it gets.  Why anyone would give them less than a 5 star rating amazes me.<br /><br />They're so much better than raisins in oatmeal, liven up tapioca pudding, and there is no more delicious cookie than chocolate chip cookies made with Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, fresh pecans and, (of course,) dried cherries.<br /><br />Try them; you'll like them.
