This is delicious frosting. Tastes just like real sugar frosting. Wonderful, rich chocolate taste. So easy to mix up - even without a mixer. Makes a wonderful cake along with the sweet 'n low yellow cake mix. YUMMY!! My only problem is trying to find it in stores. So now I just get it off the internet.
