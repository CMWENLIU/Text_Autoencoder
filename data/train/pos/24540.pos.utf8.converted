I grew up in MA. as well, and this is what we made coffee milkshakes with- ones that taste just like Friendly's. Now that I'm in CA. I have to find other ways to get it. FYI, 6 bottles here for $24 works out to a better deal if you've got other people to share with, but if it's way too much for you, try the Vermont Country Store online. It's more expensive, but they sell it in 2 bottle batches for $11. This stuff is worth it!
