These come in the famous red tin -- see my customer photo.  The current Amazon picture is incorrect -- it shows the "window-box" packaging, which is not what this item is.<br /><br />The cookies inside are the full size Amaretti Di Saronno cookies, wrapped in pairs in the crinkly parchment paper.  (These are not the small "Amarettini" cookies with the "-ini" at the end.  Those come in the "tall" tin.)<br /><br />Absolutely love these cookies. They are delicious with red wine.  We get some each year during the Holiday season. Year after year, these are delicious as ever.<br /><br />I cannot comment on whether it is still possible to light the wrappers on fire (a complaint in other reviews).  I have not tried this since I was 15 years old, which was a LONG time ago.
