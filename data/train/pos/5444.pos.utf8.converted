Being from New Orleans, I love coffee with chicory.  As many know, using chicory is very common, perhaps due to the famous beignet shop, Cafe du Monde.  That coffee (with chicory) is awesome, and they do sell that premade blend here on Amazon.<br /><br />However, as other users have commented, the Cafe du Monde coffee doesn't use the best coffee beans...it's just a cheapo coffee bean that they happen to mix with chicory...which makes it unique.<br /><br />With this product, you can use whatever coffee bean you want, and then you mix in the chicory at whatever ratio suits you.  So you can use a cheapo coffee bean (folgers, maxwell house, etc.), or you can go with a better quality bean; the choice is yours since you are mixing these on your own.  For me, after the praising review, by consumer reports, of Eight O'Clock 100% columbian coffee, that's what I drink, and it's a GREAT coffee.  However, mixing in this chicory takes it to a whole new level!<br /><br />Finding the right ratio took some tweaking, but 2 to 1 (coffee to chicory) seems to work.  I use a french press and grind my coffee immediately before brewing.  For one cup, I use two spoons of freshly ground coffee and 1 spoon of chicory.  This makes a STRONG, but rich and smooth coffee.  As someone else mentioned, almost a chocolatey flavor.  It's just awesome.<br /><br />Finally, a comment on the negative reviews:<br />Unfortunately, the negative reviews were from people who didn't know they were purchasing 100% chicory and expected a coffee product instead.  Um, guys, gals, the listing clearly says "100% Chicory"; the fact that someone doesn't comprehend very clear words shouldn't result in a product getting a negative review.  Just my 1.5 cents.
