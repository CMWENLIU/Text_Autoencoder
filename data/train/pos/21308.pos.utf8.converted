This is raw buckwheat. Not the same as European popular roasted version. I noticed review from customer who says he/she is from Ukraine and did not like it. Well, I am from the Ukraine as well - the only difference is I know the difference. City slickers have no option to buy it raw in town because in that form buckwheat is only good for about 24 months vacuum packed at best, yet in roasted form it will be good for decades. Nothing personal - just stating the fact. This particular buckwheat is simple and wholesome natural grain that needs to be flavored with other things like fenugreek seed or spices. I also tried to grow it and it does sprout in about 48 hours. It is superb natural product. It can be cooked in the matter of 15 minutes and then eaten with meat and gravy of choice or with milk and honey as cereal in the morning. This is "going to the basics" type of food. Please notice that people that thrive on aspartame soda and artificial flavored cheese from plastic jar toped with sodium tripolyphosphate supermarket "previously frozen" fish are not likely customers for this product. However, those that look for natural, tasty and nutritious grains should definitely try it. Many ancient civilizations in Europe and Asia survived on this thing for millennia so maybe it is not so bad after all, don't you think?
