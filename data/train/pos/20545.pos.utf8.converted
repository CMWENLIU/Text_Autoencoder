This is literally the best cereal in my entire life that I have ever eaten. It's a perfect supplement to a whole foods vegan diet. at 16g of protein per cup, packed with fiber, minerals, and vitamins, you cannot go wrong with this cereal. This texture and taste are not for everyone, but for those who like hearty, multi grain, sugar free types of food, this is the cereal for you!
