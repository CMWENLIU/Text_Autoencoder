Three years ago I gave up most caffeine in my diet but I've never been able to give up that last little bit contained in a good cup of decaffeinated coffee -- until now.  While the flavor is a little different than that of coffee, its close enough to become my new morning ritual.  Here's what I like about this healthy alternative:<br /><br />  * I brew it in a coffee pot just like usual<br /><br />  * The drink's consistency is similar to coffee and is dark roasted color<br /><br />  * It comes in various flavors just like coffee<br /><br />  * I drink it with about half the raw sugar and cream I used to use<br /><br />  * I'm totally satisfied with my drink; I don't feel cheated<br /><br />In addition to cutting on caffeine, I'm also cutting costs.  When I make coffee I use a tablespoon of coffee per cup.  With this stuff I use only a half-tablespoon.
