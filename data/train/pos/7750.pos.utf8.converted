This product is yummy, but I'd never pay the prices for it that Amazon wants. I live in California and can find this exact product at Smart and Final stores for less than $9...and no shipping cost, either!<br /><br />Edit, February 24, 2010<br />Ever since they changed the formula and added the Maxwell house coffee, the flavor is really really off. It's not as smooth and creamy as it once was and I drink a LOT less of this product. I hope they go back to their original recipe soon...
