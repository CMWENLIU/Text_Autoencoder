Very happy with all of Wellness products. When my black labrador got constant ear infections that would not clear up with medications I decided it could be allergies. She was on Wellness Simple Solutions Rice and Duck dry and canned food for about 6 weeks, and her ears cleared up without continuos medication.  I would highly recommend this product for any dog which has skin,ear,or stomach issues.
