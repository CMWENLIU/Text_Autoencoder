I have tried many different powdered green tea recipies trying to duplicate the Starbucks Green Tea Lattes.  This is it! This tea tastes just like their green tea latte.  I have the melon syrup from Starbucks and only use 1 or 2 pumps because this already has the sugar combined with the green tea, then I add the milk, or soy...I can even water it down a bit too.  I will be saving a bundle by making it myself!  Finally I have found the Starbucks match!
