We have been using Fresh Step "Multiple Cat" for several months now, my cats use it, it clumps well, and I like how well it controls odors. I also really like that it is "Prime" eligible for shipping and that means the UPS guy has to carry it up to our porch, which is great since we accidentally ordered ten boxes of this (yep, 250lbs) because the "Two-Day 1-Click" button kept returning an error and I didn't think to check if each click resulted in an order. By the way, kitty litter is considered a "grocery" item and is not generally eligible for return to Amazon but they did find a way to make it right to my satisfaction.<br /><br />So, this is good kitty litter that we will be using for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
