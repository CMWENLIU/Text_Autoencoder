Bought the 108 pack after wife drank this in a variety pack...She LOVES it!!!!!  I tried it and I have to say I do NOT really enjoy coffee anyway and found the breakfast blend to be quite good for coffee.  It has no bite, and a smooth, full coffee flavor.  An Excellent everyday coffee.  PS My wife is a coffe snob and used to be a Dutch Junky, but is FAR happier drinking 2-3 cups of this per day for less than the price of a single "hut cup".
