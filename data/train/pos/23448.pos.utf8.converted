A couple weeks ago, I decided to try adding coconut oil to my diet/regimen because of all its health benefits, and settled on this particular brand after much research. I have to say, it is amazing so far!<br /><br />It has a wonderful coconutty smell, and gives a great flavor to everything you cook with it (though I'm sure there are some things that don't go well with coconuts). Just last night, I made a delicious panko lemon pepper chicken cooked in the oil. Crazy good!! I've even used it to cook ground meat and veggies for a spaghetti sauce, which was yummy as well.<br /><br />For the last couple weeks, I've also been adding a heaping tablespoon to my morning coffee along with a pad of grass-fed butter, some unsweetened organic cocoa powder and almond milk - this being my own version of Dave Asprey's Bulletproof Coffee (google Bulletproof Exec...his site is amazing!).<br /><br />The energy boost I get from my morning coffee is incredible and much longer-lasting nowadays, compared to how I used to feel after a normal cup of coffee with coffee creamer. At first, I started adding just coconut oil, but I find that the little bit of butter helps the oil incorporate, so it's less of an oil slick - but I still have to swirl it once in a while. Another big bonus is that my morning coffee, laden with these healthy fats, can easily stave off hunger until lunch time, so I don't need constant snacks throughout the day!<br /><br />I have also found that I have tons of energy in the evening until I decide to go to bed, and consistently wake very refreshed, even if I've only gotten 5-6 hours of sleep. I don't have a midafternoon slump like I used to, and I largely attribute that to the addition of healthy fats, like coconut oil, and near elimination of sweets and bread in my diet (though I still enjoy a cookie now and then... :) I wish I had made these changes sooner!!<br /><br />I've also been using it as a light facial moisturizer after showers, and it's been great for that. I feel much better knowing what I'm putting on my face. The oil is also a great hair serum! I use a tiny bit (just enough to barely coat the very tip of your finger) spread in my palms, then rub through the middle/ends of my almost dry hair, then roll it in a bun for about 10-20 minutes. When I unroll it, my hair is wavy and smooth and silky and feels just as good as if I had used one of those $50 an ounce serums from the salon! That's easily one of my favorite uses...<br /><br />Coconut oil has been a great addition to my life, and I've been so excited about the changes in my energy and sleep in the last couple weeks. My boyfriend is beyond tired of hearing about it :)<br /><br />A note of caution: Eating too much coconut oil at once, especially if you've never used it before, may give you an upset tummy and an urgent trip to the bathroom. After a quick search online, I found that this is most likely caused by die-off of bad bugs in the body. Apparently coconut oil is great for detox!<br /><br />I promise, you will not be sorry for giving this a try!
