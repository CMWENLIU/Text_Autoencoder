I know the front label says this food is for senior cats but my sphynx kitten is very active and this is also for active cats, so I figured I'd give it a try. I made a mixture of half Newman's Own Advanced with half of Kitten Chow (for the required kitten essentials!) and my kitty loves it. I like how this is organic and the nibbles are nice and hard to promote healthy teeth. I've also noticed my kitty's poop isn't stinky anymore because this food is of much better quality than the other so-called premium cat foods I've tried before. Tip: If you're feeding your cat a dry food mix and its poop stinks it usually indicates its poor quality - so upgrade. I'm going to continue feeding my kitty the mixture and once he's an adult I may switch over to feeding him just this exclusively.
