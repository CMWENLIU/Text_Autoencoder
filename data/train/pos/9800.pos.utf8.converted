One of the truly great sausages.<br /><br />I remember them from my days as a young paratrooper in the 82d. The service club down the way would serve them up, sliced, grilled on a bun with mayo. They were great. Just the right amount of heat amidst the wonderful flavor.<br /><br />Decades later I discovered Aidells. They are identical with what I remembered. These days, I grill the bun--Texas Toast style--with rosemary, oil and butter.<br /><br />A real treat to eat.
