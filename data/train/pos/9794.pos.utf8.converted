I ordered this last week and have been using it and just enjoying it tremendously. I got tired of the quick-browining/burn of butter (since I stopped using fake butters and switched back to real butter). I decided to try this and I like it a lot. It smells so nice. A fresh smell. It tastes excellent. It cooks beautifully. Very, very pleased. I had refrigerated ghee I'd tried in the past (not as good as this one) years ago, but I think I'll keep this in the cupboard, cause I like it all smooth and easy to get out of the jar.<br /><br />I recommend this brand. Lovely.
