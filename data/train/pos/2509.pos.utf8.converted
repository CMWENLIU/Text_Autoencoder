You can use this in your swimming pool to raise alkalinity.  It's cheaper than the "Alkalinity Plus" product sold in swimming pool stores.  Use the same amount of baking soda that you would use of Alkalinity Plus.  1/3 pound of baking soda per 1000 gallons increases KH by 20 ppm (about 1 degree dKH).
