Oh, the smell of this bread.  Yes, it tastes just as good.  This is called a cheeese and herb bread, but you will mostly notice the herbs.  That's fine with me because this is a delicious blend.<br /><br />I am not a sandwich person, prefer hot food, but I made a sandwich with this bread using ham, salami, mayo, and some shredded Italian cheese.  Oh my gosh, it was so good I had it for dinner three days in a row.<br /><br />I've used the mix several times in my bread machine (a mini loaf in the Just for Dinner bread machine that Amazon used to sell, gosh those were great machines), cutting the recipe in half and being rather careless about the measuring.  Came out great each time no matter how nonchalant I was about the amount of yeast, et al.<br /><br />I've also made the full recipe once with my new KitchenAid stand mixer (a Friday Sale special on Amazon -- thank you, Amazon, thank you!) and it came out even better.  I might add that there were no instructions included for mixers, just bread machine and hand.  I just did it by guesswork, and it came out wonderful.<br /><br />So no matter how I mess up this recipe, I've been successful and gotten great bread.  It is a very forgiving mix.
