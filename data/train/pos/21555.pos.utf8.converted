This is really good muesli. The best way to eat it (for me at least) is to buy a nice big tub of low-fat Nancy's yogurt (or any other "real" yogurt) then mix it in a bowl with some of this muesli and a dash of fruit-flavored (some kind of berry is usually the best), sugar-free coffee syrup like Davinci or Torani. That will give you as much protein as a couple eggs, a bunch of complex carbs, low fat and no sugar. It's probably about the best breakfast you can eat and it tastes like it's terrible for you.
