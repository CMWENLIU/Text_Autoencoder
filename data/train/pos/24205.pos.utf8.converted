The Pure Natural Peanut Raisin Crunch bars are delicious. They are much chewier than I expected (luckily, they don't hurt teeth--and I have sensitive teeth. These were awesome in that aspect). I expected something similar to Nature Valley. These, however, taste like candy bars--specifically, Paydays.<br /><br />The calorie count is fairly high for a granola bar--200 per bar. However, they are packed with protein, absolutely packed, and all things considered, the sugar levels are very decent. It provides a rush of energy, but it's the good kind--it lingers, lets you down slowly, and doesn't lead to a crash.<br /><br />Overall, these are very delicious, and a great alternative to other bars. The only thing I didn't like was that they were smaller than I expected. That's such a small thing, though. These bars taste great, and they are highly recommended.
