While this product is marketed especially for cats,I am not sure that it is prepared any differently than the wood pellets available for horses or wood stoves which sell at a fraction of the cost. $3/40lbs.  That is quite a big difference.  I recommend you use your own judgment about safety but I have had no problems using the stove pellets.
