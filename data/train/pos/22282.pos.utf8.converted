This stuff is insanely good. I thought it was just going to be Nuttzo with cocoa thrown in as a gimmick, but boy was I wrong.<br /><br />CHOC seems to have a texture, taste, and consistency all its own. You still get the classic Nuttzo seven-nut butter blend in addition to huge chunks of each nut, but now there are dark chocolate bits and a deep cocoa swirl added to the mix. Really gives the whole thing a new and magical "kick" -- a bit like what a healthy Nutella-Reese's combo might be. Somehow the stuff manages to be even crunchier than original Nuttzo, too, which I assume has something to do with the slightly rearranged order of flax and sunflower seeds. The resulting mouthfeel is close to divine. This is the kind of spread that makes you pause to parse and savor each chew.<br /><br />The chocolate chips boast a refreshingly short ingredient list: organic cocoa liquor, organic cane sugar, organic cocoa butter, and organic cocoa powder. The cocoa delivers a deep, rich bite while still allowing all of the nuts and seeds to shine through. CHOC is not for fans of the super sweet goop you'll find with other popular PB blends, however; the chocolate here is fairly dark with a total sugar content only 1g higher than plain Nuttzo per serving. (Compare this to an equivalent serving of Dark Chocolate Dreams, which packs about 7g of sugar. Nutella contains over 20g!) CHOC will certainly satisfy those looking for a more subtle, refined, multi-layered taste experience. And did I mention the crunch? :-)<br /><br />Anyway, this is by far the tastiest thing I've tried in the realm of chocolate nut butters. I love to eat it with ice cream, oatmeal, yogurt, fruits, and of course straight from the jar, as recommended by the manufacturer. CHOC isn't exactly cheap, but considering all the potent and organic ingredients blended here in such perfect harmony, I'd say it's worth the premium.<br /><br />P.S. Hope to see it on shelves here in Seattle someday!
