When a favorite product goes out of existence, then a cook loses a dear friend. Although the MBT Chicken Broth packets are still available, the Beef Broth cannot be found. My mother and sister-in-law and I devotedly use the MBT products: Chicken broth, Vegetable Broth, and Beef Broth. But guess what? Beef broth is no longer available. Yesterday when I checked Amazon, MBT Beef Broth came up, but I had to add my name to a waiting list when "the product becomes available." Today when I double-checked, there is no MBT Beef Broth.<br /><br />How do we use these products? Like Emeril, we use them to add bam to soups and stews! I make Chicken and Rice or Dumplings or Chicken Vegetable Soup, using white meat only. White meat without skin has little or no fat, thus no flavor for the dish. I add two packets of MBT Chicken Broth for that missing fat and get all the flavor I want. The same is true with Beef Stew. Two packets of MBT Beef Broth add such flavor!!<br /><br />But now, no MBT Beef Broth! Just granules and cubes. They are not the same. I don't know why, but they aren't. Does anyone have a suggestion for a good beef broth substitute? I have looked and looked on Amazon for one, but cannot find a thing. Help?
