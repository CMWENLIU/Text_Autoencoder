There is a recipe on the side of the box for Chocolate Chip Brownies.  We call them Blonde Brownies.  My Grandmother had her own recipe that I used until I tried this one with the caramel cake mix.  This blows my old recipe away - keeps the brownies soft for days, fantastic taste.  I was so happy, until I could not find this boxed cake in any of my stores.  On a fluke I Googled this cake mix and low and behold here it is on Amazon.  Now I have to buy it, I have been missing my fantastic Blonde Brownies for a couple of years.
