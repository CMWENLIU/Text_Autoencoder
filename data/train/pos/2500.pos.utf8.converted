This green tea has a very natural flavor.  The taste of green tea is present without all of the sugar and sugar substitutes that are added to most other bottled teas.  Because it is unsweetened,  it only has a very slight sweetness and the aftertaste is very mild.  I've tried quite of few teas in my time, and it is not an easy task to find a good unsweetened green tea.  This is definitely it.<br /><br />The only true unsweetened green tea that rivals this one is the powder mix version (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PICJTS">All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!</a>) which I only keep in my cupboard because of the better price when purchased as a mix, and I drink a lot of tea!  If you enjoy your tea absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives of any kind I cannot recommend anything else but these two products.
