This acts a lot like fake ground beef.  It's better than some fake taco-beef dry mixes out there because it doesn't have any of its own spices.  So I can put it in marinara sauce or tacos.  Most often, I make chili with it.  It's low in fat and high in protein, so it works out great with my workout diet.  It's moist in the can, so it's ready to cook with right away.
