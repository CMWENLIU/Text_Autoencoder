This is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity.  The pot brews about 3 cups of tea.  I don't drink the tea often - I prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special.<br /><br />The dragon lily tasted wonderful, but the flower was really ugly.  However, I did buy a box of this tea and when I brewed it, the flower was more colorful and appealing.  I was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups.  Although I admit that the last three cups didn't have as strong a flavor.<br />Starlight rose was disappointing.  The flower never changed appearace, just got bigger.  The flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty.<br />Flower Jewel was a lovely bloom and the jasmine smell is wonderful, but the taste was weak.<br />Lavender Dream is similar to Dragon Lily.<br />Emerald Sun's flower didn't change.  Flavor was okay, but nothing special.<br />Jade Fortune was nothing special.  The bloom looked like a sea urchin - kind of interesting.  There was no real scent to it, and there was nothing special about the taste.  It was stronger with the second pot, which was unusual, but the tea wasn't tasty enough to brew the third pot.<br />Jasmine Pearls unwind to become long, thin leaves.  The scent is heavenly.  The taste is not quite as dramatic, but still good.  I used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot).<br />Black Beauty looked like a sea urchin, and had a mild flavor and aroma.  It brewed 3 nice pots of tea, but was nothing special.<br />Midnight Peony's flower remained the same.  The flavor was like a light black tea.<br /><br />So, the winning tea is definitely Dragon Lily - I highly recommend it!
