This product is excellent. My husband and I recently stopped in a restaurant in Fredericksburg, VA and I was served this type couscous with a salmon dish. I absolutely loved it! I asked the waitress what it was...it certainly didn't look like any coucous I have ever had before. She had to check with the chef. I am so glad she did. I immediately went on line to find this product and delighted to see Amazon carried it. It has a wonderful texture, is simple to make and is a great alternative to pasta or rice. A nice change. My five-pound bag is quickly disappearing. I will reorder!
