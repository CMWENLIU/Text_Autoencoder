I sent this to my mom and it was a big hit!  I had to call the order in since it was going to Alaska and their customer service was great.  Very friend, actually left me with a smile on my face when I got off the phone.  The basket arrived sooner then expected! (Which is worth an extra star to me.) It was beautifully done and I totally recommend their service if you are trying to buy for someone who already has everything. Everything came as discribed.  My mother was very pleased with the volume of the contents.  You can't go wrong with this company.  I will use them again for Christmas for those hard to shop for people on my list.
