While I love buying from Amazon, I was a bit concerned about getting vanilla extract in the mail (bottles breaking, yuck). However, everything about this product is great, including the packaging! They arrived in perfect condition. The extract itself is wonderful. The flavor, is as the label implies, pure. It's the best tasting vanilla extract I've ever had and it's much, much cheaper per ounce than buying it at the grocery store. Since there're six in a package, share it with others works well too. I'll definitely be buying this (and other LorAnn products) again.
