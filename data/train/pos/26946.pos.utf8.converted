My Golden Retriever has had hotspots all his life. They are definitely food related and once I find a food that works for him, we stick with it. He originally was eating Dr. Andrew Weil's food, Promise, and was very healthy and happy. Well, the company folded and I had to scramble to find dry dog food that was comparable to what he was eating. Prairie matched almost perfectly! He has never had a hotspot while eating Prairie. He loves the food. It even smells good to me and the cat. The cat will eat out of the food bin if I leave it open. She is also a Prairie for Cats fan but that is another review. Now, a word of caution about mixing flavors...mixing flavors is OK if your dog is young and active but be very careful about reading the labels and noting the amount of calories that vary from flavor to flavor. You WILL need to adjust the amount of food!!! I switched to the beef variety and didn't check the calories and was shocked to see how much weight my elderly Golden gained in just one bag of food. Overall, I am very happy with this food and highly recommend it!
