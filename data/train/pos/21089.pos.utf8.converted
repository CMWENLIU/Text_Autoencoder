I Absolutely "LOVE" Swheat Scoop Kitty Litter!!! I have 7 cat's<br /><br />& I have tried every Kind of Cat litter on the Market. I am also very concerned about my Cat's Health & I am into "All Natural/Holistic Food, & Cat litter for my Cats, & Swheat Scoop is all Natural & is absolutely harmless for your cat's....which I "LOVE"!!!!  If You keep at least a 3 inch level of litter in your kitty Litter Box it will not stick to the bottom. It also eliminates odor's when cleaned daily & I should know with 7 kitty's!  Swheat Scoop is the "BEST"!!!!!!!!!!
