We used this for Pancakes Christmas morning. Personally I did not like the bean flour at first, I thought it tasted like soap. My non-gluten-free family, however, LOVED it and *insisted* I use it from now on. They said it was not as gritty as rice flour and had the texture of "real" bread. As for the taste, they didn't know what I was talking about. They loved it.<br /><br />I tried this one again, and snuck some into cookies, then tried the Bob's Red Mill GF Chocolate Cake mix with the bean flour, and it's grown on me. I stand corrected and I am actually kicking myself for not allowing myself to grow a taste for it sooner.<br /><br />It's opened a new world of Gluten free baking for me just when I thought I had it all together with the rice flour.<br />I have gone back now and looked at my "Gluten Free Gourmet" book and have a new eye for the recipes requiring bean flour.<br /><br />It took our stomachs minimal time getting used to the beans, if you catch my drift, but after the first few batches of baked goods (about 3 in a week) we have adjusted.<br /><br />We feel better after using this mix because of the fiber and protein, as opposed to all that starch and empty carbs of the the white rice flour. I don't have to pass round the laxative anymore (a common reality of switching to the GF diet.)<br /><br />Make some pancakes (2 cups of the flour mix, 1 tsp baking soda, an egg, 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 tsp xantham gum--thin with water or milk to desired consistency)and ease yourself into it with butter and syrup.  Of course the flour smells like beans (duh), but the flavor of the beans is mild after it has been cooked.
