Excellent quality product.  The base is well made of good quality materials, it is sturdy and heavy enough so it doesn't move when your cat eats the grass.  It comes with 2 liners, one to catch the excess water (so your grass isn't waterlogged) and a second with 4 sections for each of the 4 types of grasses.  There is also a clear cover to use until the seeds germinate.  It comes with 4 packets of different types of grass seed and soil "plugs" which expand when water is added.  The directions were sort of hidden inside one of the liners.<br /><br />A couple tips, uncover the container once the seeds sprout to prevent mold growth.  My cats wanted to eat the grass before the roots were well established (which meant when they tried to eat it, the root came out with the blade of grass).  Until the roots were established to hold on their own, I cut pieces off with a scissors for them to eat).  To protect it from them, I sometimes loosely covered it with a white plastic grocery bag so light could still reach the plants.  Even with the bag, they were still trying to get to the grass.<br /><br />I let them have the grass planter every couple of days.  They are in cat heaven, this is definitely a treat for them.  At this time of year the grass outside is under 5 feet of snow, so it is nice for me to see something fresh and green too.
