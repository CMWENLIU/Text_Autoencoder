Bought this as a birthday gift for my sister. Nice little decadent treat for her to share on girls night. She said she isn't sharing. She will tell them they can order from Amazon.com if they want some. I have decided that Amazon Prime is the only way to go for gifts. I don"t bother with wrapping paper. No one seems to mind. I haven't had any complaints.
