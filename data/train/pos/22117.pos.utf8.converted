I got this for a good friend's birthday, this being my first online Plant purchase naturally I was petrified that something could go wrong......possibly that the plant would not survive it's long journey intact! But thankfully it was received just in time and in pristine condition looking just like it did in the picture on the site. Living, breathing, lovely......Great gift!!! I will surely do this again!!!
