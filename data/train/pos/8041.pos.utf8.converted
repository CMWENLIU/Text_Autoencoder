Unlike other suppliments and health foods I've got I actually make a point of using this every morning, the protein is just great and my body can definitely tell when I haven't had this, just adding a tablespoon or two to whatever I'm having for breakfast makes me feel so much better, it's quite filling and the feeling lasts for hours.<br />I don't particularly care for the taste it adds to my smoothies so I generally don't add it to those anymore. I really love using it to make berry pancakes, muffins and scones; I just sub out some of the flour and I've got an awesome breakfast (oat flour makes the best hemp baked goods by the way, the two flavors really work nicely together). I've actually gotten in the habbit of subbing out some of the flour in pretty much all the recipes I do. I really love this brand of hemp powder and I will most definitely continue to buy it.
