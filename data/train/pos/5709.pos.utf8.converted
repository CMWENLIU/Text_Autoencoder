I wrote the following review for the Black Tea version, but it also applies to the Redbush which I started drinking since getting pregnant and trying to avoid caffeine:<br /><br />I've been a chai afficionado for a while, and even more so since my trip to Nepal 2 years ago. There I was able to taste chai both in restaurants and in homes, and I have to say that Yogi's chai is the best and most authentic one I've ever tried.<br /><br />I steep it directly in milk every morning, it's a very comforting way to start the day.<br /><br />If you need the caffeine jolt, check out the Black tea chai.
