Bob's Red Mills lentils are my favorite legume. They have a slightly sweet taste and cook very fast- 20-30 minutes. Be careful not to over-cook them because they are very tender and will fall apart, still tasty though. The soup I make calls for sauteed carrots, celery, & onion. Add ham or sausage if you wish. 1 garlic clove, oregano, salt (if you haven't added salty ham), and optional hot pepper flakes. It is very hardy and filling. Caution: Lentils can be difficult for diabetics to handle.
