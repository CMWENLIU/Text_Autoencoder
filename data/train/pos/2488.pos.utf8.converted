Never had black rice before.  Heard about the health benefits (higher anthocyanin antioxidants than found in blueberries) and decided to try it.  Nutty taste, delicious and easy to make.  Turns the water purple when cooked.  Shipment arrived in great condition.  Initially ordered two/one pound bags and liked it so much I ordered 10 one pound bags which arrived yesterday.
