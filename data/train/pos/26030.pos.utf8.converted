This really is the best tuna on the market, hard to find tuna like this in stores and really hard to find tuna in olive oil.  Great for sandwiches and salads but really hard to beat the quality and comparing to the specialty store in my area that sells at twice the price this is a value.  Much better than the Progresso brand we bought a few months ago, just more consistent.
