Grocery store honey, with very few exceptions, is all I'm used to.<br /><br />I gave this product a try based on other's comments and found it to be very, very good.  It's thicker and more flavorful than what most are used to buying at the grocery store, and it doesn't leave one with an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />This will probably be the only honey I'll be consuming in the forseeable future.<br /><br />(a few months later)<br /><br />The plastic bottles this honey comes in are not very reliable, the last shipment had one leak out (came home to a box full of ants) and the quality of the honey I received in the summer was very different form what I had bought in the winter.
