This is fabulous coconut butter.  I was having a hard time with dry skin on elbows and heels, even EXPENSIVE creams and treatments were not resolving the issue.  My doctor (Dr. Michael Platt - check out his book here at Amazon) recommended a daily tablespoon of coconut butter as the remedy - in about 3 weeks problem disappeared!  The long chain fatty acids in the coconut butter fixed me right up.  It's great on toast and comes in multiple flavors (not personally too fond of the Amazon Bliss though.....)
