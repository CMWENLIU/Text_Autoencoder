BOTH of my dogs, American Bulldogs, LOVE the Blue Buffalo Large Breed Chicken & Rice Dry Dog food! My 5 year old female American Bulldog is a picky eater and was initially hesitant when she first tried it. After taking a few sniffs and nibbles, she went for broke.  My 2 year old male American Bulldog likes almost anything so he was not a concern.  The price is reasonable and the vendor ships QUICKLY which are two thumbs up in my book.  This was a great experience all around.
