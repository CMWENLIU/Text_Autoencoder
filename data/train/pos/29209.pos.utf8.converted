This kelp actually TASTES GOOD! I've tried the Starwest Botanicals organic kelp (Ascophyllum nodosum species from Canada) and it was dry, unpleasant and chalky but this organic Laminaria digitata species actually tastes like sea salt and is super yummy on its own or mixed into savory dishes!<br /><br />Also, this acts as an excellent, natural thickener which I put in my cat's moist food with pumpkin and extra water and this kelp thickens it up and gives it a nicer texture for his consumption (and it is also supposed to help constipation because of the naturally occurring alginate).<br /><br />I've also tried this as a facial mask mixed with a little water and raw honey and it is very soothing and moisturizing.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be my "go to" kelp from now on! Very high quality and the serving suggestion and iodine information [as another reviewer stated] is on the back of the package.<br /><br />For you folks owned by cats: From a different brand of organic kelp for pets, I found the serving size for cats is 1/8 teaspoon a day.
