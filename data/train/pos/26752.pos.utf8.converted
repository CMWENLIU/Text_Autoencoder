I expected the Blood Orange infused oil to be a bright red. It was not, so I wonderd if it would have much flavor. What a surprise when I tasted it. The flavor of orange was really intense. It is perfect in honey orange salad dressing or just drizzled on fish or chicken for amazing flavor. I will buy this product again.
