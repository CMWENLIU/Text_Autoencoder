I received as a Christmas gift.  Had never heard of it, but my son just KNEW I'd love it.  Set-up was very quick.  Easy to follow instructions with pics.  All the herbs sprouted in the time frame printed on the pod.  (Beware the basil placement as it LEAPS ahead of the rest - perhaps a side spot vs center where it hogs all the light).  I month later, I have LOADS of herbs, some of which I'm using and some that I'm drying for later use.  You need to top off the water to the fill line and add the provided nutrient tabs every other week.  (A light comes on to warn you).  You can program the light to give your plants the needed 8 hrs of dark.  The grow light is VERY bright, so I suggest choosing your home placement carefully.  We opted for the bottom of the basement stairs.<br /><br />We can't wait to try the other kits.
