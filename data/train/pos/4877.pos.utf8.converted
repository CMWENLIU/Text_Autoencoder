This pumpkin spice tea makes a great pitcher of Iced Tea, with a bit of Truvia or Splenda to sweeten it.  The only down side is I couldn't find it after the fall in my area, but now that I found amazon has it, I've got it on a subscription so I'll be sure to have plenty!<br /><br />Oh, and if you will only use a given flavor occasionally, Bigelow is the way to go, since each Tea Bag is individually foil wrapped to keep it fresh.
