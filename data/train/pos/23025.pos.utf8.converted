i was really surprised when i tried this - it tastes amazingly close to real eggnog, even when i used nonfat dry milk. it has exactly the same texture as real eggnog, and the flavor is very good. a fantastic bonus is that it has zero fat, but you'd never know it when you drink it - you'd swear it was the real thing. if you like eggnog as i do, you have to try this.
