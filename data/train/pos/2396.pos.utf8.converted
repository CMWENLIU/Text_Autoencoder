I have two cats and a puppy and after seeing how well my new puppy was doing on Orijen, I decided to switch my cats off of Iams and onto the good stuff. One of my cats has a big weight problem, has hot spots all down her back, sheds constantly and was overall a very unhealthy cat. Two weeks after switching them to Orijen my unhealthy cat's hot spots COMPLETELY disapeared, her shedding has practically vanished (she's a long haired cat), and she has MUCH more energy and I haven't even finished cycling them off of the old food (currently using half orijen and half Iams). I've noticed a big difference on the volume and firmness of their stool as well. I can't recommend this food enough. It has probably added years onto my formerly unhealthy cat's lifespan.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this product (probably due to the price), please at least buy a small bag to try and I guarantee that you will notice a big difference in your pet's health and lifestyle, especially if they have any food related allergies.<br /><br />The grocery store brands may be cheaper, but how healthy and content would you be if you only ate grapenuts every meal for the rest of your life?
