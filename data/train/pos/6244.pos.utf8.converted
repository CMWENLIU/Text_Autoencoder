Most people mention to me that this coffee tastes 'very good' and 'smooth'. Most comment on the noticeable energy and stamina that day after just one cup. Some have lost weight and most experience detoxification within one week. If you have health issues or ailments, you may want to search-engine 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease' you can think of, to find out more. You will find many brands of 'healthy coffee' out there-in my opinion this brand and this flavour (latte) tastes the best. But I highly recommend you taste the product and see what it can do for YOU. Every 'body' is different. I'm just one person, but for me, this brand has positively affected my: blood pressure, sugar cravings, mood, flexibility, migraines/headaches, skin, allergies [prone to sinus allergies]. I am happy to report that I have NEVER encountered: jitters, crash, burning stomach, nor nausea with this coffee (as was the case with my previous habit of 3 to 4 cups a day of 'regular' coffee). Go to pubmed, answers, reishi to learn even more about Ganoderma. This LATTE flavor of OG healthy coffee includes creamer & sugar in a perfect mix-no need to add anything else. It is important to note that 8 ounces of hot water added to the latte sachet contents in your favorite mug is the best way to experience it. [for the MOCHA & HOT CHOCOLATE, I recommend 8 oz. of hot water as well].
