This is definitely a tea that stands alone.  This tea is from a bitter, cooling-type herb. Good for problems with digestion, this tea does whatever is necessary to get your GI system back in order. Do not steep too long and remove the tea bag.  Sip slowly and enjoy the roasted flavor of this calming and detoxifying drink.
