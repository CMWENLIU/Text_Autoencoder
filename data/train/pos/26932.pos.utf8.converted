I have been living in California for 30 years now, but never forgot the coffee my Mom used to fix when I was a kid in New Orleans, half coffee & Chicory and half boiled cows milk, what the french call Cafe A'Lait.  Of course I also remember drinking that same coffee and stuffing down biegnets at the Cafe DuMonde and the Morning Call in the French Quarter.  Now being in California this long you tend to get Californicated, you know, premium wines, exotic coffee beans, etc., etc.  But when I happened on the old familiar can of CDM on Amazon I thought, what the heck, lets see if it brings back any memories, so I ordered a few cans.  Am I glad I did.  Not only did it bring back memories, but it made me realize that I would have never have found the taste I had been looking for in all those exotic beans I bought because there is no coffe bean in the world that can match the wonderfully strong and complex body of Coffee and Chicory.  Probably not for everyone, but absolutely indespensible for us old New Orleans boys.
