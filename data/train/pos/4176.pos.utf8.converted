My husband and I love this stuff!  We tried it for the first time about 10 years ago at a small steakhouse in central California.  We have kept it in our fridge ever since.  We used to be able to buy it in the grocery stores in California, but since moving to Arizona we now purchase it online.  We love it with grilled New York steaks.
