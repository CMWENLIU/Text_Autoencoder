Marked decrease in vomiting in our 12 year old Siamese neutered male.<br /><br />I thought he had some illness, or something incurable.  Royal Canin food alone cured it.<br /><br />I am certain, as well, that the malady started when the contaminated Chinese pet food scare occurred as the vomiting started at that time and we were originally advised by a pet store owner to switch to Canin.  The store went out of business and we then cast about and found it at Amazon at a great price.<br /><br />I am glad we did.<br /><br />Highly recommend
