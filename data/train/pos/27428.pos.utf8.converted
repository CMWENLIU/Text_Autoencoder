I bought some Vegemite to send to friends in Chicago as part of an 'Aussie' gift package to send with my daughter who was staying with them when she came to the US.  For Australians, Vegemite on toast is regarded as one of life's staples.  We eat it for breakfast, after-school snacks and late night suppers.  It's a cure-all when we're sick and great when we're hungover and can't face anything else. One note of caution - Vegemite is not designed to be spread thickly on toast - it has to be spread in a very thin, even layer, otherwise, it's unpalatable. Enjoy!
