These cookies are absolutely delicious and SO addictive!!!  I wasn't as disappointed with Amazon's shipping as others were- I'd say 80% of the cookies were in 'mint' condition (sorry about the pun) and only a couple that were broken in half.  They are dated for 11 monthes from now, which is wonderful.  Overall these are an awesome treat and a great buy!
