We just tried the buffalo ribeye and filet for dinner.  Grilled them for about 15 minutes, and they turned out beautifully.  My husband said it was the best steak he's ever had in his life.  I'm usually not a big fan of steak myself, but the filet was scrumptious.  Haven't had a chance to try the burgers yet, but I am definitely looking forward to it.
