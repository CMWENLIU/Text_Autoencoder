I bought these because I was impressed by their low sodium levels, but I expected that they'd need "doctoring" to be palatable.  Wrong!  These soups are all wonderful as packaged.  They're a great staple to have on hand for a quick and easy meal, but they can also be thrown in a slow cooker to be ready when you come home.
