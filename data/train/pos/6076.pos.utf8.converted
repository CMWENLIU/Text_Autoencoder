When I bought bubble gum cigarettes I wish someone had left a review. I ordered a lot of candy cigarettes which those are just sticks of sugar. These are the ones I remembered buying from the ice cream truck when I was child. I bought these for my nephews birthday as party favors and they were a great success. The kids couldn't believe if you blow in them they blow smoke out the other end. The gum really does taste good too. If you remember these cigarettes I highly recommend them, if you don't remember them you should try them to.
