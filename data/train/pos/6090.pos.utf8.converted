I don't actually eat the macaroni and cheese in our house.  The kids do.  In an effort to improve the quality of life for all, I've been gradually switching us over to natural, organic, and whole grain products.  Macaroni and cheese finally got my attention.  We've tried other brands, but the kids really say this is the best and is far better than the Kraft.  What else can I say?  I don't feel as guilty, they still get what they want.  Life is good.
