These nectarines are unsulphured and so they are a little more chewy that the sulphured ones, but that's how I like them!  They are so full of flavor my mouth waters just thinking about them.  They taste just as wonderful as a fresh tree picked nectarine only they have that wonderful chewy texture of dried fruit!  My whole family (even the picky eaters) LOVE them!
