I started to panic when I read the comment from someone about BPA in the lid of EB glass baby jar foods. I make most of my baby food at home, but when on the road this is such an easy option. I called the company right away to get the facts. I was so relieved to hear that there are no BPA's that come into contact with the baby food. There are two layers of plastic in the lid and the layer that touches the baby food does NOT contain BPA. The layer in between has small traces of it, but their research has shown that it does not leech into the food. I personally feel comfortable with this and am glad I can still support this company.
