For three years I've been baking whole wheat sourdough bread and I add this to the flour.  It beefs up the gluten a bit and gives the bread great crumb and texture.  Adding gluten powder to the dough and baking in a steamy oven makes my bread look and taste like a professional made it.<br /><br />If you're looking for little ways to cut your salt intake, know that you can reduce the salt in your recipe without fear of the gluten strands collapsing.<br /><br />Altogether I've baked breads for over 20 years.  I don't know how I did it without this stuff.  And you don't have to buy bread flour.  Adding gluten powder to all-purpose flour basically turns it into bread flour, and this little box takes up a lot less space than yet another bag of flour.<br /><br />Hodgson Mill always has fine quality in this product.  If you want to bake yeast breads, buy this!
