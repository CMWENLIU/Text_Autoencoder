Yes, there is a little gritty texture, but it reminds me of the texture of oatmeal cookie dough or some sort of dough where the sugar is granulated.  This is delicious.  Yes, some of the raisins have sunk to the bottom.  Buy some raisins and put them on your spoon.<br /><br />This is a good product, a good company, and Amazon has a good price.  If you are unsure if you want six jars, spend the extra money at the grocery store (walmart even carries a couple of flavors and even some of the single serve packets) and see if it is your bag.  It is my bag.  Try it on some apples or pears.... Yum.  :)
