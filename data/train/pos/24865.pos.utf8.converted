Clearly a high-end product and exactly as advertised. Four individual fully sealed and labeled plastic bags within a outer cardboard carton with printed graphics and text. The beans are consistent in size and color, with no observable remnants or contaminants, and odorless. Labeled "Certified Organic by QAI", "Product of the USA" and "USDA Organic". Cooking instructions, various uses, website and other useful information is provided.<br />Our intended use is to make Japanese Natto, which is a fermented form, and not particularly appealing unless you know and love traditional Japanese food. We are in the food distribution business in Japan and here in Hawaii. Even though Soy Beans are grown on our island, we needed a very high quality ingredient to prepare Natto correctly which wasn't obtainable here. My wife, who is from Shizuoka Prefecture, thinks these beans are premium, and we spent all afternoon yesterday preparing a full 24oz/680g package for controlled fermentation overnight. While the finishing process outcome will be to our discretion, the staple product (the beans), are unquestionably high-end. And the price was excellent. The outer carton has "Sell By 04-16-2014" and is also perforated for use as a retail display.<br />I think we'll be buying LOTS more of this product.<br />Aloha,  John
