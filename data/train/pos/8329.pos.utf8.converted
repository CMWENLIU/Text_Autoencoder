The Ginger chews by the Ginger People are my favorite candies of all time! These are the Ginger People's pure Ginger candies and they are of excellent quality. They are perfect if you like really spicy candies. These candies are similar to the "See's" brand Crystallized Ginger and I feel that the quality is about the same as "See's". Unlike the See's brand, these do not have a chocolate coating which is good if you don't really like chocolate.<br /><br />I love the spicy, chewy flavor. It's so hard to find delicious Ginger foods and candies (except online) and I'm so happy that Amazon started carrying these products by the Ginger people.<br /><br />These are great for nausea, too.<br /><br />Great for travel sickness, great for morning sickness, and just great taste when you want a really spicy candy. I love them! The pilots use them.<br /><br />Recommended! But if you don't want something SO spicy, I recommend that you start out with the Ginger People ginger chews first. If you like these, you can graduate up to the Crystallized ginger. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV60W">The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews, 4.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>
