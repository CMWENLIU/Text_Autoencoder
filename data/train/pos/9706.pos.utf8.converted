I love the sugar free licorice and order them frequently.  This last order, the regular ones were sent, not the sugar free.  I contacted Amazon and they said that they would send me the sugar free ones without charge.  That was a couple of weeks ago and I have not recieved them yet.<br /><br />Susan
