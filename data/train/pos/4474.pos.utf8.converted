This is the same product that I used to buy from the grocery store in little 9+ ounce cans.  It makes a delicious latte with hot water.  The price is certainly less than the grocery store charged, and the quality is excellent.  I'm on my second two pound pouch now, and the flavor is fantastic.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes tea and spices.  The spicing is light and not overpowering.  There is a slightly chalky taste at the end of the cup, I'm not sure why.  It leaves a white residue in the cup sometimes, which can be alleviated by swirling the cup when drinking the last few sips.  It is also good when cooled and poured over ice.  A perfect drink at the end of a long winter's day.
