I tried this based on my mother-in-law's recommendation. This milk powder is nothing like the nonfat milk powder that they sell at most grocery stores. You know what I'm talking about--the kind that tastes like powdered milk. Blech. This one is so rich and delicious. You have to use a lot of it to make a single glass, so it doesn't last very long. This is also great to keep at the office to use in your coffee where it's not always practical to keep a carton of milk.<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how good this milk is.  This may sound strangely random, but when I first made a glass, I noticed my dogs intensely staring at me, hoping I'd give them some.  So I did.  They absolutely love it, too. They reacted to it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world.  They don't even react that way to steak. My husband even noticed and commented it's like doggie crack. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />It's also nice that you can control the richness of it by adding more or less powder.  I also tried the Nestle Nido milk powder that I got as a sample, and it is just as good.
