This stuff is truly amazing...very tasty, indeed! The corned beef was tender and good flavored, without being too salty. The potatoes were billed as reconstituted, but I couldn't tell. Overall, the hash was quite light in texture, as advertised. I'm assuming that half a can is a serving...they're not saying. The stats in grams are pretty darned impressive: 3 saturated fat, 6 fiber, 15 protein, and 5 sugar. Try throwing a can of this hash into a large cast-iron skillet, add some diced pickled beets and yellow onion, and stir-fry with a ration of butter. Congrats, you've now made a fairly respectable "red-flannel hash"!
