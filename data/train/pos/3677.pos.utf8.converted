Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.
