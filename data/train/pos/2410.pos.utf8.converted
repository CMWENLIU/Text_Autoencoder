Everyone needs to read about safflower oil and the CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) it contains.  Safflower oil greatly assists in the loss of belly fat, combined with a healthy diet and exercise routine.  I had plateaud at around the low 150's for about 6 months. I thought this was where my body really wanted to be, and I should just make my peace with it. Then I discovered the Shangri-La Diet and then picked safflower oil.  In 2 weeks I dropped 6 pounds and it's still falling like a rock. Mind you, I've continued my well-balanced diet and my high intensity exercise routine 3-4 days a week. I haven't changed anything else about my lifestyle. Take one tablespoon in the afternoon as your mid-afternoon "snack" and then one tablespoon at night before bed, and wash it down with water. It's been a true lifesaver.  I have also read about taking CLA pills, but it would be better (and cheaper) to go for the source.
