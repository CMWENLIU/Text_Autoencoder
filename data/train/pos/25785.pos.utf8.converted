I bought the PB2 & PB2 chocolate...and both are completely wonderful! I was astounded by how tasty these 2 products are. I add peanut butter to protein powders and yogurts,etc., but the calorie content is often too high in total for the snack. PB2 allows me to enjoy the peanut butter along with my snack for a fraction of the calories:  There is no sacrifice of taste!  It does not have the thick consistency of regular peanut butter but the taste is there so it is wonderful to add to items.  It was also tasty by the spoonful!  Excellent!
