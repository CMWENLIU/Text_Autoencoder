You will not eat another brand after you taste this oil!  I am ruined for life.  And I thought my taste buds were pretty refined, but no!  Not until I tried this oil.  Other olive oils actually taste rancid compared to this.  I have turned my family and friends into converts.  Sooo yummy! I use it as a hair conditioner and skin conditioner as well.  You will absolutely love it!  And no I do not work for the company.
