"There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea." -Henry James, Portrait of a Lady<br /><br />This "English Breakfast" style tea is quite satisfying and has a darker color than most teas I've made. "Awake" will definitely encourage you to feel invigorated and inspired.<br /><br />I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. I use my coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the loose tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tealeaves.<br /><br />When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas. Some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder.<br /><br />Of all the black teas I've tried, Awake truly will keep you AWAKE. When I'm in the mood to write, this tea can jumpstart a very productive day.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
