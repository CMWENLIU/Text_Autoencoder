My Husband and I love this coffee!  It has a really nice flavor if you like a robust coffee without the bitterness. My DH says it reminds him of expresso when you make it on the stove (not from an expresso machine)and he says of all the different K-cup coffees (and we have tried alot of them) this is the only one he doesn't get tired of and could drink everyday and I agree with him!
