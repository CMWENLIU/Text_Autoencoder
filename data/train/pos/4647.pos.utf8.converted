I am eating this right now with much enjoyment. This is not a 5-* item for everybody, but if you like grape nuts (the hemp nuts have similar flavor and texture), almonds, chocolate, coffee, and a little sweetness from dried fruit, this is a healthy and filling snack that is definitely worth trying!
