I've traveled into NYC to the flower district, and shopped in Bonzai shops, and picked up pretty good Bonzai over the years.  NONE have compared to the quality and beauty of the bonzai from this source.<br /><br />The people I gave these to as gifts were blown away.<br /><br />Not only were they good strong specimens, they were beautifully shaped and pruned.  These are not just small cuttings stuck in the ground and allowed to grow until mature enough to ship.  They are crafted for beauty.<br /><br />Buy them here, and you will be truly pleased.
