Nestle Nido made in Chile Ingredients, Whole milk, soy Lecithin ( emulsification properties ), Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3. I did a three milk blind taste test. I mixed nonfat milk from a large country wide grocery store chain by the directions, Mixed Nestle Nido from Chile by the directions, and bought a pint of whole milk from a country wide dairy. I left the milks in the fridge over night in uncoverd identical marked glasses . This was to give them time to rest. The next day a friend blindfolded me and the test began. First a whole milk that was very good. Washed mouth and the second milk was nonfat. Easy pick taste like most nonfat powderd milk. Washed mouth. Tried third glass and was stumped. I sipped both whole milks and could tell one was fresher. I picked the fresher as the store bought and was wrong. The best was Nido from Chile. I have had two years chef prep and years cooking in the field. It is my assumption that the store bought had picked up flavor from the carton. I will keep Nestle Nido from chile as a back up and for emergency stock. I also boiled both whole milks and found the Nido performs as well as store bought. One thing to remember is to make sure the country Nido comes from does not add sugers or other flavorings to cover a bad product. Pricey but good for emergency or every day use if you through out spoiled milk.
