This is an awesome cheesecake.  I ordered it to serve for dessert at Easter (because I'm too lazy to make dessert) and it was just awesome.  Some people couldn't wait for it to go from the frozen state (I froze it when I got it) and it still was just as creamy and good as when it thawed.  Having a bunch of flavors was great and one was just as good as the next.  I would definitely order this again and might have to since I am going to eat the last slice today!
