The Baja Chipotle is a great marinade. It took my meat to a whole new level. I am very sensitive when it comes to my meat and when I put the meat in my mouth it needs to explode... with flavor.<br /><br />One drawback. It did play a small role in my divorce. No, no, don't worry about me, all I need is my Lawry's Baja Chipotle and I am a satisfied man.<br />After soaking in marinade (minimum 6 1/2 hours under close observation and massage) I like to put a little in a squirt gun mixed with water. A little squirt here and there during the grilling process brings out the magic in your meat.<br /><br />My wife thought she was being playful when she squirted me with the hose as I was cooking. DO NOT mess with a meat master when he is in the grilling zone. That is like messing with Yoda while he is meditating. Someone going to get hurt. A lesson must be taught at this point. Negative reinforcement for bad behavior. I hit her with the super soaker 6000, fully pumped, primed with Lawry's Baja Chipotle. Yoda would have been proud.<br />I had no idea the effect this would have on our german shepard Trixie. Trixie was on her like a starving lion on a Wildebeest. My wife ran down the driveway where two more dogs appeared out of nowhere. I watched in awe at this developing train wreck. Unable to move. Couldn't move anyway until my meat was properly removed from the grill. Priorities my friends.<br /><br />I heard screaming, possibly my name mixed with a few curse words. She was headed down the street with four dogs now in tow. How am I supposed to help her if she runs away from me. Seriously, she calls me the stupid one. I decided to take the truck.<br />I pulled up along side of the galloping herd and gave her the hand signal to jump in the back. Apparently I overestimated her fitness ability. She hit the side of the truck like a slab of beef. Yes, more curse words. I even heard them over the blaring radio. The dogs were on her like sharks on chum.<br /><br />Can you believe the judge took her side after hearing the story. All I got out of the divorce was the grill, super soaker 6000, and of course the dog.<br /><br />Lawry's Baja Chipotle is a great marinade, don't squirt on spouse, and just your dog lick it off, don't run and scream like a wounded wildebeest. Last note. Dogs love Lawry's Baja Chipotle but cleaning up dog diarrhea is a horrible way to spend an afternoon. Don't feed to animals.
