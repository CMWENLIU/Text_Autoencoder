I purchased this whole grain teff on a special deal here on Amazon, without having tried it previously or having any idea if I'd like it, but so far I'm loving it.<br /><br />I haven't tried the recipes on the back of the package yet for teff porridge or teff pudding (they look very tasty, but require longer stove-top cooking and more attention than I usually want to invest unless I've already tried the result and know for a fact that it's worth the time and trouble).<br /><br />However, when I added a generous sprinkling of teff to a bowl of McCann's Quick & Easy steel-cut Irish oats before adding the boiling water and following the microwave directions on that package, the result was spectacularly good (much better than the oats alone, even when cooked with my usual cinnamon, dried fruits, and nuts).<br /><br />And then I tried 'blooming' a half-cup of teff in about a cup of boiling water (I ended up simmering it in the microwave for a few minutes, since I was impatient) and stirring that into a standard pancake recipe (using a generic reduced-fat baking mix).  The pancake batter looked thin and a little gloppy, but they cooked up beautifully and had a wonderful, nutty (but not heavy) taste.  After I made the first few pancakes, I didn't even bother dropping frozen wild blueberries onto the pancake batter anymore, since the teff made the pancakes tasty all alone.  The texture of the pancakes was light, but spongy, and they're just as good warmed up in the microwave a few days later.<br /><br />One of these days I'll work up the nerve to try cooking the teff all alone, but in the meantime I'm adding it to other cooked or baked products at every opportunity, and I haven't been disappointed in the result yet.
