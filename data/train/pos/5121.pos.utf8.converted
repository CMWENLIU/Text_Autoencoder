Great product, and so wonderful to know it comes from pasture grazed and humanely treated cows. Got this for the health benefits for myself, and to make gelatin treats for my kids. So far everything has been a huge hit (with kids and adults) Fruit juice gelatin squares, mouse, coconut panna cottas.
