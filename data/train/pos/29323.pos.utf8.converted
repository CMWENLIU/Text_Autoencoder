I am slightly confused by the two previous reviews of this tea, which state that it is not flavoured.  I was introduced to this tea by two friends from St. Petersburg who gave me an open box during the course of a visit.  This is not simply a black tea, it is a spiced tea similar to Earl Grey.  The paradox is that I am nto an Earl Grey lover - my tea preferences tend more towards Assam or Lapsang Souchong.  However for me this rea gets that extra taste just right.  It's very pricy for me to order this for delivery to the UK, but I do that, so take that as a concrete indication of my appreciation.  If you like Earl Grey, try this.
