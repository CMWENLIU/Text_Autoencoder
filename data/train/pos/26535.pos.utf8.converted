My toy poodles are older now and some are losing teeth so I have to go to canned dog food to supplement their Bil-Jac. They really loved the Happy Hips and Canidae Dog Food and they are great but  I was looking for something as good for them but also a little more cost effective since I have so many poodles...11 of them!  Good thing they are well mannered and trained!<br /><br /> A case of 24 cans of "CS For The DLS"  is the price of most cases of 12 cans with other brands. The ingredients are top notch with this one too. [...]<br /><br />One of my tinniest ones, Baby Doll,  gets so excited  and lets out one big yelp whenever we pop open the top tab then she does this little dance around on her back two feet.  It is so cute! I also like that these cans have the pop top lid so I do not have to use the can opener.  I know, the epitome of laziness!  It is a nice feature though.<br /><br />The 4-5 lb. dogs get mostly all can dog food now as their teeth are sooo little.  This canned dog food is specially formulated for seniors but I would guess from reading the ingredients, it could be for all ages. does not have lots of watery juice to take up space but more of a soft/solid form. My larger dogs, up to 12 lbs get mostly the  Bil-Jac mixed with canned.  I mix about half a can with a little water to their Bil-Jac dry food and they graze and eat it up as they feel like it.  This keeps them in shape. They tend not to over eat when they know food is always available. I have always fed my dogs this way and it has always worked. I am going to add glucosamine to it for their hips as a few have problems with hips at their old age.  It is easy to do, just google correct dosage for them then crumble pills and add. Since I have so many dogs, I mix (hide) all meds in a teaspoon with the canned dog food and give it to them individually.<br /><br />I would also like to say that if you have small dogs and /or dogs with problem with their teeth, it is difficult for them to chew the harder kibble. If this happens they will just quit eating except when absolutely necessary and do harm to their health due to tooth pain. Bil-Jac is the only food I have found in dry form with the tiny kibbles which are easily crumbled. There are also dog aspirin formulas you can add, sneak in, to canned food for pain. Don't use unbuffered aspirin for dogs as it is hard on their stomachs. I also add Dr. Katz's water additive to prevent and help tooth and gum problems.<br /><br />My dogs are on an antibiotic regimen ounce a month, first 10 days of month, to help prevent infection from gum disease.  They also have allergies. I was using Benedryl ( at Vet's recommendation) but after researching Zyrtec (generic form), for dogs, I am using that and it works wonders for their allergies. All of the a things I give my dogs are  available on Amazon for a fraction of the price at the drug store.<br /><br /> Please, if you are going to use Benedryl , Zyrtec or any other medication on your dog and cannot afford to go to to the vet, research it completely before doing so and make sure you have the dosage down carefully so you do not harm, or even kill, your pet. It is a very serious undertaking to medicate your dog on your own but can be of tremendous benefit to your pet if you know what you are doing, so research, research, research before doing it!<br /><br />You may ask why I don't take my dogs to the vet for tooth cleaning.  Well, their  are several reasons; one the cost, of course, but the most important is that I do not want my little ones subjected to anesthesia once a year as it is dangerous, hard on their hearts and can cause other problems and even death.  I just make sure they are as pain free and as comfortable as possible in their later years, now.<br /><br />Sorry, I got a little side-tracked!<br /><br />Anyway, I highly recommend this dog food.  I am grateful the price is so reasonable so I can afford to feed my dogs this good food.<br /><br />Blessings!
