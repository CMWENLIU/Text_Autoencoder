I have purchased Talking Rain from Costco for years and now they no longer carry it.  For all of you who are looking for a fruit flavored carbinated drink, all natural and with NO sugar......THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU!! Best product to come on the market in a LONG time and I am amazed that Costco no longer carries it.
