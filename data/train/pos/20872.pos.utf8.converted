Remember how we made popcorn years ago?  You'd pour a little vegetable oil in a pan, heat it up, and add just enough kernels to cover the bottom.  Put on the lid and shake periodically.  THIS POPCORN TASTES LIKE THAT!  It is not a "buttery" flavor.  I usually add a little extra salt.  The 100 calorie format makes it perfect for a snack.
