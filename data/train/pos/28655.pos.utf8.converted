I ordered this honey for my mother, and she loves it. She spreads it on toast.  I tried it and found the taste pleasant and sweet. I think it took a few weeks to receive, and it was packaged neatly and was not damaged or spilled as mentioned in the reviews of another Manuka Honey brand. I plan to order another jar of this honey today.
