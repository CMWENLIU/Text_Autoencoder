One night, a few weeks ago, a friend of mine told me a story about eating hot homemade biscuits topped with sorghum molasses. As a California native, I had never heard about this "mystery" molasses so in a spur-of-the-moment Amazon shopping "trip", I found this sampler and without hesitation, I used the 1-click ordering and then started counting down the days. The box arrived the next week, well packed to avoid breakage. Included were 3 jars of sorghum and a hand written thank you note that I thought was the coolest thing. Who does that these days? Anyhow, I'm not at all an expert sorghum taste-tester but my friend certainly seemed to be. I did try a bit on a piece of bacon on the day my friend came to pick up the goods and found it to be the perfect amount of sweetness. Its sweetness is between regular molasses and honey...it was "just right". We've not had the chance to get together for a true sorghum breakfast, so I've yet to try the magical combination of hot biscuits topped with sorghum. I did ask if it was what he remembered as a child, and he's certain that it is...and is now researching recipes to use it in. Maybe one day I'll get some hot biscuits from him!! LOL<br /><br />Overall we were really happy with the product and delivery...even more pleasantly surprised by the hand written thank you letter. Awesome!!! And delicious!
