I just received my coconut oil today and I must say it is wonderful. Right now I am eating a piece of natural whole wheat toast with this coconut oil slathered on drizzled with honey; what a sweet treat. This is my first time ordering coconut oil from this seller and it won't be my last. This coconut oil has a light coconut taste and smell, I for one felt I was taken a tropical ride to the islands. I also tried the coconut oil on my face, the very moment my package arrived and boy was I in for a shock! My face instantly felt smooth, moisturized, calm, and I believe it gave me an instant glow,plus I tried it in my hair it was instantly hydrated and shiny! Next, I am going to try this in my homemade banana nut bread, plus count less other foods. This coconut oil is indeed a winner; a winner for my body, skin, and anyone who dares to try it. I dare anyone to try this product and you will be happy you did. Much love and blessings to all who make this product!
