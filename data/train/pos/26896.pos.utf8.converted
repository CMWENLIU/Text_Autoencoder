I have never been outside the U.S. and I don't think I have a drop of British or Australian blood in me, but I love both Marmite and Vegemite, and get both of them at World Market (formerly known as Cost Plus World Market) for about $5 a jar. Marmite is more syrupy and salty than Vegemite / Vegemite is more solid and less salty (but still quite salty) than Marmite. VEGANS TAKE NOTE : both are good sources of vegan B vitamins, but Vegemite lacks the crucial B12 and Marmite HAS B12.
