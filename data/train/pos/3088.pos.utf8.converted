This is the best coffee-based energy drink. It has tons of caffeine (155 mg), only 50 calories, and no dairy. If you don't like espresso, this isn't for you, but if you hate the sugared-up taste of other energy drinks, check it out.<br /><br />The product description is inaccurate--there's no milk or cream in this.
