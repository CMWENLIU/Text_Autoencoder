I cook a lot with paprika and I've found a great variance in quality over the years. Cheaper ones are more bland and have no heat, almost as though they are cut with some other spice. With better quality paprika, however, you can actually use less and get greater flavor and heat.<br /><br />And this was clearly good paprika in spite of my taking the risk of buying  it on the Internet. I bought it for the price but was surprised at the quality.<br /><br />if you like some heat in your food, paprika is the perfect spice to make it happen.  if you like smoky flavors such as chipotle or smoked salt, smoked paprika is even better. It adds an earthiness with the heat and the flavor to compliment the Southwest flavors I love.<br /><br />The flavors come through, it truly has a smoky flavor profile, and it has just the right touch of heat.<br /><br />Does everyone need 80 oz?  maybe not. but we use it enough that it's actually far cheaper for us to buy it this way. As a Mexican food lover, I make room in the pantry!
