I would not recommend trying to eat this by itself, but it mixes nicely with everything and is good on cereal. It reminds me of malt powder, but with add some added bitterness. It has fabulous nutrient content. I recommend it completely. There is also something to consider when purchasing all types food products - it is important for more people to support companies who are committed to socially and environmentally responsible business practices, and this company is one of them.
