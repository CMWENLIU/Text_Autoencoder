First off, top notch customer service- there's a personal touch that's rarely seen in on-line purchasing!  Please keep it up!<br /><br />Now for the goods: These vanilla beans are a fantastic value.  Seriously, I wasn't expecting much- I was hopeful given the other reviews- but I've learned some hard lessons to not expect such high standards of quality- especially when it comes to gourmand items-  These beans are even superior to those I can get from my local provider (at three times the cost, mind you.)  I've even ordered online from two other sources (one recommended by Martha Stewart, lol)- and these beans are plumper and more supple than those other pricier providers.  (Plump and supple- always a good thing.)<br /><br />If you're on the fence- I urge you to go for it.  You owe it to your recipes to use quality indredients.  You will not be disappointed.  I know I'm not.<br /><br />Thank you kindly!<br /><br />UPDATE: October 2010-<br />Just want to add, that it's now almost 3 years since my original review- and I have ordered dozens of beans from JR since this first order, and never have I been disappointed with the product received.  I stand firmly behind my five star mark.<br />Thanks so much!
