I've purchased lots of yeast over the years, and many times the taste is so distasteful that it's unfit to eat. This yeast is great because it has a very good taste. I certainly will buy this yeast again. I am probably in the minority here, but I actually like to eat this yeast by the spoonful as a snack.
