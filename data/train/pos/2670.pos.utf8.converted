I love stroopwafels, but have a hard time finding a store that sells them where I live.  I ordered these when I was really craving them, and they are delicious--nice crispy cookie with good chewy caramel filling that melts down perfectly with the steam of some hot tea.  They did not last long in my family.  Additionally, the reusable shopping bag I purchased is roomy and durable.
