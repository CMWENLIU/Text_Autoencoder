This is one of few organic,fair trade non-alkaline processed cocoa powders I've found, and Rapunzel is way more reasonable than some of its gourmet competitors .. I hope that doesn't mean they'll raise their prices! I tasted it side-by-side with a similar organic product I'd been using, which was alkaline processed, and you CAN tell the difference .. Rapunzel tasted better!
