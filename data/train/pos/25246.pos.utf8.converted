I started my dogs on these Dentastix and they really made a difference in their teeth, plus they loved them.  Then our local Walmart stopped carrying them.  I found them on Amazon for the same price as Walmart, plus no tax or shipping.  Having to buy in bulk was no problem since two dogs get one each daily so I figured it would be about six to eight weeks worth.  I have been very pleased with Dentastix.  As usual, Amazon.com came through.
