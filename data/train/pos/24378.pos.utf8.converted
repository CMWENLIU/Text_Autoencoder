Wow! Just like the old Lemon Coolers. Flavor is very much the same as I remember. They have a little yellow color to them, Lemon Coolers used be all white, this is the only difference I recognize. I have been looking for these for the longest time and am so happy. The Girl Scouts had an acceptable replacement a few years back but not any more. I am not a huge cookie afficiando but for some reason these hit the spot. I have almost finished the original order of 6 boxes, and have turned a friend into a fan as well. As  a slim person there aren't many if any other things I can eat a box of, but darn these things are great and almost addictive! Please give them a try, I hope they continue to make them!
