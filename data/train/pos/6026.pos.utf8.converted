I bought this wheat gluten primarily to make seitan with, and I've had excellent results in the batch that I made. I flavored the gluten mix with various spices, simmered it in a ginger/soy sauce broth and sliced it into smaller pieces. The seitan came out great -- both when I pan-fried it or even just used it "raw" in a vegetable stir-fry. I've also used this gluten as an additive to my flour mix for bread-making, and it definitely results in a better loaf when added to the flour mix. So, all-in-all, this is good stuff. If it was organic, it would be the icing on the cake.
