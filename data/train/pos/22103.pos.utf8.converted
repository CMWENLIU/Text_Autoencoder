I've been dieting for just over a year, using a low-carb diet, with major success.  Once I completed the first phase, I've kept my eye out for great low-carb products.  This is among the best.  I tried a different chocolate syrup before which was terrible (I'll refrain from naming names).  I was reluctant to try another one, but I'd developed a good feeling about Walden Farms and decided to try it.  Yummy!!!  It exceeded my expectations and then some!  I enjoy low-carb ice cream sometimes, and I always have to have my chocolate syrup.  On ice cream, it hardens just a bit from the cold, which I like.  I've used it in other ways with good results, but mostly on ice cream.<br /><br />NO calories?  C'mon, it has to have just a few.  But even if it has 10 calories or so, that's unreal.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!
