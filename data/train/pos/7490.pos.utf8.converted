Unlike most bottles of 'hot sauce' Tiger Sauce tends to be flavorful without melting inside skin of your mouth away. Rare? Indeed. I first experimented with this cooking sauce when I discovered the Asian art of wok cooking and making home made stir fry.<br /><br />Like your food with a tinge of heat and LOTS of flavor? Then THIS is the cooking sauce you'll grab again and again for all of your cooking needs. It's good to add into stir fry, fried rice, soups, stews, chili or for when you wish to sautee some meat such as chicken, pork or shrimp. (While it's ok for beef, I find that beef tends to soak this sauce up more so than chicken, shrimp or pork does).<br /><br />How much to use? Let your conscious be your guide! But to start with I'd use no more than a tablespoon of it with some cut up chicken chunks in the pan. Figure you're going to use 2 T of peanut or sesame oil to coat your wok/pan with to cook your meat and then when the meat begins to brown on the outside, just pour in the Tiger Sauce and let that sizzle in and flavor the meat.<br /><br />This sauce is also good as a marinade that you can use for any meat as well.<br /><br />Give it a shot. I think you'll be as happy as I am with it!
