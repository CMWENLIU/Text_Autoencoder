I would like to make this short and sweet. For the people that are experimenting and enjoying finding out what amazing things this product can do---- well done. For those of you giving it a negative review--- you're ignorant. I mean that in the nicest most literal way. As a professional Chef that has traveled the world working in many of the best restaurants in the WORLD I can tell you from first hand experience that this product is intended for things that I am guessing you just DO NOT understand. For example: Take a fish as thin as sole. You cannot actually 'sear' the fish to get nice caramelization on the flesh without overcooking it. This 'searing' is to acquire what is called the maillard reaction. The maillard reaction is the caramelization of the natural proteins, amino acids and sugars found in the meat or fish product. You do this to bring out the flavor--- it makes a HUGE difference. So, if you sear the thin filets it will overcook. Use the meat glue and you can 'glue' two filets together thus acquiring the nice brown color and NOT overcook the fish.... Easy peasy...... Get a clue and don't comment on things you don't understand. Ignorant as I mentioned before.
