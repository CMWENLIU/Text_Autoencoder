I have been doing my own taste-tasting on many of the hazelnut flavored coffee.  I keep coming back to Melitta Hazelnut Creme.  Most of the flavored coffees lose the "coffee" flavor and taste very weak.  This is a nice medium coffee with a great hazelnut touch.  At this point in time, I haven't found a better quality tasting hazelnut.  The price is also reasonable.  I'm on the Subscribe and Save with this product.
