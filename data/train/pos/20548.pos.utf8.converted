This natural sprouted grain cereal has become our "staff of life"!  Last year, I believe my 60 year old husband was a "heart-attack waiting to happen" - we changed our eating habits to organics, high omega3 foods, sprouted grains, a lot of leafy green veggies, exercise, a lot less carbohydrates, etc and a year later his cholesterol, blood pressure, homocysteine and all his other lab reports showed the blood work of "someone in their 20's", his doctor declared!  I even make a "granola" with Ezekiel 4:9, organic coconut, raisins, pecans, and cinnamon that he loves sprinkled in his yogurt.  With no refined sugar, preservatives, artificial colors, flavors or shortening - we're lovin' it!
