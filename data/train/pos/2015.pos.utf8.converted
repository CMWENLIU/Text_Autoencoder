I have been using this product for years and almost can't live without it in my kitchen.  It adds a wonderful flavor to baked goods as well as savory dishes.  It is a convenient substitute for citrus zest in any recipe. The bottles a small, but a little of the oil goes a long way, so this supply lasts me a while.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is difficult to find this product in retail stores these days.  It was really nice to see it available here on Amazon.  However, you should know that you can also purchase the product from the Boyajian website directly for more than 50% less than Amazon's current price.  Boyajian shipping is free when you order $50, I was able to fill out my order with holiday gifts for some home gourmet cooks I know.  Regardless of where you choose purchase it, you won't regret the great flavor it adds to marinades, sauces, salad dressings, cakes and cookies.
