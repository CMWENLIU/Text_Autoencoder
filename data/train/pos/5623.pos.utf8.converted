The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net.  What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.  People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage.  It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food.  What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.  It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food.  The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).  I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One.  It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.  Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result.  It's worth it.
