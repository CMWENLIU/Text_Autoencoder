This is great salmon. I've gotten it many times. It's somewhat different in taste from pink salmon. This company also cans a very good pink salmon (some of the best I've tasted): Think Pink Wild Pink Salmon. Put a little variety in your salmon dining: try them both. Delicious and healthy, five times the omega-3's as chunk light tuna, twice that of albacore and no to negligible mercury.
