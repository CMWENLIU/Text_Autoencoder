These are different than any other anchovy I had ever tried.  I first had tried then when I was in cooking school.  I was just blown away!  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but they are less salty and have much more depth of flavor.  The can is quite large but you can keep them for about a year/year and a half.  Once you open the can and have used the amount you need, just cover the top of the anchovies COMPLETELY with salt so you cannot see them.  I then put a layer of plastic wrap then foil to seal.  When using the anchovies, pull the number you need out of the can, soak them in water or milk for a few minutes to remove all of the salt.  You will need to remove the fillets from the backbone.  What you end up is an incredibly wonderful fillets.  Use them in pasta sauce and everyone will ask you for the secret.  Combine a few with melted butter, brush on crostini toasts then top with a little mild cheese.  Your guests will gobble them up and ask for more.  They will not know this is your secret ingredient.
