I can only find this item at Hannaford's grocery store and the only one close to me is 15 miles away.  I am SOOOOO happy not to have to make that extra trip once a month!  AND to save money!  It's 3.60 a pack at the grocery store.  Here it works out to about a dollar less.  I make my veggie soup with this and get RAVE reviews.  It's soooo tasty to cook your pasta in, too. No added salt, but the flavor is AMAZING even without the extra sodium!
