I'd heard of smoked paprika on several cooking shows, but could not find it locally.  Although the cost is more than typical grocery store priced spices, it is well worth the money.  It's great on fish, with Mexican dishes, and chili. Just use it sparingly. I sent my mother a tin; she says it's wonderful on deviled eggs. I plan to try it with a lot of other recipes.
