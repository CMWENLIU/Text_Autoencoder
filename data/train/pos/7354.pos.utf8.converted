I love the idea of stevia, yet I've always struggled with the funky after taste. However, this vanilla creme flavor is great! I can use this in a smoothie and not add any other sweetener at all and love the vanilla taste it adds. I don't notice the stevia after taste as I do with the other brands or flavors by this brand. In addition, I can use it as the primary sweetener in other recipes, such as a particular cake icing I make using coconut cream, and if I then add just a bit of maple syrup the stevia taste is gone. So what previously would've used 1/2 - 3/4 cup of maple syrup, now only uses a tablespoon or so!<br /><br />Absolutely try this flavor - it's great!
