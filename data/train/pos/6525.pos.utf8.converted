I have been looking for Vigo canned marinade octopus for 12 years.<br />There was only one store in Del Mar,California that carried it.<br />I lived on the island of Kauai for many years.Every time that I<br />would go to "the mainland" I would buy EVERY can that store had in<br />stock.On one trip I went to that store,couldn't find it on the<br />shelf.I was shocked.I asked the manager why the octopus wasn't<br />there on the shelf.He told me that they "don't carry it anymore"<br />I was VERY depressed because that canned marinade octopus was better<br />than some of the most gourmet seafood I have ever had!!!!!<br />THANKS to Amazon.com,my search is over and,I can so much relish<br />each and every heavenly bite of this REAL SEAFOOD TREASURE!!!!!
