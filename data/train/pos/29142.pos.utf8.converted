This is a very good canned tuna in olive oil, in a usable 5 oz size. I know it's "Chicken of the Sea", but perhaps this stuff is from a different part of the chicken than their regular canned tuna! Additionally, being packed in olive oil adds a fuller dimension of flavor to the tuna. Most tuna today is water packed, and I believe that takes away some flavor.<br /><br />After the excess olive oil is drained, we use it for casseroles, sandwiches, or just eating on a salad. The flavor is better than other canned tuna we have tried and we keep a stock of it on hand. This 24 can size case sounds like a lot, but if you eat tuna regularly as we do, it will go pretty fast.
