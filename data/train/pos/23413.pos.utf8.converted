On one hand, I kind of wish I had never tried this stuff because it is pretty expensive (I came here looking to find it cheaper, but sadly it is more than twice the price here than Costco where I usually go).  On the other hand, it's so good, every time I run out I want to kick something. Both me and my 4-year-old go through tons of this stuff. It's got a great texture and flavor. Also, at only 90 seconds in the microwave, I don't have to worry about picking something less healthy just because it's quick. I like it with a splash of truffle oil (my other unfortunate expensive food addiction).
