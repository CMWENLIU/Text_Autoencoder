I bought these for a couple reasons.  First to have the option to use flavored coffees that I have been using for years; these let me do just that, even mixing to get what I want.  Second, I can reuse the K-Cups a few times rather than tossing them, saving money and helping a bit with the environment.  These are working well on most k-cups I've tried, although I've run across a couple that, due to the manufacturing process, make using these caps difficult or impossible.
