It's too warm to cook with our oven nine months out of the year, and so each winter we try and try to remember which is the best brownie mix. We have just finished the annual ritual of trying each and every brownie mix on the market, and this one (the Betty Crocker without the syrup package) wins hands down!<br /><br />This Betty Crocker (with no syrup pack) is the best tasting by far, according to the taste testers in my house, and can be baked to that chewy gooey chocolate richness we love so much. You can also make them cake style by varying the amounts of ingredients added.<br /><br />But we like 'em oooey gooey super chewy with added pecans around here. And a pan of brownies once a week until spring (around Valentine's Day usually) is a family tradition. Next year I'll remember writing this review and I will look myself up before the first brownie mix is purchased. Actually Amazon makes it even easier than that, I've just signed up for the automatic delivery so now all we have to remember is if it comes in the mail from Amazon, it must be THE GOOD STUFF!!!
