*****<br />Numi Tea's Ruby Chai Spiced Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic rooibos, organic cloves, organic allspice, organic ginger, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, and organic cinnamon. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Earthy, vanilla organic Rooibos and a sultry blend of spices come together from around the world in Numi's caffeine-free chai. Warmed by the South African sun, Rooibos is lauded for its high anti-oxidant properties. It is full-bodied like black tea, yet soothing any time of day. We've sourced the highest quality cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon, mingling them with sweet Indian allspice and vivacious Chinese ginger. A kiss of cardamom unites this fabulous caffeine-free alternative to Numi's Golden Chai. Share in the savory warmth of Ruby Chai."<br /><br />If you are used to black tea or coffee and are wanting to get accustomed to herbal caffeine-free teas, this is a great way to start, since the flavors are stronger and thus less subtle than most herbal teas. Although this is a "chai", note that it contains no sweeteners...I prefer this, but commercial chais often have sugar added, so be prepared for a wonderful no-calorie indulgence that is beautifully flavored but not "sweet" in the same way that sugar is.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love chai, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
