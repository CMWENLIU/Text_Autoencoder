I was recently given a jar of this honey by my son, who knows I'm always on the lookout for natural remedies, and I must say this stuff is amazing! The Watson and Son honey has a remarkable golden color, but isn't transparent like the processed honey you get at most stores. I gave some to a close friend that has suffered from chronic ulcers to see how it lived up to the hype and he asked me where he could get more a few days later. It really helped soothe his stomach and I'm hoping it could eventually heal the problem like I have read in many other reviews. Great stuff all the way around!
