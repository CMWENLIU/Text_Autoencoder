I LOVE this Barney Butter!  These packets are the perfect size and source of protein to provide the energy boost on hikes, bike rides, camping and all my outdoor adventures.  I'm so glad I found these after trying so many different bars, goos, and other nut butters.  The taste is great and is so much healthier than alot of the other alternatives.  I've also been taking them to work and keep them in my car for a long commute.  Further, my kids love the taste as well so I now can feel good about them enjoying a healthy snack anywhere we go and at school.  This is truly the perfect food and now in the perfect package to go with me and my kids everywhere we go.  If you havn't tried Barney Butter, I highly recommend.  And the prices on Amazon are better than the stores so its a great deal.  Enjoy.
