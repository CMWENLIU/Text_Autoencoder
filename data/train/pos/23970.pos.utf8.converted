I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking.  Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well!  Porcini's are one of my favorite mushrooms, and JR Mushrooms brand have an excellent quality.  AB rating means they have caps and stems, and AA rating will give you get more caps.  Stems are slightly more chewer, but I like the flavor of both caps and stems.<br /><br />To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the  water boiling. Then let them cool.  If some of them are still hard I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft.  Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMAVPS">Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 Oz</a><br /><br />Mushrooms, what do they taste like:<br /><br />* PORCINI  - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut<br />* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty<br />* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn<br />* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor<br />* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos<br />* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried<br />* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor<br />* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavor<br /><br />JR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review
