I've been feeding my dog Evolution for a couple years now. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea at first, but my veganism made me do it! If there had been any adverse effects, I would've taken her off right away. I'm not going to subject my dog to my own moralism if it does her harm. The first thing I noticed was that she dove right into her new kibble, so it passed the taste test. Of course, I slowly transitioned her from her other food. As time passed, it seemed that 2 cups total of dry food per day were enough to maintain her weight. I suppose this implies Evolution is very concentrated? She averages between 60-63 lbs throughout the year. I feed her only once in the evening, adding enough water to the kibble to make it stewy. Instead of giving her treats, I merely give her a small handful of kibble out of the two cup total once or twice a day. My dog is now twelve going on thirteen and just passed her senior checkup (blood work, stool and urine check, etc) with flying colors. I don't dare tell the vet what I've been up to. I don't think she'd approve. I let the checkups speak for themselves.
