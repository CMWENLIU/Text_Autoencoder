This is a great product, but I want to address some concern about this product.<br /><br />Amid all this skepticism about MSG I felt I needed to say something. I will cite Wikipedia here -<br /><br />[...]<br />---<br />What it is made from -<br /><br />Monosodium glutamate was once predominantly made from wheat gluten, but is now mostly made from bacterial fermentation; it is acceptable for celiacs following a gluten-free diet.<br /><br />Health concerns -<br /><br />While many people believe that MSG is the cause of these symptoms, a statistical association has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people who were convinced that they were sensitive to it.<br /><br />In 1993, the FDA proposed adding the phrase "(contains glutamate)" to the common or usual names of certain protein hydrolysates that contain substantial amounts of glutamate. *(This change never went through because, in my opinion there was never enough substantial evidence to prove that MSG is harmful)*<br /><br />In the 2004 version of his book, On Food and Cooking, food scientist Harold McGee states that "[after many studies], toxicologists have concluded that MSG is a harmless ingredient for most people, even in large amounts."<br />---<br /><br />So there you have it; all of this MSG fuss is, for the most part, nonsense.<br /><br />This product does exactly what it claims to do, it makes food (meat namely) taste better.<br /><br />But like with any ingredient in a recipe, don't over do it, moderation is always a good idea (for example, you wouldn't use a handful of salt to make a small batch of cookies)<br /><br />Happy eating!
