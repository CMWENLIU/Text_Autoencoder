These are healthy and alkalizing, and easy to eat as a snack.  They keep me out of the tortilla chips and the almond butter!  I just fold the sheet in half lengthwise and tear along the fold, stack them, and fold again in half lengthwise, tear, and repeat crosswise to quickly divide a sheet into 16 squares. A little stack of those in my hand, and I also have my dog's attention.  She loves these and gets the thrill of the chase when I drop them from a height and they flutter down like butterflies.  Sometimes they stick to the roof of her mouth.  The toasted ones are tastier than the raw and are ready to go.
