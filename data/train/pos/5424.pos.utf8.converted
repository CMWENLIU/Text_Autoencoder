I have been using a Melitta Pod filter I brought back from Europe several months ago. I enjoy the possibility to use the coffee I like thanks to this ingenious device. It might take a little practice to not overfill the pod (or it would leak), but it now makes my favorite coffee every day. I am glad to finally find it on Amazon, as I thought it would be a good gift idea for several of my friends.
