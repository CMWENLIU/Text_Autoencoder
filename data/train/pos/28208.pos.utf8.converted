I read on several websites for owners of diabetic cats, that this food was well-tolerated by diabetic felines, and could help normalize blood sugar. My 15 year old Cornish Rex has been on it for three weeks and her insulin has been reduced by almost half. The vet is extremely pleased and has OK'ed me switching from the Royal Canin diabetic chow to this great cat food.<br /><br />Her energy is way up (she's a Rex, so that's really saying something), her curly-furred coat is thicker and more lustrous, and her eyes have cleared up (leaving me wondering whether she had developed a sensitivity to the grains used in the dry Royal Canin chow).<br /><br />Usuri recommends this food highly! Especially at o'dark-thirty in the morning when she begins pestering me to give her some.
