A wonderful substitute to fresh foie gras!  It is absolutly fantastic in both flavor and texture!  My favorite thing to do is soak them in whole milk and honey for about an hour then saute them in truffle oil!  Luxury at its finest!  It is too bad that some people have the inconsideration to write innapropriate OPINIONS.
