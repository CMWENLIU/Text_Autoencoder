McCormick spices aren't exactly world-renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world.  But Vanilla isn't a bold new taste sensation; it's a, well, plain-vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity.  A baker needs their extract to be consistent, flavorful, and (unless you are made of money) inexpensive.  This is all three.<br /><br />This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle. You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it's the "default" brand of vanilla extract in the US, the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it, or something like it.
