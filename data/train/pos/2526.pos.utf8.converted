Actually, for what you are getting here (a little shot of heaven), this is not really a bad price.  I am quite familiar with this brand of pistachio and I have not found a better quality nut anywhere.  In the five pound bags I have bought in the past, I have found on the average only three nuts per bag (yes, I actually counted them...I have an obsessive/compulsive personality) that were scrawny and tasting bad.  The rest have been nice fresh and plump.<br /><br />These are salted but fortunately they have not been soaked in that horrid red dye that gets all over the place much as those cheese snacks do.  As a matter of fact, the only place I have had better pistachios has been when I visit Greece or Turkey.<br /><br />I have a passion for these things that boarders on an addiction.  These are the real thing and they certainly do it for me.  I highly recommend this company and their product.
