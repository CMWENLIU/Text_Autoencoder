true to the name...these are absolutely delicious.  The wheat ones only have 80 calories, and 12 grams of fiber.  All varieties are very high in fiber and low in cal! Try them with chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese for chicken taco.  Try them as a wrap for lunch with lettuce or spinach, turkey, cucumbers, cheese.  Whatever you like..these are a nice add!
