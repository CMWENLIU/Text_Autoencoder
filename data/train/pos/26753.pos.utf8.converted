So far ive tried the breakfest blend, columbian, sumatra, verona, winter blend, house blend and a special christmas blend they had one year which was diffrent and had a spicyness to it and im looking forward to trying all the blends eventually but out of all of them ive tried so far the French roast has to be my favorite- probably between the french and winter blend. The french roast has an excellent taste and is deep dark beans and a smooth smoky taste. Absolutely delicious and smells great to. I would recomend this if you love dark coffee with alot of taste. Excellent and highly Recomended. A+
