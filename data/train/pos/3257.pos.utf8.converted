The only reason that I bought this PetGrass is because I was ordering something else and needed to spend a few more dollars for free shipping.  Lucky for my cats, I chose this PetGrass for them :-)<br /><br />I have 2 cats - 1 of them isn't too crazy about the grass, but 1 of them LOVES it!  He will chew on the grass, lick it, and play with it too.  In addition to putting the grass near their food bowls (still in the pouch), I also snip bits of it into their food.<br /><br />I am not sure about the actual health benefits of this on my cats, but they seem to like it.  Even though 1 of my cats doesn't bother with it when it is in the pouch, she seems to like it in her food.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />Just one pouch produces a lot of grass.  It does last quite a while as long as you keep watering it appropriately (my last batch is going on 3 weeks).  But, it is too much for my cats.  So, I split the amount in half.  When I open the pouch, I will divide the seeds and dirt.  I'll only put half in at a time.  Once the first batch goes dead, I'll add the second batch - I put it in the same pouch after rinsing it out.
