V8 Fusion is great. Servings of vegetables in a drink that tastes great is a fantastic invention. (peach-mango is by far my favorite flavor)<br /><br />The price here on amazon is either very good at times, or leaving a lot to be desired. You can pick up single bottles at a grocery store or a target/walmart for around $3 a bottle, or maybe less if they're on sale. On amazon, (I'm a subscribe & saver) the price seems to change a lot, anywhere from shipments that were in the low $2, to the higher $3's and $4's.<br /><br />In short, a great tasting drink with nutritional value, but watch the prices to make sure you're not paying too much.
