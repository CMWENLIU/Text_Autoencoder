I agree with Texas Mom and would recommend that you check your local Bed, Bath and Beyond. I was able to buy a box of 16 for about 10 dollars.<br /><br />You may also want to check out other online vendors. Most of them will sell the cider for list price. Most k-cups will average in price from about 50 cents to the high of 70 cents each. From this vendor, the cider k-cups are about $1.60 each, instead of .68 cents each from vendors like Bed, Bath and Beyond. I would recommend that you shop around for the best deal.
