This tea is fantastic. For as long as I remember, I've suffered from terrible cramps, jitters, and other unpleasant PMS symptoms. This tea knocks them right out. I've found after drinking a cup, I have less of a need to take ibuprofen or other OTC pain killers, as well as feeling much more calm and relaxed. I'm starting to suspect that it's made out of unicorn tears and rainbows, because it is that magical.
