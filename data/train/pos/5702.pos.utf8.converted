ATTENTION: Don't throw the treat away as others have, read below:<br /><br />I first learned of this treat from a booth at the Portland Pet Expo, and it has turned out to be an excellent, safe chew for our golden retriever puppy. When we first gave it to her, she absolutely loved it and chewed it for 15+ minutes straight, which was quite an attention span for our then 11 week old puppy. The pet expo sold samples at a discount, but said the retail price for this size chew was ~$24, so I was glad to find it on amazon for so much less.<br /><br />The himalayan chew is a combination of cow and goat cheeses, which is smoked for 7 months to produce a very hard chew which softens with puppy slobber. It does not stain, smell, or splinter. The only potential risk is a choking hazard as the chew gets small (what bone doesn't have this risk?). However, we learned a trick at the pet expo that most people here don't know:<br /><br />DON'T throw away the treat. When it gets so small you worry about choking, take it away and let it dry then microwave it for  10-15 seconds. The small chunck will get 3+ times larger, and will be less dense as a result. Now it is safe again to give to your pet as a quick treat. This way there is no waste, and your pet enjoys every last bit of it.<br /><br />Now that we have had two himalayan chews around the house for five weeks, our golden isn't quite as crazy about it as when we first got it, but she will still happily chew it over most of her toys and treats, and she hasn't finished either one yet. She still won't chew it for more than 15-20 minutes at a time, so it has time to dry out and harden again between chewing sessions. For larger dogs and more agressive chewers, I would expect that it wouldn't last nearly as long since it will stay softer as they keep chewing for longer times.
