Laura Scudder's Organic Smooth Peanut Butter, I buy this brand locally all the time it is my favorite. It doesn't have any added Sugar and very little Salt, and is even Gluten and Dairy Free, which is much better for me.<br /><br />I like to mix the oil on top with a long knife till it gets nice and smooth, I love to eat it with Almond Bread toast for breakfast or any time of the day. One of my favorites things to eat, it has a Great Fresh Taste, sometimes I go wild and slice a banana and put it on top...so good, you know, I think I'm gonna make one right now. The price here at Amazon.com is also very good. Thank You
