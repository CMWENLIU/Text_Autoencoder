I ordered this sausage because I had it at a christening party. This did not taste like the one at the party that we went crazy over; it was far better!  It has a slight taste of orange that really makes this so unique.  Don't think this is in a class with the sausage you're used to eating! This is in a class of it's own!  Order two packages, I guarantee you'll be sorry if you don't!  Fast delivery, we are very pleased with the whole transaction!<br /><br />Van
