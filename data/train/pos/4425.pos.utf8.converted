I ordered the Ennova Evo Cat Food at the recommendation of our vetrinarian. We have 2 cats, both grand old ladies, and one had developed diabetes in the last 6 months. She was on insulin 2x/day.<br /><br /> After starting both cats on the Innova Evo, our diabetic cat has been able to stop the insulin injections altogether. Nothing short of amazing as far as we are concerned. We'll never feed our animals anything else.
