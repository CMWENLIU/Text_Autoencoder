Cover the pasta with the entire jar of pasta sauce.  Add one cup water.  Mix well. Cover the ceramic dish with saran wrap or a plate, leaving a small corner uncovered to vent.  Set the microwave to run for 45 minutes on 50% power.<br /><br />Walk away.  Contemplate world peace, or have a nice glass of merlot.  After 45 minutes, take the ceramic dish out of the microwave.
