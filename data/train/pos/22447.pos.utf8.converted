I purchased a bag at a local gourmet deli in NYC because they had about 1/3 the calories of all the kettle fried chips.  First, I was shocked that there was only 1 serving in the bag (even though the measurement says 1 once the bag is bigger than you think).  After calculating the points I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad I did!  I almost felt guilty for having soo much to crunch on (there are a lot of these fries in that there bag).  I must reiterate 1 bag (1 oz) is 3 points!!! This is major.  The flavor is great and you will not feel hungry.  I am ordering a bunch of these right away.
