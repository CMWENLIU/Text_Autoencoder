I was not sure about this as I'm not a big granola eater, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. It's such a great snack. It's got great crunch satisfaction.  Wish it was in bigger clusters though. At the bottom of the bag the crumbs gets too small to grab and shove in your mouth. That's when you put it on ice cream. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.
