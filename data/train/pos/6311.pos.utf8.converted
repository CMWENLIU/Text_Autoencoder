Our almost 6 year old golden retriever has been plagued with itchy dry skin and loose stools all his life and we have tried many high quality dog foods to no avail. Finally we found Orijen fish formula and he is doing great!!!! Looks beautiful, not licking and biting his paws and skin any more and his stools are perfect. And he loves the food!!! Just wish it were easier to find in the larger size bags.
