It just does NOT get any better than this. I am not usually a huge chocolate fan, although I do enjoy a dark chocolate square every once in a while. This bar, though, is addictively good! I simply could not stop eating it. The salt blends with the other flavors to enhance them in the best possible ways, and I cannot even begin to describe the taste bud symphony that results.
