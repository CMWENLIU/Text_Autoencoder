My 5 year old cat adores the food. She scarfed down as much as I put in her bowl, so I had to be careful not to overfeed. She definitely liked this much than the other Wellness brand options.<br /><br />Since this is a very unique, extremely high protein food, you might want to talk to your vet about contraindications (kidney problems, old age?) before making the switch.<br /><br />You might also want to check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X96YIK">Spa Select Indoor Cat Food, 7 lbs.</a>, the only other food my cat goes bananas for. It's a holistic food with human quality ingredients-- another great choice. We've settled on it because I haven't made up my mind about the ultra high protein approach of CORE.
