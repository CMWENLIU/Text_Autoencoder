I love buying treats for my dogs and when I came across this in Amazon, I knew I had to buy it for my Yorkie to help her with her bad breath (CET Toothpaste helped as well!).  I was worried she won't like it coz it doesn't have the usual scent of a dog treat (meat, lamb, chicken, etc...).  So when I gave it to her, she sniffed and tasted it and started chewing on it!  She loves it!<br /><br />I'm so happy that somehow I'm giving my Yorkie something to do while cleaning her teeth!  It also keeps her busy for a few minutes.  Normal treats will only last a couple of seconds but with this, it takes her more than 5 minutes to finish it!<br /><br />What more can you ask for?  Double benefits!
