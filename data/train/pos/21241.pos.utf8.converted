I'd recently asked some online friends in a food forum what they thought the best bottled barbecue sauce is.  Four out of five of them mentioned<br />"Bone Suckin".  I was NOT disappointed!  It is not a thick gloppy sauce clogged up with corn syrup as most of the supermarket brands (Hunts, Kraft, etc) are.  The flavor is complex.  It is not too sweet, not vinegary, and with just a modicum of spice heat to keep it interesting, and so it tastes like barbecue. I've even used it in kitchen cooking (as opposed to grilling) and people commented on the great taste.<br />I bought it from Amazon, but Whole Foods also carries it.
