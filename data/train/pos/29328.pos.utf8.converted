It is hard to find a miso soup that does not use bonito (fish). This miso soup is both vegan and delicious. with only 380 mg of sodium it is also low in sodium compared to other packaged miso soups. With large chunks of tofu, onions and seaweed it's hard to believe that so much fit into a tiny package. I was so happy to see this item come back in stock on Amazon. Great any time of day this is by far my favorite miso soup.
