I love these pasta sauces - just about every flavor this company makes is amazing!  The Arrabbiata is pretty spicy, so watch out!  The Tuscan Vodka is creamy and flavorful, the Puttanesca is tangy and chunky with lots of olives and capers, and the Marinara is a great base for just about any dish calling for a good tomato sauce.  These are great with simple pasta, with ravioli, or just plain out of the jar!  Yes, I do sometimes sit and eat these out of the jar with a spoon - they are THAT good.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the jars these come packed in are top-notch.  I have never had the seeping-sauce problem others mention; perhaps it's because I use Prime and have these shipped via two-day instead of ground.<br /><br />This product is an excellent example of why I'm addicted to Amazon - it is a fantastic product that is very rarely available in stores, especially in smaller towns, and this price is unbelievable!  Look elsewhere on the web at what these sauces are selling for, and then remember that you can get free shipping with Amazon.  Unbelievable deal for a very high-quality product.  These sauces would be worth it at the "eight bucks a jar" charged by most other online stores; five bucks a jar is ridiculously cheap for the quality of ingredients you'll get in these.<br /><br />As others have also noted, the company is very nice too - I e-mailed them with a question once and the owner wrote back to me personally.
