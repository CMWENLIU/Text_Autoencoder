I just bought my first box of this, being a sort of STASH CHAI addict, drinking the BLACK CHIA TEA, and the GREEN CHIA TEA, both of which are good. So, you like CHAI? great. The box lists the same spices for each box, but they are in different ratios, depending on the strenght of the backround tea. The black tea, uses ginger, then cinnamon, clove, allspice, nutmeg, and cardamon, in decreasing amounts of spice, as you decend down the spice list. (altho the company also uses spice oils, for the teas, for more flavor.) The green tea CHIA as more cinnamon in it, compaired to the black chia. NOW, for the WHITE CHIA. SPICES AS  FOLLOWS, its mostly CINNAMON, then ginger, allspice, clove, nutmeg, and cardamon. ALL real CHIA teas, use these spices, but they need to be balanced to the teas, and WHITE TEA, is very delicate tea, of course. ALso, since it is even less processed than GREEN TEA, its very easy to make it bitter.  (It has more antioxidants than green tea too.) SO, if you get this, and you want it to taste good, dont throw BOILING WATER on the tea bag(s). Let your water sit for a minute, until its around 190 degrees F. THEN, add your tea bags, and dont let it brew for more than FOUR MINUTES. THEN, like ALL CHIA TEA, it must be VERY sweet, for the spices to "work". I add asparteme, and LOTS of it ,and a bit of honey, and some SOY MILK....ALL DONE!!! Stash's chia tea is the best, the VERY BEST. I tasted them all. There's no black pepper, chicory, or other wierdness.  SO, even tho with white chia you only get 18 bags of tea per box, instead of 20 with the GREEN or BLACK CHIA, its worth the few extra pennies for this tea. BUT, first, do you like WHITE TEA, and DO YOU LIKE SPICES? (and if you dont like to sweeten your tea, or add milk/soy, just stay away from CHIA. ) PS. dont make this the old TIBETIAN way, cos you dont want to BOIL white tea.
