The first time I used the Kinnikinnick Graham Style crumbs, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that they made an excellent pie crust that tasted just as good as regular graham cracker crumbs. I served the pie to members of my family and never told them that the crust was wheat-free. They loved it and couldn't tell the difference from a regular graham cracker crust. This is a great wheat and gluten-free alternative that I will use again and again.
