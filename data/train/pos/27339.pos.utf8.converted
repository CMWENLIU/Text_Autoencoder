I give NOW stevia 5 stars as they have the best stevia I've tried so far - but I've only tried their extract packets.  This one has no additional ingredients and no aftertaste (if used sparingly as intended).  Stevia will not have the exact same type of sweetening taste as granulated sugar or honey or other such sweeteners.  It is concentrated and super sweet, and has its own flavor and the more you add the more unpleasant it can get.  A smaller amount is best over a larger amount. I eventually got used to using a smaller amount and adjusting my sweet taste - just like adjusting to lower salt.  From my previous research, stevia is the safest alternative, calorie-free sweetening product (or should I say "nutritional supplement") available.  It is a natural product and not a manmade or altered substitute sweetener and appears to have none of their negative side effects.  I like the handy packets of the pure extract to carry with me and have used it mostly for adding to things like hot and cold cereal and drinks like tea and coffee.<br /><br />I've not tried it much in baking, but there are stevia cookbooks available on Amazon.  There are cheaper products available with a mixture of stevia and other sweeteners, but not everyone reacts positively to some of the other additive sweeteners.  If you don't, then try another brand, or stick to the pure extract.
