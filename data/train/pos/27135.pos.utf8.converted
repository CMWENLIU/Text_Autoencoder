Not only does it taste wonderful but it fills your house with an amazing aroma.  The  rice cooks up into dark reddish brown fat chewy grains.  I make it in a pot as directed or in the microwave.  Both methods turn out great.  My microwave is medium power (I can't find the tag that says exactly what wattage it is) and I use a ceramic casserole with ceramic lid, roomy enough to allow for the bubbling rice and water and not leak out.  Put in one cup of rice and two cups of water (I add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon or so of olive oil but you don't have to) then cook on high for five minutes.  Leave it in the oven undisturbed and cook on medium for 45 minutes more.  Let it sit at least fifteen minutes before removing the lid.  This rice will be a staple in my cupboard from now on.  A batch of rice makes a complete meal of just about anything, especially leftover veggies and/or fish.
