There's just something about Tapioca Pudding that makes me happy.  Definitely my favorite.  Until recently, I would just buy the Kozy Shack pre packaged tapioca pudding from the grocery in the refrigerated section; however, it has risen in price to the point where it is much more economical to make the cook and serve Jell-o brand, which tastes fresher and can be served warm or cold (or frozen in an ice tray similar to pudding pops (or poppers).  Also, no more worrying about the expiration date like you do with the refrigerated ones.<br /><br />When purchased from Amazon via their promo sales, you can get a package of this for .50.  Add in the price of 2 cups of milk (another .50), and you've made 4 servings of this for $1.  Definitely a bargain!
