I have high blood pressure and high Cholesterol, but I purchase this product because I wanted to stop drinking coffee. I went to the doctor a month after I started drinking this tea and my blood pressure was 120/80 and my cholesterol was down to 146 from 243. I was surprise of my test results, because I do not take any medicine. Who know I was going to get additional benefits from drinking this tea.
