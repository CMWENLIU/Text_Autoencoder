Vegan. Organic. Fat Free. A treat. Beautiful organic beans in a smooth & delightful organic maple baked bean sauce. Onion flavor note is not really distinguishable by itself but adds well to the overall flavor 'symphony.' Pleasant maple sugar flavor. A delight. Highly recommended! 525 calories, 0g fat, and 24g protein per can. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
