Our daughter ordered these raw pistachios as her family love the things and she knows that they are one of my big weaknesses.  I must tell you that I was a bit leery of ordering such a product but as she pointed out the price is certainly attractive (even with the shipping), as these cost a fortune at our local stores.<br /><br />Anyway, she was nice enough to share with us and I must say that I am quite impressed with this product.  The nuts are not salted, which due to dietary/health considerations on my part is almost a must.  These shelled pistachios are ideal for cooking (my wife uses them in her baking, and I constantly snack on them.  We found the flavor to be extremely fresh and as a matter of fact much fresher that of those  purchased locally.  As another reviewer has pointed out, these freeze quite well and the quality is not lessened when done correctly in nice sealed containers.<br /><br />These nuts are on the large size and after close examination we found only one or two that we had to cull from the bunch.  Shipping was quite fast and the order, for my daughter, went quite well with no problems what so ever.<br /><br />We will be ordering these ourselves when the time comes and I do highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
