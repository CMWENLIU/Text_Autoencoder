I've always loved baked beans since I was little, but now I read the ingredients in everything I eat in order to avoid the genetically modified/artificial ingredients (GMOs). These beans taste great. I always add coconut cream and cinnamon to these beans and they are EXCELLENT, not to mention healthy.
