These chow mein noodles are absolutely delicious!  They are so much better than typical ramen noodles.  The seasoning packet is a little bit sweeter, and these noodles aren't nearly as salty-tasting as the typical ramen noodles.  The seaweed also gives it an extra oomph.<br /><br />The price offered through Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else I've seen.  This is a good deal!<br /><br />One last thought:  I've noticed, and this goes for all the ramen noodles I've had, that adding a little bit of olive oil to the water as they cook brings out the flavor a little more.  Plus, the noodles won't glop together while trying to eat them.<br /><br />In any event, these are wonderful noodles - sometimes I get on a kick and eat these noodles every day for a week or so.  These are "gourmet" ramen noodles.  Ha!  Please do try them!
