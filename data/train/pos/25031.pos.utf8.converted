I love these steak pies from Fray Bentos. They had dropped out of sight and I have been checking the net for them for years. Now they are available thru Amazon. These have the same magical puff pastry top and delicious steak and kidney filling that made them my favorite years ago. The gravy is thick and delicious. One pie will surely fill you up and leave you smiling. I am so happy they are back on the market. Great for camping or in an emergency food survival kit. THANK YOU AMAZON.
