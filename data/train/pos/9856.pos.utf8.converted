This is the first Mighty Leaf tea I've tried, and I'm looking forward to trying to rest at my local cafe. Green Tea Tropical is delicious, and unlike  some other herbal teas, its fruit flavor is really pronounced. It's just sweet enough so that you don't need an added sweetener, but it's not nearly as sweet as juice. Mighty Leaf is expensive bagged tea, but it makes for a wonderful treat.
