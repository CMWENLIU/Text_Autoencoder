You really can't beat this stuff.  It's so easy to make great ice cream using this product that I don't bother with the more complicated recipes anymore.  Mix 1 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup cream with a box of this mix, blend right in your ice cream maker's container with a stick blender and start up the ice cream maker.  That's all it takes to make a quart of lovely vanilla ice cream.  I decrease the fluid and replace with fresh chopped cherries and later chocolate chips when the mixture has thickened for a wonderful ice cream that has all my friends begging for more.  Since I use 2% milk and sometimes no cream at all, my finished product is much lower calorie than pre-made ice cream and just as good.  You don't have to feel guilty at all enjoying ice cream this way.  Fresh peach ice cream anyone?  The chocolate version of this mix is also delicious. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007SNZEI">Junket Ice Cream Mix Chocolate 12 count</a>. A great and easy treat that will keep your ice cream maker churning all summer.
