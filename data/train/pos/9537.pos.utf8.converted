I bought a box of these treats for my two picky little dogs with itchie paws (10lb each) from Costco several months ago.  I've now emptied the box - well the dogs emptied the box - and I went back to Costco for another go around.  Whoops - it was a one time thing for Costco.... darn! So off to the specialty puppy store for grain free/gluten free dog treats.  Tiny little bags of treats for $6 a bag! Sooo got home and checked the Amazon website .... Hello .... Here are the treats from Costco!  Wish I had found them before now!<br /><br />My dogs are kinda picky.  I feed them Fromm grain free foods which they eat well - but the Fromm treats are really expensive and kinda large.  These are nice and small for small dogs ... about 1.5 inches by .5 inches.  They look kinda plasticky rather than "home baked" but that didn't seem to bother my dogs - they still woofed them down.  As for flavor ... well I didn't eat them but my dogs both seemed to like them.<br /><br />The box I got at Costco lasted me about 4 1/2 months with three heavy treaters for the two dogs.  There are a LOT of treats in this box and they held well in a ziplock bag.
