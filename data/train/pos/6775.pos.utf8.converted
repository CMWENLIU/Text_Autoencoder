LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE, (here sold as) 12.5-OUNCE BOTTLES, PACK OF 12, tastes far better than my second choice, (Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice....which IS on the market, as of this writing...in stores, at least).  Lakewood Organic Pure Lemon Juice IS expensive......but I have seen tiny plastic containers, shaped like lemons, that ALSO are of organic lemon juice...that sell for much more.  Lakewood Organic Pure Lemon Juice is ALL JUICE, and NO WATER....so, (although the juice does not COME from concentrate), it IS, (IF you use lemon juice mainly to make lemonade, as I do), a concentrate, of sorts, (and a natural one!), all in itself.<br /><br />LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE has a much fresher, and more delicate flavour than Minute Maid Frozen Lemon Juice.  "Lighter" in this case does NOT mean less intense...it's just a teensy bit sweeter, that's all.  NATURALLY sweeter, I'm sure....!<br /><br />A few years ago, I began to weigh SO much that my doctors told me that the pre-diabetes I had had for years, had finally turned into real, Type 2 diabetes!  (Yikes!)  However, just about that time, I had made arrangements to visit a friend<br />in Canada for about 3 weeks....and, having taken the cheapest tickets available, could NOT ask for a refund.  The doctor said it would be OK to go....IF I took things slow and easy, gave myself an extra 2 hours to reach the airport, and took things VERY easy whilst I was on the trip.  And -- try to lose some weight, and cut down, (drastically), on the sugar, fat, and cholesterol,  I took his advice, and, armed with several pamphlets for new diabetics, I boarded the plane to see my friend.<br /><br />We had a nice visit....but unfortunately, I wasn't able to go to all the places I had planned on going.  (I comforted myself with the thought that the "Chateau Fontenac", one of Quebec's premier attractions, had been around a lONG time, and if I didn't see it on THIS visit, I would probably be able to go there next time.<br />I went shopping with my friend, but cut down the shopping trip strictly to 3 hours, and didn't visit all the departments at "The Bay" department store that I wanted to see.  But I did see a lot of my friend and her family....and that's what made the trip most worth-while.<br /><br />Since I had seen her, she and her family had picked up a habit of drinking a LOT of lemonade.  I joined them in this....and found I liked lemonade a lot more than I remembered liking it.  A quick call to my doctor in the States confirmed that this was OK....as long as I didn't drink more than half-a-gallon a day, and had VERY, VERY little sugar in it.  In actuality, I had NO sugar at all in my lemonade....sweetening it instead with the CANADIAN type of Sweet'N'Low...which has CYCLAMATES in it.  (Cyclamates are banned in the US because they killed some rats once....but they haven't killed any Canadian HUMANS!)<br /><br />After 3 weeks of my friend's mom's good home-cooking, (modified for diabetics...a thing she knew well how to do, because her father had had diabetes), and lots of lemonade, MADE ME LOSE WEIGHT!  Before leaving my friend's home, I weighed myself....and found I HAD LOST 30 POUNDS!<br /><br />Back in the U.S., I went to see my doctor.  As always, he took a blood test whilst I was there, and had me call back the next week to hear the results.  AND THE RESULTS SHOWED....................THAT I HAD L O S T THE DIABETES!!!!!!<br /><br />I hadn't excercised much in Canada....but I HAD drunk a GREAT DEAL OF LEMONADE!<br />I'm sure that's what made me lose the weight!  In fact, I've recenlty discovered a book on Amazon, called "THE LEMON JUICE DIET".  My friend and her family had not mentioned that Lemonade would help me lose weight -- I guess they knew this, but considered it such an obvious piece of knowledge that they hadn't even mentioned it!  I had lost weight on drinking lots of lemonade, even without them mentioning it -- OR reading this book!<br /><br />I'm sure lemon juice is good for many other things too.  (Must research this!)  In the meantime, I'll stick with LAKEWOOD ORGANIC PURE LEMON JUICE.  If it's expensive, (and it is), I'll cut down on pizza, chocolate, and potato-chip buying.<br /><br />Somehow, I begin to wish I had bought more than one carton of this delicious and nutricious, (and organic!), lemon juice  : )
