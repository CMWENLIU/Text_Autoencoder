Our favorite rice blend by far, this mixture of brown rice grains is nutty and flavorful without any extra "scents" like jasmine, etc. or tastes that other grains could contribute.  Just plain old tasty, healthy rice.  Perfect with some stir fry or a roasted chicken breast.  Cooks well in the rice cooker.
