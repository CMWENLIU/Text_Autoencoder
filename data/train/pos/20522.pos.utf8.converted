I watched Bobby Flay on the Food Network Channel make some Margritas using Prikly Pear Syrup.  So I did a Google search and I found Cheri's.  I put in an order and when they bottle came, it was packaged like I had some exotic syrup.  I was truly amazed.  I made some Margrita's using Cheri's Prickly Pear Syrup and BOY! was it good.  I will tell my friends about the Cheri's Prickly Pear Syrup, however I will not share it with them.  They will have to order their own as this is like having a nice bottle of scotch for sipping.  I will order from Cheri's again in a heartbeat as they are the best...
