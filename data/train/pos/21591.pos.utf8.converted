Now when I make a big breakfast for my husband and myself, I can eat pancakes, too.  I took a chance and ordered 3 at a time.  When I open my third box, I'm ordering more!  I put butter and the Walden Farms Sugar Free Syrup on my pancakes.  Sometimes, I'll use Splenda, almonds and cinnamon in the mix or Splenda with a cut up Godiva Sugar Free Dark Chocolate Bar.  It's amazing that I get to eat these yummy low-carb pancakes and still lose weight at the end of the week :o)
