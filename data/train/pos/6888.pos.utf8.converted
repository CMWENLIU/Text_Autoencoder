At the last minute, we decided to make sachet bags for a Ladies Tea at church.  This product was ordered on Wednesday and received on Friday !!!  It was beautiful fragrant buds with no chaff.  We poured the whole 1 pound bag in a punch bowl and let the ladies fill their little sachet bags to take home.
