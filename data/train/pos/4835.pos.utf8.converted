My husband and I have eating these since college. 10 years later, we still love it. We usually get them from the asian supermarket, but the price is actually better on Amazon.<br /><br />If you love spicy stuff, you will love this. I don't eat things that are too spicy, so when I make it for myself, I only put in half the spice package. Yummy!
