I am on my second bag of this now. I use RO (Reverse Osmosis 'sort of distilled') water a lot and was worried about missing some important minerals. I take a thermos with cold water to work daily and usually put about 1/4 t(teaspoon) of this with 1/8 t potassium chloride, and about 1/4 t of plain old baking soda. If I have some lemon or lime available, I will squirt in a little juice. To me it tastes good and provides a good source of magnesium.<br /><br />ken
