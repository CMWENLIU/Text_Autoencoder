If you can't make gravy from scratch (which I can't) then this is the next best thing. I've tried them all but this mix is the best and it's so easy. Just add water. Goes great with Schwann's biscuits (which I  can't make either!) Also, I notice the price here is actually cheaper than what it costs in the grocery store....
