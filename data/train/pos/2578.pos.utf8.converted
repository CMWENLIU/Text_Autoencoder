I ordered 2 boxes (to meet the free shipping criteria) of this honey from amazon. The honey is good in taste and quality. I was a bit skeptical about ordering honey online after reading reviews from other users regarding the poor packing and how their honey spilled over. Guess what - now they have an extra seal under the cap of each and every bottle! So even if the cap is broken the honey wont spill. The honey tastes good. Goes perfectly well as a sweetener for my green tea. Also I thought it would be worth mentioning that the bottles do not have any expiry date (best before date) specified on them - this is unlike the highly processed honey you get in the super stores.
