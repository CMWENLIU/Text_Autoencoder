This is a must for gluten free cooking.  Don't let anyone tell you any different, there is a huge difference in rice flours.  This one is non-gritty, and does not have an offensive smell.  We love and can not live without this flour!<br /><br />Annalise Roberts suggests this flour in her cookbooks. Buy one of her books, they are reasonable and you'll be thrilled.  You might even cry a little! Her bake goods taste normal!
