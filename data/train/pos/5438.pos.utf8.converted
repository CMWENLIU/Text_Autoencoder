If you like chicory in your coffee, this is a much better alternative than buying say, Cafe du Monde or French Market coffee and chicory. Why? Because if you're like me you think their coffee tastes terrible and would rather be able to blend your chicory with coffee you like at the ratio you like. Flavor and flexibility are a nice combination. The chicory itself is excellent--rich and bitter sweet--and the six twelve ounce bags deal is very affordable. Just store them in the freezer until you need them. I know I will be buying more.
