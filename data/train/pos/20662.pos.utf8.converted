Ordered these on sale and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the saltiness - I'm fairly sensitive to salt and I didn't find it to be too bad.  Initially I used about 9/10 of the package, but ended up using the whole package in later meals and it was fine.<br /><br />You can also add a lot more chicken than they say on the box and it still comes out quite flavorful.<br /><br />It's a little pricey at the list price, but on sale it's a heck of a deal!
