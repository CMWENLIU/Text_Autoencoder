I purchesed this product after getting tired of spending a small fortune on pods. I had stock-piled a lot of coffee in my pantry and there it set after I purchased the pod coffee maker by Senseo. That is, in my opinion, the best pod coffee maker on the market. Anyway, pound after pound of Gevalia coffee kept filling my pantry shelves after getting coffee every month for quite some time. Now I can make my own pods with my own coffee. What a savings and making your own pods is fun. Marvelous invention. Hats off to the inventor!
