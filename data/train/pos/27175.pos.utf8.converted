Strawberry Fields is a great cereal in Kashi's Organic Promise line.  It has a very balanced taste between the long grain rice and wheat flakes and the strawberries and raspberries.  The flakes are sweetened with a combination of evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup for a light, natural sweetness.  The flakes are crisp and maintain the crunch in milk without being overly hard.  This cereal is also not very dense with a full one cup serving clocking in at only 120 calories.  The trade off that you make is that this cereal is fairly low in fiber compared to other Kashi cereals such as Autumn Wheat or Go Lean Crunch - both of these are in the neighborhood of 200 calories for a one cup serving.  If you are satisfied with the nutrition decision, you will almost certainly like the taste.  I found it to be essentially what I had expected the first time that I had it, and I've been eating it periodically for years now.  I like to rotate among the various Kashi cereals from week to week in order to maintain some variety.  I highly recommend Strawberry Fields for anyone looking for a lighter cereal with a balanced taste.
