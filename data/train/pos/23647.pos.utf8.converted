Per ounce this Extra Virgib Olive Oil with natural Garlic costs less than grocery store offerings of Garlic Oil. Some of these are frequently other oils and chemically flavored garlic. For me who is a lover of strong garlic flavor I added a bit more garlic to meet my taste. (Too bad it doesn't come in mild, medium and stong garlic flavor.) If one still deep fries this package of three is ideal. It's great for salads, frying, veggie dishes, mashed potatoes instead of sour cream or butter and many other dishes.
