I get these at Walmart (in the Asian food section) for .49 cents each. I absolutely LOAD UP on them. They are like any other raman noodle in that you boil water, add raman and cook for a min or two until your degree of doneness. Then you drain as much water as you prefer, which I personally drain most of it. I leave just enough to still have `soup' water after the noodles soak/cool. Every package also comes with three additions. One is a packet of paste, much like curry pastes if you use them. You have to cut an end off and really squish and squeeze the paste into your bowl of cooked noodles. Then the other packet has two sides. One is full of tasty spices and herbs. I use both of these packets and my noodles are plenty spicy. There is also a side packet of Chili powder if you like your food really hot. I have learned to leave this packet out because I enjoy the slightly spiciness (a slow warming of body temp, not a burning in your mouth) rather than full-blown heat. You can try it either way!<br /><br />The image on the front does have shrimp on it. Well, these have zero flavor of shrimp. It's more of a spicy heat and kind of fruity notes, and of course raman...quality raman by the way.<br /><br />I would give these a dozen stars.  A quick, easy meal with two packets or a snack with one. Loads of flavor, of course it's high in sodium. You could make the soup then drain all of the broth to get rid of some sodium.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Sheri Gill
