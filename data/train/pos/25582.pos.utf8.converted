It is hard to find rawhide that is sourced from AND made in the USA. I used to just buy any old rawhide because I didn't know better, but then my dog started getting sick from them so I did a little research. I realized that there is little to no quality control in some of the other countries where rawhide is most typically made. So, I decided to only buy USA stuff from now on. It is surprisingly hard to find. I finally discovered that they sell this brand at my local Wegmans and I do still buy the long rolls there from this brand, but since I don't shop regularly at that store, it's just easier and cheaper for me to order these particular bones from Amazon on subscribe and save. Especially since the dogs get them almost every day.<br /><br />They are smaller than I thought they would be but they last about 45 minutes with my two large dogs. One is a puppy who is a powerful chewer (doodle) and the other a german shepherd, for reference. The packaging is a major PITA; each is individually wrapped and it takes scissors and determination to get them open. Especially annoying when your dogs are sitting there drooling on your lap waiting for you to open them.<br /><br />With the subscribe and save, these are the same price each (even cheaper than some) as the made in China rawhides sold at all those fancy pet stores and the grocery store. They are totally worth the price! This is a really good deal and you can't go wrong, even if you have bigger dogs.
