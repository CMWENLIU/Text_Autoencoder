... because:<br />- They taste better. The others I've tried were "Yes! to cookies" (a bit sour), "HealthSmart Chocolite Cookies & Cream" (better classified as candies than cookies), and "Andre's Carbo-Save" (these come close to Lucienne's taste-wise).<br />- Unlike those other products, Lucienne's cookies are safe in terms of intestinal side effects: no FOS (such as inulin or oligofructose) no polydextrose, no isomalt.<br />- Unlike those others, Lucienne's cookies are dairy-free (and legume-free unlike Andre's).<br /><br />These cookies aren't too tempting, however. I've had truly addictive cookies made from almond and coconut flour, as well as a variation made from almond butter (those aren't sold online yet). But those addictive cookies would make me forget all the real foods, such as fruits and veggies. So I'm glad that Lucienne's cookies aren't doing this to me.
