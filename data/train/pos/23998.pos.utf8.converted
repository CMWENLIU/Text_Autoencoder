These sardines are medium sized (4 fish per can), flavorful, and retain the skin and bones for added nutrition.  The 50 piece pack is an excellent price especially considering the generous 4.4 ounce net weight.<br /><br />The "EZ open can" is somewhat vague.  It's a can like any other sardine can with a standard pull-tab that opens to reveal the fish.<br />But they're good fish and that's what matters.
