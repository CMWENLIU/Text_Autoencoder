I take two cups of the Bob's Soup Mix and add eight cups of water or vegetable stock (or a combination) along with a package of the Kitchens of India Paste for Vegetable Biryani (and the flavor packet included) and put in a crock pot.  Cook on high for 5 hours.  Ladle about 2/3 of the soup into a blender and blend on high speed to make it creamy and put back in crock pot.  Add half a bag of frozen peas/carrots mixture to the soup in the crock pot for about another 45-60 minutes.  Ladle into a bowl and enjoy!<br /><br />I have been searching for a great curry lentil soup and finally have the combination I love!  I hope others will enjoy it, too!
