The package arrived yesterday, within 24 hours of being shipped.  The package is well designed to keep the product from moving during shipping and the presentation is fantastic.  The taste test was hard to understand between all the mmmph's but eventually got two thumbs up from all parties.  I tried one myself and I do not know how they pick the perfect berries but they were perfect.  The amount of chocolate on these was a dreamy chocolate that was not dominate of the berry but a perfect blend. I do not know many presents that I or you could give for Christmas that will be remembered next year but you have my guarantee on this one.<br /><br />Guys,  if your in the dog house... this is a game changer!
