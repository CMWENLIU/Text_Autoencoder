I became aware of this product from a Food Network show with Anne Burrell. She made a brined pork chop that is out of this world. The fennel pollen is amazing in this dish! Although a bit expensive, you don't need to use a lot and you will think you are eating in a top restaurant with this dish (make the sides; the Parmesan polenta featured with the chops on the web site is fantastic). I first bought this product here, but later found it at a local gourmet grocery store. They cut back on what they carry and I'm not sure I can still get it. I will order from Amazon again. Although this brand has other flavors, I haven't tried them. I like this pure fennel pollen so much I haven't wanted to try any other. I'm looking forward to warmer weather so that I can grill the pork chops with fennel pollen again.
