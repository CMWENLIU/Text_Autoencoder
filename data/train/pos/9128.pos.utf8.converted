Always one of my favorite Haribo gummi candies, these grapefruit slices are fairly large and because they are thin, have more sugar coating to gummi ratio than most. They have a nice grapefruity taste without being overly sour. They do however tend to get kind of hard if sitting around for awhile, so I was pleased that the bag I got from Amazon was very fresh and all the candy still nice and soft. 5 pounds though is a lot of candy! Vacuum packing 1 pound bags works well to keep them fresh a long time.
