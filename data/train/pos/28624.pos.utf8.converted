FYI, this is Rapadura sugar.  The company seems to have minimized that in the new packaging (or removed it completely on the new bags!?) - probably to get new customers to purchase it in stores, whom might have put it back not knowing what rapadura is.<br /><br />Rapadura is a very historic whole food and completely unprocessed from cane-sugar.  It is the best/healthiest form of sugar.  Arguably, maybe raw honey is better.  But if you need sugar, go with this stuff.<br /><br />It is all I use now, for bread making to jam and everything in between.  (And really raw honey)  :)<br /><br />Buy with confidence! Enjoy
