This oil is good in so many ways.<br />This is my favorite oil for all uses, deep frying, pan sauteing, and straight out of the bottle.<br /><br />I also use this to make 'ozonated' oil, and it is now my favorite oil to use for this purpose, in fact I like this oil even better than olive oil for making 'ozonated' oil.
