I'm a big fan of mint tea - particularly peppermint.  Sadly, most mint teas are weak beverages.  In order to get a strong, clear minty flavor one has to steep tea for a long time or use more than one sachet; but not with this tea!  The Bigelow k-cups are terrific, much better than the other mint tea k-cups I've purchased in the past (Gloria's and Celestial Seasonings) in offering a bright and brisk cup of tea.  But please note: these might be a bit too vibrant for those with a more subtle palette.
