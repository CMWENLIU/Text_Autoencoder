This has been my favorite meal since I was a kid.  It used to be regularly stocked in Giant Food, but they have slowly gotten rid of all the products I love.  Luckily you can still buy this great spaghetti meal online.  Kraft Spaghetti Tangy Italian makes a quick, great tasting meal for 2 - 4 people.  We like to serve ours with the sauce seperate from the pasta.  And if you would like it a little less tangy, don't put all of the flavor packet in.  We usually leave out about a teaspoon of the packet.  I could eat this stuff everynight!
