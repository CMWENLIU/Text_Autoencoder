I read the book 'Water and Salt' several years ago which is why I began buying this wonderful salt. If you've ever researched salt, you'd find that typical white table salt in it's 'cleansed' state is a lifeless chemical. As a result, the body sees it as a poison and must work very hard to try to eliminate it. This is why many people are ending up with high blood pressure as most of the American diet is full of processed foods full of the (white salt) poison. Himalayan Crystal Salt is very healthy and safe to cook with and helps to balance the body as it is loaded with many trace minerals. It is also more healthy than sea salt. Think about it....our oceans are getting more and more polluted. It is a bit expensive, but your health is worth it. Check it out. Then you'll get rid of all your table salt and replace it with this too!
