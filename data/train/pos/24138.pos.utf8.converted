All I can say is that this water works. I have revived plants and flowers with it on quite a number of occasions, and it makes me feel really great after drinking it. My hydration level from drinking this water exceeds any other kind of water I've ever had, which means I don't need to drink as much water to get the intended result - relief of dryness. Regular water seems to never fully hydrate me - even after 8 glasses. This stuff does the job with a lot less. I have also seen an increase in energy and vitality in my pets when I have given it to them. It's definitely a treat and worth a try!
