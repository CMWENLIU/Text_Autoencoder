I recently bought a case of Trivedi water for myself and my female German Sheppard Labrador mix dog, Riley, who will be 9 in February next year. Each day in the morning, I put some of the Trivedi water in Riley's water dish. I think Riley is more energetic and alert from drinking the Trivedi water.<br /><br />I have a pet sitter who takes care of her when I travel and has taken care of her every couple of months. This is the positive report I got from my pet sitter about Riley after my most recent trip: "All went well over the weekend. Riley seemed to be much more energetic than I've seen in a while. We had some nice long walks until rain on Sunday."<br /><br />Treat yourself and your beloved animal companions and buy this water!
