If you want a very nutritious oil for your cooking and even!!! facial and body oil needs, this is the one to have! (besides Coconut oil, of course). I use them both ways and the results are simply amazing: no more wrinkles, and never hungry! It goes into everything raw, like salads and even smoothies made of veggies. I don't use it for(heat) cooking, it's too precious for that. Use olive oil instead.<br />It's color is deep green, and when you pour some of it into your palm, you can literally see it's smooth and beautiful texture! It has a light nutty taste, and I cannot stress enough how big the health benefits are: I never feel hungry, I don't gain weight! and I have a smooth face at soon 60 years of youth! Don't believe anybody who sells you a non-fat diet! Our body NEEDS fats to be healthy, and the right fats don't make you fat, to the contrary: you have energy, stamina and healthy body cells! This is another item I will continue to use.<br />I just have one wish: I want to see it on the "subscribe and save" list of items, so that I won't have to remember when to order a fresh batch!
