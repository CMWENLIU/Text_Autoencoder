When I bought these soups initially (several months ago), I saw the one review. But what that reviewer said about not needing to doctor the soups up for them to be good, really struck a cord with me as that is what I have always needed to do with any soup mixes I had used prior. I also really liked that they only take 20 minutes to make. You can let them stew if you want, but 20 minutes makes a wonderful tasting soup. They have chunky vegis and are very flavorful. I totally love these soups. I have now bought them several times & when ordering again today I thought I needed to also review this great find. I have tried several soup mixes on amazon.com & the Leonard Mountain soups are my favorite by far! 5+ stars :)
