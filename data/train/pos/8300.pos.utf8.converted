I take this and I also give to my dog who has had yeast issues, and I read that coconut oil helps rid the body of yeast. I love that they are all natural. Great product. I have chronic dry skin and recently moved from a humid climate to a very dry one. I can tell a different in my skin and hair. I love the added benefits to weight, diabetes, blood pressure, kidneys, even though I don't have issues with that, but it's a nice way to prevent.
