If you're looking to make coffeehouse style frappes, you need to get a mix! I'm a big fan of McDonald's frappes, but the money and calorie content made me rethink my indulgence. I was looking for a lo-cal frappe mix and could only find this one. I struggled with purchasing this one as it was a 3 pound bag and if I didn't like it, then what? But I'm very glad I made the purchase. I tried it as soon as it arrived- mixed 3 scoops (just shy of 1/4 cup) with 1/2 cup frozen coffee cubes, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2-1 cup ice cubes- then to make it pretty I topped with fat-free Redi-Whip and a drizzle of Hershey's lite syrup. Tastes great, creamy, not gritty as I've had with some other mixes. And to top it off it's low fat and low cal!
