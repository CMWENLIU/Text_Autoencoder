I use a lot of cumin and was spending a lot on spice jars from the grocery stores.  I am shocked how much cumin you get for the money from Marshalls Creek Spices.  The spice smells full and flavorful and my dishes tasted just as good, so I assume it's as high quality or better than the more expensive stuff at the grocery store.  I actually restocked my spice cabinet and purchased 10 different spices from this company at the same time.  I have no complaints about any of them.
