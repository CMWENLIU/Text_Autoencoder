I was excited to try this product after my positive experience with the NeuroSonic energy/focus drink from this line. I use this on nights I'm not tired and need to wake up early for the next day.<br /><br />MY SLEEP SITUATION:<br />I have the issue of being relatively tired in the evening and then getting a "second wind" around 10, which causes me to want complete tasks when I should be sleeping or winding down for bed.  If I'm not watching the clock I can be up till 2 A.M. doing random around the house or reading articles.  When I do sleep I also have nights where I wake up multiple times to shift around on my bed, which is disruptive to my sleep cycle.  To address this, I have tried a variety of sleep shots, drinks, supplements, and teas.  Many of them are not strong enough, do not keep me asleep the duration of the night, make it extremely difficult to wake up in the morning, or make me feel like a zombie when I am awake.<br /><br />TASTE (10/10):<br />Now I will begin to tell you about this refreshing sleep drink.  This lightly carbonated liquid is easy to drink (I consider it "chuggable") with a soft flavor that reminds me of strawberries and tangerines.  The taste does slightly linger in the mouth for a bit, but it's a pleasant taste either way.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE (10/10):<br />For this drink to work, I have to cooperate as well and hop into bed with the lights out.  If I don't do this, the drink doesn't reach its potential.  The first effect is a relaxed feeling within 10 minutes of consumption. About 15-25 minutes after drinking 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle, my eyes to start getting very heavy.  At this point I can be watching an interesting show and nothing can keep me from passing out.  It feels great when I am falling asleep from this, like a well deserved rest. I do not wake up in the middle of the night after drinking NeuroSleep and feel like I get more out of my sleep.  I also do not feel overly tired waking up as long as I have 7 hours or more to sleep.  I have drank NeuroSleep many times but never get to the second half of my drink because I fall asleep, so I actually get 2-3 uses out of a bottle.  I'd imagine the effects are stronger when you drink the entire bottle before bed.<br /><br />COST (7/10):<br />I pay 2.39 for a 1 serving, 14.5 oz bottle. Even if it was 1.99 I'd feel a lot better about the price, but that is just a personal opinion.  The price does not keep me from purchasing the product 1-2 times a week and I am able to split one serving.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great sleep aid drink which I'd recommend to people who have trouble falling or staying asleep and want to stay away from prescription sleep aids.
