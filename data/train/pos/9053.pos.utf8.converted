This is my second child, and I didn't produce well for the first one, so I'd pretty much resigned myself to minimal milk production and the theory that anything was better than nothing.  I was pumping at work three times a day and taking home about 9 ounces of milk total (and at that, it's more than I'd managed with the first child) when I caught a cold, and my production started to dwindle again, even though I wasn't taking any drugs.  Frustrated but unwilling to wean my baby at only 2 months old, I started taking this tea in the hope that it would at least sustain my current level of production.  Because it's a little on the expensive side (I was buying it locally at the full retail price) I only drank 3 cups a day.  (It recommends 3-5.)<br /><br />A week later, with my cold only just starting to clear up, I was taking home almost 12 ounces of milk.  Another week and a half later, I'm catching another cold (the downside of having 2 kids in daycare...) but I'm taking home a solid 14-15 ounces of milk every day.  This tea is the ONLY THING I have done differently -- no other supplements or dietary changes, no changes in feeding or pumping schedules -- so I know for sure it's the tea that's doing it!<br /><br />I don't know where its effectiveness will level out, or if my production will continue to stay elevated if I stop drinking the tea, but at this point, I'm just thrilled with the short term results!
