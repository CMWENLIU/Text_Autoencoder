After reading the many reviews that users had posted about this tea, I wasn't sure what to expect when it arrived.  I brewed it and found that it had a pleasant aroma and a distinctly spicy taste.  As with other k-cup teas, I found that its taste was, in my opinion, not watered down at all.  Of course there could be endless reasons why this could be and so I am not saying that others will necessarily share my opinion.  What is certain, however, is that this chai tea is very flavorful and has a good blend of spice that stands out among the chai teas that I have tasted.  This would definitely not be a bad choice for those wishing to experience chai, or k-cup chai, for the first time.
