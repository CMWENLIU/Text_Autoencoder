Like most moms when I read and saw the arsenic report by Dartmouth College, I was upset and terrified. I have been supplementing my baby's diet with 2 bottles a day for over a month now since I don't seem to produce enough milk any more. Before I chose a formula, I spent 2 days researching different options until I settled on Baby's Only. Hence, when I learnt about the findings, I was angry and felt deceived. After some more research, I decided to stick with this formula and this is why:<br /><br />1. There is no real alternative. Similac, Enfamil or Earth's Best? Those have their own issues - from BPA to Hexane.<br />2. Sabotage on Organic food?<br />3. This is a response by Professor Brian Jackson that headed the Dartmouth Research team responsible for this discovery:<br /><br />SHORT ANSWER:<br />"Sorry, so many telephone calls and e-mails; try to reply as quickly as I can. Yes, that is the brand but please don't be alarmed, these are not acutely toxic levels and this is a short exposure duration. Blood tests are not necessary. Arsenic does not accumulate in the body and is excreted within 2 - 3 days; this is why long term (decades to lifetime) is where we have data for risk."<br /><br />LONG ANSWER:<br />"We found 10 ppb inorganic arsenic (30 ppb total arsenic) in the diary formulas, 15 - 25 ppb inorganic in the soy formulas. These were two cans for each product (different lot numbers) obtained from our local COOP; how representative they are of all lots of the product over time is not known, but from what we know about the range of arsenic in rice and therefore possible ranges in syrup, I'd say that much higher concentrations are quite unlikely. The levels we detected for the dairy are either equal to the safe drinking water limit (if we just consider inorganic arsenic, which, at least for juice is what the FDA would say), or 3X the limit if you consider total arsenic. For the soy they are 1.5 - 2.5 X the level for inorganic arsenic and 3 - 6 x the level based on total arsenic. Remember the drinking water limit is set assuming you'll get a lifetime exposure at that concentration; so we don't know what risks are associated with low level, limited duration exposures (in fact that is a main research aim of the groups I work with here at Dartmouth). I have been advising people not to be alarmed; if they are concerned about arsenic exposure via formula then to consider switching to a formula where rice syrup is not the main ingredient (until such time as we have standardized testing of these products). I also recognize that there are many factors that go into choosing a formula and that this is really a decision for the parents in consultation with their pediatrician.<br /><br />To further put this into perspective these are similar concentrations to those we encounter for people in New Hampshire (also Maine) who are on private well water and have slightly elevated concentrations of Arsenic (due to our local geology). We encourage people to have their water tested and assist them to reduce water arsenic concentrations if it tests high."<br /><br />There is a thread on Babycenter.com about this topic. [...]<br /><br />My conclusion: I am sticking with Baby's Only formula for now because I don't know what other brand I would switch to. I wish I could exclusively breastfeed him...:(
