I have tried many kinds of tea, and quite honestly don't like many.  However, the tea I tried before wasn't fresh.  I know now, because I bought this tea.  Potent and aromatic, just opening the small twist-tied bag shows just what quality this tea is.<br /><br />1.6 oz for $17 may seem incredibly pricy for some, but honestly, you won't go back to drinking the cheap stuff ever again. Also, you don't need much to make a couple usable infusions.<br /><br />Flowery and light, this tea smells, looks, and tastes fresh in every cup.  It would be easy to overload with the amount of tea used... so try no more than a pinch for a 12 oz cup.  You may have to wait a few minutes, but the result will be fine.<br /><br />This supplier and this tea will not dissappoint.  Fast shipping, excellent quality.<br /><br />I will be buying my tea from them from now on.<br /><br />*edit(5/16/08): fixed embarrassing spelling mistake.
