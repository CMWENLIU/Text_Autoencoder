t's a close call, but if you're someone who eats breakfast in transit, Kashi Granola Bars have an edge over both the Nutrigrain too-sweet entries and the crumbly Nature Valley competitors. Neither a treat nor a treatment, Kashi Granola bars are light and just right--a way to get started without either residual guilt over a 7 A.M. candy bar or aversion to grandma's recommended fiber remedy. One warning: they go down easy, so don't take more than a single one with you in the car (or you could wind up scarfing down all six bars between traffic lights). Also, Amazon ships these three-buck packages in a generous-sized box, which may strike some consumers as ecologically irresponsible (wish I'd saved these boxes for a recent move of my mother-in-law. I think I ended up paying more for comparable new ones than the cost of the granola bars).
