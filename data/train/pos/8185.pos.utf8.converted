I love this conditioner.<br /><br />Pro's<br />* You don't need a lot to cover your hair (I have medium length very thick hair)<br />* You don't need to leave it on your hair longer than a minute or two.<br />* It comes out of the bottle onto your hand very thick, not thin and runny like most conditioners at this price point.<br />* It makes your hair extremely soft in a very short amount of time.<br />* Bottle rests upside down which I prefer, none wasted.<br />* Hair remains soft, even after drying.<br /><br />Con's<br />* I really cant think of any.  I tried this product because of Amazon Vine sent one for review, but I will continue to buy it as it is about 75cents to a dollar cheaper than my old conditioner and I think it works better.  It is suppossed to increase the health of your scalp, but I am not sure how I would notice that type of change.  I will also say that I am allergic to many shampoos and conditioners and I have had no problem with this after 4 uses.<br /><br />Great product, great price.
