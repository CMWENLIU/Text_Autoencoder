I bought this at my local Whole Foods and loved it. I got the last can, or else I would have gone back to the store to get a dozen.  Slightly tart, citric, thirst-quenching flavor, decent caffeine kick, no spiced plum undertones (yeah I think the cola has a little of that--not terrible just not quite what you expect), and perfect over ice.  This tastes as good as Mountain Dew, but more natural.
