Chocolate Chex are GF.  All Chex are GF.  They are produced in a completely gluten-free facility.  I got VERY sick from some recently (I have celiac disease), but it was because I got so giddy in the store when I saw that Chex were gluten-free, that I forgot to check each box I bought.  I bought one box that said "gluten-free" and one that didn't.  I got extremely sick from the one that didn't say it...because it wasn't gluten-free.  There are still boxes from when Chex weren't GF on the shelves. Also, the "malt" flavoring in the ingredients is not from barley.  Check your sources before you post that online.  :)  It's rice malt which is very different, and very gluten-less.<br /><br />I LOVE CHOCOLATE CHEX!  They are absolutely delicious, with the perfect amount of chocolate.  They make the milk delicious, too.  I don't like them for breakfast, but I LOVE them in the afternoon.
