This is a great product! I give my service dog two or three tablespoons in her food twice a day. This keeps her regular. She has not had diarrhea since I started doing this. Unfortunately it is hard to find it available during late spring and summer months. She seems to be getting a bit constipated since we ran out of pumpkin. BTW, she is 60 lbs. so if your dog is smaller you don't need to feed as much. Pumpkin is wonderful for dogs to eat if they are constipated or have diarrhea.
