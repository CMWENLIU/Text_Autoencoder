I have been dieting and watching my sugar intake. I have been using Stevia and now that there are flavors available it has rocked my world. With the berry stevia my favorite thing to do for my family to to put berries in a blender or vitamix, add ice and two full vials of berry stevia and blend. You have a wonderful sorbet!! Everyone loves this as a year round treat.
