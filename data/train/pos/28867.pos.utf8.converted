My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.
