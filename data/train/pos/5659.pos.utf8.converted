I have used this product for over 15 years. I use it to enhance the flavour of many vegetarian dishes. I also use it for fish and sushi soy sauce. My only problem with it is that I ordered this twice from Amazon in the last 4 years or so, and each time the bottles leaked during transportation. I am not sure what they could do to prevent this from happening in the future. But it is a concern. Do not order any books with it, they shipped everything in the same box, and everything got soaked with it.
