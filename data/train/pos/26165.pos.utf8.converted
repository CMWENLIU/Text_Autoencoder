I thought this flour worked very well in our grain and sugar free zucchini bread recipe.  It holds a lot of moisture and is very dense but tasted good. I think it is nice to have such great options for grain free baking.  My co workers tried it and said if I hadn't told them they wouldn't have known it was any different than regular zucchini bread.
