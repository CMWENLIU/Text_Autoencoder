This is not a weight loss product and it's not for the casual athlete; the shake's target audience is the kind of person who needs to ingest 400 quick calories and continue their workout.  Most average people are happy if they actually burn 400 calories in a session, so drinking this shake would negate any grueling gains made atop an elliptical machine.<br /><br />Pro athletes, marathon runners, weekend warriors.  These are the kind of people who'll benefit from Gatorade's new products.  Those trying to gain weight will also see results, as the nutrition is almost the same as drinking a slim-fast and eating a protein bar at the same time.  The 40/20/8 ratio of carbs/protein/fat closely mirrors the suggested standards of many weight loss programs but will be off limits for anyone on a low carb diet.<br /><br />The most obvious benefit to the high calories is the taste.  This is one yummy shake and one that few people would identify as "healthy".  Of course, if the average person consumes this product without exerting a tremendous amount of effort in the gym, they won't consider the pounds they pack on as an improvement in their health.
