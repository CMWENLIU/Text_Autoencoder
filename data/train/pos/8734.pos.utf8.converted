In an effort to save during hard times, we decided to turn our once-a-week outing with our daughter and her family into a cereal supper at her house. During home school lessons, her elementary age children have learned to read labels, and they are set free at the grocery store to choose their own cereals and other products. I found this particular cereal one day while shopping and called to make sure it fit into all the required guidelines. My two grandsons and I eat almost a box of this by ourselves on Cereal Supper Night! My daughter enjoys the Pumpkin Seed flavor best, and I routinely contribute other organic cereals. As soon as we drive up on Wednesdays, I am greeted with enthusiastic greetings and cries of inquiry, "What did you bring this week, Gran?" Three days ago, my eight year old granddaughter told her neighbor that Wednesdays were her favorite day of the week. I highly recommend this cereal no matter what your age may be!
