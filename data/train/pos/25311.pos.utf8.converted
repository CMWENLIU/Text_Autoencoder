When my cat adopted me at a local shelter, I had no clue what kind of food is good for a kitten. All my dogs are on grain-free dry food. So naturally I started him on dry food. Later on, I tried different wet food but he refused them.<br /><br />My cat is not an eager eater. He gets unlimited supply of dried food throughout the day, and he always finishes fixed amount which is in line with vet's recommendation. He also snacks on Pounce throughout the day, but mostly he prefers just to play. Play with his hyperactive adopted doggie siblings, his adopted human, or any newly discovered toys. He plays non-stop about 80% of his awake time. Food comes second in priority. That was all true, until he met the Friskies canned cat food months later.<br /><br />The first time my cat tried the Friskies savory shreds whitefish and tuna in sauce, he hestiated just like when he first encountered cheese, yogurt, or small chunks of steak. But unlike steaks or cheese which he simply left untouched nowadays, he took one lick of the Friskies shreded seafood and he gulbbed down whatever he could fit into his tiny tummy. Since then, he's fed a mix of dry and wet food. He still gets unlimited dried food through the day and only one meal of wet food at night (mixed with dry food). He's usually not very vocal and hardly talk. But when he sees his wet food coming in the special bowl, he would follow the bowl and sing all the way to his dinning area.<br /><br />Like all pet owners, I hope my cat would always eat a healthy and balanced diet. I also wish he would prefer some food that would smell more pleasing to human sense than his current favorite, this Friskies. But being such a good, well behaved, and healthy pet, I think he deserves something he likes so much. My cat has been on a mix of dry and wet food for a few months now. He's long and lean like a 10 pound tiger. And the vet is giving him a clean bill of health. One day he may grow tired of this, or gain enough weight for us to be alarmed. But as long as he stays healthy and fit and sings the Friskies' praises, this will remain his nighttime snack!
