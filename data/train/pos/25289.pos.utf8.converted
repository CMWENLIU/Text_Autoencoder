Everything I expected from the product, tried all the other gells on the market but they didn't agree with me, used it last week at the Ottawa Marathon, no cramps or side effects after the run.  Best price is at this site, don't waste your time going to a local supplier.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R9ZQGC">Honey Stinger Engery gel, Assorted Flavors</a>
