What can I say?  It's Lard!<br />Actually, I bought a medium sized home fryer to make stuff I cannot get anymore due to the liberal food do gooders who won't allow me to buy decent tasting fried foods, like Onion Rings and French Fries, that are worth eating... The lard need not be refrigerated and comes in small enough containers that happen to be perfect for the fryer.  Good quality and taste, Armour makes the best Lard, in my opinion!  The "Pack of Three" is a convenient way to purchase and Amazon packaged and shipped the containers nested in bubble bags and kraft paper to keep the containers from bumping into each other.  Good Job, Amazon!
