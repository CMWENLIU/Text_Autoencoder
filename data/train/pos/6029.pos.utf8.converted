I am using the HEALTHY BREAD IN 5 MINUTES A DAY cookbook and all recipes use vital wheat gluten. One box of this in the supermarket is double the price of one of these; so eight boxes for $10 and change is the only way to go. The expiration date on all boxes is 1 1/2 years (from today's date), so it will last a long time.  I called Hodgson Mills and they said to prolong the life even longer, it can be frozen. If you bake bread using whole grain flours, this is definitely a great savings!
