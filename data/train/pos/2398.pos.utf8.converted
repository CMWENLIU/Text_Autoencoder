I have three cats - an 8 year old "senior", a 5 year old, and a 4 month old kitten. My older male cat is notoriously picky about his dry food. He and my calico have been on Science Diet sensitive stomach food for three and a half years now with an unsuccessful attempt to move them over to Natural Balance. They would scoop out the Natural Balance and eventually went on a hunger strike. Needless to say I switched them back to Science Diet.<br /><br />When I got the kitten things became a bit tricky. My male cat would chow down on the kitten's dry food leaving nothing for my little one. I attempted to be more vigilant with them, but I can't monitor the food 24/7 so when I noticed my kitten chowing down on my dog's food (Orijen 6 fish because the poor thing has allergies and can't have grains) I thought...hmm, maybe I'll try Orijen for the cats. Luckily with the cat and kitten food in one bag I didn't need to buy two different kinds and I could feed them all in one place. Switching them over to Orijen was the best decision I've made for them in a long time. I switched them over pretty much cold turkey (bad, I know), but I haven't had any problems and they ate around whatever was left of the Science Diet. They ALL like it, even my picky eater. On top of all of this, their coats are AMAZING. My big male cat had problems bathing himself and would get dreads towards his tush and now his hair is silky smooth all around. The kitten and my calico also have gorgeous, soft coats as well.<br /><br />My cats are happy and thus, I'm happy!
