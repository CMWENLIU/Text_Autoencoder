I am addicted to coffee and for health reasons am trying to drastically reduce my intake. I resorted to using an unopened jar of Postum left from my mom's estate, and when it was gone, looked to replace it. Much to my disbelief,  Postum was no longer being manufactured. So, I tried several substitutes before coming across the Dandy Blend from Amazon, which I'm convinced is even better than Postum. It was great.<br /><br />Sometimes I just have to have a little taste of the real thing and then I add just a tad of instant Mount Hagen Organic Cafe to the Dandy Blend. At the most I go 50/50 so I figure it's like normal, decaffeinated coffee which is still not really what I should be drinking.  I've moved on to purchasing the Dandy Blend in the 2 pound bag which I store in a large, glass, vacuum-sealed jar. I place a small amount of the blend in an air tight can for daily use. In the high humidity environment I live in, this product can clump, like instant coffee, if exposed to damp air. So, keeping a tight lid on it is important. Coffee always calmed me down and help me focus. In the past, I would have some before bedtime with organic milk.  It may have been the milk but it did not affect my sleep. Now, I can continue this ritual.  Again, for health reasons, I've totally cut out milk. Dandy Blend is sooo good, I don't need the milk.  This is truly a great product for someone who enjoys coffee but must limit or discontinue drinking the real thing.
