With Amazon's Subscribe & Save option these are well below $1 per package!  I am able to make 1/2 of the packet if I don't need the whole thing.  Just mix it with water in the pan and whisk while it comes to the boil and simmer for only one minute and I had tasty vegan gravy!  It was perfect on my Edward & Sons organic, vegan, gluten free Instant mashed potatoes!  What could be easier or better?<br /><br />They also have a good looking recipe on the back of the packet for a lentil loaf that I plan on trying.<br /><br />Now I can't wait to try Roads End Organic's Savory Herb and Shiitake Mushroom varieties!
