Vegan. Natural. Kosher Pareve. Spicy. Tender chana [also known as chick peas or garbanzos] along with some pieces of aloo [potatoes] in a delightful & spicy vegetable gravy. Authentic flavor. Taste the 'kick' from real Indian green chilis. Let your adventurous taste buds travel to India without having to go there. Great with whole wheat pitas, organic basmati rice, or your favorite [Indian] bread.  Made with chick peas, potatoes, onions, sunflower oil, tomatoes, spices, green chilis, salt, ginger, garlic, pomegranate seed powder, and tea leaves extract. 525 calories and 20g protein per package. Product of India. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ61W">Kitchens Of India Ready To Eat Rajma Masala, Red Kidney Bean Currry, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.
