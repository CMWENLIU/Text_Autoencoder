I originally bought Diedrich's Sumatra from a different web site, but now that Amazon has it I have a subscription! This is one of my two favorite K-Cups (the other being Rainforest Espresso). Sumatra is very smooth... that's really the best word to describe it. Not too strong, not too weak. A good late afternoon coffee that won't shock your system or keep you up until 2AM. The flavor stands up through cream and sweetener just fine (I take mine, as a friend describes, the color of masking tape). It is similar to French Roast but a bit more refined. No hint of acid, and absolutely no bitterness or "burnt" flavor at all.<br /><br />If you're not sure, Diedrich also has a sampler box that contains Sumatra and some of their other flavors. That's how I originally stumbled on it. But as soon as I had finished my first cup from the sampler, I went and ordered two boxes.<br /><br />Order this coffee, you won't be sorry.
