We used to feed our first 2 cats Country Pet frozen food since it was THE next best thing to a natural raw diet for cats.  Then we added 3 more to the clan and our freezer couldn't hold the required amount for 5 kitties.<br />So with the help of our holistic vet and a bit of research we found EVO.  (CANNED ONLY)  It's the next best thing if you don't have the freezer space for Country Pet....or making your own.<br /><br />Our cats love it and they also enjoyed the 95% Chicken & Turkey canned.  They inhaled the duck sample EVO I gave them when I came across the new flavor.  It's much more expensive than the original formula.<br />They have super shiny coats and each are at their healthy weight.  We have a 10 yr old, 7 yr old and three 3 yr olds (brothers).  Happy cats and owners.  I've turned many friends onto EVO and Country Pet and everyone has had amazing success with the health of their pet.  :)<br /><br />I've found a case of 13 oz EVO for as low as $18.75 and as high as $27.
