I've tried a lot of competing products & flavors from other sugarless drink mix companies. Some great, some not so much. This one is in my top 3. Strong fruity flavor with plenty of tartness, yet without the extreme sourness that most associate with cranberry. Masks the sweetening agent well. Only two downsides- an excess of food coloring (common to most red drink mixes, apparently) which can be a pain if you're reusing a bottle. Also, poor local availability- hope that changes soon.
