Lovely coconut oil.  I bought the pack of two 15 ounce jars, one for cooking and one for the cat's food, my own body, and my hair, and it's just heavenly.  It smells brilliant on, but the smell fades after awhile so it doesn't totally overpower you and everything around you, my cat likes it so much that he licks it off my legs--he needs a bit of extra fat since the raw meat you get at the grocery is generally lean--and my incredibly picky boyfriend tried some teriyaki pork I saut&eacute;ed in coconut butter and he loved it--huge surprise, since I was ready to go overboard apologizing to him for the coconut flavor.  I've made raw truffles with this, carob powder, almond extract, agave, and crushed almonds, and they turned out so yummy that SAD eaters loved them.  But--warning!--if you live in the South, and especially in the summer, be really, really careful peeling the protective bit of plastic on the top off!  Mine is permanently liquid, but especially so when it sat outside in a box waiting for me to come home.<br /><br />Another bit of advice:  buy the 54 ounces; it's a better buy, and you'll use it!<br /><br />To whoever hated the plastic jars:  yeah, you're right, but I'd still buy this coconut oil again.  No, plastic isn't ideal, but I just transfer the oil to my old glass olive oil bottles and add one of the metal dispensers on the top--easy to use and it's glass.
