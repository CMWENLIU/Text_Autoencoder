The day always goes better after a cup of Yorkshire.  We've tried other Taylors and tried Yorkshire Gold, etc., and this is clearly the best.  Perfect body and smoothness.<br /><br />The first time I arrived in London years ago with a backpack, I got off the train and walked up to a counter and asked for a cup of tea, expecting him to ask me how I liked it.  Instead he cheerfully put down in front of me a mug of Yorkshire with milk in it and said, "Here ya go, luv."  It's the first cup of real tea I've ever had, and the first cup ever that I really enjoyed. Now my British husband and I make it every morning.  This type of Yorkshire needs less tea and less steeping than other loose tea.<br /><br />Here's the way many Brits still do it at home (too bad, but many, especially in London, now drink coffee instead or use tea bags):<br /><br />1. Boil water.<br />2. Heat the teapot by rinsing it out with a slow swish of boiling water, leaving the kettle boiling slowly if possible.<br />3. For two people:  Put in two rounded teaspoons of red (red/orange package) Yorkshire.<br />4.  Pour boiling water over the tea -- enough water for slightly more than two 12-oz. mugs of tea.<br />5.  Cover teapot with tea cozy or towel.  Set timer for 5 1/2 - 7 minutes, depending on your taste for strength.<br />6.  Put 3-4 Tbls. of milk in each mug.<br />7.  Pour tea through a tea strainer into each mug.<br /><br />Wonderful.  And definitely worth the little ceremony.  Not that complex once you do it a couple or three times.
