This is my second vanilla bean purchase from RJ Mushrooms.  The beans are amazing AND a great value - if you've ever purchased quality beans, you know what I'm talking about.  I made my own vanilla extract with these & it is amazing!  I'm giving some of my extract as Christmas gifts this year.  I'm also interested in trying the Creme Brule recipe which comes free with the purchase!
