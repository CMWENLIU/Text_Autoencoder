I recently found this product in my local grocery store and was delighted to find an organic cream of chicken product in the store.  Normally, I don't find cream of chicken and the one brand I have found it in, I wasn't pleased with the flavor.  I have enjoyed several of Pacific Natural Foods products before, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This tastes wonderful!  It's not over the top, but it's not so bland that it was a waste of your money.  I have enjoyed this in many dishes and will continue to purchase it until I someday perfect my own.  Even if you want a little extra seasoning, it's a great base for cream of chicken.<br /><br />What I love, however, about this product is its packaging.  It's not a can, which eliminates some of the various health issues there that have been circulating about the safety of most canned items.  The packaging it comes in is said to be a safe alternative to canned.  Forgive me, but I don't remember the details and am only writing a quick review, since I see there are none and I want this great product to have a great review!  :)<br /><br />Another great thing about the packaging is the ease of opening it.  It is a rip opening, which I stress that if you plan on using all of it at one time (and even if you don't), to open it entirely!  My husband wanted to only open it a little ways to pour it into a dish, but I stressed to him that he would be there awhile trying to get it all out if he didn't.  When you do open it, it just pops right out if you turn it upside down and squeeze.  With cans, I always had to scrap it out, but not with this packaging.  It has always fallen out for me and is a time saver for me!  (On occasion, however, I have had trouble with ripping it open without scissors, but a quick snip with scissors will fix that.)<br /><br />Not much more I can say about it that isn't in the description.  Glad to see its here on Amazon and I think you should try it!  Pacific Natural Foods, so far, has not let me down on taste and neither has this product.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we have in our dishes!  :)
