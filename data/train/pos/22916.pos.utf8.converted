I had never made sausages before; bought the kitchenaid grinder and sausage attachment; these casings...<br /><br />Results were spectacular.  I am holding a sausage-making party next weekend and these casings will be plentifully available.<br /><br />I rinsed mine for no more than five minutes, and let them sit in cold water.  Did not seem necessary to me to rinse for an extended period as another reviewer had noted.<br /><br />Biggest problem I had was I put them somewhere stupid in the pantry, made sausage mixture and then spent an hour tearing the kitchen apart and swearing at my loved ones.  At 10:30PM.  Glad the sausages were good!
