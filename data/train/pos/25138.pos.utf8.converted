I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.
