My two dogs love this stuff.  One had a little bit of trouble getting used to it (the oatmeal, cranberries, and other goodies in there kind of "loosened" things up a bit, if you know what I mean, and I didn't have enough of his old food to mix the new stuff in as slowly as I'd have liked), but after a few days he returned to normal.  Now, they're both very happy with it.  And if the boys are happy, then everybody's happy.
