This 2-tier, 18-cup design in black is a good choice for most home-kitchen counters.  I wondered if the 27-cup version might be the right choice, but decided I really didn't need the capacity, extra height and expense.  This is a very simple piece of work, and it seems a bit (quite a bit!) overpriced.  However, after a lot of shopping around, I couldn't beat Amazon's deal with Prime.  For sure, there is NO CHANCE that I will ever wear this thing out.  I'm very satisfied with the build quality, durable finish and functionality of this K-cup carousel.
