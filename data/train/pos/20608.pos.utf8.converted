Quinoa, pronounced "keen-wah," is touted by many as a "super food." It seems as if it might be a whole grain, but it actually is a seed. It is grown  in the Andes Mountains of South America and is an ancient food highly prized by the Incas.<br /><br />Quinoa is very high in protein compared to grains, making it an excellent choice for vegetarians. It is also on the approved list for those on an alkaline diet as it is considered less acid than grains. Many people with gluten sensitivities substitute quinoa for wheat. When quinoa is rated on the glycemic index, it comes in at a very low 18, making it a great choice for people who are hypoglycemic, diabetic, or on a low-glycemic diet to lose weight.<br /><br />1 cup of cooked quinoa has this nutritional breakdown:<br />222 calories, which is 70% carbs, 15% fat, and 15% protein in this manner:<br />4 grams of (healthy) fat<br />39 grams of carbohydrates (5 grams of which is fiber)<br />8 grams of protein<br /><br />Quinoa contains folate, which is an important B vitamin, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and manganese.<br /><br />Quinoa can be ground into flour (I use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YRJT6">Vita-Mix</a> to do that) and substituted for wheat flour in recipes for baked goods. The whole seed can be cooked just like rice. You use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer about 15 minutes. When you see ring-shaped sprouts popping out of the quinoa seeds, it is almost finished. Stir it to make sure all the water is absorbed.<br /><br />Quinoa by itself tastes a bit bland, but that's actually an advantage in cooking as it can absorb the flavor of herbs and spices very well. It makes an excellent pilaf and a nice addition to a thick, hearty soup. You can also stir in blueberries or other fruit and eat it as a breakfast porridge.
