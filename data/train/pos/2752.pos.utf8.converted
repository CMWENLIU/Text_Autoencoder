The item description is lacking here.  There are 4 packets/servings in each box. So you get 12 totaal servings for the price.  Must add milk (not water).  I tired this as I read a review on hot cocoa in my local paper and this was rated #1.  It does taste really good.  I suggest splurging and make this with 2% or whole milk.  Dont make it with skin or 1% - at this price you want the full effect!
