These were the hit of the "Full Irish Breakfast" my family had last St. Patrick's day. My only complaint would be that they are a tad expensive, since there's only 6 in a package, but I do understand the expense, and I did feel it was worth the money. We ran out quickly, so if we do a "Full Irish" again next St. Patrick's day, I'll probably be doubling my order, but I definitely would order again.
