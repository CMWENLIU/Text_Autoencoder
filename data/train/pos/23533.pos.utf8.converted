Found this at costco at a significantly lower price and gave it a try. I like a bold but smooth cup of coffee and find most to be too weak at medium setting. I had settled on Emiril's Big Easy as my most recent favorite until I tried the Verona. Admittedly, this is what I tend to buy in bean form for a full pot, and I was surprised to find that the k-cup version is actually very close to what I make in my drip. Full flavored without an over-roasted taste that you get with some Starbucks coffee, it's become our go-to cup. If Amazon's sellers get their price down I'll buy it here and save myself a trip to Costco.
