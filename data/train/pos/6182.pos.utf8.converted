When my next door neighbor moved she left a bottle (about 3 tbs. in it) so I tried using it in a couple recipes that called for lemon oil.  Also discovered that adding 1/2 tsp. of lemon oil to a Betty Crocker Vanilla Pound Cake mix, and substituting two Tbs. of fresh lemon juice for some of the water makes the best lemon pound cake ever.  Mix a couple Tbs. of lemon juice, fresh lemon zest and enough powdered sugar for a glaze and you've completed the cake.<br /><br />The bottle will last forever, so I share with my daughter.  You just can't compare it to lemon flavorings - it's far better.
