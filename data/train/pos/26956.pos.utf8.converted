Strong raspberry fragrance and taste.  Perfect for frosting, glaze, pastry cream and whipped cream.  Have not baked with it yet, so can't comment on whether/not it tolerates heat.<br />For those that care, the ingredients: Water, Propylene Glycol, Natural Raspberry with other Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Citrate.<br />Why in the world is it not a REQUIREMENT to publish an ingredient list w/ edible products???  Beware of "Natural" flavors!  This turned out to be a good purchase; however, I bought a few others, from Frontier, that did not include the actual title flavor, i.e. "banana," in them.  Downright awful.<br />Recipe:<br />Mascarpone, whipped.  Add, 0.25 t Raspberry extract, 2-3 T Agave, 1 T lemon zest.  Gently fold in 1 C whipped, heavy whip cream.  (In hot weather, I'll add a little gelatin to prevent melting).<br />This makes a yummy topping for berry shortcake, pancakes, caramelized bananas, lemon pie - you name it!<br />Enjoy!
