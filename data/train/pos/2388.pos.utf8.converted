I just discovered Barry Farms rice, including the Brown Jasmine.  It was very good, flavorful.  Barry Farms is a pleasure to deal with.  My entire order included other brown rice types, each bagged individually in an airtight bag and then all of those bags inside another heavy duty plastic bag.  The box was full of the little foam pieces.  You could tell it was packed with care.  The order arrived pronto.  This is the first online company I have ordered gourmet food from and I have not been disappointed.  I will be back.
