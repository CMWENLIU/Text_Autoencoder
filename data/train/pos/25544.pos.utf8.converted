This went over great at my daughter's Harry Potter party. Since I've read all the books thrice, I'm pretty knowledgable about what's in them. I went around the table and asked a child a question. If she knew the answer, she could pick whichever jelly bean she wanted (some colors are less of a "risk" than others), but if they didn't know the answer, they had to spin the spinner and take whatever jelly bean it pointed to. There were a lot of giggles and it was a great way to start the party off. Be sure and get the chocolate frog molds on Amazon. They're really easy to make and the kids loved them.
