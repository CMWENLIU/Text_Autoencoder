This stuff is straight up delicious. It has no syrupy feel or taste like most energy drinks. It tastes largely of lemonade with strong hints of black tea. Perfect start to the day, I usually drink one about an hour into my work shift. Very low calorie but full of taste.<br /><br />As of writing all the Amazon sellers are asking absurd prices. Try to find this at a local convenience store. The main brand of gas station around me sells it 2/$3.50. This particular listing is the best price since it has Amazon Prime/Super Saver shipping but it is still a fair bit more expensive than finding it in a store.
