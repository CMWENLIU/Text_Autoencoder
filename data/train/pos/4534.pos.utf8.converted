Panko bread crumbs are just awesome.  When used for breading they make a light yet crispy coating...The are different than traditional *american type* crumbs in the way that soft powder snow is different than heavy packed snow.  <p>The crumbs themselves are larger and irregularly shaped so as they lie on eachother they don't form a dense compressed breading but one with substance that still remains airy.  Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.  <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food.  These aren't the kind of bread crumbs I use for adding bulk (ie meatloaf, meatballs etc).  I have been using these for a few years now an there is a huge difference between these and the others.  I think if you try them you will really enjoy the light crisp crusts you can achieve...
