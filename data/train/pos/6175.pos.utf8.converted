As a serial cereal eater, I have had my bouts of addiction throughout my life from Apple Jacks and Count Chocula during my early childhood through an extensive adolescence with Sugar-Frosted Flakes, a short-lived health-oriented period with Bran Flakes and of course, my self-deceptive dieting tactics using Special K. My latest has been Kashi's Heart to Heart, which I find flavorful and filling. There is a slightly sweet taste which has something to do with the light honey glaze on the Cheerio-looking rings, though the most pervasive flavor is a toasted oat. I don't find a need for sugar, but I do like to pile up blueberries if I have them in the fridge.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have used it as a dinner replacement on really lazy evenings. The best part is that the low-fat, low-sodium cereal is heart-friendly (thus the name) with one gram of soluble fiber per serving. The box claims 11 servings of 3/4 cup each, which for a cereal lover, is a stretch. I've been lucky to eke out eight bowls since I tend to overflow the bowl. Still, the calorie count is reasonable at 110 of which only 15 come from fat. For a price that is on par with local retailers, Amazon delivers the cereal in cases of six boxes, which I think is a reasonable medium-term amount.
