This product is definitely a hit with my two finicky cats.  One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.<br /><br />I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!  I haven't found anyone to beat their prices!<br /><br />Good luck!
