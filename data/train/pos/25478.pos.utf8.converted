OK, its an acquired taste, but fun. It can be hard to find in stores, and is made by the old Adams company for almost 100 years. Try this along with the other gum from this company Black Jack which tastes like licorice. Also the Clark company makes 3 great old fashioned flavore of their own, cinnamon, tendermint, and my faorite teaberry. Thank you Amazon for having such interesting products from third party sellers.
