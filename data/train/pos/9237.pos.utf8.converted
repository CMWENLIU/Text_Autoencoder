I buy this stuff at my local market for $5. I'm not sure how many oz it is, but I'm pretty sure it's the same size. I don't understand why anyone would pay this much for it here. This is a great product and people should definitely include it in their diet. I like to use it on chicken instead of the traditional breading. It's fantastic!
