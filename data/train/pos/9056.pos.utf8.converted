I returned to work when my little guy was 3 months old and by 5 months I had used ALL my freezer stash.  My baby had only had breastmilk but I couldn't keep up with what they fed him at daycare.<br /><br />He eats 16oz while I am at work.  I was pumping 3-4 times at work for 20 minutes at a time and only getting 2 1/2 oz per session.  I was so frustrated and exhausted!  I tried everything: more water, more frequent pumping sessions, more frequent nursing while with the baby, I even took a nursing weekend where all I did was nurse and pump and rest but I still couldn't get more than 3 oz per pumping session.<br /><br />I started with 5 cups of tea per day.  I don't like the smell or flavor of black licorice so I was worried that I would have to gag this tea down...it isn't pleasant but it is tolerable.  I can even drink it without adding sugar, honey, or milk but it will never be a drink I like or want.<br /><br />Day one I really didn't see any change at all.<br /><br />Day two I pumped 3 times and got 11 oz which was the most I had gotten at work in weeks.<br /><br />Day three I pumped 3 times at work and each time I got 5 oz or more.  I ended the day with 17 oz and was thrilled!  That evening I nursed my son when we got home but could tell I wasn't empty so I pumped right after nursing and got another 2oz.  That night I leaked through the night and had to change my shirt...now I don't drink any tea after 6 pm.<br /><br />I've been using the tea for only ten days now and have started a new freezer stash that is currently at 20 oz.  The peace of mind is great, knowing I have extra.  I am consistently pumping 5oz per session and getting the extra 2-3oz after my nursing session with my son at 5:30 and sometimes I pump at 8 p.m. after nursing and get another 2-3 oz.  As an added bonus, my little guy was still waking every two hours until I started drinking this tea.  The past three nights he has slept 4 hours at a time.
