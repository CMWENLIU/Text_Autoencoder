My husband is a popcorn freak. So I bought this sampler for us to use with our whirly pop.  Every one of the samples are good and tasty.  There are hardly any kernals left. We also noticed that there was no kernals stuck in our teeth either. My husband and I went to the movies and you can taste the difference between good popcorn and bad after trying these gourmet samples.
