I am really REALLY happy with this flour!  i started baking routinely (again) a few years ago when Amazon offered an exceptional deal on a bread machine (something I thought I'd never buy); but it did make it easier to bake while working....(adding one more thing to an already crowded week).  After seeing the nearly ubiquitous "no-knead" recipe I went back to doing it by hand.  However, while that looked like "artisan bread," it was basically commercial white but in a different shape: garbage in- garbage out as they say in tech circles.  If you are using bleached white flour and commercial yeast, what you get is commercial white bread (albeit without the preservatives and other junk mass manufacturers add).  I'll note, for those of you who have stumbled on that recipe, it is a 200 year old recipe;, essentially sourdough, but made without either the wild yeast or fermentation (which gives sourdough its flavor).  All that said, having discovered that I began my own (wild yeast sourdough) cultures and now have half a dozen around my kitchen (which is starting to look like a lab.  In the past year I have made something on the order of 100 loaves of bread, and despite many tweaks, it was never quite there (not as good as I had hoped).  This flour made the difference~  For the first time I turned out a loaf of bread as good as any I have had~  You may not notice as much of a difference if you are using commercial yeast (though I expect there will still be some), however.... it made a HUGE difference with my sourdough cultures.  The bleaching and processing in most flour knocks out the natural yeasts.  This flour really took off~ My loaves were roughly 1/3 larger than any I had made before as the yeasts were more active and the rise better.  I hope Amazon keeps carrying this as it made a bigger difference than any other thing I have done.  (I would, however, recommend the addition of an oven stone <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000E1FDA">Old Stone Oven 4467 14-Inch by 16-Inch Baking Stone</a> (for example) if you do not already have one,which added more to the quality, as kitchen gear goes, than anything else.  However, nothing matters more than what you put in it.  This flour is visibly different; a different color (unbleached, looks almost like graham flour) and texture (stone ground flour leaves more of the germ intact).<br /><br />I came to Amazon looking for this after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0688092616">Bread Alone: Bold Fresh Loaves from Your Own Hands</a> widely hailed as the bible of artisan bread.  She recommended stone ground flour (in fact, it was specified in all of the recipes).  Before I tried this, I would not have believed what a difference it would make!  I am sure there are other good stone ground flours out there, but... I am very happy with this and will absolutely stick with it as long as Amazon carries it!<br />Beyond the quality, I like that there 9s variety. (I usually buy 20-50 lb. bags of bread flour).  It is nice to have variety.  Although it has been mentioned before, the variety I received included unbleached bread flour, whole wheat bread flour, pastry flour and corn meal.  I have only used the 2 bread flours so far, nut am happy enough with them that I am going to up my subscription (and stop buying those large sacks of white flour).  Even though I mixed them (adding whole grains...this is very much better, so much so that my 14 year old broke into the second loaf while I was out of the house.  While my family always made flattering remarks irrespective of the result before, it says a lot more if they are opting for this in preference to the bakery loaves when I am not around.
