I like to be able to just open a can to instantly make a crab meat salad.  Add mayo, lettuce, celery, and onions and this variety is delicious.  The flavor comes through scrumptiously.  I'm sure fresh caught crabs would be the best but I think removing the meat is very time consuming, messy, and tedious.  The cans do have the occasional little bits of shell but not as many as some of the other brands of crab meat I've tried.....and I've tried many varieties.  It is a bit expensive but I think of it as a treat to myself that I have every once in a while...especially in the summer.  If you like crab meat....you'll like this brand but I'd suggest buying one can locally before buying a whole case from Amazon!  Enjoy!
