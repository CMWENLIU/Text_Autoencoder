I've tried many oils, and this is the first one that actually floored me with it's delicious taste. The flavor is perfectly balanced--not too heavy, not too light. Superb for cooking, salads, garlic and fresh herb dipping oils. Carries flavors wonderfully without losing it's own deliciousness! What is a great price for such a quality EVOO. I can't imagine using anything else now and will certainly buy again. My only minor complaint is the plastic bottle, but I transferred it to a dark glass bottle upon opening.
