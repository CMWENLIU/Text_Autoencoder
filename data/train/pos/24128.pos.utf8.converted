That's right, don't buy!  Why?  Because:<br /><br />A) If you don't buy them there will be more for me.  :-)<br /><br />B) They are extremely addictive and you will gain 5 pounds in 1 month.<br /><br />In all seriousness, these are delicious.  The praline sugary stuff sticks really well to the pecans and there is a nice-sized handful in each snack-size bag.  They are a little pricey at more than $1/bag but I think you'll find them well worth it. I'm about to order more!!  Yum!!
