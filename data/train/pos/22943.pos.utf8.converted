The item is exactly as described. Keep in mind you are ordering 2 16-count packages though (for a total of 32 T-Discs). They have a very long shelf-life (over 1 year) unlike many of the other milk-based T-Discs (such as the latte and cappuccino discs, as well as the hot chocolate), so as something nice to have on hand for a chilly morning or rainy afternoon, this is a great option. I only wish Tassimo would start putting out more decaf options...
