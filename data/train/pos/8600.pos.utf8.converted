This is my favorite of the Dassant mixes (and they are all pretty terrific).  Made as instructed, it is a quick and easy mix that makes a cake with a 'homemade' taste. It is also fun to experiment and make other baked goods with this mix such as cookies and bars.  For bars:  Stir together the mix, 1 egg, 1 stick of melted butter and 3/4 C finely ground nuts (if it seems very dry, mix in 2 Tbls. water or orange juice).  Press into a prepared 8 x 8 pan and bake at 325 for about 1/2 hour.  (Check at 25 minutes - use toothpick test.)  Let cool completely before cutting into bars.  They are fabulous!
