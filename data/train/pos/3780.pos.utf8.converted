Most brown sugar one would buy is either white sugar with molasses added or sugar that is tan which has a small amount of the molasses left in.  This seems to be the real thing, dark brown and almost gummy with all the minerals from a large amount of the molasses.  Rich flavor, I use it in coffee.  Seems like it might be too strong when you just try it on it's own, but it has a positive effect on whatever I add it to.
