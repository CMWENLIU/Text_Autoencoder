This is, in my opinion, is hands-down the best loose tea I've ever had.  It's a unique blend of flavors and you can really taste the lemongrass, hibiscus flowers and the honey bush!  It's really tough to find loose tea anymore.  Trying to find one that's fair-trade, certified organic and caffeine-free at a good price is next to impossible.  I got this tea at Amazon for half the price I paid for it at a gocery store.  Really a good product.
