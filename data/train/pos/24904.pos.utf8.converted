This is an outstanding dry dog food. High in protein(42%) and low in carbohydrates. Contains no grain fillers like corn, barley, wheat, or rice. It's pricey, but you're getting a far superior product. The major carbohydrate source is potatoes, which are also a good source of B vitamins and other minerals. There is a good range of fruits/vegetables in the food, whole eggs and a good range of probiotics. The product does not contain animal fat, but instead sunflower and herring oils which are excellent sources of Omega 3/6 EFAs.<br /><br />This food is outstanding in that it contains no grains whatsoever. Grains are not a natural part of a canine diet and it is pleasing to see dog foods on the market that exclude grains completely from the diet. This is a far more natural food concept and combined with a complete lack of any low quality or controversial ingredients is the reason this food is placed in a class above the more conventional form dry dog foods.
