I purchased this from GoPicnic as part of a package for travel and purchased extras to "try ahead of time."<br /><br />This particular meal is both gluten-free and vegetarian. The GoPicnic Website also lists it as Halal and preservative free. It comes with a small fork as well as salt and pepper, so that you can eat it on its own either cold or hot. I tried it both ways and it was equally tasty.<br /><br />I love the fact that it includes suggestions inside of the package and for our first try I added chedder cheese and heated it, using it as a side dish with chicken. It was very filling on its own, and the cheese was a great complement.<br /><br />If you are eating it as a meal by itself, adding slices of cheese or a small can of tuna will increase the protein, however I would consider it an ample meal with a side of crackers or corn chips, or as it recommends on the side, over a dish of nachos!<br /><br />The packaging lists it as "two servings," although on the go you will most likely want to eat it as a single serving. This would give you 10 grams of protein, 36 grams of carb (14 of which are fiber for a net carb count of 22 grams), and 10 grams of fat.<br /><br />Tasty, healthy, and nutritious. I'm looking forward to eating it again on our trip.<br /><br />*** The one thing I have not been able to confirm is whether this meal is TSA safe. Please be sure to check if you are intending to take it with you on an airline, since it would be very disappointing to have it confiscated by security.
