Until I discovered this case product on Amazon, I had been buying the "Taste of Thai" brand coconut milk at my local grocery for more than $2 per can. This is just over $1 per can, which is amazing. The quality of the milk is equal to the more expensive brand and the nutrition information is comparable, meaning that it hasn't been watered down to produce more milk (some brand do this).<br />Cooked well and came out in a homogenized milk form rather than a clump of milk fat followed by coconut water. I am very pleased.
