My wife and I love Indian food - I prefer the hotter the better, but she prefers mild with rich flavors.  The Tiger Tiger products fall right in the middle as an excellent compromise.  We've tried the Chana Masala, Mutter Paneer and Veggie Korma, all with excellent luck, but with a word of advice.  If you think of these products as complete meals (as they are advertised), you will be pleased but not blown away.  However, if you think of them as an excellent place to start, then the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />With the Chana Masala, we usually add another can of chick peas and some cilatro or other herb that cooks well.  Then we just let it simmer on the stove top for 30-60 minutes.  With very little supervision, and medium low heat, you won't have any concerns over burning, and like many "saucy" foods, it just gets better with time.  They give this a 3-star spice rating, but it is NOT hot in any sense of the word.  I usually add a little chili oil to my serving to punch it up because it adds hot without affecting the flavors.<br /><br />The Mutter Paneer is excellent as is, and the only thing we have found that we like to add is a very healthy dose of chopped fresh spinach.  Spinach is already one of the ingredients, so we just put the Tiger Tiger sauce in a pan and add about 6-8 oz of fresh spinach.  It takes about 7-10 minutes for the newly added spinach to cook down, and the result is great.<br /><br />The Veggie Korma is probably the easiest to doctor up because it closely resembles a sweet Thai curry sauce (in our opinion, anyway).  You can add any combination of steamed vegetables (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, carrots, etc.) and protein (chicken, shrimp, fish, tofu, etc.) and you'll almost certainly come up with an excellent product.<br /><br />As for comments on the rice - it's all a matter of taste.  The Basmati Cumin rice packaged with the Chana and Korma is on the al dente side, but this can be helped by adding a little water to the packet before you microwave, and then cooking it a little longer.  The flavor is fine, but not very intense.  Our favorite is the Basmati Pilau rice packaged with the Mutter Paneer as it starts softer and has a little more flavor to it.  We do find that when our creations are done, we sometimes need to steal the rice from an uncooked package, and when we use plain old brown rice the next time, it's not a huge loss.<br /><br />Finally, one reviewer stated they had lots of sand or grit in their meals.  We have probably eaten 15-20 of these so far with zero occurrence of any contaminants in our food.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 5 stars because I feel it is an excellent tasting product, that when purchased on sale (think $12-$15 per case instead of $25) is an exceptional value.  If you are a regimented cook who likes to follow the rules you may not enjoy the more relaxed method with which we experiment.  In that case you may wish to try these individually from the store before purchasing in bulk.  In any event, I feel you'll be pleased with the results, even if you think you know better.  (NOTE: I published the same review on the Tiger Tiger Chana Masala page, too, as it accurately describes all three of the Tiger Tiger products we've tried.)
