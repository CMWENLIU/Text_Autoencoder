I've been looking for a coffee that taste like home ever since I left France. If you brew this in a normal old drip, you will achieve that perfect bold, rich, smooth coffee that you find in every French household! The beans look extremely light colored, and yet they produce one of the darkest cups of coffee you will ever have. Oh, what a pleasure!!
