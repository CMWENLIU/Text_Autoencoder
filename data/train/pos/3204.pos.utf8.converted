My two ECS eat salmon dog food and it's hard to find a salmon treat and one that is affordable when you do find them.  These are PERFECT for agility, obedience, conformation-- you name it.  They do smell strong of Salmon (which, my boys love) and like the other reviewer, they will dry out pretty quickly if not kept sealed.  That being said, my boys will not hesitate to eat them if they do get dried out from leaving them in the bait bag.  At the 4-for-3 promotion price, you can't go wrong!
