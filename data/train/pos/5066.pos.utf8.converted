I've tried every green chai available and this is hands down my favorite.  The dominant spice is ginger and the aromas during steeping are incredible.<br /><br />Unlike many green teas, you can brew this for an extended time (i.e. when you forget about it) and it still doesn't get bitter.  I take mine with a little sweetener and some cream.<br /><br />Excellent tea and it can't hurt that it is organic.  Enjoy!
