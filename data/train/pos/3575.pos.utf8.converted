Some folks are complaining that it's too expensive for JUST erythritol.  But this is organic erythritol fermented from cane sugar.  The Emerald Forest brand mentioned elsewhere in these reviews is not organic and certainly therefore derived from corn, which is cheaper. What's the big deal, you ask?  Well, I clicked on the Emerald Forest brand 44 lb. bag, and it's manufactured by Cargill--the big pharmaceutical and agri-business giant.  The corn they use is most likely genetically engineered. (Think Monsanto)<br />It's worth it to me for health reasons to use the Zero, although I do sympathize with others who feel it's pricey.
