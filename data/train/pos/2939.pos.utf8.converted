Received the Organic Valley Powdered Milk within a few days of placing the order through Amazon.com.. I placed 16 oz. of water into a container with 4 tablespoons of the powder and mixed it up.  I tasted it and it was better than the store bought milk.  Also, this milk has no pesticides, hormones or antibiotics and is certified<br />as organic. I drink three cups of double strength espresso a day and so I need to use some fat free milk to<br />enhance the taste. The Milk is so good, I do not need to put any sweetener in it.  I have been searching for a<br />solution since two years for a Milk source. I rely on the comments of the customers at Amazon.com  to guide me<br />in finding products that will suit my needs.<br />  I can recommend this product.
