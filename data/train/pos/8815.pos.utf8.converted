It has been very difficult to find thick, 100% pork hide rolls for a couple of years now. Most companies that used to make them now instead use a thin shell of pork hide around a filling of sweet potato or liver paste, but I prefer the ones that are 100%  pork hide. I give one to my Lab after his dinner and it takes him10-15 min to finish chewing it. I credit his after-dinner chews with his excellent dental health. (He's 9 years old.) These chews are even better than the ones I used to buy from Hartz Mountain-- thicker, longer, and heavier. I prefer pork hide to rawhide because is it is safer, doesn't leave goo all over his paws and the carpet, and doesn't upset his stomach, unlike rawhide. He also greatly prefers these to rawhide, even flavored rawhide. These are a great bargain, too! I'm so glad to have finally found them.
