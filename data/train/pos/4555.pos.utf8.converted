This product works wonders in my dishwasher. I live in the midwest and we have hard water. My dishwasher began having a white film on my glasses and dishes. The dishes weren't looking clean anymore and the inside of the dishwasher had the film all over. I tried running a cycle with vinegar and that helped some, but I was worried that my dishwasher was going to have major problems. I read about using citric acid cyrstals to remove the film. With no luck at finding citric acid around my area, I ordered it from Amazon. I got it quickly and used it immediately. It took 3 cycles to really remove the film and make my dishwasher look like new. Using the citric acid every couple of weeks keeps my dishwasher sparkling clean.
