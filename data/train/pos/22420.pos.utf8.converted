As Colman's concentrated mint sauce (I dilute it with an apple vinegar) is, in both my and my family's opinion, the absolute best and tastiest in the world, I was thrilled to find it available for purchase on Amazon. Just FYI, this excellent British company also makes the best (hot and strong) mustard powder.
