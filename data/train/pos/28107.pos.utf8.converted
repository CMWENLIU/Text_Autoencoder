Great tasting, good for diet, love the fact it comes from chicory. I really, really like this product and use it daily on my cereal and in my coffee. I don't get a hangover and I think it really sweetens anything I use it in. A bakery down the street uses it in baking. I feel I am eating healthy by using it, my wife uses it in her diet, the grandkids love it and I will order it often.
