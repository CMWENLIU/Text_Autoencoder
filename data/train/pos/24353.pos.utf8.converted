German sweet licorice is nothing like American; it's flavored with licorice root, not just anise oil, and it's darkly delicious. Haribo, that German maker of gummis, makes a fine licorice wheel or snail; you unroll the licorice into a long whip or else you can bite into the wheel like a cake if you are not prone to play with your candy or blow bubbles with your gum. Your choice; either way, this is excellent licorice and a real treat.
