For those of you unfamiliar with white tea, it comes from the same plant as green tea, and has all the health benefits.  White tea is picked during a small period of the year, before the buds and leaves have opened.  This gives it a much more delicate flavor (read: doesn't taste like cabbage the way green tea does).<br /><br />For those of you who are tea snobs, this is Bai Mu Dan (aka white peony), which is picked from March 15-April 10 of each year.  It is not quite as rare as silver needle, and has a bit more flavor.<br /><br />I was looking for some white tea for a regular morning cup, and I came across this bag, with a very low cost per ounce.  I'd ordered Numi before and liked it so I took a chance and was not disappointed.  Mine came in a large black, resealable bag, rather than the paper one pictured.  It is quite a bit of tea for the price.  The leaves and buds are in good condition, large and mostly unbroken (see my user image for an example), and dried to a nice green color like they should be.<br /><br />The tea has a great flavor, more substantial than silver needle, but still very light and drinkable.  I'd definitely order this again, but I'll be a while going through the 1lb bag.
