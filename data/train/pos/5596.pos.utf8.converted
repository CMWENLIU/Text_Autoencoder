I remember these wafers as a young girl and haven't found any other sugar creme wafer to compare. Other sugar wafers have a harder, thicker wafer that almost scratches the roof of your mouth. These have a very thin wafer that is simply holding the melt in your mouth creme filling together. One bite and you are hooked, you eat the whole pack! They stay crispy and fresh because they are packaged with 3 packs inside each box. They are a great snack by themselves or served with sherbet or crumbled on ice cream for a dessert.
