This is the only type of treat my cat will eat!  I was so happy to find a large size because you can usually only buy the tiny containers in pet stores.  The 1 oz. is a better bargain.  My cat prefers this over Kitty Caviar, and it smells a lot fresher.  This is high quality healthy treat for any cat.
