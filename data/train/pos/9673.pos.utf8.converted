Growing up in Georgia, I've eaten a lot of honey.  This stuff is awesome.  The Sourwood is my favorite; the honey has a really complex flavor that's of course sweet (after all, it IS honey) but much more mellow than many of the honeys I buy (such as Orange Blossom, even Wildflower).  I've been using it in a variety of teas (by the way, I love Teavana) and it's awesome.  This honey's addictive - I could eat it all day long (of course, I'd be bouncing off the walls, but at least I'd be happy!).<br /><br />I've bought this locally in Atlanta, but am so glad it's avaialable on Amazon as it's easier than hunting for it (usually only the higher-end stores carry it).
