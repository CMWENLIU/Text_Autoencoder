Once a diet coke drinker, but then moved to a natural alternative, and have tried most brands. This one has less aftertaste than Zevia, at least the cola flavor. Its overall really good, I only wish it had caffeine like Zevia for that additional pick me up. Good Stuff, cheaper than Whole Foods if you subscribe.
