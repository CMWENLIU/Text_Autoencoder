I never drink sodas but when I am pregnant one of my cravings is soda.  This is made from 62% juice and nothing bad like what is in other sodas so it is much better for you.  Honestly I have never tasted anything so good in my life, its so fruity and has a wonderful berry flavor, I am now hooked and don't know how to stop drinking it LOL
