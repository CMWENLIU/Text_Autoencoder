First time I've had success growing anything other than the weeds in my lawn.<br /><br />Update: I'm on my second pump and it's failing after 2 weeks. I have a homemade hydro system that uses a similar design pump that is going on 2yrs old nonstop. It's a very cool design but they need to find a better pump supply. Needs a ceramic bushing in the impeller like a quality aquarium pump.
