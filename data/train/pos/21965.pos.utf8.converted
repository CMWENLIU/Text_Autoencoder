These chocolate bars are made with 85% extra dark chocolate.  You have to acquire a taste for it because the darker the chocolate, the less sugar it contains. You have to acquire a taste for it because when you taste it for the first time, it has a slightly bitter taste. It took me less than a week to start enjoying the taste. Now, I find I don't care for regular chocolate because it's too sweet. It's also a much healthier chocolate to eat.
