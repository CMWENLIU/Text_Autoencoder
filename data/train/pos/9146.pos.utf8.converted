3 reasons that I decided to purchase My-Kap now were: 1. Save the environment. ( I hate it whenever I throw out used K-Cups in such a good condition, one-time use) 2. Save money. ( Although K-Cups cost much less than a visit to Starbucks, it costs ~$0.43-$0.50  per Cup and it adds up.) 3. I get to choose to brew from any coffee of my choice. ( I can brew from beans purchased in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and etc.). Best of all, brew it right after I grind the beans. Fresh)<br /><br />After My-Kaps arrived, I can't wait to use it to brew the next day.<br />3 reasons that I love them:<br />  1. Thanks to the clear instructions sent with My-Kap, it's easy to get started, assemble and dissemble.<br />  2. The coffee brewed from reused K-Cups with My-Kap tastes great to the essence of your grinds, unlike bad reviews I've read for similar product. Even better,  I can change the strength of my coffee by adding less or more onto my reused K-cup.<br />  3. It does leak but not too much or too messy. I do not know exactly the reason or ways to prevent it from happening. I am still playing with it. But the leaks are not messy because they still go into the cup. I just have to remember to wipe the machine after brewing.  I do that as a routine regardless it leaks anyway, do it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />For the quality of the brewed I get, the money and wastes I saved, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended to anyone who shares my desires to save environment, save $$ and has a freedom to brew different coffee each day. Not just different, but FRESH!! (if you recently grind the beans or grind right before you brew it)
