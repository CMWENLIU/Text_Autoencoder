Quick Review:  Island Roasters 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee<br /><br />I recently received a pound of this coffee as a gift, and looked forward to getting to sample some 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  The short version:  AMAZING!!!  I actually had to wait a couple days after trying the first sample to write this review... I was too giddy after that first taste to write an objective review.  Yes, it's THAT good.<br /><br />So, here's the review after a couple days of drinking the stuff and having some time to reflect on the experience.<br /><br />Before diving into the description of the actual drink, I need to describe the experience of simply opening the vacuum bag and inspecting the contents.  Once the bag is opened, there is this magical release of coffee perfume that is simply divine.  The smell is not something that one can adequately describe... it truly needs to be experienced.<br /><br />The beans themselves were medium-dark brown, and glistening in a uniform sheen...all were roasted perfectly and uniformly.  I quickly got down to business... ground some of the beans and started the brewing process.  The beans were so fresh and so laden with volatile oils that the ground coffee bits adhered to each other... it looked like you could have easily molded the grounds into shapes with your hands! This was really fresh coffee.  Once again, after grinding, another burst of coffee perfume pervaded the kitchen, bathing the air with an amazing aroma.<br /><br />Now for the moment of truth...tasting the stuff straight up....was...just... WOW!  Lots of coffee perfume with an incredibly complex mix of floral notes.  Very well balanced... just an amazing array of flavors, beautifully arranged with hints of sweetness along with a lovely backbone of acidity to keep everything in check.  Absolutely no hint of bitterness.  In fact, this was the most smooth coffee I'd ever had.  Delicate, complex, some ephemeral fruit notes, balanced, and most of all, just smoooooooooth.<br /><br />If you are a coffee enthusiast, give this stuff a try.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
