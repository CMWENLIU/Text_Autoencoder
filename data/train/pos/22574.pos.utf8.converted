This is the best pre-made chilli out there. Much better than Hormel or any of the other brands. No contest. It can be eaten alone or its really great for Tex-mex enchiladas or on burritos. Easy to make--just heat and eat. Can get it with or without beans, but get it without. They even have a lean version that's still good. Definite buy.
