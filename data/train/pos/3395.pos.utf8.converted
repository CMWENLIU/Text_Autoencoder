No gluten, no added sugar, raw, vegan... You'd think these would be pretty darn bland and nasty. Well, you'd be wrong. They are amazing! Sometimes simple and natural is better, and this is one of those cases. I far prefer these to any of the fancy energy bars like Luna Bars, Clif Bars, etc. They are simply nuts and dried fruit, they satisfy my sweet tooth and also give me the energy I need to get through the day. I eat them as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon stack. Cherry Pie is by far the tastiest flavor. It is tart and tasty.<br /><br />I'm confused about why these aren't listed in Amazon's Gluten-Free section, though?
