I was looking for a strawberry tea that I tried long time ago and absolutely loved. That tea was brought from Germany so I thought I will not find it here. This tea is exactly the same - flavorful, little sweet and tart at the same time and smells like heaven. Has fresh dried strawberries and tea leaves. Would recommend to berry lovers. It is DELICIOUS!
