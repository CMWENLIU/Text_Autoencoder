This is organic, costs more so it is not sold in bigger quantities. Manitoba sells the 5lb container, conventional not organic, with bigger saving but it all depends how much you consume. Manitoba sells the 5lb container with bigger saving but it all depends how much you consume. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds grinded in coffee maker + cocoa powder + unflavoured protein isolate on daily basis and now I have added hemp to my diet. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ inside the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container it needs to be #5 or much safer in glass containers. I consume seeds within two weeks but the hemp seeds within the most three months since I can not get it in small quantities and it will lose its nutritional value. This is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy and there is no profit in hemp for since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without an other artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers, like sugar and saturated fat, and common energy bars. Contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch and sugar. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing all different type of sports or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc... Thank you Canada.
