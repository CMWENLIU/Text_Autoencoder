Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per zip lock bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size<br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010
