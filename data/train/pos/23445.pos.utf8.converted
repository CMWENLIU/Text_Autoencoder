I originally purchased this oil for my dog who had been diagnosed with cancer.  Much research found that coconut oil was a cancer fighter, so I purchased this and began adding it not only to his food but my other dog's food as well and boy did they love it!  It has a wonderful coconut aroma and is a good supplement not only for the dogs but for myself as well.  I use it to cook, in my coffee, and even on my skin.  It's truly a wonderful product with many uses and so good for you, you can't go wrong with it!
