A striking pale green, bamboo rice is not technically considered sushi rice, but is sometimes used for sushi to lend color to sushi rolls. Bamboo rice should not be cooked like regular sushi rice. To cook bamboo rice, 1.5 cups of water (0.35 L) should be added to each eight ounces (227 g) of bamboo rice. Rice should then be cooked as usual, but allowed to sit for 20 minutes after cooking.
