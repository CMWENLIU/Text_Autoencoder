This was a great deal- it is difficult to find this particular choice in most of our grocery stores and in the few that offer it.....each box is priced at nearly $4.00. This was a good deal overall- shipment was quick and packaged nicely. We are really satisfied and the dinner is great. We cooked it with ground turkey and added peas.....easy and the kids are happy too!
