I guarantee this product is and does all it says it does. I conducted a test trial on myself and over a month I noticed benefits in energy, memory, hair growth and overall better health. I take 1 oz each morning and within 20 min. I feet awake and ready to tackle the day...seriously! It is packed with antioxidants and has helped my emotional state...it puts me in a positive mood and a sense of well-being.  For a long while I had trouble getting out of bed and wanting to do anything.  You can ask my husband how often I wake up crabby and after I take my daily dose I'm myself again. lol  If you have a serious health condition you will probably require more, like 8 oz a day to see any real change but you must take this religiously every day to see the benefits.  1 oz. a day works for me. Now I have it automatically sent to my home each month with Amazon's program and I SAVE $$$$.<br /><br />Goji Juice has been traditionally used to alleviate the following conditions:<br /><br />  * to strengthen the heart and alleviate heart palpitations<br />  * fights insomnia and forgetfulness<br />  * contains polysaccharides which control the pituitary glands that produce HGH (human growth hormone) which is a powerful anti-aging hormone<br />  * can be used by pregnant women to alleviate morning sickness.<br />  * Has in clinical trials shown a partial reversal in sexual dysfunction in seniors<br />  * Used to boost the function of the immune system<br />  * Has some anti-cancer properties and has been successfully used to treat hepatitis-B<br />  * Has been used successfully for weight loss<br />  * Helps the body detox, cleans the blood and build the immune system.<br /><br />Here are some facts about this marvelous fruit:<br /><br />  * They contain 19 amino acids including the 8 essential amino acids.<br />  * They have 21 trace minerals including zinc, calcium, germanium, selenium and phosphorus<br />  * B vitamins<br />  * Has more Beta-carotene than carrots (which converts to vitamin A) and has a complete spectrum of antioxidants.<br />  * Has vitamin E which is almost unheard of in fruits<br />  * Has 500 times more Vitamin C by weight than oranges<br />  * It contains the anti-inflammatory agent beta-sitosterol which lowers cholesterol and takes care of sexual health<br />  * They have essential fatty acids such as omega 6 and linoleic acid that regulate hormones<br />  * Has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties
