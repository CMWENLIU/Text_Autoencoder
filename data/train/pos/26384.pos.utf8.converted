For reasons unknown to anyone else, one of my brothers-in-law is absolutely addicted to Peeps, with his favorite being the yellow Easter Bunny Peeps. He's won two Peeps-eating contests. I have Amazon ship him a box every Easter (he lives a thousand miles from me), and I think he enjoys them more than anything else I could send. He emails me every year that they arrived intact and fresh.<br /><br />Personally, I would eat a lizard before I would touch another Peep. But that's just me.
