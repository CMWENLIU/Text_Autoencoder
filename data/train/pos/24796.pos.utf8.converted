First off, let me just say that after trying MANY teas (including many of the other Yogi flavors) this is -in my humble opinion- the best tasting. I make my own teas with natural herbs/teas and a press, but any time I'm in a hurry or want to treat myself I grab one of the Yogi Energy tea bags because, honestly, it tastes better.<br />I will say that I am a wimp and never drink tea without honey. This tea tastes fantastic with a touch of honey and lemon!<br /><br />That being said, lets break down the two "power herbs" in this tea-bag; Ginseng and Spearmint. These are two popular herbs for energy. For my own teas, my top choices would be Ginseng, Peppermint and Rosemary, simply for their incredible energetic properties and HOARDS of other benefits... but I suppose Yogi has tailored this to taste the most pleasing as well, since most people don't know (or care) much about the herbs as much as the taste. (Licorice is a fantastic herb for energy too, but its taste is overpowering).<br /><br />Here are some of the other benefits of Ginseng and Spearmint:<br /><br />--Ginseng Root (Eleutherococcus senticosus)--<br />(Excerpts from The How to Herb Book)<br />Ginseng is considered a cure-all in China. It is a hormonal herb that is good for both men and women since it regulates both male and female hormones. It is considered good for both mental and physical health and builds resistance to all kinds of stress.<br />Is especially good for men because it helps alleviate and prevent impotency.<br />Is non-toxic and used in preventative medicine because it strengthens the body's entire defense mechanism.<br />Benefits the pituitary and adrenal glands.<br />Regulates and normalizes blood pressure and blood sugar levels.<br />Considered to slow the aging process.<br />Used with gotu-kola and Cayenne as a "pick-me-up."<br />Has been used for the following:<br />-Endurance<br />-Energy<br />-Impotency (for men)<br />-Longevity<br />-Pituitary gland<br />-Prostate<br /><br />--Spearmint (Mentha spicata)--<br />(Excerpts from Nutritional Herbology)<br />Contains aromatic compounds that increase the production of digestive fluids and enzymes, relieve smooth muscle spasms, increase blood circulation, promote sweating, relieve pain and are antiseptic. It also contains astringent compounds that shrink inflamed tissues. Spearmint has been used to treat indigestion, morning sickness, nausea, menstrual cramps, flatulence, muscle aches, flu and vomiting.<br />From my studies and experience Spearmint is helpful for the following:<br />-Any sort of digestive problem<br />-Flatulance<br />-Aids for curing Colds and the Flu<br />-Folklore says it has abilities to fight tumors and cancer<br /><br />I don't understand why Yogi put Lemongrass in this tea, as it is known as a light sedative. It is, however, usually a tasty additive, so I suppose they added a touch of it for flavor purposes.<br /><br />So my personal summary is this; There are herbs that have stronger energetic properties than some that have been chosen for this tea, however the taste is superb and this is a fantastic introduction into the green tea world, especially if you are wanting to switch from Coffee to a 'healthy' amount of energy without the drop. You can easily and healthily drink 3 cups a day if you want, and it will only do your body, immune system, muscles and lungs good!<br /><br />Happy Sipping.
