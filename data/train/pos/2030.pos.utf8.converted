I love SweetLeaf stevia. It adds *a lot* of sweetness, making this two-jar set a great value.<br /><br />It does take a little mixing to dissolve in beverages, though -- keep that in mind if you're filling a cup up. I've had better success adding the stevia while the cup (or jar, when I make iced tea) is still only half-full, then mixing it in with a fork, then topping off my drink.<br /><br />This is a plant extract, not an instantly-dissolving chemical product, so don't be surprised the first time.<br /><br />It is fantastic and delicious, though!
