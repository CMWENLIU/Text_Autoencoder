I ordered these direct from the manufacturer in Spain. They work great in the Nespresso Essenza C91. With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically. So using these Necaps are easy, you will not get a diluted shot unless you let it run too long and this applies to Nespresso capsules as well. However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.<br /><br />Tips:<br />Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.<br /><br />1. Set out several Necaps<br />2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down.<br />3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly.<br />4. Fill up to top again and compact.<br />5. Put foil on and you are done.<br /><br />You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.<br /><br />Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.<br /><br />My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91. I have also made cold brewed coffee. All serve there purpose in different ways.
