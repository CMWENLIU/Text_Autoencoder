I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I improvised.<br />A little bit of oil in the bottom of a pan with the spice packet, heat to infuse oil, then added 1lb frozen bag of cauliflower, 2-3 potatos cubed, and 1 package frozen sliced okra, one cup water, spice paste.  Cover and cook until veggies are thawed, and stir.  Cook until tender, stirring occassionally.  In about half an hour, a really good sauce/ curry with vegetables is ready.  Serve over rice with toasted flour tortillas, and it's a fairly quick, low prep meal with leftovers for lunch 2-3 days.  And costs half of what it'd cost eating out.
