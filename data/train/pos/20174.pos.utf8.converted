This candy bar is fantastic! I live in the United States, and there is not really anything else like it here, although the Cadbury Crunchie bar in the UK and Canada is similar.  What really makes this candy bar special is the light, firm yet spungie middle. When you bite into it the texture is definately unique. It tastes really great too: sort of a light toffee/honey taste with smooth milk chocolate on the outside. I cannot recommend this candy bar enough.
