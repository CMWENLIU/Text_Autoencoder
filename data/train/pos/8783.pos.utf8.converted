I AM NOT AN EXPERIENCED COOK. I RECENTLY ORDERED A BREAD MACHINE AND THE RECIPES WERE CONFUSING TO ME. SO MANY DIFFERENT FLOURS,BAKING POWER,SALT,BAKING SODA,YEAST,ETC....I WAS FRUSTRATED!<br /><br /> AFTER SEEING Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), ON AMAZON, I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY. ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE INCLUDED, EVEN THE YEAST. ALL I NEEDED TO ADD WAS WATER AND BUTTER OR VEG OIL(I USE OLIVE OR PEANUT OIL).<br /><br /> THE BREAD TURNED OUT GREAT AND VERY EASY TO BAKE. THE PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR A NOVICE LIKE ME. I WOULD SUGGEST ANYONE, NOVICE OR NOT, TO TRY THIS MIX OUT. ONE THOUGHT ....YOU MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BOX EXACTLY!<br /><br /> I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED EVERY VARIETY OF HODGSON BREAD MIXES AVAILABLE THRU THE "SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE" PROGRAM ON AMAZON AND THE PRICE IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE GROCERY STORE AS WELL AS THE EASE OF DELIVERY.<br /><br /> Hodgson Mill BREAD MIXES ARE ALL EASY TO MAKE AND ALWAYS TASTE GREAT. AFTER A WHILE I MAY LEARN MORE ABOUT BAKING BREAD FROM SCRATCH, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6). TAKE MY NOVICE ADVICE AND TRY THIS, YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY REGRETS!
