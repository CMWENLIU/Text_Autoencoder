I live in Minnesota and love the NO FEAR ENERGY DRINK. I would drink 1 sometimes 2 a day they have a great taste and I did not crash from them. Sometime ago they stopped selling them around here for an unknown reason but through some searching found them on sale on Amazon. I just ordered my first order and received them yesterday AWSOME. I hope some day they bring them back in stores around here.
