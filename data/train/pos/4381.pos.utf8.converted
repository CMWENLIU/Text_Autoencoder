I found this product at a local store and then discovered Amazon's program to deliver to my home monthly.  I signed up for home delivery and received a partial order.  Now it's out of stock.  I do hope this is only a temporary situation.<br /><br />I tried other Ice flavors but none appeal to me like the orange mango. I've tried for years to find a replacement for Coca Cola in attempts to get off sugared drinks and been unsucessful until now. Ice has good carbination, appealing flavor and no sugar although it does have sucralose, an artifical sweetener, also known as Splenda.  At this time, sucralose appears to be less problematic than high fructose corn syrup in soft drinks so I'm sticking with Ice.
