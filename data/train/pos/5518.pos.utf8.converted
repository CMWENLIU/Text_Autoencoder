I don't usually write reviews but I feel I have to share this. First of all, I want to say that this is probably the best deal I've found yet for coconut oil. It smells and tastes wonderful and it arrived quickly! Next...I actually bought this to give to my mother, who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. Recently, I've read quite a few articles that praise coconut oil for helping people with this affliction and decided to give it a try. My mom, who is now on hospice, spends most of her days sleeping. When she is awake, she's in a 'zombie-like' stage. She rarely speaks and doesn't recognize any of her family. She won't eat anymore...only drinks Ensure. Anyway, I brought this to her caregivers and asked them to start mixing it into her Ensure and giving it to her 3x a day. After a week, I went to see her to see if there were any changes. All I can say is WOW!!! Not only was she awake when I went to see her, she recognized me as soon as I entered the room. And here's the really cool part. While I was there visiting, a family member of another resident told me a joke and my mom starting cracking up!! I said, "Wow, mom, you laughed." To which she replied, "Well, it was funny!" I nearly cried! I doubt she'll ever get back to her old self again but if this can help give her a better quality of life, I'll make sure she has a never-ending supply of this wonderful product. Needless to say, I'll be ordering more!
