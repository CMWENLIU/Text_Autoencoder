So, I got my delivery today, and it's a cold day, so I didn't worry hardly anything about refrigeration and popped my first one open right away, stowing 6 others away in the fridge, and giving one to my brother. I try it, and, like many of the others have said, it tasted like normal bottled water, having that mineral taste that I tend to dislike about bottled water; I trudged through it anyway, and sitting, here, with a nearly finished first bottle, I'm feeling better than I did this morning. I have been suffering through sinus problems and a sore throat all week, and it suddenly is gone.<br /><br />I'm not saying that is was caused by the water, but I'm not doubting that it didn't help. Getting past the color and the metallic taste, this product is fine and I'd recommend it to just about anyone.
