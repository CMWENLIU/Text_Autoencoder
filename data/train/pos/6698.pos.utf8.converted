For a product with calories so low, one would expect an icy, grainy dessert. It's not!  Just the opposite, in fact.  It's smooth and creamy and all the flavors taste great.<br /><br />We do all kinds of things to our Arctic Zero to make treats that rival any other ice cream:<br /><br />Extra Peanut Buttery Chocolate:<br />Mix 4 Tablespoons PB2 with a little Splenda and enough hot water to make a saucy consistancy.  Pour over chocolate or chocolate peanut butter Arctic Zero.  Heaven.<br /><br />Pistachio:<br />Crush 1/4 cup shelled pistachios into pieces.  Mix-in this, along with a few drops of almond extract to the vanilla Arctic Zero. So Yum.<br /><br />Tropical Strawberry:<br />Heat some crushed pineapple with a little Splenda and pour over strawberry Arctic Zero.<br /><br />Tropical II:<br />Heat 1/4 cup apple juice, 1 Tablespoon Splenda and 1/2 Teaspoon cornstarch. Add sliced banana disks and warm until sauce is thickened.  Pour over strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, or chocolate peanut butter Arctic Zero.<br /><br />Crispy Chocolate Mint:<br />Slightly crush 1 packet of Quaker 100 calorie pack Chocolatey Mint Mini Delights, and mix-in to vanilla or chocolate Alpine Zero.<br /><br />Cherry Jubilee:<br />Chop up 1/4 cup maraschino cherries and warm with some of it's own juice.  Pour over or mix-in vanilla or strawberry Arctic Zero.<br /><br />These are just a few of our favorites, and you can come up with tons more. But, eating Arctic Zero plain as is, is just great too!
