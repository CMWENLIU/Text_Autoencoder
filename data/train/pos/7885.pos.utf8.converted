Puffiness under your eyes:  not desirable, even embarassing.  This puffiness is caused by a genetic condition or more likely fluid retention due to environmental factors, i.e., sun, pollution, or lifestyle such as too much sodium in the diet, not enough sleep, stress, ageing.... Skin around the eyes is delicate and should be treated with respect.  Better than tea bags and cucumber slices, Coffee Bean Eye Cream smooths on gently, and is Organic with no harsh chemicals or Parabins to be absorbed through the skin.<br />I tried several products with poor results and thought I would always be plagued by this.  However this product works even when I have too much salt or not enough sleep.  I use it daily and am completely satisfied with it.  Perfect!
