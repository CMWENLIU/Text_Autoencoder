If you are looking for a nice GF flour, sorghum is one of our favorites.  We don't use it alone, but mix it in with quinoa that we grind ourselves to make a tasty flour for things like donuts, cakes, etc.  Amazon has the best price that I have found, making this a great thrifty buy for the GF baker.
