I make yogurt twice a week with yogourmet using the yogourmet multi. The family loves it. The timing I use is different than the instructions, it seems to need at least 8 hours to become thick enough. I also let it stand for 2 days in fridge. Afterward, I use hand mixer on low to give it a creamy texture. At that time I add stevia, liquid vanilla & or some type of berry. I jar it up in 8oz canning jars with reusable plastic lids. This way we always have serving size available, easy to grab and go. (I also use raw milk)
