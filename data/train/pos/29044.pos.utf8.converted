I love these noodles. While no one would every mistake them for "spaghetti", they contain zero carbs and fat, zero calories, and zero Weigh Watcher points. Once you rinse them well and heat them up (they don't really need to be cooked), you can pour on any kind of sauce or use them in a stir fry in place of any other Asian noodle and you'll be satisfied in knowing that you can eat your fill but not be going overboard on caloric intake. Of course, if you use a lot of oil or a rich sauce like alfredo (yum), you'll need to take that into account.<br /><br />I used to live near a large international market and was able to pick these up weekly, as I needed them. They were actually not called "Miracle Noodle" but were the same product, with Japanese writing on the bags. They were also about 1/2 the price of Miracle Noodles. However, no longer being able to find them anywhere nearby, I was very happy to order these on amazon. The price seems reasonable, and they were quickly shipped right to my door.<br /><br />I learned from reading other reviews here that these can also be frozen until ready for use. That's a big plus and was pivotal in my decision to order a whole case. I'll probably go through them rather quickly so opted to order them on auto-ship at an additional discount. For those of you who haven't used amazon's auto-ship option, I highly recommend that for any grocery item that you're likely to reorder regularly. You can change the time of your next shipment, skip a shipment, cancel future orders, and amazon notifies you a reminder when it is getting close to the time of your next shipment. Very user friendly!
