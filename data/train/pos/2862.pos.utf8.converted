I'm a low carb dieter, and these noodles are great. One serving has 0 net carbs.  I agree they are not a good replacement for spaghetti noodles. For those i still stick to the shiritaki noodles, they are the best for stir fry and salads though. They don't have any flavor, but they have a really nice crisp texture.
