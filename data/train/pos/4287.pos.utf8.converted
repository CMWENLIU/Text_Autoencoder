I have drunk "english-blends" of tea in various forms and guises. But being a wee bit Scottish, I tend to like everything in life, "maxed-out".  Almost all tea blends from various companies have FAILED to meet my criterion of "Maximum Tea Experience". Now, along comes Yorkshire Gold tea. Yorkshire Gold tea is carefully blended in North Yorkshire England by Taylors of Harrogate, and part of the real secret to this tea is the company's attention to DETAILS.  Now undoubtedly, such teas like ASSAM (from North-East India) will give you some strength, but not always enough brightness.  "Strength" works well at the Middle and FINISH of the flavour gamut, but initially, it is Brightness which catches your palate's attention and then the Stength simply Underscores it.  It's sort of like playing a huge C chord on a concert piano in double octaves and then you gently add a LOW Contra C.  The deep low note brings out the richness of the chord.  The case is the same here with Yorkshire Gold.  So why Yorkshire Gold and not another brand?  The parent company in Harrogate is a superlative corporation who takes great pains at CONSISTENCY.  The magic is in the Details.  I am actually drinking a cup of Yorkshire Gold RIGHT NOW as I type this, and I can tell you, I have never found a company more consistent, attentive to details, and maddeningly insistent upon excellence.  Through myriads of experiments and counter-experiments, Taylors has discovered what GRABS the tea-drinker's "Gustatory" attention, if you will.  But there's more:  this blend both refreshes and relaxes you like none other.<br />Additionally, there is something here to which coffee drinkers may relate: AROMA.  When I make the loose or bag tea variants, both exude an almost beefy richness in bouquet.  The process of mixing furiously boiling fresh water with the tea invaribly and consistently produces a fine aroma akin to the scent of a British Sunday Lunch where a delectable roast beef is the order of the day.  Rich, piquant, and satisfying.  If your brand of tea does not do ALL that I have noted ... consider a change.
