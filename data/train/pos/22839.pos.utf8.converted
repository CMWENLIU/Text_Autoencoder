There are a number of dry dog foods that are nutritionally similar to this. We've tried several of them. My dogs like most foods, but they get bored eventually so we try something new. They love Dogswell Vitality! In fact, I bought this and two other new foods. They immediately preferred this one. No corn/wheat means my dogs won't have digestion problems. Also, one of my dogs needs more bulk, and this food has more fiber than others we've tried.
