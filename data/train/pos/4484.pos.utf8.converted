This alternative to the traditional plastic K-Cup caught my eye immediately because of the price.  I have been buying the basic Ks from Amazon for years, always pretty much around the same price, and have been eager to see the drop in prices once Green Mountain's patent expires on the technology.  This company found a unique way of getting around the patent with these filter-exposed cups.  To our benefit, this brand sells more for less, and that to me was worth the try. I chose the Breakfast Blend because I normally drink the Coffee People Donut Shop, which I too love, and I thought this would be the closest match.  This turned out to be true, both are smooth and not too strong or robust.  Both have good flavor without being over the top.  As for the style of the cup, as all others have said, it does not have the plastic canister look, but rather just the filter, which I personally like.  Unlike the traditional cups, you get a whiff of coffee just before you put it in the machine, which is a nice tease.  I just filled up a Ziplock bag to keep them fresh and it's easy enough.  I'm also keeping the spent cups to use for fertilizer, just cut off the top, dry out the grounds and pour them around your garden.<br /><br />Overall I'd highly recommend this, the price is great and the coffee is very good.  If you are a Coffee People Donut Shop fan like me, you'll enjoy this Breakfast Blend.  If you prefer jet fuel, this will not appeal to you.
