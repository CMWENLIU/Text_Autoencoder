Lady Grey is my favorite tea. I love the enhanced Bergamot. Since I have been forced to switch to the decaf I have found that supply in my local stores is sporadic to none. Having a regular supply shipped has been the answer to my tea anxiety issues. The price is great and the service impeccable. One of my better moves
