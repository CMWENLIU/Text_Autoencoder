Perceptions about this innovative box of flowering teas and accompanying teapot range from "Buyer Beware" to "Gift of the Year."  Here's my take:<br /><br />The Good: 9 tea selections that are unique in bloom, taste and fragrance.  Each bloom yields 3 pots of tea. Lidded Glass teapot to view the spectacular blooming.  2 attractive, reusable and sustainable bamboo boxes (1 containing the individually wrapped flowers and a larger containing the whole kit and caboodle.  Amazon's price, which at wholesale is a steal for this type of handmade, artisan product.  And the sensory experience itself is priceless (though many a tea salon now have put a price on it).<br /><br />The Bad:  All selections do not quite yield 3 pots, and speaking of the pot, yes you may want to invest in a back-up.<br /><br />For the price, I haven't seen a better gift.  The nay sayers are looking for a product that would have to retail at twice the full retail value of this set.  And you don't like the flavors?  Isn't that a matter of personal taste?  It certainly isn't a reflection of the tea quality, which is very good.  To add to your experience, enjoy with friends and afterwards flip through The Tea Box by Gilles Brochard.
