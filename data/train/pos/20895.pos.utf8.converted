I ordered these for my protein shakes to add omega-3 and fiber. I'd never used flaxseed meal before, so I was worried, but the reviews here were go good, I risked the 4-pack with the S&S savings offer.<br /><br />Lovely. Been using it 2 to 3 times a day for my between meal whey/almond milk/flax shakes. The flax has a mild flavor that makes my smoothies lightly reminniscent of malted and wheat shakes my dad made me as a kid.<br /><br />I avoid gluten/malt nowadays, so this is a nice addition to my supplementary nutrients.<br /><br />I need to see how else to work it into my diet, as I cannot eat seafood or take krill or fish oils (allergic), and this is an easy way to add the good omega to my intake.<br /><br />Thanks to all who reviewed it previously. Made it easier for me to take the plunge. :D
