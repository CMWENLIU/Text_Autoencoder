I wanted to try my hand at making my own bread, so I purchased a bread machine.  The King Arthur Flour Baking Companion says according to their tests, the bread machine did the best job kneading bread.<br /><br />The standard recipe for my machine called for using dry milk powder, so I used SACO.  The bread is out of this world!!  Once you open a can, then it has to be refrigerated.  But the crust and crumb of this bread is so much better than what I expected.  I will always keep this product on hand.  It is truly a superior product!!
