Vegan. Organic. Kosher pareve. Very mild. Was interested to try this chili because I especially like barley in soups. The light chili use, mild tomato, barley, and great northern beans make this chili a more white-style chili, as opposed to some chilis that are reddish from lots of chili powder or darker browns from kidney beans. Easy on the tummy. The partially pearled barley is somewhat chewy. Made without texturized vegetable protein (soy) and with maitake mushrooms. I like chili with penne or other shaped pastas, over organic rice, or alone with pitas or any kind of toast. Very mild mushroom flavor note. Hint of spiciness. Great choice for those who prefer a soy-free choice with mushrooms. Great combination of organic ingredients. Also can be used as a base for your own chili by adding more diced fresh veggies, tomato, chilis to taste, and spices. Add water with the added ingredients and simmer to your desired consistency. Made with organic great northern beans, organic barley, organic tomato puree, organic brown rice flour, maitake mushrooms, organic onions, organic chili peppers, sea salt, organic red bell peppers, and organic spices. Labeled vegetarian on the bisphenol-free can, but is also vegan. 400 calories, 18g protein, 2g fat per can. Happiness arises from supporting what one finds to be good.
