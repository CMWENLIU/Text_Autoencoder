I bought the Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macs with sea salt in Hawaii. They were so darn good, I wanted more, but they were very expensive in the supermarket. So, I ordered the 6-pack through Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure why, but the estimated ship time was a few weeks off and I had a hankering for macs. So, I bought a cheaper brand at the supermarket. They were awful; absolutely no flavor. I tried again with a mid-priced brand -- same problem. These I returned to the market.<br /><br />Then, I test-tasted one at Whole Foods. Awful.<br /><br />I started to think that maybe I wasn't remembering it right. Maybe these Mauna Loa macs weren't all that good. Then, finally, they arrived. Oh, my goodness! This is what a mac is supposed to taste like! Fresh, flavorful, just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />These are absolutely the best and, to date, I have not found a substitute. Store brand peanuts...sure. Store-brand -- or any other brand -- macadamia nut? Heck no!
