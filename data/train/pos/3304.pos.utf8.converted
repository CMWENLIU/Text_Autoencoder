This flour is great in cakes and gives them a much lighter texture than say regular all purpose flour.  This cake flour is also made from soft winter wheat which sounds like a gimmick of some kind but it makes a difference in cakes.  The main differences between this and all purpose are that it is finer and contains much less gluten which is great for breads but makes cakes doughy especially if over mixed.  I will sometime use this flour if I want to lighten up one of my existing recipes by replacing 1/2 or 1/3 of the AP flour like if I want a more fluffy Madeline but still have a good crumb.  This flour is definitely not for bread as it lacks the gluten required but it is great for a perfect cakes (I used it in my three tier wedding cake).  Also note that this is not self rising but I prefer that as I can control the amount of leavening agent and salt.  This stuff is awesome for light and airy southern style biscuits ( I can't believe I ever used all purpose).  The flour comes sealed in a bag inside the box which seems to hold the approx 8 cups that I get out of each and although it pre sifted i always sift again for good measure.  Happy Baking!
