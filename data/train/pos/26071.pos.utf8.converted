We have tried several Basmati Rice over the years and finally settled on this brand. It really has full length grain and gives the aroma of a true basmati as it should. Most of the other brands we have tried are either blended rice or not real Basmati at all and were still called Basmati. It is on our regular buy cycle from Amazon. We highly recommend everyone to try it.<br /><br />The basmati rice should only be judged after it is cooked and tasted. We love the fact that this rice is packed in a jute bag which is bio-degradable and not packaged in some fancy plastic box or other material with is not good for our environment. The rice should be washed before it is cooked and soaked for 20-30 minutes for the best results after cooking. Amazon also sells a 2 lb version of this same rice but we like the 10 lb version as it is better price per oz and we consume a whole lot of rice.<br /><br />Update: August 14, 2010<br /><br />Still the same wonderful product and the same aromatic flavor of this perfect rice.
