In dealing with food intolerances, many products have one or two things added that most people even don't notice. They are not worried about what is in the food. After all, if they look they see these seemingly innocent ingredients in so many things they HAVE TO BE SAFE, RIGHT?<br />If you don't have a reaction to that small amount of added ingredient, you see it as no problem. But for the vastly growing number of us in the population, sudden onset of food allergies and intolerances leaves us with very little to eat. What seems to be an innocent ingredient, or even a welcome one if you feel it keeps the product fresher longer.... there is no innocence for those who cannot tolerate it.<br /><br />I was THRILLED after finding I am corn/soy/gluten/dairy intolerant, that I can actually have SOMETHING fun and interesting to eat! Its pure. Nothing added. Its safe!!!<br /><br />This Coconut Cream is lusciously delicious! It can be whipped for whipped cream for those who cannot have dairy. It is very close in consistency to dairy whipping cream.<br />I can finally have a latte again!<br />And my coveted coconut chicken just like the Chinese buffets serve!<br /><br />It should be used within two days of opening, or frozen. Freezing does not harm the consistency in any way.<br /><br />This coconut cream is to die for! The free shipping is a plus!
