I was surprised when I first brewed this tea -- it turned purple!  Turns out it has a delicious blueberry/orange scent which is a surprise since I wasn't expecting any flavor from this tea.  After drinking the tea, I got an energy boost and a clean feeling in my stomach.  It's a good way to keep going without snacking.
