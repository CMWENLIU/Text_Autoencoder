I am trying a low carb, sugar free diet.  I can handle most of it, but living without chocolate really kills me.  I have been searching for a lowcarb, sugarfree chocolate but they all seem to taste like rubber.  That is, until I found this WONDERFUL product.  I didn't buy it for the Hoodia, to be honest...I just wanted chocolate treats without the carbs and the sugar.  I was truly impressed with the flavor (almost too good to be true)but my greatest joy came when I read I HAD TO EAT THREE OF THEM A DAY!!!!  And guess what?  It has cut down my cravings and my overall apetite.  I bought another 4 jars and planning to always have them home!!!!!
