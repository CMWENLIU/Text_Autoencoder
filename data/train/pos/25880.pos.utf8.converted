I am a BIG fan of lollipops, and I have to report that these are, hands-down, the best I've ever tasted. The flavors are original and tasty, and the shape of the pop is just right.  And, I don't have to worry about ingesting the great unknown yellow #5 or red #2.  Go Yummy Earth!  I can't wait to see what these guys come out with next!
