I've been an espresso freak since I first tried one after viewing The Godfather Part II (Don Fanucci downs it in one gulp while talking to the young Vito Coreleone). I used to go to Starbucks every morning, but I eventually decided to buy my own machine (Espressione Cafe Retro)and brew my own. I gravited to pods because they were so much easier and less messy than ground coffee. I buy the Sampler Packs from Podmerchant exclusively, but not because I am attempting through scientific research to find the "best" brand. There is no BEST brand. Sometimes I want something light and tangy, so I'll reach for an Attibassi Nicaragua. Maybe a rich, heavy blast after a big meal? Gotta be a Lucaffe Mr. Exclusive. Early afternoon is the perfect time for a Cafe Mako Napoletano. I like the variety, I like the colorful packaging, I like to be surprised and not know what's coming next! Espresso is a treat, a pure delight, something to be savored. Who wants to savor the same thing over and over? Give me variety, or give me death!
