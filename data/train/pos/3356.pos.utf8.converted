After much research, I finally settled on a cat food brand and by Nature is it! My cats love this food (almost every flavor...) and have been doing great on it. My over wieght boy has slimmed down quite a bit since switching him to only wet food and this brand (mostly, I also feed them some EVO cans as well). One of my favorite things about it is that it doesn't contain any grains, not even rice, and is relatively inexpensive for a quality brand. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to feed their cats a great diet, but don't have the time or money to feed raw.
