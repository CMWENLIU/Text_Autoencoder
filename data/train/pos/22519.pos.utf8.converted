I decided to try rice bran oil when I was on a diet that excluded some other oils and recommended rice bran oil. I tried some from the health food store, and fell in love with the taste, but it was very expensive for a tiny bottle.  I started looking for a bulk source online.  Tophe pure rice bran oil 1/2 gallon, here on Amazon, was the best value I found.<br /><br />It tastes delicious on salads and in cooked foods.  I think it is the most tasty cooking oil I've ever used.  I like it better than olive oil or coconut oil because it doesn't have a strong flavor that would conflict with some foods.  It seems to go with almost everything.  I've ordered this Tophe oil twice now, getting several half gallons each time.  Shipping is a little high, but if you order several at once, it isn't bad at all.
