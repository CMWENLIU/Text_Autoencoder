I wonder if the average person knows how difficult it is for someone with severe food allergies to find packaged preprepared foods they can safely eat?  Let alone something that actually resembles the real thing in taste and texture (without tasting like flavored cardboard).<br /><br />I'm allergic to soy, gluten, wheat and various other foods.  Ingesting even tiny amounts cause life threatening reactions.  As a result I cook most of my own meals from scratch, don't often risk eating out and take "safe" food with me when I travel.<br /><br />Unfortunately soy and gluten seem to be the foundation of most western foods.  So it's really REALLY hard to find foods that don't contain at least one of these ingredients.  So having an option like "Enjoy Life" foods is wonderful.<br /><br />Yes they're small and yes they're rich and calorie laden ... but they taste good and ARE SAFE for ANYONE to eat.  Believe me that's an incredibly bold statement.  So who cares how big they are?!  Besides, at Amazon's prices you can eat more if you want to ...
