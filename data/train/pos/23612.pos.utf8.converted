A hearty, rich, dark coffee, not for those who like a  light, smooth blend. Although my all time favorite  Jeremiah's Pick coffee is the organic breakfast blend whole bean, this is also a great way to start the day. If you don't know Jeremiah's Pick products, they are reasonably priced, excellent coffees that have always arrived at my door very soon after I have placed an order. Check their site for occasional excellent special offers and unusual coffees.
