After diapers & wipes, these are the most important thing in my diaper bag! I'm breastfeeding my son, but we supplement with this formula so my husband can feed the baby (I don't always have enough pumped for a bottle) and for convenience. It is very helpful to have a bottle handy when I'm waiting at the register at the supermarket and the baby is crying to be fed. I love these little, ready-made bottles because they are the perfect size and there is no mixing needed - just shake, open, screw on a nipple, and feed the baby.<br /><br />These don't come with nipples, but you can use regular bottle nipples or get disposable nipples separately. You can buy about 50 disposable Similac nipples from the Abbott store online or use Enfamil disposable nipples (I've used these - they fit fine), which they sell on Amazon.com in packs of 10 or 25.<br /><br />I have two nipples in a ziplock bag and 4 bottles in my diaper bag at all times. There are cheaper feeding options, but for convenience I can't recommend these enough!
