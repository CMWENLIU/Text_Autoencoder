I'm not the world's greatest at describing coffee, but I do know what I like. I tend to prefer dark roasts, and I don't like anything acidic or too bitter. This Tchibo Gold is an excellent choice in a moderately priced ground German-roast coffee. It seems to be a darker roast, and the flavor is bold with a hint of a smoky note. Amazon supplied fresh coffee, and as expected the service was excellent.
