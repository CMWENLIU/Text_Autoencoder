I just finished a 32 ounce bottle of Lakewood Organic Lemonade. What a joy to drink lemonade that tastes great without high fructose corn syrup, sugar, cane sugar, or sugar substitute.  This lemonade has pure agave and white grape juice used for sweeteners; therefore, I can serve it with confidence knowing that it is good for me and my family. I don't think I will ever buy another brand of lemonade again.  Try it . . . you'll love it!
