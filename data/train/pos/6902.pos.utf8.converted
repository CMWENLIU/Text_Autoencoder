Old Review :I am not sure why I bought this, I was curious based on other Neuro drinks which I have had a lot of success. This tastes strange and I don't see any effects of what its supposed to do... That is all I am going to say about that~ Didn't work for me or even give me energy- Neuro has some great drinks, this isn't one of them for me..<br /><br />New Review: Ok so I was reading up on this, it says mixed with alcohol it works well.. There is no disclaimer on the bottle, so I figured what the heck! I mixed with some vodka, and felt good all night! Didn't need more then a couple shots, one bottle of Gasm, it really made me feel good- Now I didn't do what the bottom line is about this drink ( I don't have to say it do I ? ) But it gave me energy, made me relaxed and I slept great- Woke up feeling good as well!  Not sure if this is my new alcohol companion but it works well with drinks! :) Even better with Champagne! ;)
