I purchased this product after trying everything to lose weight. I just happen to find an ad for cleansing and Acai berry weight loss things.  So I searched in Amazon for something. I've only had it for two weeks and haven't weighed myself so I can't say how much I've lost.  But I can tell you that I've completely lost my hunger for food.  I'm 90-100lbs overweight.  I love food especially fast food because cooking is not fun for me.  It is not uncommon for me to eat fast food at the very least once a day.  I didn't notice the first two days but day three I was debating what to eat for dinner and realized I couldnt decide which fast food place I wanted to drive though because I wasn't even hungry or craving anything to decide.  Then the next day it happened again, and the next.  Today is Sunday and usually the weekends I just want to eat everything because I have nothing else to do but watch tv and eat out of boredom or for flavor.  I now actually have to tell myself to eat. Believe me, I LOVE food.  I eat for flavor.  Now suddenly I don't even care to eat.  Maybe its mental but I've never not been hungry.  So after going nearly all day without wanting to eat.  Crazy, I know, I finaly made up my mind to go get a chicken sandwich from BK.  I made it half way and actualy put the other half down.  Never in my life have I stopped eating at the first sign of fullness.  Thats just a small part of my weight issues.  I have to clean the plate. Thats when I knew I had to write a review.  I drank it plain and its not that bad.  But I suggest drinking it with orange juice.  I don't even notice it.  It doesn't change the flavor at all.  Just the color of the orange juice changes a bit.  I still can't believe I didnt eat the whole dang sandwhich.  As for will it help lose weight?  I guess if it surpresses appetite, you eat less, therefore less calorie consumption.  And if you excercise thats just more bonus.  We'll see.
