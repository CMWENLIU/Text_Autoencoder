My wife and I as well as other family members really like this brownie as a low calorie snack. No, it does not taste the same as the mouth watering chocolate brownies with hundreds of calories that my local bakery sells. But for a low calorie brownie it tastes pretty good. Here is why we like it.<br /><br />1. This has a soft texture, but it's not too crumbly.<br /><br />2. This has a good chocolate taste unlike some of the other low calorie chocolate items that I have tried.<br /><br />3. For me this is not too dry, but rather is moist enough.<br /><br />4. Although this is not a health food bar, it does have 5g fiber, only 8g sugar, 100mg sodium and 1.5g saturated fat. So beside being low in calories, it is not junk food.<br /><br />Shop for price. I currently buy a 38ct Box at my local Costco for just under twelve dollars.
