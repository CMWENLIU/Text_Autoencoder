Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Antioxidant Variety Pack<br />We've loved this variety so far. I never noticed it when my son was eating baby food, but now my daughter has one at least once a day. They tend to be a veggie heavy variety and my daughter would rather have veggies than fruit most days. The only one in the variety she can't eat so far is the Banana Mango, because of an allergy to mangos, but I'm hoping to save those for a later date when she can tolerate it better.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this product was that when I initially was deciding to purchase it I couldn't find out what varieties were included in the pack. So for your information they are: Carrot Tomato, Sweet Potato Apricot, Apple Butternut Squash, and Banana Mango.
