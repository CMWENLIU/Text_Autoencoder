I bought this item for my boss and he seemed very happy. It appears exactly like what it looks in the picture, tucked up with two fancy starbucks mugs in a beautiful basket. Altogether a decent and sophisticated gift. The only thing that I didn't like was the paper in which the company was supposed to print my message..it looked like a cheap dirty paper, but you can always exclude the paper.
