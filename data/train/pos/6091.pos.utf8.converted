I have a son who is very particular about his food. There are never any complaints about Annie's Classic Mac&Cheese!! I also have a 13 yr old nephew who wont touch anything other than "thee" national brand, except for when it comes to Annie's Classic M&C. He loves it and even asks for it when he visits. I really like the fact that it does NOT call for butter. Just combine milk with the provided cheese packet and that's it!! This has been a real winner in our home and we make sure to always have some on hand by purchasing it in bulk on autoship!
