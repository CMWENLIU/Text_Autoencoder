Women! Listen up! This tea is for you!<br />This tea has so many good properties, it is simply amazing! You get lots of health benefits from drinking it daily: it is said to help with nausea, ease labor and delivery, and post- partum recovery. It is also helpful for regulating menstrual periods and controlling diarrhea. And as if that were not enough, it also acts as an astringent on irritated skin by tightening the top layers of skin or mucous membranes, it reduces secretions, relieves irritation, and improves tissue firmness. As a mouth wash, you can use it to soothe mouth and throat irritations.<br />It does not have much flavor, but you can pair it with mint leaves and it will tate very nice. The color of this tea is amazing, considering that the leaves are just green! It yields a nice, golden hue!
