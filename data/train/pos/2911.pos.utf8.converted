This is a tasty product, but I want to alert other malted milk lovers that this is not suitable for simply stirring into a glass of milk with a spoon. It does not dissolve as well as the Carnation/Nestle malted milk powder.<br /><br />It is perfect for drinks where you are using a blender to mix everything together, but if you just stir it with a spoon you will end up with malt powder floating on top of your drink.<br /><br />As far as taste, I think it does taste richer and more genuinely "malty" than the Carnation/Nestle product. There's a kind of bread/beer/bakery overtone in the flavor that makes it taste more old fashioned.
