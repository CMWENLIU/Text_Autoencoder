seriously.  this is amazing.  who knew you could order frozen food products on amazon?  if you haven't tried it yet, you have got to get on the gelato classico train . . . it is sooooo good.  i haven't tried a flavor i don't like yet and it's healthier than ice cream so, wheee!  delicious and i'd definitely recommend it (obviously) to anyone.  if you're an ice cream eater, try this and you'll never go back.  i don't even look at ice cream the same way anymore . . . try the dark chocolate with fresh strawberries: instant legend status.
