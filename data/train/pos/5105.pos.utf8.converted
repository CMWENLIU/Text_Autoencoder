I am constantly on the lookout for new ways to cook fish and avoid a bit of red meat.  This curry paste tastes great and is so fast.<br /><br />No one yet has detailed the preparation so here goes, take notes, it's complicated:<br /><br />1. Dump 1 lb of firm white fish into a pan.<br />2. Put in the paste and 2/3 cup water.<br />3. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer for 10 minutes.<br /><br />Serve over rice (what I did), roti,or naan(?)<br /><br />I put some coriander in at the last minute to give it some color, and added some onions.  Very good. Hot (I sweated a bit) but good hot.  They suggest adding 2 tbs grated coconut as a variation, I think it will be just as good with shrimp or shellfish as with the cod I used.<br /><br />Very pleased.
