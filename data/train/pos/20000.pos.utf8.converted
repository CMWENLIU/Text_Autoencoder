Illy is the perfect espresso blend for people who haven't invested in a $600 burr grinder. Instead of trying to describe its qualities, let me relate a story:<br /><br />This summer we went on a houseboat vacation where I was subjected to God-awful drip coffee for a week.  As soon as we got off the boat I hit up a  Starbucks, which was of course disappointing.  Then, when I got home, we were out of Illy.<br /><br />On Monday morning I tried to make my espresso with some of Trader Joe's Espresso Blend, and while I love the Trader's, their espresso is horrible.  Finally at lunchtime I was able to find some Illy.  I was so thrilled that on the way home from work I had to pop the top, just to smell its deliciousness.  When I finally got home and pulled myself a shot, I was in heaven.<br /><br />It's like an addiction, a craving.  And in 6 months of searching since I got my espresso machine, I haven't found better nationally available coffee.
