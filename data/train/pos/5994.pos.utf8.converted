I recently gave up coffee & made the switch to teas.  I've tried all the usual suspects.  Lipton & other grocery blends were bitter or weak.  I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a fair price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips Tea, which we ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  The Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose.
