I am a coffee drinker who considered instant coffee flavored water rather than coffee.  Recently I was in a Costco where samples of the Starbucks instant coffee being served.  I tried it and was amazed at the full flavor of this coffee.<br />It's a little pricey to drink it every day but it will be going on the road with me and I will be saying good-bye to the bad hotel coffee.
