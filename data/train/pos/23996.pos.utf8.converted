Soy-based "meat" products can often be a hit or miss affair, but my family has consistently found the LL Big Franks product to be on the tasier side of the spectrum (even through several manufacturer recipie modifications).  If you are looking for hot dogs for grilling, however, try the frozen Morningstar Veggie Dog product -- for our taste, Big Franks are much better at room temperature.  Price-wise, buying through Amazon is less expensive than at our local health food shop -- not even factoring in the free shipping vs. gas used to physically go to the store.
