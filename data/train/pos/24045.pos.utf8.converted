I'm a soda (or pop) enthusiast who has tried pretty much every kind of soft drink there is throughout the states. I seem to vaguely remember seeing Hires a time or two in stores when I was a kid, but it has been very elusive in the past two decades in my experience. A couple years ago, I was reading about Vernors ginger ale on Wikipedia one day and found out that it (Vernors) was along with Hires root beer one of the first sodas marketed in the U.S., even long before Coca-cola. This really sparked my interest and I started searching high and low for it on the internet with virtually no luck as it was not available on Amazon at that time. I saw some on sodafinder.com but learned from customer reviews that a lot of the soda they sell is expired. Finally, I called customer service at Dr. Pepper/Snapple and they told me that it was in low production but could be found at Schnuck's Pharmacy in Bettendorf, IA. Delighted, I packed a few things (neglecting my cell phone charger) and departed for the 14 hour or so drive to Iowa. Luckily, this was during my week of summer vacation so I had time to do it.<br />Long story short, I made it to Schnuck's and bought some for $7.29/12-pack. About six months later I returned to Iowa to visit my friend who goes to Iowa State in Ames and picked up a couple more 12-packs but we drank it all and I had to buy more on the way home.<br />Its taste is really unique in my opinion, a little sweeter and spicier than most, but I don't think it's just my imagination when I say it tastes better than A&W (which has a strong vanilla presence), Mug, Dad's, Frostie, or even Boylan's. It's nothing at all like Barq's which I don't like and has caffeine. Maybe it's the 135 years of Hires' existence and experience that makes it the best root beer. All I know is that why Hires is no longer the premier root beer in the United States is beyond me.
