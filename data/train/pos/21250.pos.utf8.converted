I tried these out last weekend just as the temps have started to dip and I was not disappointed! I expected a very fake and chemical tasting brew but was pleasantly surprised that I got neither! I was very happy to ready that there are no artificial ingredients in this one too! This is a great alternative for when you want something different from coffee and tea. If I had to point out anything bad about them, maybe that the flavor is almost too sweet? If you brew it on your smallest cup setting (mine is 5oz for the Keurig B60 Special Edition) it is a tad tooo strong but in the medium size offerning its just right.  I hate having to buy 2-packs though...
