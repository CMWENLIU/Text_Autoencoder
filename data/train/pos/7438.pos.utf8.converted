I would second everything stated in the review by J. Eisenhauer, except that I would definitely rate the product EXTREMELY HOT.  Mind you, that is not meant as a complaint, but rather a compliment.  Even when cooking a potful of food, you generally do not need more than one drop of Satan's Blood added to the mix.  (And heck, if you then find you do want more heat you can always add another drop!)  The result will be a very robust level of hotness that will enhance the flavor of the food.  Just watch for any redness on your fingers after handling the bottle, and if you see any, wash thoroughly and NEVER rub your eyes first!  This is VERY serious stuff.  Handle with care, and enjoy the results!
