I have used this since it came out and as the sole iced tea drinker in my family I find it very handy. I can use a couple of these bags in a small pitcher and have tea when I want it all day. The flavor is excellent and will not leave you as nervous when you're off on a real tea bender. Often, for my sweetener I use Splenda and peach syrup half and half. Or try it sweetened your way and use 1/2 of an orange and 1/2 of a lemon. The possibilities are endless.
