Excellent Coffee..I bought it by mistake...I have a Keurig coffee maker.They didn't fit.I was going to send them back to Amazon.But,It work out in such a way. that I was able to keep them!!!So,we just made a hole in their little filter and poured the coffee into my Keurig filter.And talk about NUMMY!!! Such good coffee!!!I will be buying more from this seller and in the Kona flavor.love love love it!  :)
