This is an excellent product, although it hasn't helped me lose weight yet, but I ran out of it before maximizing all its benefits.  The main uses have been for our dog (added a couple tablespoons to her food to help her skin), our dry skin, and even "intimate" moments (it's better than anything else we have tried).  Since coconut oil is a natural ingredient, hypoallergenic and antibacterial, it's perfect for inside and outside of our bodies (except perhaps, for eyes and ears).  My husband has eczema and it's been one of the most helpful products we have found.
