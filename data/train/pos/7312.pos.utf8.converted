OK, I had actually heard about these things through the local supermarket that I currently work at, had seen them on display before, but never really paid much attention to them, except for when they were gone. Apparently they're only sold around holiday seasons around here for some odd reason.<br /><br />Anyway, I had read reviews that gave them high marks all around, and as soon as I saw these, I knew I had to try a box. So, after clocking out, I went and snagged a box, paid and immediately went to my car and opened that box. Needless to say, I was hit with a nice aroma, and had a feeling I was in for a treat. After I popped one into my mouth, and tasted it, I was hooked.<br /><br />The "jell" held within has a nice consistancy, it's comparable to those jelly orange slices that one usually finds in those Sathers 2 for 1 dollar packs, though flavor wise, it's way tastier than those suckers could ever hope to be. It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of raspberry flavor to harmonize with the dark chocolate coating outside. Needless to say, that box that I bought? It did not make it home. Not even half way, that's how addictive these things are. You gotta give Joyva credit for staying kosher, and creating such a tasty treat.<br /><br />Without a doubt I'll be keeping my eye out for these badboys alot more now, and might even end up buying a big box for family get togethers. These are awesome, and definitely worth giving a shot.
