In a time when everything seems GMO or hybrid-ized to utterly unrecognizable, the ancient strain of wheat -- Spelt is a refreshing find in today's fast food world.  While I am not gluten sensitive, I do find that my system can tolerate Spelt products much more than our modern strains of wheat.  Perhaps it is because Arrowhead Mills Whole Grain Spelt Flour is organic, but whatever the reason this flour is the only one that I use when making whole wheat breads, muffins, pancakes, pie crusts and more.  As a whole foods cook, Arrowhead Mills helps me to stock my pantry with a variety of grains, pulses, seeds and beans...and Amazon makes it easy for me to order just what I need, when I need it.
