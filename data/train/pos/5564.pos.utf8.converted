Weight Watchers point that is.  The bag is one point.  A great, healthy snack to incorporate into your WW diet, or any other healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />I haven't had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I've tried, no more than any other dried fruit I'd buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones.  It's definitely a small bag for the price, so if you're near a Trader Joes, you should really buy their dried fruits.<br /><br />Amazon does have a great price for this item though... I paid $1.79 for one packet at a major chain!!  That's insanity.
