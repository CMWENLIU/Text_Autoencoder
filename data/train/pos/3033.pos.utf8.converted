Some researchers say that Omega 3 is one of the most important nutritional deficiencies in the US.  Salmon is rich in Omega 3 oils, yet it is recommended to add Omega 3 fish oil supplements even if we eat salmon frequently-just to give one an idea of how much we need to add Omega 3 to our diets. Sockeye salmon is very sustainable and healthier to eat than other kinds of salmon.  It cannot be farmed because of its eating habits.  It eats algea and insects, leaving this kind of salmon to be the least carnivorous and lower on the food chain, thus, the lowest in environmental contaminants, such as mercury.<br /><br />With that said, this brand is canned in its own natural juices/oils. Skinless- very mild taste. Pull-tab lid. Can be eaten straight from the can. (I take this and some veggies to work for a quick, healthy lunch)<br /><br />If you like salmon, and/or you are trying to eat more of it, you've gotta try this one!
