I just finished off my first box of "McCann's Imported Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal". And boy did it go fast! Not because I didn't get my money's worth, but because it was so good. I usually have Oatmeal about 3 times a week, and have always been real loyal to Quaker Oats(not the instant), but I gave these a try and it is now my new favorite, and I have them almost every day now..<br /><br />Following the cooking directions(this was my first time with a quick cook oatmeal),and cooking just a few minutes(add the oats and cold water together, boil and stir for 3-5 minutes), the oatmeal came out perfect for me the first time, and does every time. With the suggested 1/2 cup Irish Oatmeal to 1 Cup Water, the consistency, for me was perfect. Just a little creamy, and not too soggy. The taste was the big test though, and I loved it. I am cutting out sugar whenever I can, but my Quaker was still one place I used just a little, so I just tried a little non-fat soy milk on the McCann's, and occasionally a spritz of a butter flavored cooking spray(just to have a little variety everyday), and I didn't even miss the sugar at all. Of course, you can experiment by adding a little more oats if you like it a little thicker, or more water for a thinner consistency. Honey, raisins or other fruit go great with it too.There are also instructions for micro-wave use.<br /><br />If you are a die-hard Quaker fan, and don't want to just dive right in and buy a 6 pack, you can find this brand at the Trader Joe's stores. I also saw the "McCann's Steel Cut Oats" there as well, which I haven't tried yet.<br /><br />There is no sodium, sugars, or cholesterol. It's low fat and calorie(2gm/150 per 1/2 cup dry serving). A good source of fiber and is pure and natural. Ingredients..100% Irish wholegrain oats. There are several different kinds of these oats available. Click on "McCann's" at top to see the other selections.This one is the "quick cook"(not instant), has a gold trimmed box, with a creamy colored background and "Irish Oatmeal" on a green banner.<br /><br />A satisfying meal that will keep you going until lunch.<br /><br />Okay, so, remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy!.....Laurie
