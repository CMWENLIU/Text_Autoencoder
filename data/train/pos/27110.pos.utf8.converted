Some of this stuff can get rather expensive but this particular brand is the most cost effective product of its kind that I have come across and it still delivers the unique and delicious flavor you are looking for.  I was a bit skeptical at first, due to the price, but after tasting it at a friend's house, I became a true believer.  Like another reviewer here, I add a dash to steamed veggies and a wee bit to some of my salad dressings and to be frank, it will tickle your tongue while knocking your socks off.  The best part is that you get all this quality and you do not have to lay awake at nights worrying about what you spent on the stuff.
