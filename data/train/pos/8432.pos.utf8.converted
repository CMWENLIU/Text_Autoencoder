Going on a regular basis to Holland, I got to know the Philips Senseo coffee machine well. I even have one in my condo overthere. Since I knew that the machine was introduced in North America I tried to buy one in Canada. But no such luck, the machine is only available in the USA, too bad. I bought one in the US, including the whole stock of Douwe Egberts dark roast coffee pods in the local U.S. Wall Mart. I thought that I could order more supply over the internet only to find out that shipping is only available in the U.S. Shame on  Philips and Douwe Egberts for not introducing the machine and the coffee in Canada as well.<br /><br />I can really recommend the dark roast coffee pods, the machine works very well, but I would even be more happy if I could go to my own (Canadian) store and buy the stuff instead of asking my mom to bring the coffee from Holland, where they have by the way more coffee varieties such as mocca, French vanilla etc.<br /><br />Henny de Gruijter,<br /><br />Sooke B.C., Canada
