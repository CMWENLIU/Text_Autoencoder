this is thee best hot chocolate. reminds me of doing "las posadas" at christmas in school and, afterwards, having buns and mexican hot chocolate. my family begs for this as a treat - it costs quite a penny in stores - even at walmart. definitely cheaper here.  this is the same taste of the whole tabs, but without the work.
