This is one canned juice drink that I really like. Its not too sweet and has a nice clean flavor. The only things that I didn't really care about is that its a little over carbinated for me, and there isn't really enough of it when I'm used to 16 oz. size or larger drinks. The cans could be at least a little bigger.<br />  One other thing that I really liked about it is a little shot of Spiced Rum goes good with it too.
