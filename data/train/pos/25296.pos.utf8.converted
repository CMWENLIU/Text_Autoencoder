That fat part of the snow man is the key to making the Kong work for your dog, meaning keeping it engaged.  I also like to throw a little peanutbutter inside and freeze it overnight. My dog lines up to go into the crate every morning (for years) since that's the only place he gets his Kong (w/tricky treat :-)
