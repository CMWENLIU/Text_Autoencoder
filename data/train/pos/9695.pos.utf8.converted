I recently dined at the Melting Pot Fondue restaurant. I ordered this yummy martini, and it was so good, I asked for the recipe. They were very kind to share it with me, but said I would NEVER find the secret ingredient Monin raspberry syrup. Well, that drink was so good, I was determined to lay my hands on this syrup! Luckily, I found it on Amazon!! Here is the recipe:<br /><br />Lemon Raspberry Martini<br /><br />2 oz Limoncello<br />1/2 oz Grey Goose vodka<br />1/4 oz Monin Raspberry syrup<br />1 oz cranberry juice<br />1/2 oz sweet sour mix (liquid)<br /><br />Mix all ingredients together in a shaker with lots of ice. Strain into two martini glasses. Add a twist of lemon and ENJOY!!!
