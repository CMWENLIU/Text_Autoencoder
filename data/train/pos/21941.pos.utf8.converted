We do not let our children drink soda, ("pop") so this is a wonderful substitute. They can't stand flavored seltzer water, but love this stuff. I have tried it myself, and it is really really good. Much better than Izzy. The orange tastes just like Fanta - I can't tell the difference. Highly recommended if you don't want processed sugar in your kid's drink.
