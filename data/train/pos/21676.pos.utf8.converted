Another reviewer seems to have missed a point that is so important to those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.  This is from the Bear Naked product description:  "Packaged in a facility that processes wheat, nuts, soy and dairy."  Bakery on Main is gluten free, and in my opinion is quite delicious.  So for those who must avoid all traces of gluten, and want to choose a product that isn't processed at a facility that also processes wheat, rest assured that you are buying a delicious product with Bakery on Main products.  I discovered their products at Life Grocery in Marietta, GA, a few months ago, and I've been hooked ever since.  I don't care for the apple variety, but the others are great.
