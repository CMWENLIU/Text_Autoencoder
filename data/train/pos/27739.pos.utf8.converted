Sent for Mom's birthday (she turned 81), thought this would be nice to send to her.  Mom loved the basket, it arrived a day earlier than what Amazon said it would!  She loved the snacks,complained about the weight she was going to gain, so I took that as a good sign.  It was a perfect order. She is picky, so I consider this a home run!
