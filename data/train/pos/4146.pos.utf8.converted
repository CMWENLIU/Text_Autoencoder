These little things are gems. They store heat from your "too hot" coffee and release it later. Really perform great in an insulated mug adding hours to my coffee's drink ability.<br /><br />They are not:<br />-Ice cubes<br />-A miracle<br /><br />Best used with:<br />-Insulated coffee mug<br />-With a cover<br /><br />I use three in an older Thermos insulated coffee mug and my coffee stays hot for about 5 hours and still is warm enough to enjoy for a few hours after that. Before Joulies my coffee was too hot then just right and then cold after about two hours.<br /><br />Main point:<br />The coffee stays at about 140 degrees for hours so it can be enjoyed. Expanding the window of comfortably hot drinking temperature.
