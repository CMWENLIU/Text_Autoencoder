The Back to Nature Crispy Cheddars are a fantastic snack.  My children wouldn't go to school without them.  These are a perfect size for lunchboxes.  This snack is the best of both worlds.  They are both delicious and healthy.  They are made without high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils.  This is a much better choice and at a great price.
