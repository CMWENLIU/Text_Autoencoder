I love this powder. I've used it in drinks and desserts and just love the flavor and reddish color it produces. It has kind of a tart flavor but is still neutral enough to use in any sweet dish. I've also used it as a drink (like kool-aid, only healthy). I just added a bit of honey with the powder and some water and it was delicious. So fast and easy. The best thing about this product is that since it's freeze-dried whole fruit, you get all the nutrients and enzymes in a convenient easy to use powder. On top of that the price is reasonable considering how much you get. I can't imagine how many pomegranates it takes to make one bag but I'm sure it's a lot and pomegranates are expensive and hard to get. Unlike the other reviewer I had no problems with the bag at all, seals just fine and I've had it for a month now. Very happy with this product.
