We eat a lot of basmati rice and the Royal brand is our favorite.  It has a superior flavor and aroma over the other basmatis we've tried, and the grains cook up so much nicer and fluffier.<br /><br />To truly appreciate this fine rice, I would highly recommend following the directions to rinse the rice first.  It DOES make a difference.
