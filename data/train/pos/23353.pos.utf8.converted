I'd also go with Mountain House for pilot crackers which could be used for survival food. Since we had a situation where a family member was trapped in an unexpected blizzard, I think these might be worth keeping in the trunk of a car. My husband and I thought they were plenty tasty, even without butter, jam or jelly. I wouldn't buy these to have as a snack food in the house if  we weren't in an emergency. At $7.19 per box, why pay the price for a snack food?<br /><br />They also have these advantages for short-term emergencies (very short-term):<br /><br />1. The outside package contains individually sealed packages with 4 crackers in each. This means that even after you open the main package, you still have 4 sealed packages, each containing 4 crackers, which should remain fresh and ready to use because of the individual packaging. Of course, we had to open and taste one of the inside packages.<br /><br />2. They don't taste salty at all. We weren't thirsty after eating them. If you were stuck in a car for 2 or 3 days, these would supplement whatever you had on hand, with enough calories per pack to keep you alive, although not thriving unless you had other food or drinks, since two crackers have 140 calories in them. A pack of 4 has nearly 300 and most people need a minimum of 1200 calories per day. With a jar of unsalted peanut butter, you would have significantly more calories.<br /><br />The average person with only minor heath issues is not going to starve in two days, even on a very low calorie diet, especially if there is snow to melt and drink. That is just my take. Many people regularly fast for a day or two because of religious beliefs and as long as they are basically healthy they get by just fine. However, you'd burn off far more calories if you body was struggling to stay warm.<br /><br />With the shelter of a car and an emergency heat-retaining blanket as well as extra blankets or sleeping bags which can withstand very low temperatures, you could probably get by even if the car battery died. It would depend on how temps go and we have not tested any supplies in very extreme conditions, including heat-retaining blankets.<br /><br />3. They would also come in handy at work if you were stuck for a couple of nights in an office building, the power was out and any snack machines were either empty or impossible to easily open. Our city was struck with a blizzard like that and people weren't able to leave work for about 2 days. Food ran out, although water was readily available.<br /><br />Some that were used to eating regular meals got very grumpy when the blizzard had them facing unplanned fast. These could help alleviate hunger pangs without causing too much thirst. We found these crackers relatively filling and they did help keep hunger at bay for hours (just our experience) even though we jog every morning. You'd probably still get very hungry overnight without extra food.<br /><br />4. An entire box would only be enough for one person for about 2 days but would probably work best for only an overnight situation.  Overnight, you could manage to help 1-4 people get a snack. Again, each pack only has about 300 calories so these would be best for 1-2 people but if you had other emergency food, it could help as many as 4 people get by (and more than that, if you had extra supplemental food).<br /><br />5. They are very lightweight. You could take them on a camping trip, perhaps in a waterproof sealed container. But they wouldn't last long in a pinch and you'd need to either fish or catch other food or have some more emergency food on hand.<br /><br />To sum it up, I'd think of these only as a snack food and good for work or keeping in your automobile trunk in case of an emergency lasting a day or two. They could also be part of your camping supplies because they are so light. During a camping trip, they'd provide an alternative to other starches. It would be reassuring to know there was something to eat, however minimal, in a pinch and you could carry them in an emergency backpack as long as you had means to get more food.<br /><br />For longer periods of time without other food? Go with something that has more calories and more crackers for longer hauls.
