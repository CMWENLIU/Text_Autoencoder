Literally from the second I unwound the string from the wand my male cat went CRAZY!!! The jumps, bounds and excitement this toy creates are truly fun and inspiring to watch and create (laugh out loud fun, and many loud sighs of wow! oh! etc).<br /><br />You won't want to put this toy away - and your kitties won't want you to either (they are crying for it right now!)  It's never been so much fun to play with this toy.  My three are about 5 months old and full of energy - but this toy really works them out - you can see the panting and feel their little hearts beating - but they don't want to stop!!!<br /><br />I wish my house was bigger so they could really bound far without having to occasionally bounce off furniture and walls.  I am tempted to try it out in my backyard to see how high they really could jump!
