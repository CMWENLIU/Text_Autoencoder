Sriracha's a great early morning pick-me-up on the ol omlet.  It's also great on pizza, stirfry, soups, panini sandwiches (spritz a little atop the cheese the next time you make one, and see for yourself), etc.  Great for livening up roasted red pepper hummus, tomato sauces, mayonnaise, you name it.  The uses are innumerable.<br /><br />I'm a self-avowed chili-head, and I've tried more chili sauces than I can easily count.  Everyone has their favorite styles and brands, and I'm no different, because this happens to be one of mine.<br /><br />The thing I like about Sriracha is how the flavor and texture of freshly ground sun-ripened red chilies shine through cleanly ... there are no gritty/bitter seeds, no oxidized flavors from using reconstituted dried chilies, no caramelized/overcooked flavors, no competing heavy mismatched flavors/spices, no mouth pucking wretched excesses from being pickled in cider vinegar and salt, no fatiguing smoke flavors, no fruit juices, no excessive heat, no thermonuclear oil essence extracts, etc.  Most of those things have their time, place and uses, and good examples of each abound ... but not here.<br /><br />No.  Sriracha is just plain, beautiful, de-seeded, unobstructed, sun-ripened fresh red chili flesh, with just barely enough garlic, salt, vinegar and sugar to round it out, plus a little gaur gum to thicken it slightly, and a little sorbate for extend it's freshness.  That's it.  It's pleasantly piquant, but not overly so.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />p.s. A convenient fallback for me, whenever Sriracha is unavailable, is Franks RedHot Original.
