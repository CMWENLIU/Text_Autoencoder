I do a lot of low carb baking and know a lot of folks who do either low carb or are diabetic and do the same.  This can be expensive if you cannot find a good price on the ingredients.  While trying to locate a source for unsweetened coconut, I was led to Amazon.com where a sale on Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour happened to be occuring.  I had been used to paying much more for a much smaller bag of almond flour through the health food section of my grocery store.  I was so pleased to find a source of the flour at almost half price plus a special of free shipping.  There were 4-16 oz packages to a box shipped in a reasonable amount of time in the original carton that is purchased for display by grocery stores so I know it was fresh.  I let everyone I know about the great prices on low carb supplies available at Amazon.
