It seems that jasmine green teas fall into two disappointing categories:<br />No matter how pretty the packaging, they are either harsh and bitter with jasmine dust and tea stem rather than flower and tea leaves, or they are gussied up by the addition of some other flavor, usually citrus.<br />Then there is Triple Leaf.<br />It gets it's own category and it stands alone.<br />This jasmine green tea delivers consistently in it's perfect blend of perfume and tea.<br />One never overpowers the other.<br />I brew 3 bags (torn open & loose) in a 32 oz. french press every morning and leave it on the counter to sip all day long. It never develops a bitter flavor, but seems to ripen to a full, beautiful taste.<br />The only drawback to Triple Leaf is that it isn't sold in loose form.<br />I buy it by the case and find that the unused boxes store very well.<br />The last box is always as fresh as the first.<br />Happy Sipping!
