This is the only food we have fed our 1 year old female German Shepherd after the breeder recommended it.  She loves it.  She has lots of energy and no skin or digestive issues at all.  Her coat is beautiful and shiny.  We followed the feeding recommendations on the bag. She has grown to her full size and is not at all overweight like some other dogs we know that are fed the grocery store brands.  Many people have commented on what a beautiful dog she is.  I attribute this to the well balanced diet of Royal Canin.
