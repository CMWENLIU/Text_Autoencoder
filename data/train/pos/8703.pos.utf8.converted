Bottom line:  If you like bacon (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), you'll love this product.  It's two of John Candy's favorite things wrapped into one - bacon and salt.<br /><br />I am one for combining things that make sense.  Shampoo and conditioner.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Paris Hilton and an electric chair.  Bacon and...well, anything.  I can put bacon with any dish and it'll taste great.  Eggs, salads, steaks, macaroni, etc.  Now, I just put a little of this Bacon Salt on whatever I'm eating, and it tastes like a million bucks.<br /><br />I'm not one to look at the back of the bottle, so you'll have to go elsewhere for the health exploits of the product (however, as far as I know, it's low on sodium).  For the taste, however - you can't go wrong, as long as you like BACON.<br /><br />RATING - BUY...NOW.
