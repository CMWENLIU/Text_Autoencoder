Salt comes in a sturdy aluminum pouch with a screw cap. We live in South Texas where the humidity can turn salt into a brick overnight. This packaging keeps the salt nice and dry. Salt is finely ground which we liked as most dishes require a pinch. Taste is very mild and doesn't bite you with lingering after taste like regular table salt can do. 5 Stars
