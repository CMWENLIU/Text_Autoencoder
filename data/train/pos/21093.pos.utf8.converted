I tried this jam based on a review I read on Amazon.  I thought such rave reviews merited a try.  I was not disappointed.  It was GREAT. Loaded with fresh summer berries the jam looks like something you'd see in a picture perfect photo in some great foody magazine.  The taste is equally appealing reminding me of some homemade treasure Grandma pulls out of her pantry or something served in a fine french bistro.<br /><br />We've tried it on toast, scones, pancakes, even vanilla ice cream.  We had 6 weeks of company this summer and I ordered a case for us all to enjoy.  Had to order another case before the last of my company left.  Most everyone wrote down the name so they could order it for themselves.<br /><br />Now after raving about this jam I have to let you know that I'm not a huge fan of jam but my family does enjoy it so we always have jam on hand.  Usually strawberry jam is their preference, in fact. But... THIS JAM made ME want to make toast for breakfast just so I could slather some on buttered toast.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />My only question is this... any thoughts as to what one could do with many cases of darling empty jam jars?  I think this could be a great country craft waiting to happen.
