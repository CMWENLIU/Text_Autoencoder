I haven't bought this on Amazon, but I have tried it and it is delicious! It has different flavors and textures from the cinnamon and raisins, and while a little higher in sugar than normal PB, it's totally worth it. YUM.<br />I really want to try other PB & Co.'s flavors-- particularly the  cookie dough one! :)
