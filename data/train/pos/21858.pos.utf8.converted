We have a picky eater who has allergies.  A friend of our clued us in to the fact that dogs with allergies could have problems with grain in dog food.  Researched a little on the internet and turns out there's a lot of merit to that.  We selected Rachel Ray's because it had more meat than most (we just walked Wal-Mart and compared labels till we narrowed it down to two).  Our dog goes hungry before eating food she doesn't like and she gobbles this stuff up.  After 9 months we have noticed her allergies are completely cleared up as well.  Eye buggars and profuse feet licking (the vet said she's allergic to grass - really!)  So after 6 years, apparently we don't need the eye drops and the foot spray.  Just needed to change up her dog food.  Vet didn't mention that either... amazingly the guy who sells us the medicines - go figure!
