I bought this to have on the shelf for a quick meal.  It is very very rich and I suspect would fare better as a cup appetizer before a full meal, and not as a meal.  I think most people would enjoy it.  I am not certain, however, that I will repeat the purchase.  I think I am more satisfied with a homemade potato soup.
