One of the best instant noodle soups I've ever eaten.  But it is even better if you add a packet of Kikkoman's instant Wakame Soup (Amazon sells this too), and a few cloves of fresh garlic sliced about a minute before you take it off the burner.  The Kikkoman's Wakame Soup is loaded with thinly sliced very tender and savory seaweed and spices that mix perfectly with this soup. The combination is scrumptious! I will be ordering both soups again.
