I have never tried rooibos before and was pleasantly surprised when I drank my first cup.  I now drink it daily in the afternoon and it has fast become my favorite tea.  I usually drink it blended with Jamaica sorrel (hibiscus sabdariffa also known as roselle) and African honey bush and just add a few drops of lemon juice.  It tastes great every time, served hot or cold.  I sometimes add rose hips to the blend, and this further enhances the taste.  I am running through my rooibos in no time, so I am about to place another order and this time I am also going to add the green rooibos to my blend.
