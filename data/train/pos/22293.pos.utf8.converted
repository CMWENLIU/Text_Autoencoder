INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT<br />A party. College kids drinking, eating pizza. Everyone talking, no one listening. ALEX takes a slice of pizza from the greasy box, puts it on a paper plate. Goes to kitchen. Pulls down HUY FONG SRIRACHA HOT CHILI SAUCE. Proceeds to drown the slice with stream after stream of thick red paste. ALEX takes a big bite. GIRL looks on, horrified.<br />  GIRL: What are you doing?<br />  ALEX: You've never heard of sriracha?<br />  GIRL: No. That's just hot sauce.<br />  ALEX: Hah! You ignorant fool. You can't have any.<br />  GIRL: Um, okay. Not like I wanted to anyway. Freak.<br />GIRL walks away. ALEX continues devouring the slice, sweating from the chili spiciness, oblivious to how insane he looks.<br />  ALEX (V.O.)<br />That girl doesn't know about sriracha. Good. More for me. More, more, more, for me.<br />CLOSE-UP on Alex. His eyes close in silent joy.<br />FADE TO BLACK.
