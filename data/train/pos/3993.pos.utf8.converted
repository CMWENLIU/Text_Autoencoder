I sure like this product, as I've always loved the butter popcorn at the movies, but now I usually wait for movies to come to Blockbuster. I don't like popcorn salt alone, and had looked for a solution to my problem. This is the answer, and it's sure as heck cheaper than the $5 per bag at the cinema.
