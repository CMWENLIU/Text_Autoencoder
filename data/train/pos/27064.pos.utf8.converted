Truffles remind me of garlic with an added dimension of aromatic appeal. In fact, I'm convinced that you can use truffle oil in many recipes that are compatible with garlic oil. While black truffles are highly prized, you may prefer the white truffle oil in a rice recipe.<br /><br />"Risotto with Red Bell Peppers and Truffle Oil" is a good example of a recipe using truffle oil. I actually created this recipe using the URBANI truffle oil and it is superior in flavor!<br /><br />The chicken base gives excellent flavor and is less salty than most bouillon cubes which are less flavorful.<br /><br />1 T. Urbani "white" truffle oil<br /><br />1 T. salted butter<br /><br />1 chicken liver, chopped, this is optional<br /><br />1 T. chopped yellow onion<br /><br />1 T. chopped fresh parsley<br /><br />1/4 c. chopped celery stalks<br /><br />1/4 c. chopped red bell pepper<br /><br />1/4 tsp. ground black pepper<br /><br />1 tsp. garlic salt<br /><br />1 c. uncooked Arborio rice<br /><br />1 T. chicken base<br /><br />4 c. boiling water<br /><br />Heat the oil (some have told me to add it later, but I don't think it makes much of a difference in this recipe) and butter in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Fry chicken livers, then add onion, parsley, celery and bell pepper. Cook 5 minutes. Add pepper, garlic salt and rice. Stir until rice absorbs the butter and looks transparent on both ends of the grain. This actually takes 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the water with chicken base. Stir until most of the water is absorbed. Continue to add water in 1/2 cup additions for the next 30 minutes. This dish must be continually stirred and is completely done when water is almost completely absorbed and there is a creamy sauce coating the rice. Serve immediately or the creamy sauce will be absorbed into the rice and you will have a drier, but still delicious, dish.<br /><br />Makes 6 servings.<br /><br />Recipe Note: This creamy dish is perfect as an accompaniment to Roast Chicken. Red bell pepper has a dramatic effect on any dish it touches, any remaining bell pepper may be chopped and frozen to be used later for decorating a cream soup.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
