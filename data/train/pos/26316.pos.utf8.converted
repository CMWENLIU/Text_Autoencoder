Delicious, but hot.  I didn't believe any of the reviews that I read, and now I find myself trying to sneak this sauce into anything I can.  And I had to try it in cottage cheese after reading that one person's review, and it's actually not all that bad.  It would take some getting used to.  Anyway, really hot, but it's a weird sauce because for how hot it is, it has this delicious flavor.  It's good by itself, but I love putting it on things that already have a sauce, or mixing it with a sauce.  MMmm yum.
