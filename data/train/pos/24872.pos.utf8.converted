I had bought this cereal a couple years ago in an organic market, and I have not seen it since then. I fell in love this cereal. It tastes so good. It's so yummy. The only thing that's a downside is the amount of servings in a box. It's not much, but I don't mind. It's totally worth getting the pack of 6 for that price.
