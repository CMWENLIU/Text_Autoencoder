The Southeastern Mills Country Gravy Mix has the down home country gravy flavor that I use over fresh baked biscuits that we love having for Sunday morning breakfasts.<br /><br />It is a great buy in the 24 count carton. I've priced both chicken gravy and country gravy  mix in the store and it costs over a dollar a packet. The thing is, the store bought packet makes one cup of gravy. However, Southeastern Mills Country Gravy mixes up three full cups of gravy. That's plenty for a domestic partnered couple not to run short while pouring gravy over biscuits. It tastes great, too. I've mixed a store bought package of the Chicken Gravy mix with this, too. this makes undeniably the best gravy I've ever, ever tasted! Buy this product!
