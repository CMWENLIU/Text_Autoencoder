Good stuff, dogs love it.  Made a big difference when I switched from another brand.  My dogs seem healthier, and have lost excess weight which they gained while on the other food.  Their bowel movements are more normal now, and they no longer have problems with their anal glands getting full/hard and needing to be emptied like they did with the other food.<br /><br />I was surprised to find negative reviews for this food.  I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of amazon, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag.  1) that has nothing to do with amazon, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.  It's misleading to people looking for products when something has 2 stars because someone got an expired bag from A DIFFERENT STORE.<br /><br />My dogs love this food, and I don't think I'll ever switch.  Their health is important to me, and this food seems to deliver on that.
