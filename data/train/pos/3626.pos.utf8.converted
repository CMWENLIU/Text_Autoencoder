I have a subscription to this product because it's so good, and you can't beat the price. The powder easily mixes into anything. It has a full, rich flavor with no additives or fillers and it's raw. My favorite way to use it is to mix it into coconut oil and agave, with a little extract like peppermint, orange, or lemon. It makes a lovely chocolate sauce that hardens on contact when it touches something frozen. I add the sauce to banana icecream, which is made from frozen bananas which I run through my juicer machine with the blank plate to make raw soft serve. It's a wonderful, raw healthy treat that I sometimes have in place of a meal. Go ahead and subscribe and get Amazon prime. It's totally worth it for this cacao powder.
