I am addicted to panforte, the traditional Tuscan Christmas fruit cake, I have even made Nick Malgieri's recipe at home with great success!<br />I have tried most of the brands on amazon, and when I can find it.<br />I find Maribisi is the top producer of panforte, their panfortes are loaded with Tuscan nuts and fruits and truly are the best quality.<br />My favorite is the margherita, however, recently I tried the date and almond cake, which was excellent.<br /><br />I wait every October for the stuff to be shipped to the States.<br />Get it while it's fresh!
