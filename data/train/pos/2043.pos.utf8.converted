Our 5 year old son loves popcorn but we are always concerned about the hulls in most popcorn's and the potential choking hazard with little ones.  This popcorn is perfect!  Although there is no true "hull free" popcorn, this one comes as close as it gets!  It tastes great and, in our opinion, is very "kid friendly".  This is the only brand of popcorn we use in our popcorn machine at home!
