I am very pleased with my order of Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix.  I love the 16 oz packages.  They are small enough to use up one at a time while the other packages remain unopened (also easier to store).  The flavor is also great, and I can make quite a few recipes with it. My favorite recipe being the low carb pancakes, the recipe is right on the package.  The absolute BEST reason I love this baking mix is the fact that it has 5 g fiber per 1/4 cup.  0 trans fat and 0 sugar.  Try it, you won't be sorry!
