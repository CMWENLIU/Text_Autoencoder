I have to admit that the 20 years Starbucks says it devoted to developing an instant coffee worthy of the "Starbucks" name was time well spent. Whatever they did and however they did it, Starbucks has managed to create a super-rich tasting instant coffee that could easily be mistaken for their traditionally brewed coffee. The popular dark (Italian) and mild (Colombian) flavors are offered in very classy looking plastic pouches that conveniently turn 8oz of hot water into the best tasting instant coffee you've ever had. In fact, I had a difficult time telling it from their brewed coffee, and normally that's all I ever buy there. Although the price is a bit high - almost a $1 a cup - it's still a great alternative when you just can't find a walk-in store. I see a few packets taking cross-country flights with me, as well as stuffing a handful into my backpack when I camp. Heck, I'll never have to drink hotel-room coffee again! Hey Starbucks - when can I expect a "decaf" version?
