This is the second purchase I've made of this product. It's the cheapest way to buy it and we use about two of these jars per year. It came double wrapped in a zip-lock bag for safety against melting (had it been warmer). Never mind that it has a seal under the cap. Anyway, the oil is wonderful and I use it in place of shortening for a lot of my baked goods plus we'll put a dollop in a mug of coffee.
