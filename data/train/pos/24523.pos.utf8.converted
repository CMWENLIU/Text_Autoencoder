We first discovered Carbon's Waffle mix while on vacation at the Kennedy Space Center in Titusville, FL. We stayed at a Fairfield Inn and the continental breakfast included waffles and about everything else you could ask for. But what we kept coming back for were these incredible waffles. I've had nothing like them before. We begged the lady to tell us what the mix was and she brought out Carbon's Pancake and Waffle mix. It wasn't long til we got back home and I ordered it off Amazon right away. It arrived pretty quickly and it was just as good. My boys love them (ages 5 and 3). Whenever I have a day off from work they beg me for these pancakes/waffles. The texture, sweet flavor, and buttery taste make them almost like candy. They are best in a Belgian waffle maker as this accentuates the light buttery taste. We use a Waring Pro professional grade waffle maker. We had friends over the other night and gave them some of these waffles, and of course he took the empty can home so that he could order some for his own family. No doubt, we are sold on these babies!
