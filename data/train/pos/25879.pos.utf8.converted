Dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy, but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier.  They're wonderfully flavored, organic, and made by a company who honestly cares about its customers.  These are a great find and a staple of my house. They're just awesome, its hard to believe they're corn-free.
