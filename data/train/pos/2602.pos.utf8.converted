Although my cat is not a finicky eater, he really loves Weruva's Grandma's Chicken Soup! Because I need to get more liquid into his diet (he has been diagnosed with struvite crystals and needs to ingest more liquid), this soupy food is the perfect way to do that. And finally, I like this cat food because it is "real" food, not chopped up by-products like many cat foods. As a result of feeding my best furry guy this food, he has had fewer digestive problems and no urinary issues.
