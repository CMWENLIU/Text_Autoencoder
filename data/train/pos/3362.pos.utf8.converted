Ordered this early in the year and find we use it for all sorts of dishes. Much more interesting than just brown or white rice, the combination produces a great flavor and great texture. We will be buying more after we use up our current order. Update May 2007: Have ordered more. This rice is excellent in a variety of dishes and is priced nicely too, at least compared to the alternatives in our local grocery store. My favorite recipe: Cook with some added bouillion or real chicken stock, add 1 to 2 tsp butter, add some dry or chopped onion, sage, basil, oregano and whatever else you feel like and cook as normal (15 to 20 minutes).
