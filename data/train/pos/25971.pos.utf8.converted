One of our two finniky cats loved the little "shredded wheat" pillows. 50% in this case is excellent, since both had been repulsed by a half-dozen or more previous products (mainly the tube-lube genre).  Effective?  I planned on including the results in this initial review but decided a month was not long enough, so  the verdict on how well they work will have to wait another month.  Procedurally, however, I fed the one cat on both the regimens for existing hairballs and for preventing potential ones.  A month in and no hairball contributions.  I can, however, report now on my opinion of the manufacturer's customer service:  LOUSY:  I emailed a few questions relating to using the product most effectively and received no reply whatsoever.  If Amazon allows, I will update this review mid-November, 2011.<br /><br />UPDATE.  Two months in and no hairballs. Strange and amazing.  Strange in that M&C is just the usual petro-malt "tube lube" formula in a crispy coating. Even my "non-picky" cats do not "prefer" the tube-lube experience BUT yet they relish the M&C treats, even when broken open and the petro-malt is exposed. The secret is not in the coating, since I scraped some off and used as a flavor enhancer with no effect (See my CAT-MAN-DOO SPRINKLES REVIEW).  Amazing in that after the front-loaded dosage for existing hairballs, I cut back on the dosage even further than advised.  Instead of the recommended two "pillows" every other day I reduced that by half to one "pillow" every other day. And most of the time I would even skip weekends, which amounted to a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. This stretches the [65] "pillows" in the 50 g. package from two months to four months of servings and reduces the cost to a little over a dollar a month. NICE. Also nice is that M&C is available on Amazon, PetCo online, and PetCo stores for about the same price. The only thing better would be if our pets unanimously agreed on M&C as their preferred hairball treatment.  Unfortunately our pickiest pet has chosen another brand (VET*BEST CAT LUBE, reviewed separately). It works for her (so far) but I doubt the practicality of splitting the tablets of the VB product into small enough (effective) servings to make it as cost-effective as M&C; even if I ground the VB tablets into powder. But I probably will try. ONE FEEDING TIP: The 'pillows" are fairly large and look more "bite size" if divided. THE ONLY NEGATIVE:  M&C still has LOUSY customer service: no response.<br /><br />LAST UPDATE: See my separate review of PET NATURALS HAIRBALL CHEWS for a summary of my experiences with all three products.  Hint: M&C comes out on top for value and PN for acceptance (and ingredient quality). M&C is now called HEALTHYBITES HAIRBALL REMEDY in a white instead of the metallic bag. And my apologies for the scattered information.  I would have preferred to review them all in one place but the separate trials extended over such a long period and I did not work out in advance a way of consolidating them into a neat package.
