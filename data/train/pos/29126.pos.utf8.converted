Only for devoted Pepperheads. Walkerswood has something for everybody so move down a scale if you are<br />allergic to hot.<br /><br />Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper authentic<br />flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive oil, but I've found<br />it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results. Its a<br />little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every<br />few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff.<br /><br />If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or<br />doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while, knowhudahmsayin! haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green<br />like the Grace rub does. 5 Scovies
