Open the lid on this lovely salt and you are struck with the unmistakable aroma of truffles. The taste is even better. A little goes a long way. I add a pinch to eggs to turn ordinary into decadent. Like another review, I also love this salt in popcorn. I add a pinch to my oil (usually clarified butter) before popping and supplement with plain sea salt ground fine in the mortar and pestle. A nice change of pace.<br /><br />This salt is speckled with black truffle flakes that look something like ground black pepper. The truffle flavor is infused throughout. The salt I received on 5/31/2010 has a 'best before' date of 10/28/2012.
