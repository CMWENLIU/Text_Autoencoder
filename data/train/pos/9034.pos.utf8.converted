A German friend, returning to his home in New York City after visiting with family in Frankfurt am Main, brought me back a gift box of ASBACH URALT Assorted Brandy-Filled Chocolates. That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, "Weinbrand," since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Amazon has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift.<br /><br />The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates. The assortment includes cherries marinated for over a year in Asbach brandy, praline, coffee and pure cognac. The chocolates are as fine as any I have had in Belgium and much less expensive. This is a real winner. 5+ Stars!<br /><br />JANA
