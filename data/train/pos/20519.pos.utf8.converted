I have been weight training and trying to eat a higher protein diet.  I can no longer bear the sight of turkey, egg-white omelets or cottage cheese.  I dislike artificial sweeteners (mostly due to their taste) so I don't care for any pre-made shakes I have tried.  I turned to whey protein (bleck...maybe more experimentation will yield something better)and soy protein (bleck redux) but couldn't stand them.<br /><br />But I like this!  I wouldn't eat it plain (it's not THAT good), but the taste is easily coverable with yummy and healthy additives.  This morning I made a "shake" that was 1C OJ (Tropicana Grovestand), 1/4C (appx) pure pomegranate juice, 1/4C egg whites (22g protein), 1/4C (appx) plain non-fat yogurt, and one banana. I blended these together with a few ice cubes, and yum!  Even my kids love it!<br /><br />It probably has a lot of naturally occuring sugar from the fruits and yogurt, but I am happy with the content and nutrients, and I can drink it happily without forcing it down!<br /><br />I have tried the Honeyville dried fruits and been pretty happy with them as well (much better blueberries than for pancakes), so I will look forward to adding these for variety when I can't find good fresh fruit.
