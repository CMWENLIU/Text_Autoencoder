took a trip to Costa Rica recently and was turned on to this coffee, Cafe  1820, by a friend. So rich and smooth with a distinctive flavor. produces great crema in my super-automatic. love to get it whole bean but I believe it's a blend, so I'll settle for the ground. brought many pounds back into the country but have been searching for a US source since my stash is running low.
