For years tea lovers in the USA have had to resort to importing Dilmah, probably the finest in the world (it revolutionised the domestic tea market in Australia when it was introduced there twenty years ago). Beautifully fresh (vacuum packed for the loose-leaf teas), finest leaf, richly satisfying, fairly traded, among tea connoisseurs Dilmah is more an institution than a regular tea company. By purchasing their products, you will not only be indulging in the ultimate tea-drinker's experience, you'll also be helping a multitude of award-winning non-profit programmes instituted by Dilmah's enlightened management. There should be more products like this. Do yourself a favour and buy some today.
