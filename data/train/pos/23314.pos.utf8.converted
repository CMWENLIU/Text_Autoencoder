Panko makes the crispiest, lightest breading. It is great for meats, seafood, veggies, and even some sweets (I have had some of the best fried ice cream that was covered in Panko crumbs, but you can also do bananas). There are tons of uses, so definitely try some Panko for your next breaded and deep-fried cooking session.
