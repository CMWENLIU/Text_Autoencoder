I never write reviews, but I cannot sit here and eat this amazing sourdough and not share with the world the amazing tastes and combination of ingredients that New Grains has packaged and shipped right to my door.  The classic San Francisco Sourdough taste that is lost on the gluten-free community has been captured and made available.  Thank you New Grains and for anyone in doubt about ordering this, don't hesitate your taste-buds will thank you!  I also would like to add that they included some cookies to sample along with this product, where were so soft and moist.  I cannot believe that this was all gluten-free.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
