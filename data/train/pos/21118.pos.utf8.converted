My dog hates the dog greenies so i was a bit skeptical about purchasing the kitty ones.. but my cat looooovessssssss these! My dog gets jealous so I end up giving him a piece to stop his whimpering and HE loves it too hahaha. Paid about $2.50 for them and a week later stopped by a petco for more treats and saw them there for $3.99. I love amazon :)
