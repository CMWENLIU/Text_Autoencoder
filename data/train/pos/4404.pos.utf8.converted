I have placed several orders for sprouting seeds/beans from The Sprout House.  They are of excellent quality and come in nice plastic jars resembling large spice jars for parsley and such.<br /><br />The seeds sprout uniformly and well, with negligible "junk", and are very tasty.  In comparison, I had a very bad experience in buying seeds from another seller/producer that came in a cheap plastic bag that spilled all over the box and arrived in a black plastic trash bag from the post office.  The quality/uniformity of those other seeds was nowhere near these from The Sprout House.<br /><br />If I am buying alfalfa sprouting seeds, I will ONLY buy these.  Please see my customer images as well.  I hope you found my review helpful.
