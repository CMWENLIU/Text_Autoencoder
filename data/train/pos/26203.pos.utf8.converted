For over 10 years, I have made my own ghee, tried various brands and nothing compares to this uniquely produced and amazingly flavored ghee.  Because they are a smaller creamery, they do charge more and it is so well worth the price.  We did some research and found out that ghee has a huge health benefit of unclogging vessels in the body rather than clogging them like butter can (and other articles and reports such as [...], said it is casein free and yet others said it is lactose free too)...so, that's the logical side for using it-but with this ghee, the TASTE is so incredibly DELICIOUS, that our family can't even consider butter or margarine now.  Ghee stays soft and does not have to be refrigerated. The shipping is reasonable through Amazon, especially so you can try it in the smaller size.  The main point is that it seems that through working with nature's cycles combined  with their loving attention to the welfare of their cows, they have captured the secret to a wonderful tasting and ultimately health sustaining product.
