After experimenting a bit to find dry food all three of my felines would eat, and after reviewing and researching ingredients and labels, I landed on Blue Buffalo's kitten food.  My oldest cat, KatKat, age 3, will sneak eat the kitten's portions.  I don't think it hurts her. All three are healthy, trim, with shiny coats, abundant energy.  I free-feed this food and supplement with wet food in the a.m. and p.m. (amazingly, the best wet food I've found so far Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food, Flaked Fish & Shrimp Feast; it has good ingredients and seems a good value for the price; I am currently waiting on a delivery of Best Feline Friend Canned Cat Food, Tuna Too Cool Recipe--will post a review when the furry ones had a chance to taste-test it).
