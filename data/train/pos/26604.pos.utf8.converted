Sure, there are tons of oatmeal options out there and I've tried quite a few. McCanns is the best.  For starters I don't like mystery ingredients.  McCanns has only one ingredient--  oats, and they only use the highest quality.  Because of the way the oats are cut they cook very quick.  I micro mine with soy milk in 2:20.  After cooking I add cinnamon, ground flax seeds, and some frozen blueberries for a breakfast of champions.  After switching to this from eating cereal I've become very lean.  I've recommended this combination to many others who have experienced similar results.
