I have had my three cats on Innova dry food almost from day one, the only exception being our 12-year old tabby who started his life on premium brands such as Nutro, Iams, Science Diet, and Eukanuba. Even before the great pet food scare of 2007, I learned that those brands, sad to say, do have by-products and fillers, and thrive primarily on their marketing and distribution momentum, and the recommendations of vets who are unfamiliar with many of the newer all-natural brands. Since discovering Innova in 2002, I've been a vocal advocate of this brand among all our friends with pet families, as the company's focus on healthful nutrition without deleterious additives and preservatives is key to their philosophy. Last winter, I tried samples of Innova EVO on both the kitties and our miniature schnauzer (whom we have since switched to Timberwolf Organics, another superb brand, just because of lower fat content), and found them even more excited about mealtime when they saw me approaching their food bowls. With regular Innova, they've all had robust growth, excellent muscle tone, supple skin, clear eyes and shiny full coats. After a few months on EVO, they're even more energetic and look better than I thought possible. The product is sold at natural pet product stores - listed on Natura's website (not the big chains) - at a better price and without the shipping costs associated with Amazon's partner. How do you put a price on your family's wellbeing? This is well worth the investment, and your kitties will be satisfied with less, as they're consuming no empty calories.  Besides the health benefits to them, there's the added benefit to you of easier litterbox maintenance, with smaller, more compact stools.  (On that score, we've found The World's Best Cat Litter to be the best alternative to clay litter.)
