Milka is one of the leading producers of chocolates in the world. Founded in Switzerland in 1901, the brand quickly spread throughout Western Europe. In 1990, the company was acquired by Kraft, and their wonderful chocolate is now available throughout the world!<br /><br />I love Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate. It is absolutely delicious - not as sweet as many American chocolates, and with a rich and creamy texture. Want to try a great chocolate? Get Milka's Alpine Milk chocolate!<br /><br />(Review of World's Best Milka Chocolate - Alpine Milk)
