Her's my problem with people like the previous reviewer. I don't need your novice, pseudo medical opinion for a product you have not tried. You are as bad as the people that review a recipe after they change 6 ingredients and then say it was just okay. They didn't review the recipe at hand! I digress... The company has been making this stuff for over 30 years and have not seen any issues or side effects. In fact, dogs and cats seem to love it and they seem happier with better coats.
