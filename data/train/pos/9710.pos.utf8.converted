As any native of the Aloha State will tell you, locals put Li Hing Mui Powder on anything and everything.  This sweet/sour/salty spice packs quite a punch; once you've had it, your mouth will forevermore water at the thought of it.  Literally. This spice goes well with all types of food, though it's at its best on fruit, candy and the rims of margarita glasses.  I highly recommend it with fresh oranges: slice them up and sprinkle some of this on them.  You'll never think of fresh fruit the same way again.
