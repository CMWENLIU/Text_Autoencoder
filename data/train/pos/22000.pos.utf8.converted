I was wandering around the international food aisle when this caught my eye. Sweetened, condensed milk in a re-sealable bottle rather than a tin can. I said, "Oh my! What evil thing is this?" And then I bought it. You might not be able to use a whole can of sweetened, condensed milk, but you sure can find lots of uses for a it when it comes in a squeeze bottle. I put it in my coffee, in my tea, over my fruit, over my icecream, and then I lick the plate.<br /><br />The really nice thing about this container is that you can turn it upside down so that the nice, cool, sweet goo that is La Lechera is ready to pour whenever you want it.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you want a new addiction. Seriously.
