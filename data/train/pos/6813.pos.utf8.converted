It's been a long time since I've tried the Yuban line of coffees. I have a tendency to try a lot of different brands just because I enjoy trying new things, and the Yuban coffees haven't caught my eye in quite some time. Yuban is a "high-end" Kraft brand coffee offering, and it's always been made with 100% Arabica beans. As of mid-2006, though, Yuban is offering a new wrinkle to help recommend it to coffee consumers, Rainforest Alliance Certification.<br /><br />That's important because coffee is the world's second largest commodity after oil, worth $60 billion annually, with 25 million people growing it in 50 countries on some 30 million acres, many of them in fragile, tropical ecosystems such as rainforests. Kraft is the largest United States coffee roaster, so their commitment to this certification is a big deal. Rainforest Alliance certification requires farmers to adopt best practices and meet very rigorous criteria for conserving wildlife and improving the lives of the people who grow and harvest the beans. The Yuban line guarantees that at least 30% of the coffees that it packages come from Rainforest Alliance Certified producers.<br /><br />All very interesting and commendable, but the bottom line is "How does the coffee taste?" Well, I've made a number of pots since I've rediscovered the brand, and I must say that it performs pretty well. The grind is a little fine for my taste, but it does ok in the coffeemaker. The color is rich and dark, the aroma is inviting, and the taste is very smooth and robust. It's a good value at the price point, and I'll probably find myself buying it again. It makes a fine "everyday" wake-up call, and the environmental benefits make it even sweeter to drink. Enjoy!
