I adore this soap! I'm not a fan of strong scents and I tend to have fairly dry skin on my arms and legs so it was difficult for me to find a soap that I really liked. Olivella has been wonderful! The scent is mild and clean and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized without leaving a residue. Most days I don't even have to bother with lotion. I highly recommend this product to everyone.
