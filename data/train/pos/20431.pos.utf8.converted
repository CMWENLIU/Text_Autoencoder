If you are a beginner, seriously think twice about using this as you would a tabasco or any type of louisianna hot sauce.. After having this sauce, those seriously don't even feel like they have any spice at all. Take the top of your finger, touch it to the top of the bottle, and your mouth will be burning for at least 10 minutes. This sauce has a great flavor, and really meshes well with other sauces / foods. I enjoy it thoroughly!! (It's really good on pizza :))
