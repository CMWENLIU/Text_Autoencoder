We used this product as a handout for a parade where we were using a water theme.  The candies tasted as good as everyone remembered and we had several people THRILLED to see a candy they remembered from when they were kids.  Those who hadn't had them before were intrigued at the look and loved the new experience.  Individually wrapped was extremely important for the parade and they are slightly larger than address labels for an envelope, to give you a comparison.
