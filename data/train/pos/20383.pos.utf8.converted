This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits.  Some obvious and some not so obvious.  I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress.<br /><br />I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YY2XQE">5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams</a>.  I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.  Since I've started this nightly ritual nights have become more peaceful, days have become brighter (i.e. tears from stressful situations do not rear their ugly head nearly as much).  I've been happier, plain and simple.
