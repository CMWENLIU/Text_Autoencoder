If you like the Colombian Arabica coffees, this is as good as any other Colombian. Medium roast with full rich and smooth flavor. Leaves smoky-chocolatey aftertaste (a nice one). The price is also excellent at .46/cup, don't let the price make you think that it has no quality; very satisfied with my purchase and I will buying more for sure; this is one of the best deals with T-Discs.<br /><br />The coffee is also 30% Rainforest Alliance Certified, which makes me feel even better helping a good cause. I am very happy to find Yuban now in T-Discs for the Tassimo. Get it while it is available.<br /><br />Update: After going through the first package; this one has really grown on me and I can't wait for it to be available again.  Very tasty and smooth way to start your morning. Highly recommended.
