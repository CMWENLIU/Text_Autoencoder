I've enjoyed Dave's Total Insanity for over a decade now. It's by far my number one favorite hot sauce of all time.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet makes a variety of "Insanity" themed hot sauces including "Temporary Insanity", "Ultimate Insanity", and more. But of them all, "Total Insanity" has the best flavor to my palate. Dave's Total Insanity has strong overtones of garlic which I really like combined with a tangy lime hit but just a touch of smokiness. The overall flavor profile is just divine.<br /><br />Then the burn hits.<br /><br />And what a burn! It's terrifyingly powerful, inducing screams, dizziness, tears, and more. The endorphin rush from Dave's Total Insanity is absolutely the bomb. I eat more and more, unable to stop this coaster-ride of fantastic flavor and furious fire. I sweat, I cry, I shudder, I double over, and then I hit that pain-induced high and I just float as the room spins away.<br /><br />Thanks, Dave.
