This pasta actually tastes like the real thing!  Highly recommended!  I have also had the house foods 20 calorie pasta, but it tastes slimy and only works well with asian style foods.  But this tastes great no matter what and fills you up!  Works well with all sauces, including marinara.  Five stars!!
