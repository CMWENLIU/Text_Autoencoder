We've been eating the Wild Planet tuna for a while (and it's also excellent), and decided to give this a try. It's more expensive, but very very good, with real salmon flavor and texture. It truly is skinless and boneless, and in nice big chunks (it's like a big piece of fish in the can, with maybe some smaller chunks to fill the space and weight needs). And being wild-caught, and in BPA-free cans, there's the added assurance that they're good for you!<br /><br />This would be excellent in a salmon salad, but what I do with it most often is a salmon hash, with sweet potatoes. It's also good mixed into mac & cheese! For those of us who don't have regular reliable sources of fresh wild sockeye this is really a great option.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: after the comment here I did further research, and the cans for the salmon are NOT, as of mid-2012, BPA-free (the tuna and sardines are). Sorry for the misinformation; I had seen reports that all of the Wild Planet seafood was BPA-free, but apparently (according to the company) there are no Alaska plants working with BPA-free cans and their other tests to date have not been satisfactory.<br /><br />Since it's an occasional rather than everyday for me, and the quality is otherwise so high, I'll keep using this. But others should make their own decisions.
