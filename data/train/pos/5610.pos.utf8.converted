Twinings English Breakfast Tea is by far the best black tea sold in teabag form that you can get on the retail market. Rich, full bodied and spicy. It's great alone or lightly sweetened. I drink a cup every morning for my caffeine rush, and it's MUCH healthier then drinking coffee! The price to buy Twinings English Breakfast Tea in bulk from Amazon is truly a great deal. Normally, in the grocery store, a 20 bag box sells for $4.99. This 50 count x 6 boxes makes it about $4.75 a box, but for 50!!! Not 20! If you're a tea lover, then trust me, you will love this tea. And buy it from Amazon, cause you can't beat their price!
