In a word: amazing. Imagine chocolate without toxic sugar and gas- inducing malitol. They're high in fiber and great in taste; ChocoPerfection is the way to go if you're on a diet and want to indulge now and then. I believe the woman who makes these delicious treats initially came up with these chocolates as a way to lose weight. Whatever the reason, way to go!<br /><br />I highly recommend them.<br /><br />By the way, if you find the price a bit too high, remember that they are sweetened with erythritol which will command a higher price since that particular sweetener is pricey.
