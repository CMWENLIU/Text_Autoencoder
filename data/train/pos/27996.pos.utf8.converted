If you looking for this to taste just like the real thing it doesn't, its a bit sweeter, but if your looking to add peanut butter back into your diet without all that added fat this will work.<br /><br />I don't diet I change the way I eat and I have found that one can get use to anything if you give it a fair chance.<br /><br />After not having any peanut butter for over a year cause of the fat, I was more than happy to try this and found that it was great for me I can have it with apples and veggies the way I use to as a snack.
