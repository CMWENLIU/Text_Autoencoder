I add 1 tablespoon to each dishwasher load. The citric acid keeps the mineral deposits in check and the glasses sparkling. Our city water is extremely hard, and the spinners in the dishwasher would get clogged with deposits. Not any longer! I also use it as a neutralizer when shampooing the rugs, but you have to rinse with water afterwards, or it stays a little sticky.<br />I try to use simple solutions to keep the home clean. This is a safe way to clean.
