Frontier's Ceylon cinnamon tastes good, and I've bought more of it after trying half a dozen others. It has a bit milder flavor than Penzey's, but I like theirs too.<br /><br />Frontier Co-op itself offers more variations of Ceylon cinnamon than are usually available here on Amazon through resellers. To see what else they have, you might want to have a look at the Co-op's own extensive retail and wholesale sites.
