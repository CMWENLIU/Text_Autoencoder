My Westie is going on 8 years old. He has always had a sensitive stomach. The vet put him on "special" prescription dog food years ago for it. Even while on this so called "good stuff" I had to break his feedings down to very small amounts about 8 times a day because if I fed him too much of anything at once, he would just throw it all right back up again. He threw up 1 to 3 or 4 times a week no matter how careful I was and regularly woke up with a snurgely stomach that was so loud that you could hear it gurgle and snurgel from across the room. On those mornings, the only thing I could get him to eat for breakfast was plain white rice, which almost always settled his stomach. A couple weeks ago, he ran out of his prescription food and in desperation, I went across the street to our local pet store where I discovered The Honest Kitchen Dog Food. He has been eating this gluten free formula now for 2 weeks. In that time, he has not thrown up or woken up with a snurgely stomach once. I am now able to feed him a heaping bowlful of Honest Kitchen twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). He LOVES every bite and hasn't thrown it up once. No more breaking down his feedings into little bite fulls 8-10 times a day to prevent him from urping it all right back up again. I only wish I had heard about this stuff a long, long time ago. And I now suspect that my poor sweet puppy has probably suffered all these years from celiac disease, which no vet ever raised as even a remote possibility in spite of the fact that they all knew of his hyper sensitive stomach and the constant throwing up, morning snurgels, etc... (What DO they teach those folks at vet school???) Anyway, long winded review, I know, but hopefully someone with a similar experience of puppy stomach troubles will read it and Honest Kitchen will do the same for their pup as it has for mine. It's been a real life changer for my best friend. :)
