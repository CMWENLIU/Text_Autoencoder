This rice is good and very nutritious. It doesn't swell or fluff like white rice or parboiled rice. A cup of this is a lot for one person and could last 5-7 days. That is good if you have plans to eat rice for a whole week. Don't be fooled by it's size. This rice has a lot of fiber and other nutrition so it fills you quickly. Only about four scoops of a regular size spoon (a size up from soup size) is enough. I added a little bit of concentrated coconut cream to it and ate it with baked chicken; vegetable aren't needed. I went to the toilet often after eating this for three days. If you eat too much of it it may cause you to have pasty, constipated-like stool. This rice goes perfect with poultry (chicken, turkey, duck, goose, quail, etc...)Coconut cream was optional for me and I'm glad I tried it; however, a little sprinkle of salt will go a long way.
