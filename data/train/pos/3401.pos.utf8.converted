This stuff is freaking delicious. I bought this juice on the colloquial advice that it's great for inflammation (I have gouty arthritis, which is awesome). It is so, so yummy, it's hard not to drink the entire container down with complete abandon to your inner glutton. I've also used it for flavoring muffins, corncakes and yogurt - ai-yo it's divine. My kids love it frozen with some vanilla soy milk for creamy, treaty goodness. And it is amazingly priced for SIX BOTTLES of 100% juice. Hundreds of uses, go crazy with your bad self.
