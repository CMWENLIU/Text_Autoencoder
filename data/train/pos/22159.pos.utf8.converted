I too am from NY and this is by far the best brand on the market. I wish they sold it locally here in NC. I miss just being able to buy it at the grocery store. You get a lot for the money too. it's a BIG jar not those itty bitty ones they sell here at the market. You get Quality and Quantity! BEST buy!
