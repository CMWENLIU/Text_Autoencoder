I have been on the quest for an instant miso VEGAN soup. I thought it did not exist. I have made miso soup many times from scratch but I am lazy sometimes and would like it to be quick and pre-made. I have looked high and low on amazon and all the brands included some sort of fish product. Now many packages do not right out say it includes fish, but ingredients such as bonito flakes are indeed fish. Any vegan should go get themselves a source book because some animal ingredients are not so obvious.<br /><br /> Well you can imagine how excited I was when I read the ingredients to find them ok to eat. I ordered right away. I got the package two days ago. I just tried the soup right now. I made it per the directions. I heated up 12oz of water (directions say 8oz) in my large coffee mug in the microwave for 3:30. After it was piping hot I added the first packet which has the miso in it. Stirred it around then added the second packet which has the tofu and seaweed. Give it 20 seconds to all mix together and took a sip.<br /><br /> The taste is absolutely amazing. I was not expecting it to taste so good. I highly highly recommend this soup. Plus the price is fantastic. I have it auto-shiped so I saved the extra 15%. The kicker on top of everything is that the miso is organic. I try to buy at least 70% of all my food organic. This is perfect. Vegan, Organic, Great Price. Please give this soup a try.
