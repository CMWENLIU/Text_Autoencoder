We fed this food to both of our cats after we got them from the breeder.  One 3.5 lb lasted about a month and a half.  I love the research this company has done.  I will be with them for a lifetime, and we are already looking at dog food with them too.  The cats' coats already started to get softer within the month.  After that babycat period, I put them on the kitten formula.
