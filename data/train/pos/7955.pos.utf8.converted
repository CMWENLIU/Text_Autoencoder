Disclosure: I used to work at Peet's coffee, so am used to a decent cup of joe. This Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve can compete with the best of Peet's decaf, IMHO. It has great flavor and decent crema (if you grind the beans right before brewing, as is best), plus holds up well to sugar & cream unlike many decafs out there. With the subscribe & save Jeremiah's is pretty competitive to other coffees out there. The cost, combined with the taste & quality, make it a very appealing coffee. I really hated switching to decaf at first, but it now it's not bad at all because of Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve. I've been drinking it for months now and will continue to do so until...well, until I can't anymore. It's really good!
