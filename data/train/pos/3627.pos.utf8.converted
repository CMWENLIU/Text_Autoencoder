This is raw CACAO powder NOT COCOA powder.  This is NOT like Ghirardelli's or Hershey's or Nestle's or Swiss Miss cocoa powder.  This is NOT a direct substitute for those products in cooking or making hot chocolate.  There is no sugar in this product, it is bitter (the way it was meant to be) and it is a different product.<br /><br />This is also made from cacao beans like chocolate but it isn't processed the same way.  This is a simply ground (minimally processed to remove the bean's husk) cacao beans. In fact, unlike cocoa or chocolate this is high in fiber and low in fat (17% of the calories come from fat content).  It is low in calories at 24 calories per tablespoon. It also has ALL the health benefits of chocolate at a much, much higher concentration than even the darkest chocolate because the processing of chocolate/cocoa breaks down the healthy compounds.<br /><br />So, how do people use it?  I mix this product with hot chocolate mix to add a little bite to it.  I also add a level tablespoon to my coffee in the morning to give it a cafe mocha type flavor that I have grown addicted to!  People substitute this for cocoa only when they are either adjusting their expectations or their recipes.
