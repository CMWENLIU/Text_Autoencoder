A person should completely ignore the price here.  To be truthful, if you use coupons and watch for sales, you can get these much cheaper. This review is not about the price, it is about the product.<br /><br />I love these things and they are one of my favorite snack foods and I am seldom without a box of them open.  I love the flavor and eating a few handfuls with a nice crisp apple and a glass of tea is yammers.<br /><br />I want to say though that not only are these delicious, they are also very filling.  This at one time in my life was very important.  Yes, there was a time when I was absolutely flat broke; like as in I was not sure where my next meal was coming from.  Let me tell you that a box of these things and a glass of water can take you far.  It fills an empty belly quite well and if you have every had an empty stomach and were truly hungry, you will know that it is not a pleasant experience.<br /><br />There were many days that these things were the only thing I had to eat and they saw me trough.  Times are better now; a lot better, but I still have a special place in my heart for these little chips.  You would think that I would be sick of them after all that; not so, I still like the things.
