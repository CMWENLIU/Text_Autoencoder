I used these years ago when I was dieting because I like a lot of butter on my veggies!  I couldn't find them when I wanted to watch my calories again, so I checked Amazon and sure enough, there they were.  Still as good as ever!  I wish they'd sell them in smaller quantities, but that's a minor problem. I probably have enough to last a year now! The product is great and while they aren't as good as a stick of butter, (is anything!!??) they give a nice kick to plain vegetables and keep them moist in the mouth. They also give a nice sheen and flavor to oven baked rolls without all the calories.
