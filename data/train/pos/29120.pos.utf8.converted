When I first bought this product,  I figured it wouldn't taste anywhere near most Whey Proteins, for this is half true.  This hemp powder sure has an earthy taste with a dirt like texture.  Being the non-wasteful person I am, I kept using it and I found mixing it with a milk(cow, almond, oat..) and a fruit such as a Banana does wonders for the flavor and a hint of Vanilla extract makes it taste good too!  I workout hard every day and I must say it's been helping me to achieve better results and and bigger muscles!  Your body can actually use every gram to it's advantage unlike whey where you have to drink tens and tens of grams to recover from a tough workout.  Do the math=Processed whey powder=50% usable by the body(75g) or hemp powder=100% usable(only 15-30g!).  I go natural with weight lifting because cutting corners will show on your body when you get older.  In all honesty, if you are a person that is picky with taste or flavors, you might only be able to hack this by masking the flavor with a bunch of other products.  It ain't the most exciting flavor, but after a while, you get used to it and it's very easy on my stomach.  From seeing some results using this, I'm definitely gonna continue using this product!
