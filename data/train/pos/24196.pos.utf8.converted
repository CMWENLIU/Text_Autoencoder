It's just black cherry juice but if you want to avoid the gout a bit of black cherry juice everyday might help keep those crippling attacks at bay.<br /><br />I haven't had an attack in two years since I started drinking a six ounce glass of black cherry juice every day. Sure it's just antidotal and one's person experience but black cherry juice defiantly works for me. It sure beats having another gout attack and having to use any of those nasty gout medications which can play havoc with your GI track.<br /><br />I bought this brand primarily on price, which is a very good deal compared to the other brands. The twelve pack weighs 15 pounds so getting free shipping is very nice. I found this brand to be a little sweeter than some other brands so I don't find myself needing to use a sweetener such as Splenda when I mix it with water.<br /><br />To make an even taster drink try it mixed with club soda.  Its also great added to a fruit smoothe.
