I've been drinking this tea for over a year now, and it is the main tea I drink.  I prefer other teas for flavor, for sipping and savoring, but this is what I drink the most of, as a refreshing and healthy beverage, and it is very good for that purpose.<br /><br />The Amazon description, saying this is Bai Mu Dan, is incorrect. It is actually fannings. Fannings is the second to the smallest leaf size. Fannings are used in tea bags because of their small size and economic price. On the Uncle Lee's tea website, this tea is shown just as white camellia sinensis. The Uncle Lee's Organic White tea that is described as Bai Mu Dan on the Uncle Lee website is $5 for 18 bags.<br /><br />The only other pure white tea I've had is Republic of Tea's Emperor's white tea, which I find superior to this tea, having a milder and sweeter flavor that is even more pleasant to drink without sweetener than this one. The Uncle Lee's white tea is closer to an oolong in both color and flavor than the Emperor's, with just a hint of bitterness and none of the herbal tones of a green tea.<br /><br />That said, the RoT Emperor's White is almost 6 times more expensive than this tea, and Uncle Lee's is still easy to drink without sweetener, so I'll save the Emperor's for special moments and use the Uncle Lee's as my "daily drinker."<br /><br />Having more flavor, I find that this makes an excellent iced tea.  I usually use 4 bags of this, and one bag of Republic of Tea's Cherry Green Tea, to a gallon of water plus 2 heaping teaspoons of natural cane sugar to provide just a hint of sweetness in a very refreshing iced tea that everyone loves.
