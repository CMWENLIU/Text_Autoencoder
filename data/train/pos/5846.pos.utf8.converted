Just wanted to speak up and say that during a very stressful time, this tea was a life-saver. If you follow the directions, let the bag sit for 5-8 minutes and then squeeze the bag before you throw it away, the calming effects are immediate and thorough.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I happened to like the taste too!
