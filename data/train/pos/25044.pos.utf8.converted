This coffee is very fresh upon arrival and doesn't last long enough in this household to go stale! We do keep it in the freezer but it is wonderful and just what we like...we look forwrd to it every morning.....this is a bolder tasting coffee. Great taste and even better value. I highly recommend it for serious coffee drinkers.
