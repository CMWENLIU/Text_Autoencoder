My cousin told me about this really cool toy called a Sharkbanana. At first I was a little confused as to what it was when he showed it to me but it turned out to be fantastic! The Sharkbanana is very soft and the shark is firmly in place inside of the banana so the toy won't fall apart. This toy showed me how the familiar shapes of a shark and a banana could be combined to make a wonderful and original toy! It's the one and only SHARKBANANA! All and all the Sharkbanana is wonderful and fun. I would recommend this product to anyone who like sharks, or bananas, or someone who wants a fun and original plush toy.
