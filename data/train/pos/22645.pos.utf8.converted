I just received my Brazilian Rain Tree an hour ago.  I want to first say that I have received several trees from Brussels and Brussels trees bought through Amazon.  They are always very well packed.  I have learned a great way to get the tree out.  I open the top of the box and remove the invoice and brochure.  Then I open the bottom of the box and set it inside a large trash bag.  Pull up on the box slowly and pull up the sides of the bag.  I was able to get my tree out and remove the peanuts with only four peanuts touching the floor.  It takes awhile to pick out the peanuts around the tree but it is worth it having a safe tree delivered.<br /><br />I am very surprised with my rain tree!  It is 20 inches tall from the soil and the trunk is almost an inch wide.  The tree is not straight up and down but has a beautiful curve too it.  There are tons of leaves and smaller branches.  This tree looks much older than I expected!  Right now the leaves are all folded up since it has been in the dark box for a few days.  There are no blossoms at this time but there are a bunch of thorns!  I am very happy and can't wait for the leaves to open up.  I gave the tree a drink of water and will baby it for a couple of weeks since it has had a few rough days.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that it is better than other trees I have seen online.  I really struggled with deciding on what indoor tree to buy.  There are not many photos of this tree type online and the best ones are obviously specimen trees that are much older.  One of the main photos of the Brazilian Rain Tree seems to be copied a million times and used on many sights.  I will try to get some photos soon and put them up on Amazon.<br /><br />I have only had this tree for an hour but at this point I would recommend it!
