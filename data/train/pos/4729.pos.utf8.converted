I have a confession to make: I eat baby food. I'm not a kid, and I'm not even a mother, so I can't make the excuse that I'm testing it to make sure it tastes okay for my baby. I'm a college student with no kids. It's just so easy! And baby food and dog food are so much healthier than adult human food most of the time (no, I don't eat dog food too!).<br /><br />These are the things I like about this particular item. It's super convenient with its little pouch that you can carry with you wherever you go and drink out of. It's mess-free. It's extremely healthy, with fruits, veggies, and chia seeds. It's also fairly low in sugar compared to a similar product I have also tried, the Peter Rabbit Organics pouches (11g compared to 12-23g). Plus it's cheaper.<br /><br />The only things I don't like about this product are the taste and texture, but if your baby doesn't know better, (s)he might not mind. The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.<br /><br />With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad. It's not too filling for an adult, but when paired with a mini Clif bar, it makes a healthy snack for less than the Fillet O Fish I would otherwise get at McDonald's.
