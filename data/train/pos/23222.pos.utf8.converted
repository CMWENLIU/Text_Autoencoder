I heard my friend who is a fan of Rocky Mountain say that Nutiva had too many shell pieces in it.  But I tried it anyway, and it doesn't, I think it is the better product though really there isn't a lot of difference in any of the products I tried.  Thing is, 3 bags of Nutiva is a bucket and a half of Rocky Mountain's......so if you buy in 2's like I do, then for $36 or $37 you get 3 buckets worth.  With Rocky, you get 2 buckets for $32 or $33, so the extra bucket is like, only $5.....what I also found was that the packets they send them in are very good/well resealable....so I keep them so I can put about 7 or 8 tablespoon full in one bag, cause it fits so well in my briefcase to take to work, and the spoon fit wholly inside the package too!  It is really convienient.  Anyway....thats it.....=)  Free shipping too....
