My dog absolutely LOVES these... though he's not sure why.  He takes them and runs circles... every once in a while he'll drop it and bark at it... then picks it up and start running again.  Considering the rawhide is gone by the time I get home, I think he eventually figures it out... either that or I've got a TON of rawhide bones buried in my yard somewhere :o)<br />Seriously though - no extra stuff, just plain chewy rawhide fun - it's a winner in my boys eyes!
