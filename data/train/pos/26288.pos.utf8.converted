I love these noodles and ordered by bulk directly from Konjac. This will be an ongoing order for me. They come packed in a water tight bag. You just rinse, add your other ingredients and heat up. There is a strong fish smell upon opening. However, once they are rinsed and mixed with other foods, they automatically take on the taste of the food. Just as good as spaghetti.  The bags are 9 oz. each and it feeds two people, even though it does not look that big. Excellent for low carb diets. I'll never use regular pasta again.
