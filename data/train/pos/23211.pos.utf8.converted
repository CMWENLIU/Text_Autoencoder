I was so distressed that I could no longer find this product in the grocery stores!  Finding it on Amazon was such a relief, that I bought 2 cases.  This custard is such a comfort food for me, makes wonderful custard or custard pie.<br /><br />I would love to get the recipe mentioned by an earlier reviewer for cinnamon rolls using this custard.
