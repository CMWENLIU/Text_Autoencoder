By far, these are the best anchovies ever. Great on homemade pizza, in salads (egg-less Caesar), on crackers, in spaghetti sauce (a la Putana with some capers). These anchovies are worthy of your best dishes. Have fun cooking and eating! Buon Gusto!<br /><br />The containers are very good. Use what you want & save the rest in fridge.<br /><br />Have given an occasional jar to a special guest & fine cook-they are uniformly appreciated and enjoyed.<br /><br />Update 8.10:  Just ordered again. It's sad when we use the last one as these are better than all others! 6-7 time repeat buyer. No point getting those oily anchovies in tins that cut your fingers. If you don't use  all the anchovies, the tins are left to mess up your fridge with oil. Jars can be kept on the door of the fridge. These are great.
