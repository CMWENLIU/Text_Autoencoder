These noodles are really good.  I use them to make an amazing chinese chicken noodle soup.  However, I just now got around to reading the nutrition facts and realized these are loaded with trans fat.  They have 1.5 grams per 1/2 cup.  I wish La Choy would get responsible and stop using trans fat because I really do love these noodles.<br /><br />UPDATE (09/11):  These noodles no longer contain trans fat!!  Thank you so much, La Choy, for listening to your customers and improving your product.  I just bought some more today and can't wait to use them!
