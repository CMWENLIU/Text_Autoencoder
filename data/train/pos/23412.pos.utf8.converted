I recently bought this at Costco, and really liked it.  It is a nutty grain, has a nice consistency, a chewy texture.  It cooks 3 cups water to one cup of grain.  You cook it somewhat like rice, but can drain off excess water.  I have not tried other brands, but this one seems inexpensive (3 lbs for 16 dollars as opposed to 1.1 for 8 dollars on Amazon) compared to other brands.<br /><br />I enjoy cooking it and putting uncooked vegetables on top with various sauces, as well as using it as a side dish.  You can use it as a rice substitute, and I have also used it in salads and have incorporated it into my wheat bread.
