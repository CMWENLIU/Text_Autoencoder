I wasn't familiar with this company before buying their Valerian Mint tea bags, but I can say the purchase was well worth the money.<br /><br />The bags included are not the smaller ones normally used for single serving tea cups. They are large enough to brew up to 2-3 cups and ideal for smaller tea pots. Right there the price becomes reasonable.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is fairly agreeable, too; Peppermint is never a bad way to go when flavoring medicinal/therapeutical herbs. I usually drop in an extra bag of chamomile when steeping Valerian, so that helps with the flavor, too.<br /><br />Personally speaking, I feel the effects of Valerian tea much faster than, say, capsules of Valerian root one might buy at a natural foods store. I can recommend this as a soothing alternative to whatever you might normally drink to relax at the end of the day.<br /><br />If I had to list any specific concern, it would be the intensely vivid dreams that Valerian seems to produce from time to time, but nothing so mind-bending that I would stop drinking the tea.<br /><br />Lastly, avoid heavy or daily usage, beacuse the build-up in your system can lead to problems. You don't wanna be that health-obsessed guy In Newport Beach who died from a massive build-up of Echinacea in his system. Give your body time to flush the herbs out. They aren't always water soluable like Vitamin-B.
