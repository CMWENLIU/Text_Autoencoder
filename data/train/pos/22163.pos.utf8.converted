Most sprinkles that you can buy in the grocery store taste mostly like wax since they are made for decoration.  These sprinkles are from the Netherlands so they actually taste like chocolate!  They are great for making sprinkle sandwiches!  In the Netherlands, instead PB&J, they spread butter on wheat bread and pour on some chocolate sprinkles.  Yum!
