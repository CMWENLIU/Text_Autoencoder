I LOVE the product and was hoping to buy it buy the case here but the price is crazy. Im not going to pay anywhere near $35 for a case of 12 when I can buy them at my grocery store for a $1.25 each! That make this DOUBLE the price. Not a chance. Lower your price to a realistic point and maybe Ill purchase from you.<br /><br />  ***UPDATE***<br />  LOcal price is about $2 on average now so these are quite as overpriced anymore but not still not enough of a deal to buy here if you can find locally.
