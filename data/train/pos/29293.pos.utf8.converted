I've read many places and heard Dr. Oz say that the only oatmeal that really has the health benefits is steel cut oats.  I just love this stuff.  I make a large amount and eat it cold all week.  I use 8 cups of water, 1/2 cup non-fat dry milk, mix it, bring to a boil, and then dump in 2 cups of the oats.  Stand by the pot and keep stirring so it doesn't overflow the pot or stick to the bottom.  I love the flavor and the sort of crunch.  It would also be good with dried cranberries and some walnuts or slivered almonds.  It's a few pennies cheaper at Trader Joe but they don't always have it.  I've been eating it every day and thoroughly love it.<br /><br />EDITED TO GIVE A GREAT AND EASY WAY TO COOK STEEL-CUT OATS:<br />After a few batches, I have perfected this stovetop technique for steel-cut oats:<br />1. boil 4 cups of water in a pot on the stove<br />  (optional:  1/2 cup non-fat dry milk to up the calcium)<br />2. add 1 1/2 cups of steel-cut oats<br />3. bring to rolling boil again<br />4. cover tightly and let it keep boiling for a few seconds<br />5. turn off flame and forget about it.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long, under 1/2 hour I think but not sure, and the water is totally absorbed and you have the perfect combination of creamy/chewy steel-cut oats.<br /><br />You get enough for quite a few servings; not sure how many. 10 maybe??<br /><br />Nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot. What a delight.<br /><br />Much better than standing over the pot and stirring and much better than cooking in a slow cooker.<br /><br />(Learned this on egullet!)
