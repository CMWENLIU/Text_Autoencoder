Absolutely a must for hot chocolate lovers who don't want the sugar. You can sweeten it yourself with xylitol or stevia.  Unfortunately the company sent me the wrong product.  I'll keep it as it's just as good for my use.  Just make sure they send you the right stuff.  I highly recommend all Dagoba products.
