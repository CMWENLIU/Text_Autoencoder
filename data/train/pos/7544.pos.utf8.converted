Five Thousand Stars.<br /><br />I tried dirty sue for the first time last week and I asked myself why wouldn't this be available in every bar and restaurant I visit? From this day forward I will never drink a dirty martini unless it is made with Dirty Sue!<br /><br />Every one who reads this and agrees should ask their local bartender to please carry this phenomenal product--we want our dirty sue.<br /><br />-Long Live the Dirty Martini
