My kids love these!!The first bites brought smiles and"YUMS".I also really like and enjoy this mix!The quality of the tasty fruit is much better than i thought it would be! this fruit is not to hard or to soft.Its perfect for snacks,treats or just because!! Plus there is vitamin A,c,calcium and iron.Also this is not overly sweet either! I will buy this again!!
