If you want a hot drink with a coffee-like flavor (and a great aroma) but not the acid and caffeine, this is a great alternative.  I loved to drink coffee but I didn't love the way my body reacted to it.  Now I can have all the enjoyment with none of the negative effects.  I have been drinking this for a couple of weeks and actually prefer it to coffee now.  This is by far the best coffee alternative that I have found so far.
