Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really "food", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies.
