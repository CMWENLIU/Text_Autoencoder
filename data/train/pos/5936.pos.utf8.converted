This is without a doubt the best 70% chocolate I have ever tasted. Way above the so-called top brands, such as Valrhona, E. Guittard, Michel Cluizel, etc. The texture is smooth and creamy, and the taste is full of complexity - rich, but not overbearing. It has a nice espresso finish, but no bitterness, just a perfect blend. I not only eat this chocolate out of hand, but I also bake with it, and use it to make chocolate ice cream. You could not ask for better results. To summarize, this is a very unique, complex chocolate with a nice round taste, and tons of depth. Highly recommended.
