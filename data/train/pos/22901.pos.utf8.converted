I thought these cookies were a bit pricey, but with Subscribe and Save, the price is comparable to other organic sweets on the market. Luckily for me, the taste was NOT like other organic sweets on the market, and that is a good thing. While other organic cookies can be very dry and crumble after a single bite, the Late July cookies have a creamy filling that isn't greasy like Oreos. The outer cookie has a good crunch and texture that holds up well and doesn't crumble. There is no such thing as a healthy cookie, but if you get an occasional sweet tooth, these cookies are a great way to satiate that tooth without completely blowing your diet, and are organic to boot.<br /><br />There is no taste, smell or look of green tea in these cookies, you would never know they had green tea if it wasn't for the label. That is also a good thing, and knowing that you can get some of the great benefits of ECGC without a strong tea taste is a nice added bonus to these treats.<br /><br />These cookies are now my official sweet treat splurge that, in moderation, won't blow my food routine.
