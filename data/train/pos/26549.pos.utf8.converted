This wonderful piment&oacute;n comes from La Vera region of Spain where five varieties of peppers are grown. Two of the varieties are sweet, the other three have a more piquant quality.<br /><br />The peppers are dehydrated and smoked using traditional techniques, a process that imparts the final product a unique flavor.<br /><br />If the tin doesn't say "dulce" (sweet) the paprika will have a stronger and spicier taste, perfect for dishes such as chili.<br /><br />The paprika "dulce" adds a delightful flavor to tomato sauces, stews, rice pilafs, and any dish containing peppers or eggplants.<br /><br />Only buy smoked paprika in tins with a denomination of origin (D.O.) from "La Vera" or "Murcia."<br /><br />Tip: All Spanish smoked paprikas have a much more pronounced flavor. If you've never used them before, start with about half as much as what your recipe calls for.<br /><br />Be careful not to burn this paprika because it will turn bitter very quickly and ruin your dish. To avoid that, always make sure that there's enough fat/oil in the pan when sauteing.
