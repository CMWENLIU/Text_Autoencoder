The best butter chicken you ever had!<br /><br />Start with a medium SWEET (very important) onion and 2 - 3 cloves of garlic minced. Sautee in butter, very slowly while cutting chicken into 1" to 2" cubes (small because it cooks faster). Add the chicken to the onion/garlic sautee and add 2 tsp turmeric (or to taste) and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste).<br /><br />Start cooking your rice at this time.<br /><br />Cook over medium heat (don't burn the garlic) until chicken is done (5 to 10 minutes). Pre-mix the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken paste in a small bowl using hot water until smooth and add the mixture to the pan. Cook down to desired consistency.<br /><br />Optional: add tomato paste, plain yogurt or cream cheese (separately or in any combination). Or add a fresh mango cut into small pieces for "Mango Chicken".<br /><br />This makes a truly restaurant-class Indian dish and takes just 30 - 40 minutes from concept to meal. Serve with a small salad, fresh veggies and nan for a complete meal that is a real treat! Serves four (or two really hungry people). Double the recipe for 4 or more - the leftovers are just as good as the dinner and probably won't last until morning.
