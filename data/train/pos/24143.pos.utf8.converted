I am thrilled to be able to purchase and have the Trivedi Water delivered to my door!<br />I drink...A LOT of water...My dad taught me the appreciation for water<br />a long time ago, and growing up in athletics,<br />water was and continues to be my preferred source for hydration survival!<br />I consider The DIVINE, to be my primary<br />source of survival in all ways!<br />This water fits perfectly into that equation, as IT is infused with energy from<br />the DIVINE source! I am an overall healthy 55 y/o female and experience close to peak, optimum<br />health in most areas...The water provides for my thirst requirements in tasteless, odorless<br />perfection and is very refreshing!<br />My 26 y/o daughter swears that her skin 'cleared up', she 'feels better', and she has less emotional<br />stress associated with her menstrual cycle. My 6 y/o granddaughter drinks a lot more water when<br />we have Trivedi energy infused water. She said she 'likes the blessed water', 'it's good!'<br />I have photographs from my most amazing testimonial. I dropped a cap full of the water into an<br />almost empty bud vase where a dying red rose had made her home for the previous 2 weeks. Her petals were<br />crispy and all of her leaves had dropped...her stem was brown half the way down and only half of the<br />stem remained green. I watched for several days with the expectation of a miracle. Perhaps, her petals<br />would come back to life! That didn't happen, but what did happen is a tiny shoot with 3 little leaves<br />of bright lime green grew from the spot where one of the dried leaves had dropped!!!<br />My daughter and granddaughter witnessed this with me and I took photographs...Miraculous happening on a<br />cellular level!<br />My dad taught me something else in his efforts to expose me to everything at the dinner table...<br />He said, 'how do you know, if you don't try it?'....what I learned is ...<br />When I didn't try it, he laughed and said, "MORE for ME!"<br /><br />I AM of the humble opinion that we ALL should be provided with<br />this water through our political resources as part of a preventative health care maintenance plan!Thank you
