I risked buying a case of this oatmeal, even though I'd never tried it, because a competitor stopped making the flavor I'd been eating for years. It tastes great, with a pleasant maple flavor that remains for awhile, and it's lower in sugar than most (6g). If you like it sweeter (as I do), just add a packet of Equal. Each packet is well sealed, making ant infestations less likely (a problem with my former brand). One caution to those on a low sodium diet: it does have 180 mg sodium. If you like oatmeal and maple flavoring, you can't go wrong with this.
