Since we started using Blue Buffalo for our 2 dogs, the change has simply been amazing.  They've trimmed down (lost some excess weight), coats are sleek and shiny, and they have much more energy.  And it has NO CORN!  Both our dogs are rescue animals.  One has had a problem with odor - she simply STINKS.  Blue Buffalo dramatically improved her odor, too!  We love Blue Buffalo and will continue to feed it.  Too bad it's so expensive - but to me, it's well worth the extra cost to get the benefits for our animals.
