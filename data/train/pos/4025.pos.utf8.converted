Thanks to Green Mountain (Keurig) buying up all the K-Cup makers, traditional K-Cups keep getting more and more expensive while getting less and less good.<br /><br />Bad combination.<br /><br />I was almost resigned to buying my own coffee and using the Ekobrew refillable filter until my Keurig gave out but then I came across San Francisco Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser non-K-cups.<br /><br />WOW, I can actually use the large cup setting again!<br /><br />These deceptively little pods pack a punch and while I'm no coffee expert, they are consistent and taste great.<br /><br />Now I'm just hoping that Green Mountain doesn't take them over...
