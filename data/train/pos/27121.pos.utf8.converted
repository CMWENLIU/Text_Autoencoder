My quest for a good vegetarian bouillon has ended! The bouillon smells great and I love that it is in powder form! It does give a nice taste to my soups and I will (finally!) no longer make vegetable stock from scratch. As an FYI, this is the brand of bouillon that several Bristish cookbooks refer to, like The Rose Bakery Cookbook or Ottolenghi.
