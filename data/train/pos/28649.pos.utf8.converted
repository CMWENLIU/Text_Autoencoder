I originally bought this product from the King Arthur flour website, but I'll glad to find this on Amazon.  The aroma of this emulsion reminds me of yellow cake batter.  I like to add this to my sweet yeast doughs and cakes.  This gives my baked goods that extra "hmmmm, did this come from a bakery?" kind of flavor.  I also use the Almond Baking Emulsion instead of almond oil.  I find that the flavors don't taste diluted, once my recipes are baked.  These products are a pantry staple.
