I've eaten Kasha all my life and I'm 66 years old. We always had it as a breakfast cereal and many times for dinner cooked with onions and chicken broth; on many occasions we added pasta bowties. Today I am a diabetic and kasha is a life saver because it is the only grain cereal I can eat a nice big bowl of and it doesn't 'jack up' my blood sugar and it has a nice glycemic index in that my sugar level remains at a constant level for quite a while and then drops slowly. If I eat oatmeal, cream of wheat, or corn meal mush; my sugar goes above 200 and then drops like a rock after my morning hike. With the same amount of kasha, the level never exceeds 140! Besides the health benefits, it tastes so goooooooooooood!
