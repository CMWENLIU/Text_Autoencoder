I have tried many olive oils in the past with little to no flavor.  This oil has a wonderful taste. You can use this  oil ,almost as much as you would use butter, without all of the animal fat. I use use this oil for my salads, add to tuna fish instead of mayo, and use it once in a while to top off my cooking. My favorite way to cook with this oil is to fry eggs and garlic together, with a touch of sea salt and black pepper. I am glad to have found such a good tasting oil. Stay healthy , Retired early.
