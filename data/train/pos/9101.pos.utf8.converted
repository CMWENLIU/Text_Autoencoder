While I don't enjoy eating this crispbread alone- it is too dry, I am addicted to using it instead of bread. I put tuna, eggs, fruit, cheese, you name it on these and it turns into a meal.  Very yummy.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ALO05I">GG Scandinavian Bran Crispbread, 3.5 Ounce Bag</a>
