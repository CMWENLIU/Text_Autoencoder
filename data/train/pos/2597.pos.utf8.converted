I have used many different brands of coconut oil but I must say Nutiva Organic coconut oil is definitely one of the best ones. It has the pure coconut smell and great for use on skin. It was manufactured very recently and has a 2 year lifespan which is impressive. The shipping was incredibly fast, took only 3 days for this to appear at my house. It's also great for cooking.
