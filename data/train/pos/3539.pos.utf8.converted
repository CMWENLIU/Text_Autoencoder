Herb Ox Vegetarian Broth is non waxy (unlike KORR), and is a true vegetarian broth, though becoming increasingly difficult to find in local supermarkets. Have been using this particular broth for over thirty years and I still love its taste and consistency. If you're a vegan or vegetarian, this is a marvelous broth which would compliment any dish, or as a good stand alone. Great for when you are sick also.
