While, I had shipping issues again. I have had PureVia before.  I prefer it over Truvia, Stevia, etc... It is Zero Calorie (not 15 calorie or some other "low calorie stevia alternative."  The ingredients taste great and leave no after-taste.  I grew-up during the "Equal," "Nutrasweet" a.k.a. aspartame generation and can handle the taste of Diet Coke with Nutrasweet.  However, "Sweet & Low" a.k.a. saccharin was and has been part of the carcinogenic risk my whole life and don't use it.  Sugar is plain bad (from a healthy eating stand-point) - I know, artificial sweetners are not good for you either.<br /><br />However, PureVia is an excellent artificial sweetner in place of Saccharin, Aspartame, and Ace-K (Acesulfame Potassium. Stevia based sweetners are best and the most natural. There is nothing natural about Splenda. They make claims it comes from real sugar, but the process to get that is far from natural.<br /><br />Stevia is naturally extracted from the Stevia plant, a part of the Crysanthynum family; it is done so without the use of chemicals or radiation. Then the sweetest part of the Stevia plant is also extracted; "Reb-A." It is again, an all-natural process, with no chemicals, harsh extraction processes, radiation, etc...used. These ingredients are mixed with inert substances including (dextrose, cellulose poweder, and other natural products). It is gluten free, Kosher, and leaves no bitter after-taste like most sweetners that aren't simple sugar. Research will show that not all Stevia based products (like Truvia, Stevia, etc...) are created the same way nor have the same ingredients.<br /><br />PureVia is the cheapest. A box of 40 at the grocery is about $2.50-$3.00. A small box of Truvia can run up in the $5.00+ range.<br /><br />There is a product called "Stevia in the Raw" from the makers of "Sugar in the Raw"<br /><br />"Sugar in the Raw is real granulated unbleached Sugar made from Turbinado Sugar from Sugar Cane; however, although much better than white granulated sugar, it still has 25 calories per serving and contains sugar. It is also very course and hard to dissolve in iced drinks.<br /><br />"Stevia in the Raw" is admittedly, the BEST Stevia product.  Better than PureVia. However, it is much more expensive.  The reason it is better is the lack of added ingredients.  The process to obtain the Stevia and Reb-A is the same; however, only Dextrose or Malodextrin "Carbohydrates from Corn" are used as a "cutting agent." It is Zero calorie. In addition to Dextrose, the following contain extra "Natural Ingredients":<br /><br />Truvia adds erythritol, a sugar alcohol.<br />PureVia adds erythritol and isomaltulose, a disachharide of glucose and fructose (creating sucrose by enzymatic rearrangement).<br /><br />So, as you can see, they all have their own unique signatures, "Stevia in the Raw" being the apparent "safest" and "most natural."<br /><br />However, this review is about PureVia and I find it to be a pleasant transition from the normal Diet Soda sweetners and artificial sweetner packets at your local restaurant.  Give it a try or try "Zero Calorie Sobe" flavored waters.  They use PureVia, if I am correct. Vitamin Water Zero may use Truvia (Not definite on that one).
