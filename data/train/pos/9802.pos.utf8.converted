I love the thinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter bars - they are a tasty protein-filled, gluten-free, no sugar bar that works well to fill in for a missed meal or busy day on the go. BUT - the last 2 orders I've received from Amazon.com have been horrible - seems like the product was either past its prime and/or had melted and then re-hardened.
