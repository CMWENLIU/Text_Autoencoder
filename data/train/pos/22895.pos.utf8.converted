I am a avid crystal light drinker and i bought Mio the sweet tea version today.  I like the idea of adjusting the taste as i go and sweet tea taste pretty good.  I've always found that crystal light was way too strong so i always had to dilute it with more water.  And with regards to additives it's your choice as a consumer as to whether you are going to consume it or not.  Personally I'll take my chances because I'm an adult and I can make my own decisions.  I personally like this as a alternative to crystal light bottom line.
