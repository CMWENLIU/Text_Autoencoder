I adore the taffy from taffy town, it's soft and I love most of the flavors. That said, I have to agree that I don't like to buy it as an assortment. My family loves the tropical and fruity flavors & my mom loves the chocolate, caramel & licorice, so we can usually split an assortment, but I prefer to buy individual flavors.
