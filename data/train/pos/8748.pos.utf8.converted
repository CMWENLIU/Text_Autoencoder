My wife and I are runners and all around athletes. I bought these after seeing Ryan Hall rave about them on his blog. Here are a few thoughts.<br /><br />They may seem expensive, but what I found is that they are so filling, we don't have to eat much. We make 3 servings per meal (I usually eat 2 and my wife 1). This is 1 cup which is about a 1/7 of the box. That meal ends up being about $0.75 for the two of us! Also, most pancakes usually have tons of calories, I can eat two servings, be comfortably full and only have eaten 260 calories. That's amazing!<br /><br />They are very quick to make. We have only made pancakes so far, but it only takes about 20 seconds of whisking. How easy is that?<br /><br />As for taste, I'm not AMAZED but they are good. They are boarder-line bland, so I put a little butter spray on them. We often mix them with fruit. However, for wholegrain... I'd say they are excellent. We've started mixing in protein powder and that has the potential to improve the taste depending on the protein you use.<br /><br />Healthy, cheap, easy, tasty, hearty... what more do you want?
