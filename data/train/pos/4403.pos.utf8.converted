Tully's Kona is a wonderfully smooth coffee.  Kona coffee in general is outstanding.  If you have never had Kona coffee, you must simply try this K-Cup.  Tully's Kona coffee gives you a bit more robust flavor than a Columbian coffee, without the bitterness of a darker or more bold coffee.  It is smooth and tasty.
