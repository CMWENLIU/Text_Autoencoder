I am not one to play the race card, but when it comes to tea I stand firmly on my Britishness.  Tetley's British Blend is real tea, not the pallid, anemic apology for tea that skulks in silly little bags (twee bags) with strings and tags and staples and other absurd paraphernalia attached, in a vain attempt to disguise the uselessness of trying to extract any vestige of taste from the contents.  These are round, robust bags that sit purposefully at the base of the cup and mean business.  They contain real tea with real taste.  Make sure the water is boiling hot when you pour it on, give the bag a minute to soak - encourage it with a little squeezing - then add a drop of low-fat milk or a slice of lemon and enjoy a true cuppa, taking time to sneer at the poor, deluded fools around you, sipping at their pathetic rosehip infusions or vanilla flavored Lobsang Souchang Rama Gupta, or whatever it is.<br /><br />The shelf life is long enough for you to buy it in bulk, and Amazon's price is good, so treat yourself to a proper cuppa.  Coffee can only start your day.  Tea can make it.
