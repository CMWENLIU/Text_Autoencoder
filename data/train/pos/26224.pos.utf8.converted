I bought this candy as an early Valentine's/Birthday present for my husband.  I realized when it arrived that 2lbs? Yeah, that's a LOT of marzipan.<br /><br />Fortunately for us, it is DELICIOUS! We opened the box up right away and dove right in. The candy was finely ground, without a grainy texture we've found in some other candy.  It was nicely sweet and intensely almond flavored.  Even my picky two-year-old tried a piece and asked for a second.<br /><br />To prolong our enjoyment of the candy, we froze two of the trays and are quickly working our way through the third.
