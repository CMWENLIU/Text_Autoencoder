My friend Denna adopted her Sheltie from us at Sheltie Rescue of Utah.  I was over her house the other day. I had brought some of Z-Chews to share with her boy, Duke.  She immediately told me that Duke doesn't like any chewies and she's tried a whole bunch.  He just leaves them laying around.  I said...well...I've got them here, it's a premium product with outstanding ingredients, so let's just see what happens when we offer him one.  You know the end of this story...Duke at first sniffed suspiciously but then ate the Zuke's Z-Chew.  Denna stood there like she was in shock.  So, we found a chewie treat that Duke likes and it's really good for him too.  Yeah!  I'm really sorry that someone else's dog threw up the pieces.  If that happened soon after eating the Z-chew then there was no time for anything to get digested.  Everybody's stomach is different...human or canine.
