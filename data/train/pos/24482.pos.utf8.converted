If you are on Weight Watchers, there is no better snack bar. I eat them for breakfast and, get this, they are only TWO POINTS. You can buy Weight Watchers own bars and they are about one-third the size. These are satisfying and come on, they have one side that's coated in chocolate! I also like that they have plenty of fiber - five grams, and are loaded with many essential vitamins. I bought a case of these bars and am about to buy more.<br /><br />YUMMY!
