Vegan. Natural. Incredibly wonderful aroma from the moment you carefully open the pop-top can. Huge bouquet of India spices. Very spicy. Very hot. 100% authentic. "A ticket to India" in every can. Not for those without a sense of adventure or experience with intensely full flavor Indian cuisine. My first spoonful by chance (and luck because I enjoy them) had a whole green chili. The fresh ginger shreds are divine. Unbelievably delicious. Great with whole wheat vegan tortillas if don't have chapatis or naan [Indian breads] available. Also great with organic white or brown rice. A new top shelf spicy standard for prepared Indian. Another warning (and kudo) that this recipe pulls no punches. "Truly Indian." Some of my friends in India do not normally make food this hot in their own homes [which is not to say that there also are not incredibly delicious recipes that are no so far up on the hotness scale.] A jewel for those looking for this type of food experience! I still can't believe it. Choley or chole along with chana are Indian words for chickpea which are some of my very favorites dishes in Indian cuisine. Eleven stars. Made with chickpeas, tomato, onion, water, cottonseed oil, ginger, garlic, coriander, salt, green chilis, melon seeds, tamarind, cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, poppy seeds, nutmeg, bay leaf, and fenugreek. 600 calories and 20g protein per 15.8 oz/450g can. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.
