Savory Choice is the best stock I've found and I love everything about it.  First off, it's flavor is incomparable to any other pre-made stock product and it really tastes like what chicken stock is supposed to taste like. I shared it with my grandmother and it won even *her* stamp of approval.  Secondly, I love that it is concentrated so that you make up just the amount you need, which is especially handy when you are deglazing a pan to make a sauce, for example; you don't end up with a whole quart container going bad in your fridge.  Finally, if there's anything I learned from NY apt. living, I love how small the footprint is of the box, itself.  It's also great to pack for backpacking trips, to keep in your desk at work, etc.<br /><br />They make chicken, beef, and turkey and around the Bay Area, it's available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, Andronico's, etc.
