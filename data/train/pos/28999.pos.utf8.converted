I ordered this after hearing other moms talk about using coconut oil on their babies' bottoms instead of typical diaper rash cream.  The antifungal/antibacterial properties really do prevent rashes.  Our baby had already had 2 yeast rashes in his first 3 weeks after birth so I ordered this coconut oil and use it every other diaper change or when he looks red.  He has been 100% rash free for the last 4 weeks.  Also tried it out on my other son's dry chapped cheeks- worked great! I suffer from psoriasis and am considering adding some of this oil to my baths- you can't beat the fresh coconut smell either.
