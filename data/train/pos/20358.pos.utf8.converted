We have six assorted sized dachshunds all heavy chewers. This is the favorite toy/treat of all six. Even though there are always more than enough bones to go around they always want the bone another dog has. They will patiently watch each other and as soon as the one chewing on bone loses  interest they will swoop in and grab the bone for themselves. They all get excited when we open a new pack. We buy the three pack.
