Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Low fat. Classic bean chili style. Full of delicious black beans. Not strongly spiced, but very flavorful. Great with organic rice or pasta or with your favorite crackers. Can be used like 'dal' in South Asian cuisine. No GMO ingredients. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
