You wonder a little when or where Amazon gets this--it's usually a restaurant supply item, and there is so much in one package that it will take one person a year or two to use up.  However, it is gluten-free, which means it's a good thing to have on hand if you or someone you cook for is gluten-free.<br /><br />Why do you want potato starch?  Because you can use it and rice flour to make microwave mochi;  you can make microwave brownies, pizza and dessert mochi, without gluten, with only about three ingredients and ten or fifteen minutes.
