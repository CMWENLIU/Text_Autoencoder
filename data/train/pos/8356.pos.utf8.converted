Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />***** Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!<br /><br />Nutritional Value: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br />Packaging, Appearance, Flavor: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br />Competitive Pricing & Value: *** Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Delicious nutty flavor with a very crunchy texture.<br />+ Only 4 grams of naturally-derived sugar (AND NO CORN SYRUP)!<br />+ All-natural minimalist set of ingredients.<br />+ Due to the all-natural nutritional content that is not artificially fortified with extra vitamins, these serve solely as snack bars and are not meant to be used as meal-bar diet aids.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- Slightly expensive considering the small 40-gram (1.4 ounce) size of each bar.<br /><br />Although these snack bars come in four different flavors, this review is specifically for the "Madagascar Vanilla Almond" flavor...<br /><br />The Amazon product listing for this snack bar currently does not list its nutritional information, so I included it below (copied from the kindsnacks Web site):<br /><br />Ingredients: Mixed nuts (almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts), honey, non GMO glucose, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar vanilla, soy lecithin.<br /><br />Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamin A (0% DV), Vitamin C (0% DV), Calcium (6% DV), Iron (6% DV).Vitamin E (25% DV), Vitamin K (2% DV), Vitamin B1 (4% DV), Vitamin B2 (10% DV), Vitamin B3 (10% DV), Vitamin B6 (4% DV), Folate (6% DV), Phosphorus (15% DV), Magnesium (20% DV), Zinc (8% DV)<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Bar (40g)<br />Calories: 210<br />Fat Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 16g<br />Saturated Fat: 2<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 15mg<br />Potassium: 210mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 14g<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g<br />Sugars: 4g<br />Protein: 7g<br /><br />Nutritional Value: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br /><br />As befits the Kind company's slogan of "Ingredients you can see & pronounce", the ingredient listing for these snack bars includes just the necessities, without the various chemistry lab listing of corn syrup-derived sugar, vitamin additives, preservatives, and strange-sounding artificial compounds that some snack bars include.  The "non GMO glucose" means that the glucose is derived from non-genetically-modified sources.  Unlike the sucrose table sugar, glucose is a very simple sugar that is easily digested by the body.  "Madagascar vanilla" is sometimes promoted as being a premium vanilla that comes from Madagascar, even though most of us would not really notice any difference between vanilla sources and where the plants were grown.  But many so-called "vanilla-flavored" foods are artificially flavored with vanillin derived from lignin instead of vanilla fruits, so at least we get real vanilla here, instead of artificial vanilla flavoring.  The "soy lecithin" ingredient acts as an emulsifier to hold the ingredients together and keep them from separating.  Soy lecithin is a byproduct of soybean oil production.  So all ingredients used in these bars are vegan and natural in origin.  If you are allergic to either soy or nuts, you should not consume these bars.  But these bars are gluten-free for gluten-sensitive people, dairy-free, cholesterol-free, very low sodium, and have a low glycemic index with no trans fats.<br /><br />I am particularly happy with the fact that corn syrup, and all its variants, are not used in these snack bars, and that they are not all loaded up with sugar.  Too many snack bars list corn syrup as one of their primary ingredients!  These bars also have less sodium than most snack bars out there.<br /><br />Because these snack bars are not artificially fortified with additional vitamins, they do not serve as meal replacement bars, so they are not comparable to a meal-bar like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GU66BY">SlimFast 200 Calorie, Sweet & Salty Chocolate Almond, Meal Bar 5pk, 7.93-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> (which, like many meal bars and snack bars, is full of corn syrup).<br /><br />Packaging, Appearance, Flavor: ***** Excellent 5-fuzzies rating<br /><br />These bars have a hard, very crunchy, whole-nut texture that I found totally enjoyable to eat as a snack in between meals and on hiking trails.  The texture is somewhat like crunching on peanut brittle, but certainly not as sweet as peanut brittle.  If you prefer your snack bars to be soft and chewy, this is not the right bar for you... but be aware that "soft and chewy" often translates to "loaded with sugar".  If you have sensitive teeth or gums, biting into this crunchy bar may cause some discomfort.
