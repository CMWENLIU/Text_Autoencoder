This is an awesome, convenient product.  My kids actually like this better than "real" (i.e. meat) taco filling.  It's much quicker to make than hamburger, lower fat, and obviously stores for much longer.  We aren't vegetarian but I try to limit our meat intake so I always use this in our tacos.  I'm glad Amazon carries this because it's not available at our local grocery stores.  Yummy!
