Surprised of the bad reviews because of the smell, . . .come on seriously?  Dog lick their privates and smell each others butts.  I mean the smell is hardly that of a baked apple pie but I love that these treats are made of natural ingredients.  I also love the perfect pea sized shape.  Not to much and not to little.  My puppy loves the stuff and I've gotten him to do all sorts of things.  Catch a frisbee, sit, down, shake, sit pretty, play dead, roll over, fetch, touch a target, say his prayers, stay, and come and he's only 4 months old.  I make sure that I adjust his feeding when I treat so that he does not over eat for the day.  These are great.  I buy the peanut butter flavor.
