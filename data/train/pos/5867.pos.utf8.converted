I love this stuff. I debated for a very long time about whether it would be worth the money. It is. I feel much more clean- if that makes sense. I also have a clearer mind and love the way I feel after putting a scoop of this in my smoothies. For my smoothies I use water, almond milk, 5 frozen strawberries, 1/2 frozen banana, 1 scoop whey protein powder, 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, some cinnamon, and a scoop of Amazing grass. I love the way it tastes.
