I love me some tijuana mama's!!  It says they are "300% Hotter."  Hotter than what  I dont know.  Cant be the Big Mama variety cause these arent even all that hot.  They just taste awesome.  My friends make fun of me cause I love these but if you love pickled sausage like me you know you are a rare breed that has a need to feed.  Buy or die.
