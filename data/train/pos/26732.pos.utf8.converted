My mother got a job in a diner in Oakland California when she was 17 years old (she is now 91, she loved the coffe they served, Farmers Brothers) 55 years later I went to work for a Hotel that served Farmers Brothers coffee I took some coffee to make a pot for my mother and she immediately knew it was Farmers brothers coffee she remembered this coffee after all those years. I still use it it's the only coffee that we use it dosen't leave a after<br />taste in your mouth.  It's the BEST
