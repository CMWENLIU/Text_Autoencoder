Blair isn't joking: that plastic skull is a cogent, stark warning not to take this sauce lightly.  And another note: this isn't so much a sauce as it is an additive.<p>Here's how you can literally fire up your mouth: take one 24 ounce jar of generic hot salsa from your supermarket.  Let's say you laugh at their idea of &quot;hot&quot;, which means you're ready to go with Blair's Sudden Death Sauce.<p>Put the salsa in a blender.  Do not blend yet.  Pour about 1/4&quot; of water in the empty jar, shake it up, pour into the blender (get all of your salsa's worth).  Put four-six drops of Blair's into the blender.  Cover and blend on &quot;Liquify&quot;.<p>Pour into a serving bowl.  Take a nacho chip, dip, and eat.  Now run to your  kitchen sink, and stick your mouth under the tap.  After five minutes, the burning should stop.<p>Repeat until the bag of chips are gone.<p>I add a few drops to canned chicken soup, and it really makes it far more tasty and hot than you could ever buy.  I'm impressed at how tasty the sauce really is, if you use it properly.  It takes a little practice to get the right balance of flavor-to-hot, but it really does add flavor to soups, salads, chili (man, does it ever), hamburger, just about anything.  A single bottle might last you about three months, and you'll sneer at lesser sauces in your grocer's aisles.<p>fred
