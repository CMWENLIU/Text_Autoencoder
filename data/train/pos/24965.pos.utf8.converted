First off, whoever pays $18 to ship an item that costs $1.89 will most likely already have a bitter taste in their mouth. That said, unless you live in the sticks, most civilized areas have places like Trader Joes, Whole Foods, Wild Oats, and other places. I walked five minutes to Ralphs (owned by a little company known as Kroeger) and plopped down 99 cents for these noodles. Also, if you don't know the first thing about cooking, don't expect much from these. They're not your garden variety Kraft Mac 'n Cheese out of a box (or a bag, in this case). Use your imagination (yes, what a hard task for some of you). Seasonings, other than your basic salt and pepper, can bring out quite a bit of flavor. And no, I'm not saying just basic pasta sauce either. You can make a tasty Thai dish, or even just butter and romano cheese would be nice. Just THINK before you complain. Otherwise, you can keep eating refined carbohydrates and wonder why 60% of America is fat. Okay, rant over!
