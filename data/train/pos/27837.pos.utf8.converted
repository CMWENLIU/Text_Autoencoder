This chili powder is the only one my mother would use and now my family uses. There is no other chili like it. The color, the texture of the product is awsome. I have used others, but they leave a gritty feel to the sauce. We as a family have been using this brand for over 50 years and since we left Texas, here in Idaho... it is hard to find. When we can't find it, we ask our relatives from Lubbock to ship it to us.
