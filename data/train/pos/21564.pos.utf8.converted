This is a flavorful, smooth and rich variety from Timothy's.  I like my coffee strong and without bitterness.  This one filled the bill perfectly.  If you like the deepness of espresso along with the ability to stand up to sweetners and creamers (I use half and half), then this is the coffee for you.  It was a First Cup in the Morning WINNER.
