Very different from the bland white mac and cheese we grew up with, this dish is heavy on the full-bodied taste and texture of whole wheat pasta and has the quality I've come to expect from Hodgson Mills products, since I regularly use their whole wheat flour and stone-ground corn meal in my kitchen. Try it and you'll like it. But don't expect it to taste like Kraft Dinner.
