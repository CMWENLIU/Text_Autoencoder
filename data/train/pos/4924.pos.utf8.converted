I eat about 3 tablespoons of VCO per day.<br /><br />I have used Garden of Life and Spectrum Brands, both of which were the UNREFINED versions.<br />Those brands were delicious and Bronners Fresh Pressed Virgin Whole Kernel is no exception.<br /><br />I prefer unrefined, flavorful coconut oil and this is exactly what I got.  I eat it straight from the bottle and it does not make me gag at all.  I love it!<br /><br />Not only is it delicious with a taste of toasted coconut, it really smoothes the skin out.<br /><br />I think that I will start cleansing my face with this rather than soap, I have read that people do this.  I will try that and write an update.<br /><br />BTW, Bronners sells two version of their VCO, this Whole Kernel Unrefined and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052AIF00">Dr Bronner's Fresh-pressed Virgin Coconut Oil White Kernel Unrefined 14 Fl Oz</a>.<br /><br />According to Bruce Fife, an expert on Coconut and Coconut oil,<br /><br />The difference between the "white kernel" and "Whole kernel" is that the whole kernel includes the brown membrane that separates the kernel from the shell. According to Fife, this membrane has a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer's website, "Whole kernel oil, which is made from the kernel with its "parings" is more nutritious and has a slightly nuttier flavor whereas white kernel oil offers a choice to consumers who are familiar with this grade. Both grades are versatile and healthy along with being organic and fair trade."<br /><br />UPDATE:  I missed this the first time.  Bronners' VCO is made from dried coconut as is Spectrum. Whereas Garden of Life VCO is is made from freshly picked coconuts that are used within 24-48 hrs, the coconut meat shredded (not dried) & cold-pressed using the water from inside the coconut, then fermented to extract the oil.<br /><br />I just received some Tropical Traditions coconut oil and will review and compare shortly.
