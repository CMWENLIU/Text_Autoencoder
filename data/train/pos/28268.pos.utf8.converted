Pieces can be large so I break them up but there are also smaller pieces and some powder.You should keep it in the original package and take out a week's worth or so at a time and store in a jar or plastic container as it can get stale once out of the original package. The 4 oz size is pretty large, like a large yogurt container.<br />Be careful about forgetting them in your pocket they can stink things up if left there for months. (Some other brands come from china, I like that these are made in the USA)
