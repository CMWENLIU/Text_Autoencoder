The previous reviewer wrote a review without ever having tried the product, which seems inherently wrong.  I can honestly say I have had pickled watermelon rinds dozens of times and LOVE them.  Who is to say what is gross and what is frugality?  Millions of people eat dogs and horses, which I would never try, but I don't condemn them.  Anyway, please try them.  They are great.  They are tangy and sweet and with just enough crunch.  Yum!
