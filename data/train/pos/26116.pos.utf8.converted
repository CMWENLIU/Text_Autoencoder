Great item!  Definitely go with organic and don't but 'lite' types.  You can  the add water yourself-why pay the same for half the product.  Nice generous amount of cream-even more so than some more expensive brands.  Excellent for drinking when mixed with 1/2 to 3/4 can of water and a little vanilla.  (Thickens when refrigerated.)  Even good in coffee or cereals instead of milk.
