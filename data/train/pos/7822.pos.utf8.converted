Before detailing the added benefits of Miso-Cup, I offer the opinion of my wife, Yumi, a Japanese woman born and raised in Yokohama.<br /><br />"This is the best instant miso soup I've ever had," she said.<br /><br />So, we promptly placed an Amazon Subscribe & Save order for regular shipments.<br /><br />What are the added benefits I noted earlier? Edward & Sons Miso-Cup is organic, gluten free and proudly displays that it contains "NO MSG" and is "Vegan" with the big "V". Each serving has only 60 calories.<br /><br />If that isn't cool enough the company offers to replace your disposable soup cup with a reusable Miso-Cup travel mug for only $3.99 with all proceeds donated to reforestation charities. You get your good deed of the day and lunch all in one!<br /><br />Getting back to the taste - the main reason we purchased this product - the ingredients are easy to read and understand. You get freeze-dried tofu and green onions, wakame seaweed and vegetable seasonings. There are three servings in each packet.<br /><br />The Miso-Cup nicely compliments a bento lunch or an order of sushi. I keep a packet in my desk drawer with a small bowl. Preparation is easy. You squeeze out the first packet of miso and stir in eight ounces of hot water until it dissolves. Add the tofu and vegetable packet and stir again. That's it.<br /><br />Whether you used to live in Japan or just want to experience miso soup for the first time, Edward & Sons Miso-Cup is a great product - tasty, convenient and healthy. Rating: Five stars.
