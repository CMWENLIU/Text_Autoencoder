I purchased this because my 2 neopolitan mastiffs would lift the chain link fence and go out to chase rabbits in the desert. After installing all long the fence (500 ft) I took the dogs to the corner where there was a hole where they used to easily get out. One dog got a shock and jumped away. I do not know if the other dog got shocked.  Then both dogs went all along the fence and looked for a place where were was no wire but there was none. So far they have not gotten out.  I intend to turn off the electricity after a couple of weeks to see if it still works.  Now I am going to set up wire around my garden. Very easy to install. I used black clips to hold it out from the chain link fence and handles to open at the gates. I unplug it when I go out and the dogs are in the house.
