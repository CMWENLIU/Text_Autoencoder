Now my kids don't ever have cool-aid type drinks, so to them, this taste like a treat!  We take this every day (I only do a 1/2 scoop, to last longer, with 3 kids!) and it has done a world of good for us (along with a powder probiotic, buffered Vit C powder -with magnesium and stuff like that-- and glutamine powder) we do this power drink )using mostly water, and a little apple juice) and my kids have been healthy ALL WINTER!  This has never happened before.  We are pretty healthy eaters, no sweets, etc. but this is truly amazing!!!  (I have a first grader, and 2 preschoolers).  HIGHLY recommend this .  Oh, and we are also very sensitive to different foods (gluten, dairy, etc) but eating this before we eat those foods helps them to be not so sensitive!
