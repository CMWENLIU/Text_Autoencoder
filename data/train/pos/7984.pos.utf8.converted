I have one dog suffering with a serious congenital illness and am not one who easily submits to medications.  Having had this dog under the care of a homeopathic veterinarian who has carefully instructed me on the pros and cons of different types of dog foods and treats, I highly recommend this product.  I've learned to be more aware and choosy of the ingredients in dog food and treats and find this product a healthy one.  We all need to be more aware of what we feed our pets these days and give them a fair shot at living a longer and healthier life.  My dogs love them but serve in moderation per the instructions.  They contain important heart supplements and will prove beneficial to the health of your dogs....so love 'em the right way....through the stomach!!
