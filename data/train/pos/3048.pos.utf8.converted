With all due respect to "Mama Bear" what's important to me is that it tastes OK and is easy to prepare.  It does taste great, and in spite of all of the "chemicals" listed in the previous review, has only 386 calories.  If you spend 1.5 hours a day working out, as do I, that's not a huge issue.  I agree, it is important to be aware of various ingredients, but IMHO not necessary to obsess over them.  Much better than what you can pick up in the local grocery store..and now that I've gotten this off my chest, I may go down to Burger King and celebrate with a double whopper cheese.
