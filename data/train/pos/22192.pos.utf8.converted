Excellent flavor, mild, light but should be brewed carefully with a timer for only 2 minutes.  Loose tea leaves.  Preheat tea pot with hot water to enjoy a hot cup of tea from India and only add minimal milk, 1 teaspoon, as it requires much less milk.  No other flavoring needed.  May be bought cheaper at Indian grocery stores but it is difficult to find.
