Santa Fe brand is being sold here (Amazon.com) at something like $1.88 a bag, but you have to buy 8 at a time. And they are eligible for free shipping if you buy the $25 minimum order from Amazon. I haven't tried the Santa Fe brand, but think it might be worth checking out. The Mexicali Rose is just too expensive to even consider, even though the taste is great. It's the next best thing to home cooked, BETTER than home cooked if you're a gringo.
