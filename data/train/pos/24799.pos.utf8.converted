When did Amazon start selling this stuff? It's so hard to find, and it's awesome. Seriously, awesome.<br /><br />Manhattan Special is exactly what they say it is: an espresso soda. All the bitter kick of espresso with a thick layer of sugar and fizzy carbonation. The only problem is that it's hard to get.
