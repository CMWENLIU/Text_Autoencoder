Albeit a bit pricy, this is a delicious and healthy snack.  I enjoy all three favors - blueberry, raspberry and strawberry (probably in that order) - and for the price, it's a good alternative to keep on hand for last minute cravings, like drive through fast food breakfast on your way to work or vending machine afternoon candy bar temptations.  Great chewy texture, satisfies a sweet tooth, and leaves you feeling proud not guilty for putting something nourishing in your body.  Glad I tried it.  Bought it for the heavy omega oils content - really nutritious; if you're not crazy about fish, try this for your OFA.
