This Lucienne Orange chocolate bar is crisp and crunchy with a hint of orange flavor. You smell the fresh, citrus orange flavor more than taste it. I find it very satisfying when I'm craving chocolate. The taste is light and chocolatey without being too bitter.<br /><br />If you want a chocolate bar that tastes like the sugary sweet, waxy common chocolate bars, this is not for you. However, if you want a purely chocolate taste that is just a bit sweet, this may be what you're looking for. I truly enjoy this one.
