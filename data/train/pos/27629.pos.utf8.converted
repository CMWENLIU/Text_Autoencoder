Starting to feel a cold coming on?  Don't feel like or have time to go to the doc?  Keep a box of Echinacea Plus in the house for just those times.  It's got a soothing taste, a soothing smell and it a great beverage anytime, not just when you are sick or on the way.<br /><br />Some people think this stuff works to help head off a cold, some don't.  It has worked well for me since the Pitt Student Health Clinic Suggested it years ago.  Sometimes it succeeds 100% in heading off a cold at the onset of symptoms when consumed as soon as the scratchy throat and runny nose start but sometimes it still takes a little extra help.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals makes great products.  They are kinda pricey but generally worth it (especially this one).  Go buy this at the local grocery or health food store.  You'll be able to buy it one box a time and the bulk price on Amazon is equal to or more expensive than the single unit price in a store.
