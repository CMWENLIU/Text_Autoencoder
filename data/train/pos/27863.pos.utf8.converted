This product is wonderful!  I have nothing to compare it to, but I had wanted to start making my own pizza's at home and decided to try using high gluten flour.  So far, the product has performed wonderfully each time I have used it.  I've made about 1/2 dozen pizzas using my own dough recipe and it has delivered each time.  The 5 lb. size is nice, as it is hard to find anything less than 25 lb. bags.  Price per pound compared to King Arthur's high gluten flour, it is about the same but slightly less, even with shipping & handling charges.  Overall rating: EXCELLENT!
