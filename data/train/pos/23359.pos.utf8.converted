I like the flavor of pomegranate w/resveratrol.  It's strong, but not too tart or sweet.  I look forward to my ounce every morning.  It gives me a little flavor punch to get me going.  My first 2 bottles came from Costco, but they were $30 each.  Because of the health benefits of this drink I was determined to continue using it, but I couldn't justify buying juice for that price.  I searched the web for the best price and this is where I found it.  What a difference.
