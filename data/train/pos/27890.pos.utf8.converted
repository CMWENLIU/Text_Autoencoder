I have tried many flavored or specialty K-Cups and the Golden French Toast is one of my favorites!  As with most of the flavored coffee K-Cups, it's more of a smell than taste for me (this explains why many people say the flavors are too "light" even though I enjoy this) but this one actually does taste like sweet maple syrup.  It's perfect in the mornings!
