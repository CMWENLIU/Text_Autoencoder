Hey, don't take the list of included flavors too seriously, I got different items in mine, and I suspect you will too... It was kinda fun to get the surprise flavors! Now if only they'd decide which flavors for which days, lol, I spend so much time just deciding which of the wonderful flavors to try each day!<br /><br />p.s. Rainforest Espresso: way strong. Good, but strong. Consider having some flavored creamer around in case you find it to be too much (I usually don't, but was lucky I did today)
