Fresh gooseberries and commercially prepared gooseberry pie are impossible to find, so if you like gooseberry pie, as my husband does, canned gooseberries are your only source.  The Oregon Gooseberries are the best and the label includes a recipe for the pie.  The Amazon.com price was much lower than the cost in the local supermarket for the same product.  The "use by" date on the can is sufficiently distant that we will have gooseberry pie twice a year for two years and use up the eight cans before they expire (each pie takes two cans of gooseberries).
