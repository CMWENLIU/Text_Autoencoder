We have been eating this rice for past 8 years and the rice has absolute consistent quality and texure every time we make it. We have been buying this from an ethnic store but now Amazon has the rice at even a better price. Would recommend soaking the rice for 30 min or so for best results.<br /><br />This rice is grown in the foothills of Himalayas and is enriched with minerals and natural Aroma. We have cooked many dishes including some Tea Rice and they are to die for. We would highly recommend this brand of Rice for your entire family.
