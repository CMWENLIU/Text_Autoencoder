I would definitely recommend any tea from Traditional Medicinals. Dandelion tea is a very nice, a bit bitter with a nice roast flavor. But be aware, you might spend the night in the restroom, it's kind of laxative. I think that's the reason it is recommended to those who suffer from hemorrhoids. If you already have regular bowel activity, it can be exhausting.
