Most reviewers seem to agree the quality of these mushrooms will add that special magic to any dish requiring their use. There is a decent ratio of whole mushrooms to stems. I assume the more expensive Grade 'Extra AA' offering by JR Mushrooms has more mushroom cap slices instead of so many stems.<br />As dried mushrooms have a very long shelf life buying them in bulk makes sense to anyone who like me loves to spontaneously prepare a good Porcini based Ragu Sauce, Polenta or Risotto but cringes at driving to the local supermarket to pay $6.99 an ounce for a skimpy cellophane bag of mushroom bits. This company shipped my order to the West Coast in what seemed to be overnight delivery. I will certainly be a repeat customer and will no doubt be preparing more recipes that include the wonderful flavor of dried Porcini mushrooms selected from my big gallon bag. Enjoy!
