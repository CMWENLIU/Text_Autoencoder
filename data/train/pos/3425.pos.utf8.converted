I will be buying this again,  it is a great tasting product and very handy for transporting and keeping for those times when you can't get to the store. Needs no refrigeration until it is opened, and once you do open it, it lasts for a long time in the refrigerator. My issues were with the expiration date. Mine expired about 2 months after I received it. There was no way that I could use 12 32oz cartons of this in that time--the very reason I bought it was because the description stated "long shelf life." Luckily, Amazon remedied the situation.
