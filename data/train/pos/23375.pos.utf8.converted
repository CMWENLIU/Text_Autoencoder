WOW!<br /><br />The tea has a uniquely wonderful flavor for those who love Lavender and a bit of Bergamot.  You'll have to be the judge if this is the tea for you or not; however, the amazing revolutionary infuser tea bag should be the standard for tea bags everywhere.<br /><br />Usually Full Leaf Tea is processed differently from how tea is processed for tea bag use, but not in this case.  When you pour the just boiled water in a cup with this tea bag you can immediately see the tea leaves growing in size.  It's like using loose leaf tea without having to strain the tea later.<br /><br />I gave this a 5 star rating because I simply enjoy this special unique taste.<br /><br />~
