I can't say enough good things about JR Mushrooms. These are top-quality chef inspired vanilla beans. I got them primaraily for my creme brulee.<br /><br />Another plus was the free shipping which really helps a struggling young chef like myself. The only slight dissappointment was that there was no "Best Creme Brulee" recipe enclosed. No problem for me as I've memorized the procedure.<br /><br />I can say this: You won't be dissappointed by this product. Use it in whatever calls for vanilla, even ice cream!
