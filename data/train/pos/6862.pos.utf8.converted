***Updated Dec 8, 2011******<br />From reading recent comments it sounds like this product has changed from when I reviewed it.  My package lists the ingredients as Blue: Deionized water, glycerin, red cabbage.  Red: Beet juice, citric acid.  Yellow: Deionized water, glycerin, curcumin.  More recent customers claim it now has chemicals.  If you are interested in natural food coloring, this doesn't sound like the product for you.  Hopefully Amazon will get the listing straightened out.<br />****************************<br /><br />We avoid artificial ingredients, so after attempting to color icing for Chirstmas cookies with fruit juice and beet juice last year, I bought this food coloring to try out this year.  After reading the other reviews, I didn't have high expectations and was only hoping that it would be easier than making my own (and it was).<br /><br />But I was able to get rich, vibrant colors, not simply pastels.  Certainly they weren't the bright artificial colors you get with petrochemicals, but they were far from the pale pink and yellows I was expecting.<br /><br />My first experimentation was with small batches of icing - only using a few tablespoons of powdered sugar and milk and 2-5 drops of coloring.  The red came out a magenta, not Barbie pink, but definitely not red, either.  The blue was kind of a greyish blue.  The yellow was the most like you would expect.  I had also thought that the colors wouldn't mix well but I made green by mixing the blue and yellow and a nice purple by mixing blue and red.<br /><br />As one reviewer noted, they don't have as long as a shelf life as non-natural colors.  I bought mine in October and they are dated 5/2011.  But I put them in the refrigerator immediately (not waiting until after they were opened) and I have read on another site that carries them that this can extend their life up to a year.  The yellow separates so I shook it well before using.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the results and would definitely use them again. I'll try to post a photo of our Christmas cookies with the product.
