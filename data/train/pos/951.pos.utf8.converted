I bought this to replace my Mr. Coffee K-Cup brewer.  The Mr. Coffee one is okay with most flavors, but I noticed a distinct difference when I tried the Keurig brewer at my apartment complex with a particular brand of coffee I'd had trouble with in the Mr. Coffee maker and noticed an immediate difference.  Good brewer, decent price; best quality for the dollar.
