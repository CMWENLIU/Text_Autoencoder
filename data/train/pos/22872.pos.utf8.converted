The plants came really quickly, and included a pot, plant medium, and care instructions. Like a couple other reviewers, I also received a bonus plant. The extra plant that came was really small, and I worried that it might not make it, because it seemed really young, but I've had it for a few weeks planted with the rest, and it seems to be doing great. Excellent product, excellent service.
