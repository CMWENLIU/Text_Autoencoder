This is the only flavor that I like.  For some reason the sweetness goes well with the the softer consistensy of the dried chickpeas.  I would buy this flavor again, but not the other ones.  These have a slightly chalky, soft consistency compared to nuts. I was expecting something a little crunchier. I love that they are beans and have fiber (6 grams). The #2 ingrediant is evaporated cane juice and #3 is brown rice syrup. And if you are watching carbs then nuts are lower. These have 23 grams total carbs and 6 grams sugar. The fat on the other hand is much lower then nuts - only 2 grams of fat. 140 calories for 1/4 cup so about the same calories as most nuts.
