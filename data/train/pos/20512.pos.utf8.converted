In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.<br /><br />Chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region, although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea, rich milk, various spices and a sweetner. The spices most commonly used are cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper; Tazo's very peppery Chai adds rooibos, vanilla, star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe.<br /><br />You should always have this tea with real sugar, even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener, because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices. And if you like your store-bought Chai, maybe you'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices, too! Namaste ...
