I heard about the healthiest oil on the planet as being coconut oil so I had to read and study it to make sure...  I ordered 3 books chock full of information about coconut oil.  The names of the books that I ordered through Amazon were: The Coconut Oil Miracle, Eat Fat Look Thin, and Coconut Lover's cookbook.  I read them all and am on the phase I or the Coconut Diet at this time and very pleased with my weight loss so far and even more pleased with the fact that I do not stay hungry...  that morning omelet that I have with a grapefruit is so filling that I have no interest in the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake or pie out there lol ... amazing for me let me tell ya!! lol.  Although I do eat later in the evening a salad and either fish or chicken and drink lots of water I am satiated and feel great!!  I certainly do recommend this product and for those of you that believe the stories that have circulated for years that coconut oil is among the bad oils for your heart... please order either The Coconut Oil Miracle book or the Eat Fat Look Thin book and read for yourself that this oil actually prevents heart disease.
