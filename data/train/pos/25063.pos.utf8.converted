These are the greatest thing for eating on the run!  No BAD stuff like high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated fats, etc.  Only GOOD, wholesome, natural ingredients, and there is a lot of food value packed into one of these bars.  They are the best, and Amazon's price is "amazin'"!  Oh, yes... on top of all that, they taste GREAT!  (I personally like this one better than the other Rebar products, but my friend likes them all).
