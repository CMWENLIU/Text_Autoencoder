This are the best cookie I have ever eaten, and if I could only stop at one little 3 cookie pack, it would be perfect. Costco does carry the cranberry almond, which is great but doesn't carry the chocolate chip. As a chocoholic I would like to find them. You can't beat Costco's price of 20 packs for $6.99. BJ's carries an assorted box of 15 for $5.99. The Christmas Tree Shops carry the chocolate chip as well as the other varieties in a smaller box of 7  packs for $3.99. I thought that was way too expensive until I see them here for $24.00 for 20 packs! I know that they have to ship them, but even so, the price is unreasonable.<br />So if you find these great little cookies, buy a bunch because Costco says they only buy them around Christmas time and when they run out they won't be bringing any more in for many months.<br />All you Costco members, an e-mail requesting them would help.
