Yep, that's right, 5 stars!  This contents of this little box packs a nutritional punch with 24 grams of protein and 12 grams of fiber, you know you're being good to yourself! That's 3 stars, add a star for flavor and another for convenience and value and there you have 5 stars!  Anyway,  whoever suggested that one combine the edamame and the fruit nut mix is definitely on to something because the edamame is pretty dry and bland so, the mix flavors it up a bit and make it much for palatable.  The hummus is pretty good and I really appreciated the lightness and flavor of the crackers.  The dark chocolate also has good flavor and is a prefect way to top off this meal.  This is perfect for me to tuck in my purse and bring it for lunch when I'm working or on outings with my family (although I think my 5 year old will prefer the peanut butter one:)). So with the $1.00 off coupon, the s and s savings and the other 10%  discount I paid less that $2.50 for each meal, what a great value!
