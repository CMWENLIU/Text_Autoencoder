This is a review from Marc's wife:<br />  I have throughly tested this Product.<br />Order this exact one: Nestle Nido makes a confusing array of products with similar names and labels!<br />  Con:Taste not IDENTICAL to whole milk!<br />  Pro:Dissolves easily, smells good.<br />  -Tried this as creamer in tea with sugar-a person used to whole milk in his tea thought it tasted fine.<br />  -in cooking- tried it in my favorite pancake recipe-no perceived difference.<br />  -tried using it as substitute for milk in a couple of sauces: no complaints from anyone, I thought it tasted slighty low-fat. Certainly in a cheese or other highly flavored sauce should be fine.<br />  -substituted for half the non-fat dried milk in our instant hot cholate mix recipe. Everyone raved about the flavor! I noticed our mix wasn't being used up at the same phenomenal clip as people professed themselves more satisfied.<br />- Perfect for single people who want small amounts of milk, mostly for creamer in hot beverages. If you're going to use it slowly, maybe put in a glass jar in the fridge.<br />- Disaster supplies;earthquake,hurricane,etc.<br />- save on gasoline! Won't have to make trips for the sole purpose of someone having milk in their coffee or cereal!<br />- Camping,etc. where weight is an issue;bring this powder and reconstitute as needed.<br />Buy it-you will love it! If two cans seems a big quantity for you, give/resell the other one to a friend,neighbor,etc.<br />NEW ADVANTAGES_ADDED 8-01-11<br />-Easier to use in cooking than liquid milk- in any recipe where it calls for scalding and then cooling the milk, you can skip that step by just mixing up the amount of milk used in your recipe from the milk powder and lukewarm water. Faster and saves on pots needed too.<br />-Absolutely ESSENTIAL if you make yougurt at home. Milk solids are added to milk in making yougurt to stiffen the milk so the resulting yougurt will have the texture people have come to expect from store-bought yogurt.By using this whole milk powder instead of nonfat milk powder, the yougurt thickens better, and it tastes better-for the best yogurt you have ever eaten, try homemade yogurt made with whole milk AND this whole milk powder!!
