There is a lot of detailed information in some of the reviews below, so I won't repeat what they have to say.  However, my experience overall is excellent and while it's true different plants grow at different rates, the output of this thing is prolific.  I cut the herbs every few days and give away a lot.  It grows right back and the taste is delicious.  The lettuce from the lettuce kit is also very good and I have found the company to have excellent customer service, documentation on their products, etc.  While this unit isn't prefect, I can't imagine it being much better.  I am seriously considering getting a second one because I am so happy with the results.
