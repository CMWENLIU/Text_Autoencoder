With other formulas, my daughter had really bad gas pains and far more spit-up incidents.  After switching to Gentlease, she has really thrived, gaining weight appropriately and seeming tremendously happy with it (and not so happy when we're 30 seconds slow in providing it to her :D).<br /><br />As for the corn syrup solids, this is simply there as a replacement for lactose, which is removed from gentle formulas.  It has to be replaced by something, so they use corn syrup solids.  I don't think there really is any major concern here, as sugar generally is sugar once it is broken down in the body, but I can see the reason for others to be concerned.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see, however, is Amazon include this on a subscription plan like Amazon Mom.  Enfamil is not inexpensive, and it is a regular consumable for my family.
