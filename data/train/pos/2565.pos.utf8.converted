i've had insomnia for 5+ years. I used to be on meds like Ambien, Zoloft, and Elavil for the longest time. I also do have anxiety (hence the zoloft and elavil). I kissed all those meds goodbye when this tea came out. I don't reccommend you drink it while driving, cuz it did impair me many a time when i would drink it while i was out having dinner.<br /><br />It def does what is says. I've only tried the Green Tea & Honey - non carbonated bottle of tea. It tastes great, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste at all. In fact, i don't even notice an aftertaste when i drink it.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Chamomile (reduces anxiety), Valerian (promotes relaxation), Passionflower (reduces anxiety), Hops (promotes relaxation and inhibits adrenaline), Melatonin (relaxes your muscles), and lemon balm (enhances mood, alertness & calm).<br /><br />This tea is better then any pill i've ever taken for my insomnia and anxiety. It's healthy and all natural. There is no crash afterwards like most drinks and meds. You will wake up refreshed.<br /><br />Drinking it will make you relaxed and laid back (mellow). You will most likely fall asleep. (This is on 1 bottle). I have done 2 bottles - they reccomend not going over 2 bottles, and if you drink 2 bottles to separate it by 8 hours from the last one. I drank bottle 2 after 3 hours of drinking the last one. i only made it thru a 1/4 of bottle #2 before i passed out in my bed. Doing 1 bottle is like equivalent to 1 5mg pill of ambien, but doing 2 bottles is like equivalent to 20-25mgs of Ambien (and the legal highest dose for Ambien i am told is 20mg), so 2 bottles is pretty strong.<br /><br />I love it, and i definitely reccommend it to other ppl who have anxiety and insomnia. I love it so much i want a month supply of it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that it may contain kava kava as well, even though none of the bottles have this listed on it.
