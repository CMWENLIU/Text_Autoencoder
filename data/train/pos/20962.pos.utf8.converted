This product is made in Canada. The noodles are about 1/8 inch or more wide dry. When they are cooked 10 to 12 minutes they get fatter. They have a very nice texture to them. The taste is outstanding. I enjoyed eating them very much so. This is a very low sodium product. Mine arrived in good shape and I checked the freshness date... almost 2 years to go. This is one of my favorite TOP THREE noodles now. I am a noodle person for sure. This is a very very nice product.
