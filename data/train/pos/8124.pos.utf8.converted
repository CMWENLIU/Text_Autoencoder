I buy different types of treats for my dogs and keep them all in a large Rubbermaid container on top of the fridge.  The dogs go nuts every time I reach for that box.  I think they enjoy the variety because after I give them their treat they still look at me like "what else is she gonna give us" and sometimes I swear it's more like "but mom, I don't like that kind, I want the other one".<br /><br />I mix all kinds of mainly dental treats together in the box.  Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.<br /><br />I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.<br /><br />They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.<br /><br />I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.  Mix it up so your dog doesn't get bored and use different shapes to get different angles on their teeth.<br /><br />If my review has helped you while considering this item, please click "Yes" this review was helpful to let me know.
