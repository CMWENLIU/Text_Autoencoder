This is my favorite coconut oil for eating and moisturizing both.  It is unrefined virgin coconut oil and has that great coconut smell (and taste!).  If you want odorless / tasteless coconut oil - make sure you purchase the REFINED coconut oil.<br /><br />Coconut oil has never made me nauseous and this one is no different - it's one of the best, highest quality oils I've ever had and I highly recommend from everything from cooking (does not degrade at high heat like olive oil) to moisturizing (coconut glow and super shiny hair!).<br /><br />Bought a smaller size initially and went through it in no time flat. The gallon size lasts me a good 3-4 months (cooking and moisturizing).<br /><br />Editing this on 05/19/2012: "perfect price" at the time, by the way, was $56.15 shipped via Amazon Prime.  Hello inflation?
