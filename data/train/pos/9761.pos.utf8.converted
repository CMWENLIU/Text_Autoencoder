WOW!! I was doing just fine until my little one started hitting mini-growth spurts. I had been giving her a bottle of pumped milk twice a day when I had to take medicine that I didn't want in my system when I nursed. So, when I got off the medicine, I noticed that those times of day, I was not producing AT ALL. If you don't use it, you lose it, so they say. I was desperately nursing every hour just for my girl to get SOMETHING and stimulate production, but it didn't work and we were both frustrated and tired.<br /><br />I read about Fenugreek seed and couldn't find it, but stumbled upon this tea. Within 24 hours I was so engorged that I had to pump!! I now still use it just to be able to store up frozen milk for when my husband and I go out or I run an errand and don't want to have to find somewhere to nurse. My milk supply now doesn't even begin to run out when I use the pumped milk and skip nursing.<br /><br />I wish that I could tell every mom about this. I think less women would give up on nursing due to lack of milk, if they knew about this tea! And it's so inexpensive. I drink at least 2 cups a day. I love the taste. It's sweet and minty. I just add a little sugar.
