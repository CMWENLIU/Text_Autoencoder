I bought a box of 12 bags almost every month. I finish them all. I use them to control my appetite. It takes about 5 minutes to finish one, because the candy is hard, not soft. Four candies contain 100 Cal. Twenty minutes you only get 100 Cal, not bad. If you eat ice cream, you can consume a lot more Cal.
