My daughter is gluten and dairy free, and we have tried EVERY pasta brand out there.  Since I like to cook a lot at once and use the rest for left-overs, the other gluten free (brown rice and potato only brands) did not do well when re-heated, and also had a "different" consistency --according to my daughter.  This brand is incredible, perfect texture, cooks easily, and my husband (who is a Sicilian) will even eat it , and once mistook it for his favorite brand!  Bionature has achieved the perfect pasta for picky gluten-free eaters.  If you are celiac, or gluten-sensitive, you MUST try it.
