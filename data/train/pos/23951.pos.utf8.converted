I just recently started 'treating' myself to organic goji berries I found at a local food store and have fallen in love with these yummy soft chewy treasures! But they ain't cheap (here in Vancouver they're usually around $3.99/100g!) So when I stumbled across this 10lb bag of organic goji berries by Navitas at a very reasonable price, I couldn't resist! Having already become a fan of Navitas' Maca powder I figured I couldn't go wrong, right? ;)<br /><br />Well, Navitas did not disappoint! They arrived very securely packaged in thick sealed plastic bags. And the taste? Awesome! Unlike another reviewer, mine were soft and sweet with a nice chew! I'm so thrilled! What a bargain! I'm so glad I splurged on the 10lb bag! I'll be enjoying these gojis for quite some time! Thank you Navitas! ;)
