I saw this at Whole Foods and bought it from there.  I wanted something nice to bring to a house party and didn't feel like bringing flowers.  It was a hit!  It really is very pretty and memorable.  It was one of a kind, plus a small piece made a nice dessert with coffee.  Well worth the price.  It would be fun for a chocolate tasting event.
