If you're looking for a tasty treat on those cold winter mornings or even on a warm summer day, this soup will not disappoint! It's absolutely delicious as are all of the other Kikkoman -Instant Miso Soups. I just love them. I discovered them when I got sick on vacation in Hawaii and I've been eating them ever since! I should meniton, they're great if you've got an upset stomach.
