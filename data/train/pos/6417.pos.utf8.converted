I bought this kombu with the idea that I would make dashi (Japanese broth) but I found it is also good for making pickled vegetables. I put cukes, daikon, raw green peppers, and anything else that I would like in a crunchy salad, in a glass jar with some sea salt, leaving it in the refrigerator. The vegetables give up their juices and soak in a brine of salt and juice.<br />  The vegetables stay crunchy and flavorful. I put them on hamburgers and in salads. Even on a cracker with some cream cheese!<br /> Shredded kombu (cut it with scissors after it has soaked a good long while in the salad) is a flavorful addition.
