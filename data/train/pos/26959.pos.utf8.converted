Having started cooking wild rice 20 plus years ago when I suppose it was just becoming widely available and the gourmet market was just beginning to open up, I know something about wild rice. Now, thanks to the internet, I don't have to travel to far off Minnesota or buy tiny expensive packets in the local health food cooperative. There's plenty of wild rice available for anyone who wants it these days, but as the demand has grown, the industry has changes. A lot of wild rice isn't really wild anymore. It's farmed in rice paddies. And a lot of wild rice is dried in industrial drums fueled by propane, much the same way coffee is roasted. You'll see a lot of dark black, hard rice sold as wild rice. Maybe that's all you've ever seen.<br /><br />Bineshii still does it the old fashioned way. The rice is wild, harvested by canoe, slow dried over a wood fire. The result is a flavorful, tender, ultra-long grain that has a light nut-brown color and a delicacy no other rice can match. It's so tender, you don't even need to cook it. You can soak it overnight in water and it will soak up enough water to become edible raw -- sort of like pasta al dente. It really comes into its glory when you cook it though, with wonderful curled sweet nutty grains that are so delicious I hate to serve it as a side dish. I usually just eat the rice and nothing else. That's how good it is!<br /><br />Bineshii is a group of Native Americans and they do more than just rice. They make preserves, soap, totems, kinnick kinnick, birch bark art pieces, and even have an instant mix Ojibwe fry bread, if you have a hankering. It's worth your while just to browse their website for a bit. The bottom line is that this is the best authentic wild rice I have found.
