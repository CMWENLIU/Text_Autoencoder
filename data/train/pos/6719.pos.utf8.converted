As a foodie, I'm also a bit of a snob about teas, generally preferring organic, muslin-bagged or loose teas. That said, this Stash Chanakara Tea sampler, on first try, immediately became my favourite tea purchase, and I promptly ordered this excellent bulk value offered by Amazon, soon after trying each of the seven teas included in the box. Each tea "chakra" consists of extremely aromatic and flavour-filled combinations of herbs, flowers, leaves of a colour corresponding to each chakra. While I cannot offer evidence of their efficacy in chakra work, I will say I did some best-guessing about where my particular energies were on a given day, and found that the chakra-tea I chose each time really did seem particularly soothing. New age-y ideas aside, the teas really are extremely flavourful without being overly sour (as I find many brands, like Celestial Seasonings, can be). The scents are noticeably lovely, and for me, I didn't find one flavour that I didn't truly love. Highly recommend.
