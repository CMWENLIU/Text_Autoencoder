Just got this the other day.  Nice sampler, coffee from many different countries, no blends, just beans from the area.  All of them are good, ranging from mild to bold in flavor so there is something for everyone.  The Brazilian is an extra bold, gives you a bit more coffee in the cup.  There was even Peruvian, I didn't know they grew coffee, very nice stuff.  Looks like we are getting some more choices now to the Green Mountain and Tully's blends.  This is good for the consumer, more choices and lower prices from competition.
