Delicious!  I'm not a coffee drinker, but I love my mom's Keruig.  These K-cups are the best hot chocolate I have come across.  I make the 8oz. cup and it's so rich and delicious.  The perfect cup of hot chocolate.  I would totally recommend these for anyone looking for a new K-cup of hot chocolate.
