We have always liked these Australian-made corn crackers (I am from Australia and used to enjoy them there also). They are somewhat like rice cakes, but thinner, and obviously made out of corn. They are about half the thickness of your average rice cake and in my opinion, much tastier. They are great as a snack by themselves, our 3 year old daughter loves them, or with cheese or spreads. As long as you close the bag after use, the pack will keep fresh for a few weeks after opening.
