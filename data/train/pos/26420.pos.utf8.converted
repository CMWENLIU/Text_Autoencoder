I don't often write reviews, so it says a lot that I'd take the time to write about this tuna. This tuna is much, much better than your typical Chicken of the Sea or other common brand. It is unctuous and meaty without any fishiness at all. I also like the fact that each can lists the Omega 3 amounts (both DHA and EPA). I actually like the skipjack tuna of this brand better than the albacore. Highly recommended.
