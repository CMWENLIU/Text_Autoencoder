This Thanksgiving I used these cookies instead of our regular brand when making my grandmother's famous cookie crust for pumpkin chiffon pie, and it was so delicious that everyone at the table was left speechless.  For one crust, use one and a half cups of cookie crumbs, a combination of ginger cookies and vanilla wafers.  Add in some finely chopped pecans, a quarter cup of confectioner;s sugar, and a third cup of soft butter.  Spread in a buttered pie pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350
