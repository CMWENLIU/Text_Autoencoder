Nature's Path is my favorite cereal brand, and OPTIMUM Blueberry is my favorite of them all.<br /><br />I've been enjoying this cereal for well over 5 years.<br />It's organic, and full of wonderful beneficial whole grains etc. - just read the ingredients list!<br />It has a mixture of textures, with "twigs", "puffs", flakes, seeds and the little dried blueberries.<br />It's great with soy milk, dairy milk, yogurt, and even right out of the box as a snack.<br /><br />I haven't bought it for awhile because it never seems to go on sale anymore, so I was thrilled to find it here on sale for $2.20 a box!<br /><br />I just got my shipment from Amazon, and want to add a few notes:<br />While the cereal seems very fresh, I couldn't find an expiration date anywhere on the boxes.<br />They have changed the packaging, making it even more eco-friendly, and also slightly reformulated the cereal. The box says "Now with 25% less sugar than our previous recipe" Yay!  (Don't worry, if you've had this cereal before the change, the taste is still wonderful.) So the "Nutrition Facts" have changed (not drastically) from what Amazon shows, but the fiber has dropped from 10g to 7g. The serving size is still the same at 1 cup (55g).<br /><br />Here are some of the differences that may be important to you:<br />Calories were 190, now 200<br />Protein was 8g, now 9g<br />Total Fat was 2.5g, now 3g (Still none are saturated fat)<br />Total Carbs were 40g, now 38g<br />Fiber was 10g, now 7g (Boo!)<br />Sugars were 16g, now 9g (Yay!)<br />Sodium was 200mg, now 230mg<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor is very mild, I usually add more for flavor and health benefits. I also add a small amount of walnuts (for extra EFA's, taste and crunch), or pecans. Read Update below for more additions.<br /><br />Unless you are hooked on the average sickeningly-sweet, unhealthy, over-processed mainstream cereals, I think you will love this as much as I do! If you want to try a box before you buy it in bulk here, I've found it at most health food stores, Fry's / Kroger's in their health food sections, and Sprouts.<br /><br />Even if you are hooked on the other stuff, give this a try, you might be pleasantly surprised. I had bought this for my parents and their verdict is: Dad loves it, Mom likes it.<br /><br />Update 6/6/09: I just responded with these comments in another review, and thought they might be helpful:<br /><br />I too would enjoy more berries in the cereal, but it would probably make the price astronomical, so I usually add a little of "Just Tomatoes" brand of freeze dried mixed fruit which is yummy and has a good mix of fruit - though I could do without the raisins, they're not so good freeze dried.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QV4">Just Tomatoes Just Fruit Munchies, 8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />They also have only blueberries<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGAJP0">Just Tomatoes Just Blueberries, 8-Ounce Tub</a><br />plus strawberries, raspberries, apples, pineapple etc. just search "just tomatoes" - without quotes - in the grocery drop down in the search box.<br /><br />I first found them at my local upscale grocery store (in smaller sized containers) and they are a little less expensive here, but I also like to support the local store, so I buy them from both places.<br /><br />There is another brand that I haven't tried, but has gotten great reviews called Traverse Bay that has dried blueberries<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YDO">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7ELTM">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 4 lbs</a><br /><br />You don't need to use a whole lot in the cereal so they last for awhile. One tip is to keep them in the freezer so they stay crunchy.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
