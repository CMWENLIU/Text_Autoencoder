I thought maple syrup was maple syrup but, apparently things have changed over the last several years.  I noticed a while back that the maple syrup I purchased in the store (even organic) had an "odd" taste.  It just didn't taste right.  I tried several types but, with the same result.<br /><br />Then I read a review on here about Vermont having tougher standards for maple syrup.  As in something about not allowing other sweeteners or something, don't remember exactly.<br /><br />Anyway, I decided try Brown Family Pure Vermont Maple Syrup.  Wow, major taste difference, even the after taste lingers and is very nice.  I also bake bread with maple syrup, the smell of the baking bread, and the bread flavor are much more distinct maple.
