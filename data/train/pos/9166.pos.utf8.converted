I've bought plants online in the past (never through Amazon or The Orchid Gallery) & have had some frightening results. However, I fell in love with this orchid & decided to give The Orchid Gallery a try. First of all, they were very cautious about sending the orchid on a day so that it wouldn't sit in the post office over a long weekend. I really appreciated that. When the plant did arrive I was blown away with how large and healthy it was. It also had no problem with acclimating & is already putting on new leaves.<br />Though the experience was amazing & I look forward to doing it again, I wish that I was able to choose the way the plant was to be shipped. The postal service here is less than spectacular.
