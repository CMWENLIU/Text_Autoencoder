My sister used to work as a rep selling products such as ensure.  Years ago she told me that carnation instant breakfast is a very affordable replacement for that costly product with all the same nutritional value.  My 89 year old father lives with me and recently had a heart attack.  He was too weak to eat, but because he<br />has a sweet tooth, he was willing to drink this in hot milk all day long, believing it was hot cocoa.  The result was he got better quickly and regained the 20 pounds<br />he had lost.  I highly recommend this!
