This milk is the best. Mixes well in cold water. I use it for cereal, cooking and in my morning cuppa. Being a shut-in, I may never go back to fresh milk, since I have to rely on friends to take me to the store. Nothing could be easier and the flavor is top-notch. This milk also has a higher butterfat content than regular whole U.S. milk, coming in at 3.7% (Whole milk in the USA is 3%).
