I've been trying various Dr. McDougall's Right Foods soups over the past month, and this flavor is by far the best of the bunch. I have not had any issues with leakage from the bottom of the cup, but (as noted by the prior reviewer) the cups do get quite hot.<br />There is a nice balance of flavors in this mix, and the size of the noodles makes it easy to eat without making a mess. I will definitely purchase more of this soup in the future.
