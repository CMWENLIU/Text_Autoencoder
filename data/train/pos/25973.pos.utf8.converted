I have used catnip spray for many years. I generally put it on new scratching posts that I want the cats to use and I renew the spray from time to time just to keep them acclimated to the use of the posts and not the curtains. When toys are no longer interesting, a bit of spray livens them up. If the cats are bored, I spray the toy of the moment and that  gets kitty minds off the mischievious and back onto the game at hand.<br />I noticed that the bottle of spray that I had been using had lost its ability to interest, and it IS about 5 years old, so I decided to get a new bottle and naturally turned to Amazon as the easiest source for my need. I was dismayed to note that many of the sprays for sale had gotten bad reviews. Writers had stated that this or that spray smelled bad, or did not work, OR Smelled bad and sent the cat away instead of providing entertainment. So I carefully looked through the availability of various sprays and settled on this one.<br />It is made by a reputable company that specializes in products made from naturally grown herbs.<br />When the spray arrived, I first used it on a cat scratching product that had been a favorite, but had lapsed into disuse. After carefully spraying it, I waited a few seconds (literally) and here came my grey kitty with huge dilated pupils. He looked at me briefly and plunged right in and began rolling, playing and scratching. Then the shyer girl tiptoed over to see what the fun was and joined in.<br />So that I could get into the fun fest, I sprayed "Da Birds" (one for each cat) and hung the birds just out of reach of the kitties. Here they came and the games began. We played for about 15 minutes.<br />So I am well pleased with this products and so are my kitters.It was just what I had in mind. As usual with catnip spray, I can detect no odor, though I believe some people can smell a bit a a minty fragrance.<br />I certainly recommend this product as "The catnip spray to use!"
