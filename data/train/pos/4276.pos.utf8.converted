This is great for those that don't drink milk on the regular. This way your milk won't go bad, and you always have delicious milk on hand when you need it. It is really sweet, so if you don't like sweet, just add more water. It comes out creamy when you mix according to the instructions. Good packaging, doesn't get stale, and I usually keep it for about 4 months. Great purchase, and I have Amazon Prime, so it came quick.
