While traveling through Europe, we stayed at a lovely bed and breakfast in the Swiss Alps. One evening, the owners of the inn prepared a dinner for the guests that included lemon chicken and parmisan risotto. While the chicken was delicious, I fell in love with the creamy yet meaty texture and delicate flavor of the risotto, a perfect accompaniment, and attempted without success to duplicate this dish at home. Recently we began switching to organic and natural foods, and made our first box of Lundberg Organic Parmisan Risotto. I was taken back to that lovely inn with the first delectible bite! I was so amazed that the rich flavor and texture of a homecooked dish could come from a box! This risotto is ideal with so many main courses - chicken, fish, Italian meat dishes - and can also be the foundation of a hearty vegan dish with added vegetables and nuts. I'm impressed with all of the healthy Lundberg products and recommend them without reservation, but this Parmisan risotto remains our family favorite!
