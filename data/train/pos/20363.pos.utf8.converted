I have looked for a long time for this chocolate type. I was interested in a sugar free dark chocolate bar sweetened with stevia. Stevia is a natural sweetener,  it has 0 calories and , most importantly, it has 0 effect on your blood sugar levels. So, if you are a diabetic or just having a low carb diet (paleo -diet), this is a chocolate you can indulge in without guilt. And is the only one I know of...<br />Unfortunately, very few manufacturers, if any, know or care to make a stevia sweetened chocolate bar. There is almost nothing out there. 99.99% of commercial sugar free chocolate bars are sweetened with maltitol - a sugar alcohol - which, in spite of being branded as "sugar free" still has a noticeable effect on your blood sugar. Still damages you in this way. So, not really a solution if your goal is to keep your blood sugar low and still enjoy a great chocolate.<br />And so, I am so glad to have found this bar. It is an artisanal chocolate, apparently made by Dante Confectioners in MA. It is a fresh, luscious and rich bar, with a nut flavor finish, and just the right amount of sweetness. It does not have a bitter aftertaste, which is the most common complaint one finds about Stevia. But, you have to love or have acquired a taste for really strong dark chocolate to enjoy this bar. So, all in all, this is a great discovery for me and a delight for the connoisseurs.<br />And, most of all, a welcomed and much awaited product for this market (health conscious chocolate lovers), and, in my knowledge, the only one of this high quality to really provide for all the pleasure and health benefits of chocolate with the lack of detrimental blood sugar side effects and 0 calories of the natural stevia sweetener. A great product!
