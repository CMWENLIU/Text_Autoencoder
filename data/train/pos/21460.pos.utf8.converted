I imagine the people giving this product low ratings either a. don't have clothes moths and expect it to catch all kinds of moths, b. didn't actually put the pheromone in the trap (you have to open the package and drop it in that hole in the top), or c. didn't read the package to see this only traps the MALE clothes moths and does not kill the larva which is what actually eats your clothes.<br /><br />First off, the type of moths that eat your clothes are very very small and very very fast. They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.<br /><br />I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.<br /><br />Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps.
