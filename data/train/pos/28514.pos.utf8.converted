I'll admit it, I have something of a blue raspberry fetish going on.  It probably goes back to the blue raspberry snow cones I had as a child, but at 50 it doesn't seem to have diminished.<br /><br />These gummy bears are fresh, soft, taste delicious, and ten pounds of them seem truly decadent.  The guilt only lasts for a second, though.  :)
