There may be meals that are better than these Rice and Beans packets, but there is no meal that has the ratio of goodness/easy. None in the world. I have eaten these things at least 3 times a week for over 10 years and have refined the process to a science. You can add chicken, Tabasco and even toasted almonds to really make them special. I love them. Good source of protein.
