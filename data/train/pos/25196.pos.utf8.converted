My two kitties love these food pouches, and they seem to enjoy all the flavors equally. They get all excited when I'm preparing it for them, as one might expect, and I'm the cost isn't too bad either (about $0.62/pouch). So for what it's worth, this product definitely has approval from this owner, and kitties too!
