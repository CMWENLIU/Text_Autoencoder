There is simply no comparison between Nellie & Joe's and other lime juices available in stores or even most fresh lime juice.<br /><br />Great addition to BBQ marinades and dressings.  However, my favorite use is in a margarita - add 50 % - 80% lime juice to tequila and Contreau to taste, on the rocks and do not shake. Use with care.  Much less sugar than the traditional margarita and may be a little sour for some; but, it quickly becomes an acquired taste.<br /><br />The Nellie and Joes site has lots of recipes for sauces, marinades and such.<br /><br />Note that the Amazon vendor appears to have the prices switched on the products.
