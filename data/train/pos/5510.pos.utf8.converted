I've tried numerous coconut oils and I must say I really like this one.<br />It smells so delicious when you open the jar.<br />I enjoy it so much I usually eat 2 Tbsp a day like some people eat peanut butter. If your way of eating is low carbing this product fits the bill and it's so healthy . I also enjoy making a "candy" treat with it.<br /><br />1 Tbsp chopped nuts i.e. walnuts, almonds or pecans in a small cupcake paper or aluminum baking cup.  Add 2 tbsp of melted coconut oil  on top of the chopped nuts.<br />Sprinkle 1 tsp of coconut flakes on top.<br />Let it harden in the fridge then it's ready to enjoy.<br />Add a cherry on top when in season, grated orange rinds, strawberry halved...<br />Use your imagination...<br />~Enjoy, Sooo Goood<br /><br />Update: 8/7/2012<br />Don't remember how many times I've ordered this coconut oil but today's another time.<br />Recently, I saw a recipe for Paleo Coleslaw. If you need a change in taste from coleslaw made with mayonnaise then try this one. I really like it because it seems to taste like Asian Coleslaw, sadly, my better half doesn't like it. I even have it with breakfast sometimes.<br /><br />Paleo Coconut Coleslaw<br /><br />This recipe comes from grassfedgirl.com<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />
