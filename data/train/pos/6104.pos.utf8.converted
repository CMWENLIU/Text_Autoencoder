The Sapporo noodles are more expensive than the ones you find at the local supermarket, but they are also a notch above the cheaper brands. The noodles do not bloat up and get mushy when boiled. As a consequence, the cooked noodles have a pleasant Al dente bite. The spice pack is pretty delicious, and I frequently boil some frozen dumplings from Trader Joe's when I make these noodles. The price offered on Amazon is really awesome. My local supermarket is selling these for $1 per pack.<br /><br />To be healthy:<br />(a) throw away the spice pack. These noodle spice packs, any brand, are high in sodium, fats, MSG.<br />(b) boil noodles and throw away the water. These noodles, any brand, are coated with a waxy substance to protect their freshness. They will come out when you boil it- so pour away the water. The noodles will taste better too.
