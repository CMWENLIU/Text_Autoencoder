I am a firm believer that nuts are an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, sometimes nuts are just plain boring to eat, but this mix actually add a little bit of chocolate, which makes the entire mix taste great. Don't be fooled by the high amount of fat because it actually contains a lot of unsaturated fat, which is actually good for your body.
