A friend of mine gave me a pack of this for Christmas last year, and I've been hooked ever since!  This is my absolute favorite incense now.  I've tried other rose incenses in the past, and though they smelled nice and vaguely smelled of roses, nothing can compare to HEM's Precious Rose.  This stuff is strong and smells exactly like roses.  I mean it when I say "strong" - if you aren't ready for it, this stuff might knock you over...with awesomeness.
