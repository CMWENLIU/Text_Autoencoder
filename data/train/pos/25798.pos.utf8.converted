I've been using white truffle oil as a healthy alternative to butter for about a year. I also like to buy organic products. This product has the delightful mild flavor of a fine Italian white truffle oil, with the added benefit of being organic. I use it to heat up rice, cook fresh or frozen vegetables and it's great on popcorn. Fortunately, because of its high cost, a little bit goes a long way. Once you open it, be sure and keep it refrigerated as it will spoil quickly. refrigerating will cause it to thicken but that's easily resolved by microwaving it for 20 seconds or putting the closed bottle in hot water. If you microwave it, be sure and cut off the little metal ring that the is the bottom of the bottle cap. It's easily removed with scissors. I also, for environmental reasons, like that it's packaged in glass and not plastic. For some ideas on how to use truffle oil you may want to check out the book "Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E97X0M">Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure</a> by Rosario Safina, the owner of the company that makes this particular truffle oil. I've not read the book or even looked at it but it's been reviewed byt 12 people at Amazon and ten people gave it five stars. The two people that gave it a bad review can be considered as outliers. One reviewer gave the book one star because he or she never got it from Amazon. That's a merchant complaint and not a product complaint. The other negative review stated that there were spelling and typographical errors and that was the sole purpose for the bad review. The ten remaining reviewers all give the book five stars so it's probably worth looking into if you're looking for ideas as to how to use truffle oil in a wider range of recipes.
