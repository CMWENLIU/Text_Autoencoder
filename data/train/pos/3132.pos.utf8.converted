I'm really a white rice kinda person - raised on it, like it.  As my tastes matured I learned how much more flavor there is to be had -- basmati, jasmine...in white rice, jasmine is my favorite.  I started trying to eat better several years ago, but never truly learned to appreciate brown rice.  Instead, I ended up mostly cutting rice from my diet.  Now that I have found Lundberg Wild Blend, rice is back in the lineup.  I look forward to the nights when this is one of the sides.  It has a nutty taste, yes, but also a bit of sweetness.  We love it!
