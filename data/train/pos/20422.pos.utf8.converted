I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going "poo" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year; that coincided with a new brother (he is the middle child) as well as his efforts on potty training.  At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.  But all in all, I am in LOVE with this product and highly recommend it for children as well as adults! My husband is about to start taking it to see if it helps with his sleep and his adult ADD that he suffers from.
