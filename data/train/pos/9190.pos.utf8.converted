Teff flour is used to make "injera", an Ethiopian, crepe-like bread. If you want Teff flour, then this brand is the best one around for the quality of the grain used and also for the fine ground texture especially since the texture plays a lot into the final injera product.<br />If you are not used to Teff or are experiencing some indigestion-like symptoms, your body is not used to it. You may try mixing all-purpose flour or pancake mix to dilute the Teff's effects. Slowly you may increase the Teff intake. LOVE it!
