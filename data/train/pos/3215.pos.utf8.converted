What a great value this is. I saved a lot of money, buying this assortment of syrups. And they are all my favorite flavors, too. I love the spicy, fragrant, delicious flavors we all enjoy in the winter. I would love to hear from other people who have tried these syrups, sharing all the ways they can be used. My favorite so far is to swirl the Pumpkin Spice into some plain yogurt. Very good. Any other ideas out there?
