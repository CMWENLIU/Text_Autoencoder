Back in March I ordered four dawn redwoods from a nursery on Ebay, all about 2-3 feet tall.  They arrived bareroot and healthy.  The plan was to plant three in the ground to replace trees uprooted by Katrina.  The fourth was to go into a pot to be trained as bonsai.  All four trees were thriving, but the one in the pot looked like a plant that yearned to join the rest of its family out in the yard, rather than being forested with my bonsai collection.  Clearly, it was going to take time, patience, and training to get it to look like a bonsai.  I decided to put it in the ground and order a Brussels Dawn Redwood.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did.  The Brussels tree is a long way from a specimen, but it already looks like a bonsai, a mature-looking but minature redwood with beatuiful tapered trunk and gorgeous lower branching, all of which was lacking in the nursery tree, which had arrived pruned to favor topgrowth.  The Brussels Dawn redwood is absolutely stunning, far superior to the tree pictured on Amazon.<br /><br />Sure, the nursery tree would have acquired this look--eventually, and after much training.  But it loves growing with its kinfolk in the yard, and meanwhile I have this beautifully shaped little tree from Brussels to marvel at every time I sit outside with my bonsai collection.  Frankly, I can't take my eyes off it.<br /><br />I'm neither impatient by nature nor a champion of acting on impulse.  But there are times when instant gratification and acting on impulse has its rewards, and this was one of them.  The Brussels Dawn Redwood looks like a tree, not a seedling.  It is nothing short of breathtaking.
