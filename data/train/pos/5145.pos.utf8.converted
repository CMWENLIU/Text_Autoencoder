Jorge Cruise recommends this product for a substitute in his Brownie recipe for people on the Belly Fat Cure program ([...]).  I searched EVERYWHERE in the Chicagoland area and noone knew what I was talking about.<br /><br />I finally found it on Amazon and a few other websites.  I figured I would only order 2 bottles until I found out whether or not it lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />After one recipe of Brownies, I had to immediately reorder, this time by the case!<br /><br />It really is delicious stuff, although, as with all sugar replacements, you need to eat this in small amounts as the body doesn't always adjust immediately to these types of replacements. I highly recommend this product.
