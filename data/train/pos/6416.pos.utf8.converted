My family ate this tangy spaghetti when I was growing up and it's a comfort food as far as I'm concerned now, 45-50 years later.  The other review said that it was 2 - 4 servings, but I admit, when I manage to find this product I don't want to share it with anyone.  I don't know why more grocery stores don't carry this product.  My favorite part is that tangy spicy taste.  Most store bought spaghetti sauces have sugar or some other sweet flavor and I don't like them at all.  I wish that Kraft would at least sell the seasoning packets for what my family calls "hot spaghetti".
