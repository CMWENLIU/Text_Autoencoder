<span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:09 Mins<br /><br /></span>My eight-year-old son volunteered to try Nong Shim's new flavor, spicy chicken. I made a video interview of him eating the noodles for dinner, after he came home from judo practice (hungry).<br /><br />Our family enjoys Nong Shim instant noodles. We stock our pantry every autumn with bowls of ramen, yakisoba and udon. Nong Shim is the leading brand of ramyoen (ramen instant noodles) in South Korea.<br /><br />The package design is getting better. The endorsement by Professional Chefs (a 2011 Chef's Best Award) is easier to read and three colored boxes in the lower right corner note that the noodles have no MSG added, there's 30% less sodium than their regular product and that the noodles have 0 grams of trans fat.<br /><br />I recommend adding refrigerator scraps to your instant noodles; perhaps, whole kernel corn (for sweetness) or some tofu, finely chopped green onions (scallions), chopped, cooked beef, chicken or seafood. An egg is another delicious addition.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Earlier this year, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, posted "Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles." I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you will never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I distilled his tips down to these four bullet points:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins -- Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br /><br />* Vegetation -- Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions "should wilt in a matter of seconds."<br /><br />* Eggs -- Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br /><br />* Simple Simmered Meat -- Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />Instant noodles available at Amazon that our family eats and recommends:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP136A">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Kimchi</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Noodles</a><br /><br />In many cases you can sign up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for additional savings and convenience.
