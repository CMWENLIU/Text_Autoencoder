These bottles helped tremendously in adjusting to daycare for a pumping mother.  My daycare used these bottles at the end of the day when baby was hungry and there was no breast milk left.  I call them a jumper bottle--they satisfied her hunger until I could pick her up and nurse her and 2ozs wouldn't significantly reduce my production. They are ready to use - which allows them to be stored at daycare per state daycare guidelines--I simply provide a bag of ready to attach nipples.  Priced exactly like local but no sales tax to pay and delivered to my door!
