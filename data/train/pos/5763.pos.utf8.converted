For my fellow southerners who like to make a homemade pot of Red Beans & Rice, flavor your water with this vegetable base.  It's delicious!  Everyone always comments on how good my Red Beans are.  I buy the Camelia brand red beans, follow the directions on the label, but also add this flavoring to the water.  You'll love it!
