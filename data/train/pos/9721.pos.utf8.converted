Okay, I was very, very skeptical when I ordered this on the suggestion of a friend who swore it tasted just like real syrup. I've tried nearly all other commercial brands of sugar-free syrup and had come to the confident conclusion that there really was no such thing as a sugar-free syrup that actually tasted anything resembling the real thing.<br /><br />In fact, before my package arrived, I was already contemplating how I'd get rid of it all after what I anticipated would be a definite dissapointment (yet again) in taste.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to say that I'll be keeping every single bottle and will probably use it all up before the expiration, hoarding it away for myself like a pirate hoards treasure.<br /><br />It truly is, by far and away, the best sugar-free syrup I've ever had. It tastes almost exactly like the real thing, both in texture and flavor. Another perk of sugar-free syrup: Absolutely no annoying stickiness should I ever get overzealous in my pouring!<br /><br />At last my search is over! I'm one very happy camper and truly satisfied customer. Thanks so much, Joseph!!<br /><br />(Only one complaint: I wish, out of all the bottles, there was at least one equipped with a pour spout in the lid)
