I have used the crystal cat litter with my two cats for the last five years.  The last few years I've used Tidy Cat's crystal litter (it was what was available at my grocery store) and also the "Just the Crystals" litter that Amazon carries.  I switched to the Ultra Pet crystals a few months ago and this litter is FANTASTIC.<br /><br />My large maine coon cat urinates a lot and when I would go to stir the crystals each morning, there was almost a slurry of wet, nasty crystals at the bottom.  After stirring up the crystals it just seemed like a damp mess.  I understand that the crystal litters are all made with silica, so there shouldn't be much of a difference between brands, but somehow there is a BIG  difference.  This litter absorbs the urine completely.  There is no "wet spot" in the litter box anymore.  I suspect this has to do with the shape of the crystals - more on that below.<br /><br />The odor control with this litter is also much better.  Both cats use the same box and the litter is lasting me a full month. By the time I notice any odor, it was already time to change the box.  There is also nearly no dust!  I'm so used to a cloud of dust rising in the air when I changed the litter box.  I assumed that was just the way crystal litter was.  There was always dust everywhere, even to the point that it had somehow managed to get inside the electronics to the automatic cat feeder.  This litter is a bit more expensive up front and the only reason I tried it was because Amazon had a $5 off coupon.  Now that I have tried it, there is no  way I would go back. Because the odor control is so much better, this bag lasts me the full month and I'm not replacing it as often as I had to do with the cheaper brands though so it seems I'm about even.<br /><br />The only negative comment I have is in regards to the tracking - and it's not that bad.  The "original" formula of the Ultra Pet litter has crystals that are round.  I have tile and noticed a bit more tracking.  I saw that Ultra Pet has other formulas, one called "less track", and another one that is "micro crystals".  I plan on giving one of those a trial run to see if I can get the same absorbency and odor control with those formulas as I have with this kind. I suspect that the slightly larger round crystals are what makes the difference though. The round crystals  allow air to circulate around them better than the other small crystals that pack together so tightly.
