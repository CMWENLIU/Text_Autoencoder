I have been a customer of Miracle Noodle for several months.  I have tried a variety of shapes of Miracle Noodles, including the fettuccini.  All of the Miracle Noodles are the same product, in different shapes.  I followed the instructions on the website, and did a little experimenting on my own.  My family now consumes at least one package of Miracle Noodles each day.  We started out with basic stir fries, but now, I try them in a wide variety of recipes, from soups to vegetable dishes to desserts.  The fettuccini works very well with sauces and soups, and once mixed with the other ingredients, affords a taste and feel very similar to flat noodle pasta.  I try to incorporate the noodles into everything I cook, because it provides filling, calorie-free fiber.  During the day, when hunger strikes, I usually crave something sweet.  The Miracle Noodles can be used to create sweet dishes that conquer the craving, filling me up without extra calories.  I love this product!
