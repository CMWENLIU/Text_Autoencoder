This is the most versatile product that I've ever used. You can eat it by itself, mix it with vegetables, meat, herbs and/or, put it in soups or sauces. Israeli couscous tastes delicious, is not expensive, a little of it goes a long way and, it's easy to prepare. Israeli couscous is much different than the fine & grainy couscous that most people think of, and are used to, in reference to couscous. The pieces are much larger & heartier so they hold up under various cooking preparations. Israeli couscous has a mild flavor which makes it capable of adopting any flavor profile that you may desire---just like pasta (because it IS pasta) or rice. It is an awesome addition to any meal. Try Israeli Couscous---you'll be glad you did!
