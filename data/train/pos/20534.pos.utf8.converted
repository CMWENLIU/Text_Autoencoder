My bf and I make truffled popcorn with this truffle salt, some truffle infused safflower oil (more of a true truffle taste than truffle infused olive oil) and a stir crazy popper (oh, and a little earth balance melted on top). It is soooo delicious and the truffle flavor is very strong. Zooming in on the picture I saw that it said 5% truffle, but the actual product I received in the mail was labeled 10% just like it says in the product name.
