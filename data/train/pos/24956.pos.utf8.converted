I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as "chewy" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a "diet" never tasted so good, baby!<br /><br />We haven't heard the last of shirataki!
