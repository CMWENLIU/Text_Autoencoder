I received these from my spouse because I probably would never have bought them myself. Honestly, I was not very excited to try these. I mean, it's candy. Not only is it candy, it's milk chocolate, and candy (especially milk chocolate) should be sweet.<br /><br />However, these chips bring together that perfect balance of savory versus sweet. Like chocolate covered pretzels, but better because they're potato chips! The little ridges help with the texture, I think that was key, or perhaps I am just biased towards ridged potato chips.<br /><br />This plays out as a balance between flavors and textures. Sweet vs salty. Crunchy versus smooth. These chips are fantastic. It's one of those things that your mind says no, but after thinking about it, realize that it was in fact, a great idea.
