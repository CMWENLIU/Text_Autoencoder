"Full strength" truffle oils (as opposed to olive oils that claim to have truffle flavor but are much weaker) often cost $6-$10 per ounce, so you'd better hope you're getting a far superior product to this one to pay several times as much.  For the most part, you aren't.<br /><br />No matter what they call it (truffle flavor, truffle essence, natural flavors related to the truffle) all "truffle oils" - every single one of them - use fake flavoring, specifically 2,4-dithiapentane.  This is the main flavor compound found in truffles, similar to how vanillin is the main component of vanilla beans but can be made artificially.  A few oils do contain tiny amounts of real truffles, but it's just for show; a "pure" truffle oil would require hundreds of dollars worth of white truffle just to make a few ounces of flavored oil.<br /><br />If all truffle oils rely on the same compound that can be made relatively cheaply and consistently, how do the "better" truffle oils justify the higher price?  First, they package them in fancy looking tiny bottles.  Second, they use Italian olive oil as the base oil.  The goal is to suggest (falsely) that the truffle flavor comes from real Italian truffles.<br /><br />So while it's true that some truffle oils taste better than others, this is mostly (perhaps entirely) due to the quality of the oil used.  La Tourangelle uses organic safflower oil, which is nearly flavorless.  On its own, it does tastes more "chemically" than olive-oil based oils.  If it took a lot of truffle oil to flavor a dish, this might be a serious weakness.  But in reality it takes just a few drops to flavor a dish, so you're usually going to add additional fat anyway.  You can put your savings towards the premium oil of your choice.  Besides, in some dishes (eggs or mushrooms cooked in butter), you might not want olive oil flavor anyway.<br /><br />One caution/tip: like wine, "truffle essence" oxidizes and changes flavor.  So unless you plan to use the whole bottle within a month or two, it's best to keep the air out.  I filled several glass "airline size" whiskey bottles with the oil and use one at a time.  I also keep the bottles in the refrigerator, as heat and light speed up oxidation.
