Unsweetened, this has a nice mellow, black tea flavor, with a hint of cocoa, orange and spice.  Sweetened with sugar, the flavors intesify somewhat, but when I added a splash of soy milk, it completely dominated the flavor and the subtleness of the cocoa and orange was lost.  Perhaps cow's milk would be better if you prefer milk with your tea.<br /><br />For anyone on a gluten-free diet like myself, Numi's website states that all their teas are gluten free, with no chance of cross contamination.<br /><br />I think I'll go have another cup.
