These are absolutely exquisite.  Kopper's invented the chocolate covered espresso bean, and this is that original product.  Absolutely delicious.  But beware!  These are highly addictive!  On a positive note, there are enough in this 5 lb. bag to share with friends and neighbors!<br /><br />Another note: although you will not find it anywhere in the item description, these are covered in DARK chocolate.<br /><br />ENJOY!
