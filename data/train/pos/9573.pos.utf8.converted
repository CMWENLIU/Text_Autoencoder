I love this product -- no dirt, no bugs and no chance of over-watering!  This is very easy to assemble and easy to use.  Just add water and a couple of nutrient tablets every two weeks.  There's even a light that tells you when you need to do this.<br /><br />I planted my Gourmet Herbs on June 15 and I was ready to harvest the basil before the fourth of July!  If you follow the instructions, there's no way to mess this up. The herbs lasted about six months. My only caution is (and this is noted in the instruction booklet) that the lamps are on about 16 hours a day and they are bright at night.  I can close off the bedrooms, so it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone one who has tried to grow herbs indoors in the past.  Aerogarden's customer service team is the best -- they know their stuff and are vary helpful.  I had a problem with one of the herb kits and they have really worked to fix the problem.<br /><br />Update:  I read another reviewer's note about installing a new pump.  I had a seed pod that never sprouted and after being shipped a replacement pod that also didn't work, Aerogarden sent me a new pump.  I installed it last night with a new kit.  The instructions were clear and it was pretty easy to do.  I liked doing it myself in five minutes instead of sending the unit somewhere to be repaired.  It still was an inconvenience, but my positive experiences with the product far outweigh the annoyance of the installation.<br /><br />Update:<br />My first kit was the gourmet herb and as noted above, I had problems with the cilantro.  I have since replanted my garden by mixing the French, Itallian and new Gourmet Herb kits and they've worked beautifully,especially the cilantro.  The new pump has made all the difference.  My oregano is even more hearty this time around.  With the mew pump, all of my herbs are doing better.  After almost two months of growth, the thyme appears to be the least robust of the bunch, but still has a good yield. It's in a back corner spot.
