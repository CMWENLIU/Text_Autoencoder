These cakes are so good and moist. I suggest having a glass of milk with them or you might have a hard time talking. The rum is strong but it is nice and smooth. The cake is sweet and creamy. I have only tried the 'Golden Original' so far, the other 5 flavors sound really good, and I can't wait to open them up.<br /><br />These are packaged beautifully, and would make great gifts as well. The cakes are roughly the size of a really fat donut. They are perfect to split with someone else. I wouldn't suggest eating the entire sampler box of 6, you might get more than a buzz from these. So you probably shouldn't bring these to work, or you might get in trouble.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again, or probably a larger cake next time.
