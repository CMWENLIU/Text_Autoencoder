I have traveled the world of earl grey tea varieties and there are many good ones (and even more bad).  However, I have never had a tea that registered near perfection like this one.  I have been sipping this tea for nearly a decade and it is absolutely outstanding (and had fantastic experiences ordering it through Amazon).  I highly recommend it.  I do always warn folks to avoid tea bag teas in general since they are mostly created using the lowest quality tea leaves ("tea dust"), so invest in a tea stick (Google it) and enjoy loose leaf varieties so you can have a cup of tea at it's highest quality.  For what it is worth, never allow the tea leaves to sit in your hot water for more than three minutes (less than half that time for a cup rather than a tea pot full).  Enjoy!
