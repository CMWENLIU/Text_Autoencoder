Was able to get this type of noodles (creamy chicken) before one of our major grocery stores folded. No one in the area has the selection they used to carry. This was my favorite & I have missed it for years. Couldn't even find it on the Maruchan sight. Once you try them, your in love. Great lunch for on the go!
