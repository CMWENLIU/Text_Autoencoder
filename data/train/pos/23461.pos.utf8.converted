I have a potassium deficiency and have found coconut water to be an excellent addiction to my diet. I even notice a slight energy boost after drinking it. The flavor is just slightly sweet and coco-nutty with a faint saltiness like most sports drinks have. It's really easy to pack a couple of tablespoons into a Tupperware or small zip-lock and shake it up with water after a workout. The product dissolves quickly and easily leaving the water slightly cloudy. Overall CocoHydro is as good if not better than packaged coconut water (I compare it to VitaCoco Original). The environmental impact of using a powdered product is much less than the tetra packaged waters. I have even subscribed to a monthly shipment so I won't have to drive to a health food store 45 min away for my fix.<br /><br />Bottom line, it tastes great, it costs less than other brands, and I will be buying it for the foreseeable future.
