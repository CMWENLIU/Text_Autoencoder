This sweetener has no after taste, resembles table sugar without the calories.<br /><br />What I have found in other sweeteners:<br /><br />*  High Fructose Corn Syrup does cause weight gain.  All concerned about their weight, as myself, should stay away from it.<br />[...]<br /><br />*  Cane sugar, not as bad as HFCS will also put on the weight.<br /><br />*  artificial sweeteners -  I have personally witness a person with a medical mystery like disease resembling lupus clear her symptoms when eliminating unnatural artificial sweeteners.  I know of another person who had restless leg syndrome at night eliminate these problems by eliminating artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />* Stevia herb is sweet but with an after taste
