More difficult than oatmeal or quinoa to cook for breakfast: the small grains must be shaken apart once added to the water, and more frequent stirring required to avoid a sticky gel-like mass on the bottom of the pan. These minor annoyances aside, teff has excellent flavor and nutritional benefits, including 20% of the RDA for Iron. Great with fruits and nuts for breakfast, or as a base for vegetables in a casserole.
