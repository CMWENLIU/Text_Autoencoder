I'm a caregiver for a vegetarian, and was asked to cook a few meals.  Being a non-vegetarian, this was a challenge for me, so I searched the internet, found a few recipes and then came up with one of my own using this broth along with the 'beef' and 'chicken'.  It was a big hit.  It came fresh in the foil pouch, and the amount was great to transfer to canning jars.
