Normally I don't even think about drinking vodka (too many bad college memories!) until my husband brought this home one night. He claimed it was a sipping vodka and in all honesty there was no way I could believe him. So against my better judgment I decided to mix it with some orange juice. Wow...I have never tasted a vodka so smooth and there was no burning sensation and rubbing alcohol aftertaste. Even when you shoot it there isn't a burning sensation and almost feels like you are drinking water. And come on now, the bottle is pretty freakin cool! A must try vodka for the non-vodka drinkers.
