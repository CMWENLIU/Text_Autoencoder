We've been buying Arya Basmati rice for years and prefer it over any of the other varieties we have tried. We are thrilled for it to be available on Amazon and even more to find out that it is the best selling rice on Amazon. It is perfectly aged, quite fragrant, not sticky and lends itself to countless recipes and culinary applications. This is one of those rice that one can eat plain, without any seasoning or additional flavorings.<br /><br />We do not agree with the previous reviewer about the bag and packaging. All major Basmati brands come in this kind of packaging to avoid infestation by providing oxygen, cost of material, ease of storage and of course recycling of the bags to save natural resources. Plastic containers on the other hand pollute our system and add price without adding any value to the rice. The true Basmati rice is aged for a min 1 year to give a full flavor of aroma when cooked and they are stored in such bags, only in large quantities.<br /><br />Basmati can be cooked in many different ways with many many different dishes. One of our favorite and quick recipe for Basmati rice is below.<br /><br />Recipe for Peas Pulao:<br />Ingredients<br />2 cups water<br />2 tablespoon oil<br />1 cup Basmati rice<br />1/4 cup frozen green peas<br />1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds<br />Salt to taste<br /><br />Directions<br />Saut&eacute; cumin seeds in oil using a saucepan, until light brown.<br />Add rice, peas, water to the saucepan and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 12 minutes.<br />When rice is cooked, stir gently to fluff it up.  Cover and let stand for 5 minutes.
