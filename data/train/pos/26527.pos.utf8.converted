Vegan. All natural. Kosher. Chickpeas and potatoes in savory brown gravy. Reminds me of puri aloo (without the bread) from railway platforms or from street vendors across India, but higher quality and very hygienic. Convenient foil package. Heat & serve. Great with tortillas, pitas, puris, on toast, or over rice. Actually made in Maharastra, so its really the real thing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM">Tasty Bite Entr&eacute;e, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006MUF6G">Tasty Bite Entr&eacute;e, Bengal Lentils, 10 Ounce Packet (Pack of 12)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5GJRE">Tasty Bite Yellow Curry Vegetables & Jasmine Rice, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> are also highly recommended.
