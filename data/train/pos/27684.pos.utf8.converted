This is the first Jeremiah's variety I've tried, but I am completely satisfied and finally feel like I've had a "truth in advertising" moment of my very own. Although it's really the number of positive reviews already in place that sealed the deal. I figure if you're writing reviews about coffee on Amazon, you probably know a thing or two about the grind.<br /><br />Now, to reiterate, Fogbuster consists of dark, oily beans packed with rich, nutty, semisweet flavor. It also makes a full-bodied iced coffee. Fogbuster is most similar in flavor to Taylor Maid Farms' Goat Rock roast; it's as good or better than any cutely named Blue Bottle variation; and if you're waiting to hear what I have to say about Pete's Coffee, you've missed the point.<br /><br />I live in San Francisco where this is brewed, but the Jeremiah's store is in a sketchy neighborhood and it's actually far cheaper -- at the moment anyway -- to order Fogbuster through Amazon than Jeremiah's website. I've already set Fogbuster up to be ordered automatically every six months (I know one 5 pound bag won't last that long, but I also know I'm finicky and will want to try some others inbetween).<br /><br />A parting shot at Jeremiah's: Offering pre-ground beans to your customers through a middle-man warehouse is akin to Ian Astbury joining The Doors. It's sacrilegious.
