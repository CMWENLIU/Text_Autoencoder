For the first few years we've had our German Shepherd we fed her Honest Kitchen mixed with Canidae.  She was a healthy weight, sleek with a shiny coat.  However, I hate to admit that I complained to my husband about the cost so he switched her to Newman's Own and Alpo.  Within 6 months she's overweight and has horrendous ear problems.  Horrendous!  She walks crooked because her head is tilted, and continually she presses her ear against our hands to massage the base of the ear.  The smell is noxious and whines or yelps out when it obviously pains her.  The vet kept giving us otic washes, but never questioned the source of the chronic ear inflammation.  A friend put me in touch with a breeder and the breeder immediately asked about her food.  She said that Honest Kitchen is a FANTASTIC food choice for dogs if you're not going to feed them a raw diet, and that her ear problems are likely a direct result of her changed diet.  So we're back to Honest Kitchen...and the cost is definitely worth it to have a healthy, happy dog!
