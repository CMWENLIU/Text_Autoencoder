Six ingredients...Dates,Almonds,Pecans,Ginger,Cinnamon, and Cloves....that's it....I don't know how they do it but it is the most delicious treat i've had in a long time  The ginger, cinnamon and cloves give off a pungent aroma and packs a punch-the dates give it a sweetness but not too sweet and the nuts add crunchiness but WOW!WOW!WOW! I can't believe how great these ginger snaps are.  This is not meant to be a criticism but I must admit the look of the bar is not pretty but once you've taken a bite you'll know, they're pretty wonderful.
