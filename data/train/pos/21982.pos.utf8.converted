In a world where canned chili is usually filled with fat, salt, and preservatives, Amy's chili is a welcome relief to those of us who are trying to eat healthier.  Chili is a favorite in our family but I can't seem to make it very well for some reason. It's just not my fort&eacute;. However, other commercially-made chilis are so very high in sodium and fat that we just had to go without chili for a while. When we tried this, we weren't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The results were delicious!  It's just the right amount of spicy, you don't miss the salt, and it's bursting with flavor. This chili is even good straight-out-of-the-can so if you live in a hurricane area, this is a must for your hurricane kit. I highly recommend this for chili-lovers who are trying to have a healthier diet.
