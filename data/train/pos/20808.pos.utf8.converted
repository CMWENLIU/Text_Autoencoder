These are by far my favorite gluten free oats that I have tried.  I prefer them over Bob's Red Mill and one other smaller brand that is currently on the market.  I prefer them due to the fact that they are a bit sweeter and thinner cut than the others.  They really are the most like Quaker oatmeal (which is what I grew up on).  So if you like(d) Quaker oats but now need to have certified gluten free oats- this is your best substitution!  You will love to be able to make oatmeal cookies once again!
