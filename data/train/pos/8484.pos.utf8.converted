I love this tea.  I drink it hot with honey; my husband likes it cold with stevia.  It has a refreshing peach taste with a zingy, spicy undertone (but not overly spicy).  Not only does it taste good, but it's good for you.  I also like how Yogi Tea heat seals their tea bags, which results in fragrant, fresh tea.
