So I know this guy, and he's been eating these things at least 3 times a week for over, like, 10 years or more. Well I thought that was sort weird, ya know, at first...  But then I found myself stranded at his house one day, forced to join him in a meal of Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans.  And my life has never been the same since.  Seriously.  Ask any of my friends.  A mushrooming explosion of zestful flavor (not actual mushrooms) in your mouth belies the simple and inexpensive 6.4-Ounce package.  Did I mention it's Zesty?<br /><br />But the problem was, Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans, 6.4-Ounce Packages weren't available in any local stores.  My friend (who I didn't think was so weird anymore) had to travel four hours north by motor vehicle just to buy them, year after year.  But today we can celebrate our good friends at Amazon.com for making this hidden culinary nugget readily available to all (and for saving my friend a lot of gas money).<br /><br />And can you guess how I'm going to celebrate??
