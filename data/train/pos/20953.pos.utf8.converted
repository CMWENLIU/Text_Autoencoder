I have purchased these cookies twice now (I'm backlogged, but I was afraid that Amazon wouldn't stock them again) and I'm slowly eating my way through them.<br /><br />Many people have attempted to describe the taste and I agree with most of the previous descriptions - they are not hyper sweet or milk chocolate-y, but rather almost like a darker chocolate taste.  Don't take me calling it dark chocolate to mean they're bitter, because they're not, but imagine the taste of a normal Hershey's bar if you removed half the sugar.  You'd still get the nice taste of chocolate, but just in a more subdued fashion.  If you have a chocolate craving, and not a sugar craving, you'll love these cookies.  If you have just a simple sweet tooth and a craving for sugar, well these may not be quite what you're looking for.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is that these are what I would classify as "very hard" cookies.  Most of the cookies you find on the grocery stores now days contain quite a few fatty ingredients that make the cookie yield in your mouth instead of crunching.  These suckers crunch.  A lot.  I would even go far as to say that if you have dental issues, milk would be a requirement to eat these.  The texture is very similar to eating Nature's Valley granola bars (not the chewy ones).
