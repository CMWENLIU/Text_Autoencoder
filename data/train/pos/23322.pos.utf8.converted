I don't know about how well they work (fiber and all) yet (although I would like to know what the ratio of insoluble v soluble fiber is rather than the generic amount as I can't find that info on their website), but the Dark Chocolate Almond are by far the best tasting of these kind of bars I have ever had. Seriously, really taste good. 5 stars are based on taste and that I don't blow the bank with 130 calories. Hopeful that the antioxidants and fiber are actually beneficial.
