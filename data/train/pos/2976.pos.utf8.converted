Learned about these treats from a friend who has two rescues -- a 65 lb.pit bull mix and a 50 lb lab mix. The Checkups are really excellent for helping to keep the dogs' teeth clean and better yet, the dogs -- two shelties, 8 yrs and 2 years old -- love them. They each get 1/2 a checkup bone before bedtime. The treats are also wheat-free and very digestible -- eliminating two issues that have caused serious problems for dogs in the past. Even better, during our dogs' last two annual health/dental checkups -- the vet did NOT recommend we bring the dogs in for teeth cleaning. In fact, their teeth were given the "look pretty good" comment.
