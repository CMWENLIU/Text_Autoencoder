I used this tea first when I was pregnant. It was my first pregnancy and I had read great things about it toning the uterus to make labor go a bit more smooth. I drank 3 cups a day starting at 37 weeks. my son was born at 40+ weeks and my labor was short and the pushing didn't last that long. I do attribute that to this tea. This tea is also great for taking away menstrual cramps. Today in fact I took many different medications to try to get some kind of relief, and nothing would help. I found this tea that I forgot I had, made some and what do ya know, cramps are gone. I highly recommend this tea to all women.
