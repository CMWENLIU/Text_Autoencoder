Ever since I brought my Keurig brewer to my office, this has been, hands down, the most popular K-Cup in the collection I keep on hand.<br /><br />Being a Full blend, it's strong enough to use on the 8 oz brew setting to give it a nice strong, yet subtle flavor.  I can taste a hint of the vanilla in the blend which ties the entire blend together.<br /><br />There were some comments about the Diedrich roast being stronger than most East-Coast roasts, but I found that Diedrich's roasting to be superb.  I've tried Timothy's, Green Mountain, and Van Houtte, and I find Diedrich to have less of a burned taste.  After all, Diedrich did invent one of the most successful roasting machines used by other coffee houses (look for Diedrich Manufacturing for more information).<br /><br />While I still enjoy drinking Diedrich's Colombia in the mornings (at the lowest setting to make its flavor stand out), I find myself always drinking a cup of Morning Edition afterward.
