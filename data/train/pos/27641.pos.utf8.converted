Pardina lentils are my favorite.  They hold their shape when cooked so, being a vegetarian, they are great as a meat substitute in things like sloppy joes or casseroles.  The dryland hills of the Palouse in eastern Washington and northern Idaho produce the best lentils, dry peas, garbanzo beans and wheat, much of which are exported to India and Asia.  Pardinas are great in soups, salads, casseroles and rice pilafs.  Palouse Brand are the only brand of lentils in my kitchen.
