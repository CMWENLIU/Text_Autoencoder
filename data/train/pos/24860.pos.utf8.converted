As a result of psychiatric problems, I regained 37 of the 60 pounds I had lost. I was desperate to avoid resuming my diabetes meds, which make me sick. I knew that cinnamon is known to lower blood sugar, and I eat a lot of fat-free, sugar-free  yogurt with frozen berries in it. I season the yogurt with cinnamon and Splenda. I actually eat about a quarter of a cup a day of cinnamon. My last A1C (a blood test that tells a person's average blood sugar over the last three months)was perfect! And this is such a good-tasting and smelling cinnamon; it's much better than the grocery store type, to say nothing of the dollar store type. I will definitely continue using this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEICQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
