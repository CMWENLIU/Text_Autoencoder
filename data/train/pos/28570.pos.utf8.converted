After reading the other reviews, I decided to add mine. I like strong, black tea because I add sugar and milk. This is the only tea bag that is strong enough for my taste, even though one reviewer suggests it might be made more for a tea pot. I let it brew in the cup for a good 5 minutes with a lid on the cup, and it's the perfect cup of tea. Can't drink another kind anymore. PG Tips also makes good iced tea in an iced tea maker. This is truly a great price for this many tea bags, as well. Each to his own, but this is the best tea bag for me.
