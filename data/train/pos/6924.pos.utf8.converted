Being a health nut, I have put some greenfood powders in my mouth that were less than tasty, let me tell you.  This one suggests being mixed with milk, but I went ahead and tried it just with water out of curiosity BEFORE the indulgence of milk.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the lovely cocoa flavor.  I bought this more for my hubby who cannot stomach green drinks and forgets to take his capsule version...his words "not the best chocolate milk I have ever tasted, but as a green drink not bad at all"...from him, Standard American Diet Man, this is high praise.  i am trying to get thru a less tasty one at home now so I can indulge in HIS.
