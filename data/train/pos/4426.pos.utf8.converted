Winnie has been ill, at 14 years of age and having lived outdoors for 10, she was really causing me concern when she refused to eat. After she started to feel better I followed the Vets advice and tried this. She eats all of her food( she gets this dry and the Evo canned) and asks for more. I can really see that her skinny little body is doing much better. As close to a raw diet for the meat eater as you can get without the real prep of raw!
