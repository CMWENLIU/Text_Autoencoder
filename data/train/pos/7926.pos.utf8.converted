I personally don't drink coffee and I rarely eat chocolate, but I think these are awesome.  I'm broke this year, so I'm give them out as presents (if I know you, act surprised).  So far, I've gotten positive feedback from others.  And they came straight from Costa Rica.  Pretty cool.  I'm ordering more.
