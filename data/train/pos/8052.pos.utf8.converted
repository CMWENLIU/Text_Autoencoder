I ordered the chocolate, vanilla and strawberry/banana flavors. I love them all. As another reviewer mentioned, they came well packaged and frozen hard. I had to wait a while to try them. The vanilla is lovely. Very subtle flavor and not too sweet. It's not premium ice cream, but then I would never indulge in premium ice cream anyway. My calorie restrictions only allow for stuff like Skinny Cow and Arctic Zero is as good or better. I still find it amazing that I can eat a whole pint of this for less than 150 calories. Thank you Arctic Zero! I'll be a regular customer.
