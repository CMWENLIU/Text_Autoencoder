I was very impressed with this starter.<br /><br />1 It sets up in four hours<br />2 it made a nice smooth yogurt<br />3 each box makes six quarts, so this package of three boxes makes 18 quarts<br />4 the packages are set up for quarts, the amount I use<br /><br />Just a hint for beginners, if your yogurt isn't as thick as you like, the original heating time is important. The longer you hold it at 180 degrees, the thicker your yogurt. I use a double boiler to keep mine from scorching.<br /><br />While I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZ8S5U">Yolife Yogurt Maker (YL-210)</a> because you can use your own jars and vary the sizes, you can even make yogurt using your crockpot. Just google yogurt recipe crockpot.<br /><br />This is a super starter and works very well.
