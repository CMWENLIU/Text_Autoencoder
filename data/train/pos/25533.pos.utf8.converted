I just bought these cookies so I'd get free shipping on a couple of other items I wanted. WHAT A FIND. They are fantastic. I didn't realize I was getting a box of six boxes of TOP QUALITY, DELICIOUS cookies. We polished them all off in short order with lots of company at the cottage this summer. My husband was thrilled that they were organic, my brother and his wife found them a chocolate lovers delight, the grandkids gobbled them up, and I was astounded that they were gluten free and wheat free so I could enjoy them as well. We will all be ordering lots more.
