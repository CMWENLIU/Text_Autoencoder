Korean seaweed snacks are very tasty. My local Chinese supermarket sells this brand, in addition to another favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPV4AO">ChoripDong Korean Seaweed Snack (Kim Nori), Roasted w/Olive oil & Sea Salted, 0.17-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>. If you've tried Japanese seaweed snacks and didn't like them, you may like Korean ones. Korean seaweed snacks are typically roasted and flavored with salt and oil while Japanese ones are oil-less. This makes Korean seaweed sheets very light, flaky, and crispy. They just crumble in your mouth. Both are very nutritious and healthy, but Japanese seaweed strips are thicker and more chewy. The downside to the yumminess is that Korean seaweed snacks typically taste saltier, so it's best to eat them with a bowl of rice, though I've gone through several packs of them on their own. You also have to wipe your fingers afterward because of the oil.<br /><br />Inside each pouch is a plastic tray that holds 6 or 8 sheets of pre-cut seaweed to prevent crush damage. If you don't like seaweed at all, you might not like this. Seaweed snacks are not for everyone. But if you do, definitely give this a try.
