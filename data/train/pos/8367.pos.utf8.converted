Whoever said healthy food does not taste good, never tried this stuff! I am a life long vegetarian but only started using nutritional yeast last year. This stuff tastes great and is so easy to use. I use it to make scrambled vegan eggs (with tofu). So many vegan recipes call for this stuff and I can see why. It's a powerhouse of nutrients and tastes like cheese!
