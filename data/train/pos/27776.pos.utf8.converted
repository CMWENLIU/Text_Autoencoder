This lower carb pasta tastes like regular wide noodle pastas.  Doesn't work with the LOW Carb diets, but it does work great with the Weight Watchers diet.  It has SIX grams of fiber per serving!  The company makes four flavors... lemon pepper, basil, garlic, and the regular egg noodle.  I have tried them ALL, but like the egg the best.  The lemon pepper works well with a white sauce (alfredo, etc).
