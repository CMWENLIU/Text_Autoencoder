This is a great sweetener and a generic version of liquid splenda.  Contains 800 drops. With 1 drop equaling a tsp and 2 drops equaling a packet of splenda.  The bottle was pleasantly bigger than I expected.  After purchasing it last week, bought another one this week to keep at work.  Zero carbs so you don't have to waste any carbs on artificial sweeteners.  Doesn't have a bad after tase.<br />Would recommend to anyone who uses sweeteners.
