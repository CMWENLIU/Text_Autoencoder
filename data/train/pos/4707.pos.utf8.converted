I originally tried this tea in the Teavana store, and was surprised at the wonderful scent. I'm not usually one for peach teas, but this was so mellow and fragrant, I couldn't pass it up. I didn't even realize it was a blooming tea until the gal at Teavana explained it to me.<br /><br />Not only does this tea taste good and is good for you, but it's beautiful, and more affordable than you'd think. The blossom it creates when you brew it is very pretty, it's half of why I drink it. And, each blossom is good for 5-6 brews, which means the 2 ounces in a pack (about 8 blossoms) is about 50 cups of tea. I use 1 blossom in Teavana's Perfect Tea Maker (the 16 ounce size) and I can fill the tea maker full 5-7 times before I consider the flavor and scent to be pretty diminished. For an artisan tea, that's an excellent value.
