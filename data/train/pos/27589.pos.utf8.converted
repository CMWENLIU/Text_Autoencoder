We have tried the mango and apple flavors, and prefer the tangier taste of the mango.  These fruit leathers are soft, sticky, and totally delicious.  The packaging colors/design look a little different in the pack we bought, but the essential size is the same.  At our store these cost 69 cents apiece, so ordering a box from Amazon.com is a deal (although then we eat a lot more of them too!).<br /><br />Nutrition info on the "mango sunrise" flavor we bought, each strip serving (14g) has:<br /><br />Calories: 45, Calories from Fat: 0<br />zero fat/cholest/sodium/protein, 85mg potassium, 11g carbs, 1g fiber, 9g sugars, and offers 4% Vitamin C.<br />All sugar comes naturally from fruit.
