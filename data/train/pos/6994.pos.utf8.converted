I've ordered this sauce several times and fall in love each time. The vodka sauce makes plain pasta a restaurant-worthy dish. Spoon it over chicken, toss it with shrimp, add it to pork, the options are endless. The flavors are just right. My seven-year old loves it as much as my husband and I do.<br /><br />There used to be several customers reviews, which were so outstanding I bought it the first time just based on what I read. Sometimes the packaging is not the most secure, so check all of the jars when you get them. Some people have had jars crack and I had a couple that opened. They weren't opened enough to spill, but when I removed the plastic cap, I could see that the inner seal was opened. Amazon sent more immediately, so I have continued to order them again and again.<br /><br />I'm glad this comes in a four pack because any time I open a jar, it's gone within the hour.<br /><br />Update:<br />Amazon has improved their packaging since I posted my review, such an improvement that it is worth an update given the earlier concerns about open jars. The new-and-improved box is sturdy, with dividers for each jar, plus a styrofoam layer. Then the entire box is packed in an Amazon box. I do not think that anything can happen to the jars now, and I've never had any problems since the box improvement. Thanks, Amazon!
