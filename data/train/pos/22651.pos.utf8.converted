We all know that green tea is healthy, but if you are like me, you hate the taste. However, this stuff is quite amazing. The mango flavor is quite strong, masking the tea taste. It also has only 5 calories and no sugar, unlike some green tea. So, if you are looking for a healthy alternative to sodas, this is for you.
