For decades I have cooked barley the long way - simmering for almost an hour, watching the pot so it doesn't boil over, scouring the sticky, gooey pot afterwards. I recently gave this product a try and am now a convert. No more long vigils at the stove watching a pot simmer.  This is wonderfully flavorful, full of all the healthy stuff we are looking for, and so much easier to cook, in a lot less time. I used to freeze the long-cooking kind and now I cook batches of this and freeze in smaller portions as well.<br /><br />I have even simmered this quick cooking barley along with whole wheat orzo together in the same pot, drained it and frozen it for future use in soups, stews, etc.<br /><br />Never again will I waste an hour of precious time cooking barley the long way. This quick cooking barley will now become a staple in my cupboard.
