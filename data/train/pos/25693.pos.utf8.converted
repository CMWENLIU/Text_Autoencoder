Trident uses a sugar-alcohol called Xylitol, a natural sugar that has no carbohydrate action, yet bacteria ingest the Xylitol and cannot metabolize it, thus starving the bacteria!  Thus, with consistant use, it rids the mouth of harmful cavity-causing, gum disease-causing bacteria!  This is truly a unique gum.  One of the few gums that all dentists can recommend!<br /><br />Don't use this product if you suffer from TMJ - it will only aggravate your sore joints.<br /><br />This is a great product for the average person, child or adult.  Chew two to three pieces a day and your oral health will improve.<br /><br />Jim Koenig, DDS
