Our dog LOVES to chew, and these sticks are the best! Each stick is strong, yet softens up as it is chewed. Each stick lasts long enough to satisfy his "chewing fit." For quality, value, and safety, we haven't found anything to compare with the bully sticks. Next to Costco (when they have them in stock), Rawhide Depot has the most reasonable price we have found anywhere for the 12" bully sticks. And, their customer service is excellent!
