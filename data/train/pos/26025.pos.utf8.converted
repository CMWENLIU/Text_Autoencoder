This "Bacon Spread" is every bit as delicious as it sounds! This has a jam consistency that lends itself to spreading on hamburger buns (which is very good, indeed) but it also makes a great addition to anything that pairs well with bacon. We added this to our homemade fried rice and it was nothing short of amazing!<br /><br />While this is a little pricy, it makes a great gift for the "gourmet chef" in your life!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
