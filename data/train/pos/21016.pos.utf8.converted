My husband and I ordered this basket for his parents anniversary and they loved it.  My mother in-law said it was the best of Italian food (they are Italian New Yorkers who have retired to Florida) that she can not find in the supermarkets in her area.  They loved everything in the basket and said the presentation and quality were excellent.  I am so pleased that they were excited about this product because the older our parents get the harder it seems to be to find an appropriate gift that they will actually use.  The delivery was very fast and we are all extremely happy.
