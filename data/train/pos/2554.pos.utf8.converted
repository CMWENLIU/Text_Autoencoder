I love this product.  I grew up using this mustard but then moved to another area where it was not carried by the local supermarkets.  Then I found it again, and life is good.<br /><br />My wife is a yellow mustard person, and dislikes any of the spicy brown mustards I usually eat.  But when I found Kosciusko mustard again just recently I was raving about it so much she actually tried it.  And said she liked it.  Then two weeks ago I walked into the kitchen and found her making herself a sandwich and she was using the Kosciusko's!  I was shocked!  I started to make fun of her, asking if she grabbed the wrong mustard by mistake.  She said she likes it.<br /><br />Imagine that, all those years of living in a drab, unexciting existence using plain old yellow mustard, and she has finally seen the light.  I am so proud.<br /><br />Thank you Kosciusko Mustard Company.<br /><br />PS: There is only one problem I can see with your product.  It only comes in a 9 ounce jar.  That is not nearly big enough.  At the moment I have one half used jar in the fridge, and two unopened back-up jars in the pantry.  Please start selling it in a larger jar.
