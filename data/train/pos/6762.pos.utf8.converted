I have reviewed several gluten free products and this is the best gluten free mac & cheese I have found.  I found this at my local health food store, about the only place I shop now that I have to eat gluten free, and loved it.  When I saw it on Amazon by the case (and $10 off to boot) I was excited.  Annie's also makes frozen, microwaveable mac & cheese that is *very* good...it really just depends on whether you are used to the frozen/baked kind or the kind out of a box.  It seems that Annie's makes a great line of products and I would try any of them.<br /><br />Great product and I appreciate Amazon stocking quality, good tasting gluten free items like this.
