Mate de coca (coca tea) has been used for centuries in the Andean countries as a pick-me-up and to counter the effects of altitude sickness.  I didn't know it was legal to sell in the U.S. but was very happy to find it on Amazon!  I ordered some and just made a small pot of tea (using two tea bags) as a pick-me-up because I was feeling sleepy and tired.  The tea is mild-tasting, much more so than the bitter (but caffeine-laden) yerba mate of the Rio de la Plata basin, and relatively light colored.  It does pack a kick, though, and after a couple of mugs of tea I'm definitely wide awake!  Don't take this before bedtime!  It's definitely something to wake you up, not put you to sleep!<br /><br />The tea is not habit forming.  Andean Indians have used it (or chewed coca leaves) for energy and to stave off hunger from time immemorial.  You might find that as well as waking you up it suppresses your appetite somewhat, so this could be useful for dieters.  A welcome addition to Amazon's offerings and a way to help Andean Indians who grow coca legally to find a legal market for their product.
