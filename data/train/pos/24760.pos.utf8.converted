I have enjoyed these every Christmas for the past 4 years.  I first had them in Germany, where they are available only during the holiday season.  I sent a pack to my Mom as a Christmas gift, and she loves them too.  She's deathly alergic to nuts, and unlike the Mon Cheri's you find in the states (with hazlenuts), these Mon Cheri's have no nuts, only chocolate, brandy, and a cherry; thus, she can enjoy them without worries.  I wish America would sell these little delights in stores, rather than just online.  They're well worth the wait of mail order though!
