Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before<br />they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite.  I was<br />able to find the recipe for the corn cakes in a cookbook I purchased, but I could never find the recipe for<br />the Cancun.  I made several attempts to prepare our favorite dish, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't<br />come close.  I finally just gave up, and then, a few weeks ago, I found the recipe on the internet.<br />I was so excited, and made my grocery list for the ingredients that were needed.  Well, I found everything<br />I needed, but you guessed it, the lobster base.<br /><br />I went back on-line and did a search on lobster base. After checking out all the companies that popped-up,<br />I decided on Amazon.com.  I found the amount and cost range I was looking for.  I placed my order and within<br />a few days I received it.<br /><br />I surprised my husband one night for dinner with our long-awaited favorite dish and when we took our first<br />bites, we looked at each other and smiled.  That was it, the taste I thought was lost forever, had been found.<br /><br />Thank you for giving me my missing ingredient......Better than Bouillon Lobster Base!!  Now I'm searching for<br />more recipes that I can use it in.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />P. Bush
