If I had to pick just one candy to have for the rest of my life, it would be some fameous chocolate from Europe, but if I could choose two, Haribo Fruit Salad would come in second. This is amazing candy; I never tire of it. My wife and I consume about 30 pounds a year of this stuff, and it is definitely less costly than chocolate. The six flavors are all good, if not always identifiable. What is that green flavor, anyway? Watermelon? Maybe, but definitely not citrus. The flavors I'm sure of are Orange, Lemon, Grapefruit and Cherry. There is one that is maybe peach, or maybe passion fruit. Then, there is the enigmatic green. The soft gummi candy is coated with fine granular sugar, a nice touch. Haribo sells a version of the Grapefruit flavor in a single flavor package, and though slightly different from the Grapefruit found in this mix, it is wonderful, too.
