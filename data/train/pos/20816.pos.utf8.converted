My son is a 2nd grader he had to do a report on an invention. He picked bubblegum. When time came for him to do an experiment this kit was prefect. The kids in his class were amazed on how it was done and how easy.  There was plenty of gum to go around the class of 22 with some to come home. If your child likes to play scientist this is a great kit!!
