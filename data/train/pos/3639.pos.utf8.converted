I have the nibs.  I have to stay away from peanuts due to allergy and soy as well.  That makes finding a tasty cacao powder tough.  I tried last week to make brownies by grinding my own nibs into powder.  They were tasty.  The raw aspect makes them very potent!  However, the kids could tell the difference from the traditional powder I was using.  We had Equal Exchange cacao powder, which is good but processed with soy.<br />So, I ordered up this powder version, figuring they can grind it better than I can.  I was correct.  Wonderful powder and smell.  I made brownies two days ago and another version yesterday.  They are great with the powder!  I just placed another order since xmas season baking is approaching and I have almost used one of my bags already!<br />I will continue to use Navitas products.  We currently get the cashews, maca and cacao from here.  Great deal on Amazon and the best taste I can find.  Bonus is allegen free for us as well!
