I've been addicted to Slim Jims for YEARS!  I mean really...I can remember begging my mother to pick up a package when she'd go food shopping.  Now, as an adult, I have the power to fill all my cabinets with Slim Jims!!!  I know they're awful for you, and like a hotdog, I don't want to know what's in them...but I'll tell you...a Slim Jim a day keeps the frowns away.  They're especially good with Iced Tea.  Give it a try!
