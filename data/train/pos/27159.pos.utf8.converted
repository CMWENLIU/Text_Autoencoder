My husband and I have been ordering this coffee for over a year.  Amazon still seems to be the cheapest even though we have had a few price increases which have resulted in approx $7 per box since we first ordered.  The coffee is very good if you like flavored coffee.  Very rich with flavor and is med bold.  Smells delectable when brewing.  We are totally addicted to our Keurig coffee maker.  We have tried several brands and flavors of coffee but this one remains at the top of our list. Thank you Amazon for carrying it, the auto shipping and for such great service.
