I've seen these around but all the negative press told me it wasn't worth the agony of trying to choke these stinky slimy suckers down. Anyway, practicing the reasonable-carb lifestyle, I rarely eat pasta but miss the convenience of pasta dishes for lunch.  Wondering if they were really *that* bad, I busted out the fiver I had burning a hole in my pocket and bought two bags. Ready for the most horrendous smell that had ever invaded human nostrils, I opened the bag and held my breath.  No sirens went off, the cats were still walking around and life appeared to go on, so I let my guard down and decided to take a breath while the noodles and I were in the same room.  Silly me, I thought to myself.  I've been fooled by the drama of Amazon reviewers.  Sure they do have a smell, but steaming up some brussels sprout will leave you worse off. A 30-second generous rinse of hot water in my favorite yellow Tupperware strainer yielded a healthy portion of stench-free noodles.  Then I decided to do what no man has dared to do before! I reach into the strainer with my index finger and opposable thumb, pinched a tablespoon-sized serving of plain hot rinsed noodles, and stuck them directly in my mouth! O.M.G.... nothing happened.  So I made my spaghetti and had a great day.
