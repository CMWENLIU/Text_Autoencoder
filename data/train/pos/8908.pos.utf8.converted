When I was at school in Idaho 35 years ago, this was my favorite candy of all time.  Unfortunately, I've never seen them offered for sell in any store since then.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw these at Amazon -- at a great price and delivered to my door in Texas.  I lost no time in ordering a box.  They're basically chunky chocolate on the outside that surrounds a cherry concoction that surrounds a whole cherry.  Very tasty and just like I remembered.  If you love cherry chocolate candy, you won't go wrong with these yummy treats.  I think I'll have one right now....
