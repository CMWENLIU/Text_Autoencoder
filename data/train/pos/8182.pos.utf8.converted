We bought this item to specifically help to detox intestinal track. It's great stuff. It was shipped fast, it's a very good price, and this is raw food!<br />We grind them in a processor, add raw honey, take it and then  2 hrs later take couple spoons of castor oil. Trust me it's worth doing once in a while as it helps you stay clean on the inside.<br />I also make pumpkin & raisin raw cookies out of it. Pumpkin seeds are great or you! Especially for men as they take care of prostate health  as well!
