These Kashi Chewy Granola Bars are the perfect thing to bring along in the car, keep in your desk at work, and always stash one or two in your purse. They taste great and are filling enough to stop a more "sinful" snack-attack cold. Eat one of these before you start searching the supermarket aisles, and you'll save quite a bit on those hunger-driven impulse buys. This is an excellent, healthy product.
