Our favorite way to serve this item is to mix it with chicken, but it's great as is if you're a vegetarian.<br />To address an earlier review (which gave the product a single star when it was clear the reviewer was actually rating the Amazon site, not the product): nutritional information is available from the Jyoti website (http://jyotifoods.com/pages/ingrednt.html), at the bottom of the ingredients page.
