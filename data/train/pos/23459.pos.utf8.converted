I first tried the Pineapple flavor and was waiting to try the Original to cast my final rating.  I'm still very impressed.  While nothing beats a fresh coconut, this is a great alternative.  I'm a coconut water addict and consume anywhere from 1-3 cans a day.  This adds up in $$$.  For people like me, who drink coconut water everyday and use electrolyte replacement mixes in my water bottle when i'm biking, this is a dream come true.  My kid actually loves eating the powder straight!<br /><br />I recommend this product for people who love coconut water as much as I do, are aware of the environmental impact shipping coconut water around the world, packaging waste, want it all the time (like me) and like the convenience of the powder.  For purists, stick with the fresh coconut.  But for price, flavor, environmental impact and convenience, CocoHydro is awesome!<br /><br />Thanks CocoHydro for making this product!  It's a great creation!
