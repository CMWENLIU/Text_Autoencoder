My husband really, really likes this stroganoff meal. There is never enough left in the skillet for me to have second helpings -- he'd eat the entire box if he could! I do recommend browning the meat before adding the mix. Also, very lean hamburger (93% lean) doesn't have the flavor that an 85% lean meat has, so save some money there and enjoy the flavor more. I did use a steak for one of the meals, though, and that worked pretty well, too. So if you want to "upscale" the dinner you can certainly do that. This is a good quick dinner for workdays.
