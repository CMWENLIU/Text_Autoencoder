I was very skeptical when I bought this item, so imagine my amazement when I discovered that it actually works!  Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated.  Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer.  The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening.  Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse.  Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next.
