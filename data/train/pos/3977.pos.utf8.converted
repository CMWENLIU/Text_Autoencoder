The taste and quality of this soup is far superior to the stuff in the famous red can and white can but without all the unpronouncable ingredients.  We originally bought this because it was the only cream of mushroom soup without soy.  Not only am I allergic to soy but it is so unhealthy it should be avoided by everyone if at all possible.  One thing to be aware of is that this is a 12 ounce box whereas the name brand cans are only 8 ounces so when comparing prices remember that these are 50% larger than the other guys and you'll need to adjust your receipes accordingly.
