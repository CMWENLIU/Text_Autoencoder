This blue corn meal was perfect. The quality is great! I would buy from this seller again. My only suggestion - buy multiple bags or you'll regret paying the shipping charges for a tester amount (which is what I did). I also got the sweet potato flour and it was also in perfect shape. I would buy from this seller (except next time - bigger quantity to save on shipping).
