What's in the box:<br /><br />Organic, buttery-rich crackers:  6 crackers<br />Gourmet Asiago cheese spread:  .75 oz.<br />Salami Slices: .8oz.  enough for a couple of slices per cracker (or else you will have a lot of salami and no more crackers)<br />Cashew medley, containing yogurt chips, cranberries, cashews and raisins:  .75 oz.<br />Organic Dark Chocolate sandwich cookie with antioxidants:  1 cookie<br />Plastic knife<br /><br />It all tasted so good!  I was shocked at how great all the flavors went together.  The cheese spread easily on the crispy, butter crackers.  The salami didn't taste salty, but was well-textured and very natural.  The cashew medley is awesome and I wish there was a bigger bag of this item.  The organic sandwich cookie was fine, but not outstanding.  Overall, this is a great tide-me-over until dinner or my next meal.  For a child, this would be fulfilling for a lunch box.  I only wish there was a little juice box to wash it all down.
