For years, I've been looking for cornbread like Mom used to make.  I've finally found it.  Pamela's cornbread mix has it all.  It's quick and easy to prepare and it tastes heavenly.  All the make-from-scratch recipes I've tried tend to be rather dry.  Pamela's cornbread is delightfully moist and it stays moist if you don't get it all eaten at once.  In fact, it's so moist it tastes good even without butter.  It has just the right degree of sweetness.  You can also make cornbread muffins from it and I've discovered they freeze well.  In addition, Pamela provides variations on the recipe if you're looking for something a little different.  I have no hesitation in giving this product a resounding five stars.  I like it so well I order it from Amazon in bulk.
