I have two dogs, one is a 4 month old lab pup in basic obedience training.  These treats are great because they don't crumble in your pocket...they are slightly bendable (moist) to break into two pieces or you can feed them whole.  The Salmon smell really motivates dogs to follow commands.  The price was incredible saving me almost half price on "Entirely Pets" through Amazon.  I give my large Akita mix dog a couple of these for treats just because he's a good boy.  I highly recommend them.
