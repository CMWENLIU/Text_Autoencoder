Great blend, if you like French Roasts you will love this.  I have found the best K-cups for the Keurig are the dark roasts, they seem to brew with the best flavor, and as far as they go this is one of the best.  You won't go wrong choosing this if you love a dark, rich, full bodied flavor with a little bite like I do.
