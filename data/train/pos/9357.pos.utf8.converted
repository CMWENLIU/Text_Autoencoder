Simply put; this mint tea is outstanding!  I cannot recommend it enough! The aroma from the box alone was surprise enough for me, however I drank about four cups on my first sampling; one just wasn't enough.  No caffene?  Drink all you want!  I slept like a baby an hour later.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed!
