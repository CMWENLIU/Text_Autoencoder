I was looking for a great cracker to be able to make "lunchable" like meals for my children to take to school.  They are age 7 and 9 and both gluten free.  These have worked wonderful.  We have tried the regular (good but kind of plain in flavor), whole grain (very strong spice taste the kids didn't care for) and Cheddar Cheese.  I recommend the cheese.  The only issue I have with these crackers is that they are a little brittle and 1/2 the bag (there are two in a box) is always crumbled pieces and there aren't many whole crackers.  But when you are gluten free and looking for a replacement you put up with a lot.
