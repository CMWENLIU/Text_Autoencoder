Recently, I tried coconut milk in my coffee because I had some left after cooking curry.  I drink 2 cups of coffee every morning, with cream - no sugar.  Even though it sounds awful - the coconut milk was fantastic!  So far I have tried two brands - the first was sweet, which I did not prefer - seeing as I do not sweeten my coffee.  The second was Thai Kitchen, ORGANIC, unsweetened.  The Thai Kitchen brand was MUCH better. It was thicker, and less sweet, very pleasant - creamy.  I didn't see the Organic Thai Kitchen, so I just bought a case of the regular, unsweetened Coconut milk.  I can't WAIT till it comes in! I know this is great in cooking, but seriously - when you have a recipe that does not call for the whole can, what do you do with the rest?
