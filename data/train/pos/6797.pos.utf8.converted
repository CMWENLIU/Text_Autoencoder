I was looking for a dark roast that was also organic. Amazon happened to have a great special on this coffee. I was not disappointed at all and have bought this product again, after the special expired. It's a quality coffee with a rich taste. As a bonus, it's grown the "right" way through organic/biodynamic methods. If you care about environmentally-friendly farming and/or supporting small farms, this is a product you should consider.<br /><br />I use these beans with a burr grinder and a French press. The beans are very oily, as French roast ought to be. They are packaged well, but I highly recommend placing them in an airtight container after you open the bag.<br /><br />The taste is phenomenal. If you like bold and dark coffees, this French roast is the way to go. The taste is very strong, but acidic. Cafe Altura also has other beans available if you're looking for a lighter roast. Overall, this is the best coffee I've purchased from Amazon. If the company has another two-for-one special, I'm going to order a ton a Cafe Altura beans!
