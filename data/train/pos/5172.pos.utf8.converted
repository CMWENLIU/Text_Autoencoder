I buy Roland peppers at a local restaurant supply store, but the prices from Amazon are better so I'm switching.  Roland roasted red peppers have a deep pepper flavor, and the texture is always just right.  Unlike some other brands of roasted red peppers, these do not have vinegar or additives that might interfere with your recipe.  I use them in many recipes that I would fresh peppers, adding to the recipe at the last minute.  I find them almost addictive!
