Unrefined oil is not processed, bleached, deodorized and stripped so I will always pick that over the refined, but I must admit that I don't use coconut oil for cooking, I use it on my skin and hair! Although this oil has a very high smoking point, I am always worried about the true health benefits. Coconut oil may be associated with atherogenesis (disease affecting arterial blood vessels) so I choose to use for the topical benefits rather than ingesting it.<br /><br />I have learned from my boss who is form India, the secrets to her lovely shiny hair, and it's simply about warming up some coconut oil. I spoon it out if it's solid into a small glass bowl and microwaving for about 15 seconds then massaging my hair and scalp then tying a bun and letting it soak in for as long as I can ( anywhere between 15 minutes to hours or even overnight) then shampooing out with a clarifying or non moisturizing shampoo. Usually one shampoo is enough, sometimes if I have extra oil on the hair I shampoo again and then condition as usual.<br /><br />The sheen, bounce and manageability is incredible, I have never been as impressed with a product for the hair as with this simple treatment. The oil is inexpensive and lasts forever and the results are simply dazzling. For those with dry and fried hair, colored, tired or simply hair that needs a deep treatment this is heavenly. Even fine hair that has never been abused can benefit for it.<br /><br />I use this as often as I can, but once a week is sufficient, although the way the hair feels after is addictive and I can never wait to do it again.<br /><br />- Kasia S.
