My Nonna Lucia started buying this whole bean coffee at the Grand Union under the Pelham Parkway El,  MANY MANY years ago. The checkout station had a coffee grinder at the very end, so once Nonna paid for her groceries, she'd open the bag and dump the beans into the biiig grinder and flick the switch -- brrrrrrrrrrrrrp....!! the beans would grind, and oh what a wonderful smell!!!<br /><br />Every morning at breakfast, Nonna would set the glass percolator on our humble Bronx gas range, and brew herself a cup of 8 O'Clock Coffee. There she would sit at the kitchen table, listening to Italian operettas on Pasquale C.O.D.'s radio show, while dismembering a big chunk of Italian Bread (from Arthur Avenue), eating a soft boiled egg and regally quaffing her cuppa 8 O'Clock Coffee.<br /><br />The wonderful 8 O'Clock coffee, in its wonderful whole bean-ness, is still with us. Nonna, unfortunately is not. She left the world at the age of 94, and now listens to the angels (and most probably Pasquale C.O.D. himself) singing in Heaven.<br /><br />Nonna, this cup is in your memory!! * * Lifts cup, toasts Nonna Lucia, savors excellent brew flavor that brings back intense memories of a Bronx childhood and an Italian grandmother's love * *
