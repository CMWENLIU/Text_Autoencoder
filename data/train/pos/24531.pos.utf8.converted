The first time I bought this salsa I bought it as a joke, mainly for the mallard drake on the label.  But, Wow!  El Pato has a very smoky, medium hot, tangy, salty flavor.  I have given El Pato to visiting friends returning to places without access to the lovely salsa.  Great with chips, but even better on eggs in the morning.  (We who grew up in the Southwest ate hot sauce with our breakfasts of mother's milk!)  My only reservation, and it is really not a reservation, is that the salsa is inconsistent.  Differing levels of saltiness should not happen, as it occasionally is too salty, but differing levels of 'heat' are due to the fickle nature of the jalapeno pepper.  I have had cans that are toward the direction of mild, and one that nearly blew my head off.  Needless to say I have never opened a can of El Pato without finishing it!
