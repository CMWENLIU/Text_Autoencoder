These are great treats. I echo what other reviewers have said that they are great for training and you can't beat the fact that they are so low in calories. We previously tried Milk Bone Dry Treats and a few semi-soft options - all bigger treats, but these tasty little treats appear to be our labs favorite.<br /><br />Will only buy Zuke's in the future!
