My 3 yr old son has dairy and egg allergies so hard to find good cookie substitutes.  He loves these.  You can't roll them out and use cookie cutters but can still decorate with sprinkles.<br /><br />I think they're a pretty good substitute too.  I originally made these with a soy margarine that I later noticed had trans fats.  Now I use a heart healthy one without trans fats.  The cookies aren't as moist but they're healthier.<br /><br />I've also tried the chocolate chip cookies and they are awesome.  The brownies were good but more cakelike.  The pancakes were good but need extra flavoring like blueberries.
