This stuff is great! I first started to use it on just vegetables, but now I use it on mostly everything and my table salt has become used less and less.  This seasoning is especially good on vegetables, chicken, soups, salads and everything you'd use salt for.  The only time I use regular table salt now is for beef.  The flavor of this Knorr is more chickeny and veggie, though I understand Knorr has another seasoning geared towards beef. The texture of this seasoning is very nice in that it melts very quickly like a bollion cube
