This is the Japanese version of breadcrumb (pan=bread, a Portuguese loan-word, and&quot;ko-&quot;  is &quot;child of&quot; or of &quot;derived from&quot;.) Panko are used for katsudon, tonkatsu or cutlets served on rice or in soups. The cutlets, pounded chicken or pork, are coated with these light and crispy crumbs and fried. They are not gritty and dense like regular crumbs. They are very nice on deep fried shrimps and decorative for a more gourmet touch.
