This product really helps me stay "raw."  It has a good ginger flavor.  I first started to eat more raw foods by buying a dehydrator and making my own food stuffs.  If I had found the Go Raw products before I bought the dehydrator, I would have not needed it!  The pumpkin and spirulina bars are rejuvenating.  All three of these items help the need to eat a crunchy snack and still eat raw foods.  Peace
