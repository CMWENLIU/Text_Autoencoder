I purchased 75 vanilla beans to make vanilla extract for the holidays. I was  going to let this project go when I saw that the vanilla beans were around $5 A PIECE at the grocery store. I took a chance on these (buying them online sounded kind of strange) but when they came, they were well packages, fresh and smelled so good! It has been over a month and the extras are still looking good as well. I would be happy to purchase from this seller again.
