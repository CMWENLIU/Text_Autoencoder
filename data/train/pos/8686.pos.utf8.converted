My son LOVES Silk Vanilla Soy Milk, these little containers are perfect for his lunch at school.  I highly recommend them for anyone who's child drinks soy milk and they don't offer it at school.  I found it at Walmart way cheaper then on Amazon, but it only comes in a 3-pack, but it's cheaper by about 66 cents per container.  I would rather buy in bulk, but the savings is too much.
