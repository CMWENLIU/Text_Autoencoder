Thanks to a combination of Hi-Tor Neo Diet and Vita Gravy (and the sub-q fluids prescribed by the vet) my cat, who was given a diagnosis of advanced kidney failure and a certain impending death sentence two months ago, has amazed my vet and everyone in the vet's office. As a previous poster has already said, many renal failure cats are presribed the Hill's k/d or a/d diets and they absolutely hate it and won't eat it. My cat would not touch the stuff -- wouldn't even smell it -- I had to force feed him for weeks. I finally found the Hi-Tor Neo Diet, which is almost as low protein/phosphorous as the Hill's prescription diets. My cat loves it and is finally gaining back some weight. The vet had also prescribed some vitamin drops, which he also hates. Then I found "Vita-Gravy", which is also available at Pet Food Direct. He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste! If your cat has renal failure and is refusing to eat, you might want to try this combo. Good luck! I hope your kitty fares as well as mine has so far.
