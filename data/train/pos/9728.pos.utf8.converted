This sugar is healthier than the processed kind and super tasty.  Amazon offers it at an AWESOME price, but if you have a serious sweet tooth I would caution against purchasing it in such a large amount.  It is so good that it takes some constraint not to stir it into every cup of tea, bowl of oats, and picture of lemon aid.  Remember that is is STILL SUGAR and should be used sparingly!  There are healtier alternatives out there, but for that special cake or an occasional cup of hot cocoa this is my pick.
