Our pediatrician recommended Pediasure for our 2 year old son since he was underweight. He'll go days with hardly eating a thing and doesn't seem to mind. It's very stressful trying to make sure he has a healthy diet. I refuse to go the junk food route just to get food in him. But he needed 1-2 Pediasures a day, and they are prohibitively expensive, about ten bucks for a 6 pack. That's over 100 bucks a month. I tried a couple of substitutes, like Gerber smart drink and Ensure for kids. But he didn't like them as much, and eventually refused to drink them anymore. Ovaltine was an affordable alternative, but it doesn't have nearly as much nutritional value and it has a lot of sugar. In fact, sugar is the first ingredient in lot of these substitutes. I had to keep going back to the outrageously expensive Peidasure and was at my wits end.<br /><br />I've had the original Carntion Breakfast drink and I loved it many years ago. Totally didn't think of it for this scenario since it's an "adult" drink, but then I happened upon it by accident. Still had a lot of sugar though, so I was super excited to find the No Sugar Added formula. Especially happy that it has sucrose and not aspartame since it's for a toddler.<br /><br />Best part is, my son LOVES it and drinks it without a fuss. This, along with vegetable/fruit smoothies and whole grain cereal helps me feel like he's getting a good diet. He's at a healthy weight and I'm a happy mommy!
