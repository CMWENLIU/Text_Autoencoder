I love this noodle soup!  This is one of the few varieties out there that are not spicy.  You might pay a bit more, but the larger size totally makes up for it.  It seems to be out of stock a lot, and this makes me worried.  I am on the Subscribe and Save plan for monthly delivery.  I hope Amazon.com or the manufacturer does not decide to discontinue it.
