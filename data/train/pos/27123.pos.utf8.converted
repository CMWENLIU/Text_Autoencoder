I ran into this at my local Whole Foods for $6.99(MSRP regular price) and thought I love garlic I'll give this a try.  Fermenting cabbage turns a lack luster vegetable into a nutritious powerhouse superfood of Sauerkraut so starting out with a superfood such as garlic has got to end up with a super superfood!  right!  I made some homemade onion soup and threw a couple of black garlic in there and let me tell you is tastes super delicious!  I may have found it for the nutrition but I am going to buy again and again for the delicious flavor!  Look at all the great recipes on their website too!<br /><br />Black Garlic Kale<br /><br />Black Garlic T-Bone Steak"- Mini Superior Farms Lamb T-Bone with sugared mint sea salt, gold dusted micro greens, and Black Garlic fondu.<br /><br />Black Garlic, Crunchy Vegetable and Sesame Noodle Salad -This salad makes a good light lunch for two people.<br /><br />Mushroom and Black Garlic Risotto -add extra flavor to your Risotto<br /><br />Creamy Cheese and Black Garlic Dip - Black Garlic flavored cream cheese?<br /><br />Scallops with Black Garlic and Chorizo - This is an ideal starter for two or a pre-dinner nibble. It is also excellent as a lunch, served with a lemon vinaigrette rocket salad.<br /><br />Lamb and Black Garlic Fajitas - These make an excellent lunchtime treat. Great for children! You can substitute the lamb for chicken or for a vegetarian version add different vegetables such as mange tout and baby corn.<br /><br />Fillet of beef with a Black Garlic Mushroom Duxelle served with a Black Garlic Port Wine sauce<br /><br />Black Garlic Stuffed Mushrooms - Exotic mixture of taste between black garlic and mushrooms<br /><br />Black Garlic Linguine - You have had a busy day; don't feel like cooking. Think Black Garlic! This dish is quick, easy and very tasty!<br /><br />I may have one of these for dinner tonight!  YUMMY!  I am a huge garlic fan and have even been teased "oh so you are having a little linquine with your garlic?" because I used a whole head of garlic.  However, I am not a fan of roasted garlic really or elephant garlic either.  My new favorite garlic is now Black Garlic!<br /><br />UPDATE 4/11  These have become one of my favorite foods.  They are sweet and taste incredible chopped up on top of margarita pizza!
