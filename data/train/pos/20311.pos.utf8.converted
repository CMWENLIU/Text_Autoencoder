I'm so glad I found the folks selling this chia seed. It's such a good deal that I can't imagine buying it from anyone else and I sure hope they continue to make it available at this price. Don't believe the hype that chia seed varies much in nutritional content -- I've done the research and according to Dr. Wayne Coates from the University of Arizona all the commercially available chia seed today is from a single genetic source. Dr. Coates wrote a book reviving interest in the value of this traditional food source and in making it available to more people. I am not affiliated with the company that sells this chia seed, and the reason I did this research is that I was recently told about a "miracle" product made from a specific variety of chia seed, and it was outrageously expensive ($30.00/pound). It is only available through "vendors" and I was told it was the only chia seed that is nutritionally beneficial, not like the black chia seed used for chia pets. Well, it's not true, folks. Like anything that's grown, chia seed can be affected by growing practices, soil, etc. But it's a plant that demands very little and normally grows on very lean soils. It also is not bothered by pests, so no pesticides are needed for its cultivation. It is, however, sometimes grown in rotation with other crops like corn and maize for which pesticides are used. For this reason, organic chia seed has not yet been available. Some companies are promising that they will make organic chia seed available soon. But for now -- chia seed is chia seed, and this is perfectly good chia seed at the best price I've found.
