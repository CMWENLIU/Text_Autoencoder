Last night my family tried the Patak Tikka Masala sauce.  Boy, that was good! Tonight, we tried the Patak Tandoori Paste-- and, yes, that was good, too!<br /><br />The paste is very easy to use.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I mixed 8 -10 tbsp of this paste with 6-7 tbsps of plain yogurt and marinated for several hours.  Then, I baked the chicken for about 1/2 hour and it's done!  It's rare when I serve a meal that everyone in my family likes, but I've now served 2 meals in a row that everyone in my family raved about!<br /><br />I served this with couscous and a salad.  Very quick, easy, and very very good!
