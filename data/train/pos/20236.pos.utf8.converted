These new flavors are awesome! I went back and bought several more canisters because the display said it was for a temporary time only. My teenaged boys even like them.  I went to buy more, and the store no longer has them!  I need to have a steady supply of these.  They are all refreshing and sugar-free, so no guilt!  I guess I might be stuck ordering on line from now on.  I can't believe more peeps aren't asking for these flavors to be permanent!
