I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there.  I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida.  I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon.  I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits.  They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine.  Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else.  We each have our own preferences.  I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of $10 to $100 a bottle.  And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano.  I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies.  I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly.  If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084.  By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better.  That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%.  Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store).  Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling.  Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons.  To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff.  Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption.  Cheers.
