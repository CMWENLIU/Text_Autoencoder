Different types of treats have different advantages.  Bits of raw or cooked meat are great as a "high value" reward during initial training or for training under distraction.  A softer, manufactured treat is good for rapid and involved work, when you don't want chewing to slow down the action.  And a dry, crunchy treat like these biscotti provide a wonderful, practical, general-purpose solution.  They don't need special storage and they don't go bad.  They are low-cal.  They are clean to handle.  They are easy to deal with during the winter, when wearing gloves.<br />Regarding the user photo posted, of fractured bits of biscotti, I'd say that based on my experience that problem was likely one of poor luck with the shipping.  As with any sort of dry grain food, some does end up damaged, much as is the case with breakfast cereal.  Each bag does end up with some crumbs at the bottom, even in the best case.  Personally, I've never felt ripped off by this, as the vast majority of the treats have been in good shape.  And the crumbs can be added to the dog's food, or mixed in with peanut butter for a treat toy, to add a little interest.
