I have an almost 11 month - lab weim mix - who is close to 100 lbs. When I got him he was on some high protein food from the feed store. I switched to purina puppy for large breed and he had loose stools. I then moved to wellness, pricey! and still loose stools...and ate a ton with ribs still showing. vet said it was fine but I felt like he was semi-starving. searched around on the net and saw this, saw it was wayyyy cheaper then wellness (and their bag is 5lb less) but got the same or better marks on the dog food rating website for being all natural. got it, dog loves it and his stools are much firmer. he still eats a ton (he is a large, active, growing puppy) but he has filled out - no more ribs showing than the bottom two slightly which is better than all of them. I will definitely keep buying this. I can't find it locally so just get it from amazon but with free shipping, its almost easier having it delivered to my door.
