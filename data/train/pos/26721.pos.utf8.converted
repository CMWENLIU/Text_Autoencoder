If you like low carb Brownies, these are top notch.  I've had several brands of low carb brownies over the years, so I have plenty to compare these against.  The Big Train chocolate chip cookies are top notch as well.<br /><br />Like all low carb desserts, just don't eat too many - or they'll tear your stomach up.
