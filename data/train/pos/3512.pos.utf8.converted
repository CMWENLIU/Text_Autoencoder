Upon lots of experimentation, we found Nestle Good Start Soy as the best formula for our baby boy. We used Good Start Soy so far. Very recently we upgraded to Good Start 2. No problems at all. The best time for this upgrade is when your baby is on first foods for a while. but not eating enough of it. Our pediatrician recommended frequent feedings. That works semi-successfully for the day-time with attention and mood problems. During night, especially before sleep-time, feeding of Good Start 2 is very effective to put him down for 6 hrs at least. (We have one very active baby). Good Start 2 has worked out as a very effective strategy to fill the nutrition gap.<br /><br />It is not very easy to find big cans and even small cans of Soy products in popular superstores and grocery chains. If you do, the price varies as much as $3-$5 per can from one place to the other. Amazon's 24 Oz. 6-pack is the best deal with free shipping. You pay about 84 cents per ounce. If you go for one size bigger 6-pack 25.6 Oz cans, you pay 93 cents per ounce.
