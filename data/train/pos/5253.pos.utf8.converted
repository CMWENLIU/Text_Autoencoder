I cycle quite a bit and these definitely keep me fueled. I love the taste, texture, and the organic ingredients. The texture is somewhat chewing and slick. These don't get that, stuck in my throat feeling, like some of the other chews, gels, and bars. My biggest complaint is that they are so good, I have to keep myself from eating more than I should.
