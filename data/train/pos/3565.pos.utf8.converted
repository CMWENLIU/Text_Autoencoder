This is the best granola I've ever found.  I hate to say that though because I don't want them to run out of stock and I'll have to wait longer for my next shipment!  Stays crunchy, never stale.  It's delicious!  And since I live in Oregon, I should know a good granola when I taste one.<br /><br />I disagree with another review saying it's very coconutty.  I'm not very fond of coconut and have never even noticed it.  I like this granola because it is somewhat plain and doesn't have any weird textures or dried fruit (which I am also not fond of).  I primarily use this granola to put in my vanilla yogurt.  It's tastes just like it should, like honey and nuts.
