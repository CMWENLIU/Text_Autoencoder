As an avid coffe drinker looking for new flavors and coffee that tastes great black - this is one of the best if not the best coffee I have ever had. The flavor is just enough without being overwhelming and does not turn bitter. It is wonderful by itself and will probably be delicious with cream and sugar.<br />Bought at a discount store I was so happy to find this on Amazon as I have become hopelessly addicted to this coffee.<br />Everyone even non-coffee drinkers tell me it smells like maple syrup and they love the aroma.<br />It is one of those coffees that just make you feel good.
