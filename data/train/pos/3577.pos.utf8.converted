I bought this for my husband because I don't like him using the pink packets, and this seemed a healthier alternative.  I bought this at Whole Foods, but I think I'll buy it from Amazon from now on because it's almost half the price.<br /><br />I tasted this before dumping it in his coffee, and it tastes wonderful.  One of the other reviewers mentioned a "cooling" sensation - it does taste like you're eating something cold, even though it's room temperature.  It's kind of like mint in that way, but not mint-flavored.  I put a little in my own coffee (usually I prefer coffee black, but I'm testing it for this review) and it didn't give the nasty aftertaste that "pink" (saccharine), "blue" (nutrisweet), or even "yellow" (splenda) gives.  I also don't have a headache, which I get from "yellow", but then I didn't put much in my coffee - maybe a teaspoonfull.<br /><br />I'm nervous about health issues, but since this is made from fermented cane sugar, I can't think of any health issues that this would have, as opposed to saccharine.  I looked it up in Wikipedia, and the article on "erythritol" is informative and nerve-calming.  You should read the article if you're curious, but apparently erythritol (which this product is) is safe, has almost no side effects (like gas or bloating) unless taken in HUGE quantities, and is even safe for your teeth.  It also mentions the "cooling effect".
