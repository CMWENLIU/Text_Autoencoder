I have been a vegan for about 3 years and have tried every bean I have found.  These are my favorite, and even my kids love them... they certainly don't like all beans.  To me, these beans have a pork and beans flavor, but without the pork.  The skins are fairly thin, so the beans might disintegrate more easily than other beans, which works well for bean dips or a refried bean recipe.
