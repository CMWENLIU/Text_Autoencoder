I have been baking anisette cookies for many years. This oil is the best product I have used for the true anise flavor of the cookies. I used to be able to get the oil easily, but in recent years haven't. I used almost every anise flavoring on the market. This is the real deal. The flavor stays with the cookies......it is the best!!!!
