It is very unfortunate that something finally IS amazingly helpful to human beings and people would try to squash its spread by creating false claims about it. The science on Himalayan salt is actually very clear...the mineral content of the Himalayan salt is extremely well balanced and there is absolutely no way that someone using Himalayan salt therapy would end up with an elevated level of fluoride. For those spreading these rumors, how about you also present some scientific research? Extensive studies on the benefits of salt therapy have been conducted in Poland and China, and the bulk of this research (mostly unknown in the US) supports the use of Himalayan salt. As for the location of where the salt comes from, the salt does come from Pakistan--but "Pakistan" is just a human-created boundary. This salt was created as the original primal sea began to evaporate--the salt crystals were formed simultaneously as the plate activity created the mountain ranges in that area. The salt crystals that resulted were therefore tucked up inside the mountains. So it's all in how humans choose to define their borders today whether it is from Pakistan or some other country...who cares where it actually comes from if it is safe and helpful? And that's really the bottom line for me...as someone using Himalayan salt for several years now, I have personally seen a huge benefit.<br /><br />The one way to make sure you are truly getting Himalayan salt, though, is to look for the light pink variety--because this light pink color comes from only one mine in the world! Hopefully the unscrupulous business people will not try to color rock salt, too!
