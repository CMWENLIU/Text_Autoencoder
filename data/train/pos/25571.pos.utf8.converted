I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.  I like several of the extra bold k-cups, especially Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and Midnight Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop.  But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.
