I never thought I'd go thru a pound of stevia, but here I am, just ordered my second pound, after taking about 2 years to go thru the first. I love having such a bounty of good quality stevia available, and it is sooooo much cheaper than any other way I've found to buy it. I put some in baggies for friends to try out to see if they like stevia - it's so cheap, it's no great expense if they don't like it.<br /><br />This stevia is great quality, unlike some of the "green"-ish cheaper stevia. Also know that this is the uncut pure stevia - oftentimes companies will mix in some maltodextrose or other mixer to make it less strong and more comparable to sugar in volume. Because stevia is VERY strong - serving size is 1/32 teaspoon, which equals one teaspoon of sugar. On the Now container, they say that it contains 16,214 servings - that cracks me up.<br /><br />I used to buy it at Whole Foods in bulk at $150/pound, and I'd just take the smallest little amount. Then they discountinued selling it bulk because it was so expensive that when moisture got in and ruined it, it was just too expensive for them. So I asked my Whole Foods buddy who the supplier was of their bulk stevia, and he told me it was Now.<br /><br />I use stevia in my tea, my kefir, and in some recipes as a sugar replacement. Often I'll cut the sugar by 1/4 and add in a small amount of stevia. If it is all stevia, it doesn't always taste that great, but when it is blended, one can hardly tell.<br /><br />I also use lakanto, which is better for baking. But unlike stevia, it is not inexpensive. The only place I know to buy it is thru Body Ecology (which is my preferred eating system BTW)[...]
