This is one of my favorite chocolate from Kinder Bueno. It use to be my top favorite, but there is also the Happy Hippo from Kinder which is so very good. Also a must try.<br /><br />Kinder Bueno: each stick has four chambers, the outside is a wafer type material, while the inside is filled with hazelnut chocolate. There are 2 sticks per package. It is addictive. Some people say that one stick is enough. But there are days when I can eat 3 or 4 of them.<br /><br />I absolutely love hazelnut chocolate. When I'm dieting, this is one of the few chocolates that I would eat.. since I believe in saving calories for the best.
