Senseo recently released several flavored varieties. Having always been partial to hazelnut coffee and being the happy owner of a Senseo coffee maker, I just had to give this new flavor a try. Well, let me tell you... I'm hooked! There is so much rich flavor in this coffee it's hard to believe the drink is calorie-free. It has the complex, subtle, thick texture and flavor of a fat- and carb-laden drink. If you've been worrying lately about the effects of your daily Caramel Macchiato on your waistline (not to mention your wallet) you have to give this coffee a try. It's wonderful and guilt-free! The pods are a little more expensive than regular varieties (the package is the same price but there are slightly fewer pods per bag) but boy is it worth that little extra!<br /><br />This flavor was all I needed to decide me to buy a second Senseo machine for my office. It's very quiet and doesn't bother my cube neighbors, and it's already paid for itself because I no longer spend a fortune at the coffee shop for mediocre coffee: I have my "candy bar in a cup" (to quote Paula) right at my desk.<br /><br />Senseo has a winner with this one... Give it a try!
