I first had instant whole dried milk when doing missionary work down in Honduras, CA. That dried milk happened to be either KLIM, a Borden product, or Nido, a Nestle's product. For all you dyslectics, you probably picked up on KLIM is just MILK spelled backwards......LOL.  I have had whole milk in the UK and even their full cream Jersey, gold topped, milk and thought that might be the best milk ever.  Matter of fact, I grew up in Houston, Texas and raised on a local dairy milk, Westmoreland.  During those days the very best milk was the one that was the creamiest and Westmoreland guaranteed that, as all their milk was from Jersey herds.  Peak easily surpasses that great "fresh" milk.  Not only does Peak taste great, not dried/instant, but it has the greatest milk taste ever.  I dare say that as long as I can order this stuff, I will never buy "fresh" milk ever again.  I am no longer a frequent milk consumer, but I do use it to make yogurt occasionally, on cereal, or even drink it, but rarely buy it as it typically goes bad/off before it is consumed.  Frankly, I do use it every morning in my coffee or tea.  I would recommend that it is made in a blender, chilled overnight, and then consumed.  I also have used half Peak and Sanalac powder to achieve a lower fat, but full flavored milk.
