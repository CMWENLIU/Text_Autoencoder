My grandma made the best poppy seed buns when I was a kid, but in the USA I was forced to buy the poppy seeds in a tiny glass jar for $4.98 and they were always stale. Finally I found some for a reasonable price and good quality to boot. Thanks to Bob's Red Mill for making it possible again to share grandma's recipe with my kids.
