I became addicted to Knudsen's Tangerine spritzer... until I tried this Ginger Ale spritzer.  Now it's my main drink, besides coffee or tea or water.  I happen to love the flavor of fresh ginger.  In the winter, I kick a cold using boiling water, fresh ginger, honey & lemon.  Mmmmm.<br /><br />This drink contains 65% juice.  Ingredients are:  Sparkling filtered water, brewed ginger root, white grape and apple juice concentrates, and ginger extract.
