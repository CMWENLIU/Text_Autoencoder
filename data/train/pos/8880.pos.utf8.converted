I am a big fan of star anise.  I use it mostly in sauces and gravies, and I have always loved the flavor it brings.  Normally I buy it in an "upscale" grocery store across town, since the standard grocery stores near me do not carry it.  I have always been happy with the product I have been using, but I figured I'd poke around online to see what I could find.  Normally, it costs me $4.99 for a 0.60 ounce jar.  The Frontier Star Anise cost me less than $14.00 for a 16 ounce bag, so I figured I'd give it a try.  I didn't realize how much 16 ounces of star anise would be!  There really is a bunch of stars in this bag, and most of them are whole stars.  The truly surprising part about it for me was the quality.  Each star is easily twice the size of the stars I have been using, and now I realize my normal stock is actually shriveled up.  These are huge and very fragrant...I actually need to change my recipes to use less or else they will be overpowering.  Now, I don't know for sure if I'll be able to use all 16 ounces of them before they need to be replaced, but for the price (at this price, I would only get 1.8 ounces of shriveled up stars from my normal supplier) and the difference in quality, I would definitely recommend these and I will most certainly purhcase them again.
