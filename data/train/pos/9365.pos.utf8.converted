I'm a big fan of the Hodgson Mill Flax Brownie mix and this seemed interesting so I gave it a go. I absolutely love it! I made mine with almond milk, egg white and 2 tbsp of natural applesauce rather than butter and it came out fantastic. This tastes like *real* gingerbread. Not overly sweet and with the perfect amount of spice. I was impressed by the texture also. Usually when I substitute applesauce in baked goods, the texture tends to get a little too sticky and heavy, but the gingerbread came out very fluffy and perfectly moist! I also added raisins which was a nice addition. I baked mine in an 8" x 8" baking dish and cut it into 8 decent sized servings which came to about 215 calories each (and is virtually fat free.) Perfect with a cup of coffee for a quick, healthy and filling breakfast. Will absolutely buy again! Who says healthy can't taste good?
