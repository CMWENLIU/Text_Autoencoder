I am a connoisseur of Horchata and as such I feel it is my duty to praise the authenticity of this particular brand of ambrosia.<br />It's actually quite hard to provide a scale of goodness because of the diversity of palates.<br />But if your looking to make Horchata without having to soak the rice and blend it, this is it.<br /><br />But I will add, look for it in your local Latin-foods mart, as the shipping from this seller is outrageous.
