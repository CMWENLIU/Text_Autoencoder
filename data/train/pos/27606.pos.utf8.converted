I drank this several times a day leading up to the delivery of my first baby. Not sure if it's the tea, luck, genetics or a combination of the three, but I had an all-natural delivery with only 30 minutes of pushing and no tearing! It was a text-book perfect birth. I'll drink lots of the tea for the next baby. Why not?<br /><br />UPDATE: Drank this stuff again during my 2nd pregnancy. Baby was out in 3 pushes. The midwives said I make delivery look easy. Again, not sure if the tea gets the credit, but I'd drink it again for my 3rd pregnancy.
