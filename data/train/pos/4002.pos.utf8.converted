I like strong coffee. I should get that out of the way first, because I know not everyone appreciates deep, dark coffees. Aside from Dark Magic and Mahogany, this is better than almost every k-cup I have tasted.<br /><br />I may be in the minority here, but I actually prefer the filter-like bottom of these pods over the k-cup for four reasons:<br /><br />1. I've noticed no difference in freshness compared to the Nitrogen-filled, sealed k-cup.<br /><br />2. I don't have to waste filtered water and keep a paper clip handy to unclog the coffee grounds that get stuck in the needle of the Keurig because of pressure and temperature differences between where the k-cup was sealed and where it gets punctured.<br /><br />3. When brewing with these One Cups, the kitchen smells of freshly brewed coffee, an aroma I had missed when using k-cups.<br /><br />4. (And I realize not everyone will feel this way) - warning, nothing but complaining ahead:<br /><br />I had begun resenting being beholden to Keurig. I dutifully sent them money each month for k-cups and each month they found new ways to make me regret it. (Not shipping the k-cups out at all, allowing my package to sit in their warehouse for a week while they assured me it was on its way, consistently being out of stock of the k-cups I wanted and most of all, whenever I called or wrote to point out a problem, issuing a coupon code for free k-cups but then repeating the problem the following month. Their customer service dept is structured in a way that they repeat problems and never resolve anything.)
