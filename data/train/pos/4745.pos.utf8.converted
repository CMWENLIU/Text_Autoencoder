Could a bar be any more tasty?  These are wonderful.  I love the fruit/nut combo.  I'll open a package a munch on a little bit at a time just to saver the taste.  So far, I've had the lemon, cherry, ginger snap, and a chocolate one and these.  I love every one except not a big fan of the chocolate one.  And usually chocolate anything is my favorite. I'm very glad I found these.
