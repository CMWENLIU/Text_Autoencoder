This product works great to give you that initial push you sometimes need to get moving without any jittery feelings or crash later.  I only use 1/2 of the bottle at a time and the no refrideration needed makes it handy to keep in the car and drink on the way home from work when you have a lot you need to accomplish at home.  Love it!
