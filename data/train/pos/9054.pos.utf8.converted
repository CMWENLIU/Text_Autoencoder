Along with pumping often, this tea has helped to increase my supply after returning to work.  I tried fenugreek tablets, took the maximum dosage (12 tablets daily for the brand I purchased), and it did nothing.  Lactation consultant said that for some people, the combination of herbs found in the tea is more effective than a single herb.<br /><br />I had a very hard time w/ my supply when I returned to work, but am determined to continue nursing.  Here is what has helped:<br />1. Drinking this tea.  I need to drink 4-5 cups a day for it to be effective.  I just boil a pot of water in the morning, steep 5 bags for 15 minutes, and then drink the prepared tea throughout the day.<br />2. Pumping at least 3 times per day, either instead of nursing or 30 minutes after nursing.<br />3. Bringing pictures of the baby to work (not sure why this helped... maybe hormones?).<br /><br />Good luck!
