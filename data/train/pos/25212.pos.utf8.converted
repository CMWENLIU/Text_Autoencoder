I became interested in ACV when a coworker mentioned it as an effective weight loss aid.  While doing some online research, I read that it can be beneficial for scalp conditions.  Over the past few weeks, my scalp has started itching and flaking like crazy--to the point of insanity.  I was scratching so much that I left scabs, and I've hated the way it looks.  I have chocolate brown hair so the flakes are very obvious.  Prescription shampoo (Nizoral) helped some but didn't completely cure it.<br /><br />So I tried some undiluted ACV as a post-shampoo hair rinse--and it worked great!  I've used it three times now, and dandruff is about 98% gone.  The itching has COMPLETELY cleared up.  I couldn't be happier. My method is: Pantene shampoo, rinse, full-strength ACV, rinse.  My hair is super soft and shiny afterwards.  I read that some folks dilute the ACV first, others use ACV as a shampoo (supposedly works well for oily hair), and others don't rinse the ACV out of their hair at all.  Users will probably want to experiment to find out whats going to work best for them.<br /><br />The only drawbacks:  If you have any tender areas (cuts, scraps, scabs) the ACV burns a bit.  If you get any ACV in your eyes, the ACV burns a LOT.  The smell is horrible but it disappears when your hair dries.  Be sure your hair is dry before you leave for a hot date or meet with wealthy clients, because the smell will be noticible until your hair dries.<br /><br />I've experimented with taking ACV orally as well to get the health benefits and possible weight loss benefits.  The problem with this is that ACV tastes TERRIBLE, even stirred into a glass of water, even with a spoonful of honey.  Seriously, its terrible.  It smells like that brown vinegar that British people put on fried fish, so it probably tastes similar.  I wasn't expecting this, so I was disapointed.  I guess I thought I would like ACV because I adore red wine vinegar and use it often on salads and sandwiches, but ACV is nothing like red wine vinegar.  I can't stress enough how bad it tastes, and I'm not a picky eater at all--I like pretty much everything...hence the weight problem.<br /><br />I have discovered that I can tolerate a tablespoon of ACV in an 8 oz glass of grape juice.  I've always loved Welch's Concord grape so this is what I use.  I did not care for ACV in a glass of orange juice, however.  Its tolerable but grape juice masks the taste of ACV better.  For all I know, the grape juice is interfering with the ACV absorption, or killing the ACV nutrients, or whatever.  But this is the only way (so far) I can get it down.<br /><br />The good news is that my grape ACV cocktail has a slight appetite-suppressive effect.  Its subtle, but I do fill up a little faster if I drink it just before a meal.  Since there are calories in a glass of grape juice, I may or may not be getting any weight-loss benefits.  Time will tell.  Drinking it provides lots of other health benefits, so even if I don't lose weight my efforts won't be wasted.<br /><br />I got mine at my local GNC store, where I paid $5.99 for my 32 oz bottle.  Looks like I paid just a little more than if I gotten it from Amazon.  Thats ok though, it was worth every penny.  I will keep using it, so I'll be watching for sales online and in stores.<br /><br />Bottom line:  ACV is a great product for dandruff sufferers.  The jury is still out on using for weight control.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Drinking the ACV began to irritate my mouth and throat, so I stopped after a week or two.  However, I'm still finding it useful for dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) control.  The dandruff problem will sometimes suddenly flare up, and ACV rinses are useful during these times.  I've recently read that masks of warm olive oil are also helpful for this problem, and I tried it today with great results.  The itching subsided almost completely.  I think it'll be useful in the future to use warm olive oil scalp masks once after every few days of ACV rinses because the ACV is quite drying.  Olive oil restores softness and shine along with killing the itch.  Wash the oil out in your kitchen sink to keep your tub from getting oily.  Good luck, fellow dandruff sufferers.
