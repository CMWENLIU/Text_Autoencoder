My dog's love this flavor of dog food, and I am most comfortable feeding them this one because fish oils are so much healthier than animal fats. There is some fish smell to the food, of course, but not too bad. If you have a sealed food container, which you should anyway for a large bag like this, it will keep the smell inside. This product is also grain free and is overall full of great ingredients. This is a company than can be trusted.  Go to [&#8230;] for more information about this food.  Amazon has the best price I've seen for this, especially when you consider the price for subscribe and save.
