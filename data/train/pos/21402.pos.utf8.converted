Our dog was having trouble with grocery store purchased dog food. She would eat it and a half hour to four hours later she would throw it up. This cycle went on for months. We took her to the vet and they ran all sorts of tests and everything came back negative. So the vet's solution was to put her on a stomach medicine...for the rest of her life!<br /><br />Not wanting to put her on drugs for the rest of her life (she's only 2 yrs old) I started doing some research and discovered that many dogs have a food allergy to grains, especially corn and corn by-products which are in just about every commercial dog food.<br /><br />Then I stumbled onto grain-free dog foods and this led me to Orijen. All I can say is "Wow!"<br />I tried a small sample bag first (purchased at a store an hour away) and she loved it. Best of all, it stayed down.<br />Then I bought a larger bag. Yes, it's more expensive but she eats a smaller quantity so overall each month I'm not spending any more money on dog food.<br /><br />In the 6 months we have had her on Orijen Adult Formula, she has not thrown up her food at all. Not once! (She also likes the Orijen fish formula too)  I find that simply amazing. Her coat is shiny and glossy now and she clearly feels good!<br /><br />The only negative for us is that it is not available locally and I have to drive an hour to a larger city to buy it. Occasionally I have ordered it online. But we have a new pet store opening up here soon that will be carrying it so that will resolve our "where to buy it" issue.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that VETS also suggest a grain-free diet for dogs having stomach/digestive issues instead of just automatically reaching for the Rx pad. My two cents.
