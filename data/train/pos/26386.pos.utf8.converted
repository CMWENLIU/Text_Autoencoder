Ahhh... Two delicate fluffy layers of golden cake filled with a creamy, white, heavenly nectar sent down from above, all enclosed by a thin shell of frosting to lock in all of the unforgettable flavors.<br /><br />Let me tell you a little story about me and zebra cakes.  I began a job as an intern about 6 months ago.  As a typical intern, I was forced to do some undesirable jobs throughout my day.  These undesirable tasks became quite beneficial to my taste buds the day I stood up and said "I will complete those necessary jobs for one box of Zebra Cakes."  Within 2 weeks I had an entire desk drawer full of Zebra Cakes. BOOM...<br /><br />Heart shaped Valentine's Day edition, Christmas Tree edition, or the standard Zebra stripes, no matter what the occasion it's always Cake-30 time.
