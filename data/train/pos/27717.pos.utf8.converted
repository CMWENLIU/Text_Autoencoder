Fantastic product.  Tried the All Natural for the first time.  Although it doesn't fill the house with that fantastic intense Golden Waffle smell like the regular does, it tastes just as good (if not better).  One catch is to let the batter sit a bit before using it.  The first couple waffles came out a bit heavy and not as crisp, but after the batter had sat a bit it came out very light and crispy as you would expect.  This will be the one I buy from now on.  Price is a bit less than what I pay locally and saves me time and money since I don't have to make special long trips to the only store that has it in our area.  Glad Amazon has this.  Next I will be trying some of the other flavors.  By the way, try adding a tablespoon of this to your favorite cake, muffin,  or bread recipes.  You will be amazed what it does for them.
