I found Earth's Best while shopping at Target and was thrilled to find USDA certified organic baby food. My son loves the apples and pears, the bananas are a little tart but I just add a little rice cereal and it's fine. I love that Amazon.com offers subscribe and save for Earth's Best and at a cheaper price than Target or Babies "R" Us. Great packing and fast delivery!
