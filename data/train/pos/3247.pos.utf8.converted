This is my favorite tea, bar none. I have gone through teas over the years - Stash's Irish Breakfast was my favorite for a long time...  Typhoo, Twinings English Breakfast. Then I stumbled across Ahmad English Afternoon Tea on a remote island in the Pacific being sold by a Pipe and Drum Corps as a fundraiser. I was immediately hooked on that and when I couldn't get that tea from them anymore, I went hunting online. That's when I came across Ahmad's English Tea No.1. It has become my everyday tea. I love the smoothness that accompanies the full body of this tea. I still have English Afternoon Tea on occasion - but this is my fave! I drink it straight hot and cold, with milk and with milk and sugar.
