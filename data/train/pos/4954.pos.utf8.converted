I had concerns that Royal Canin had changed the Bulldog formula too much.  However, after comparing the old ingredients to the new ingredients I decided to stay with Royal Canin.  I gradually switched to the new food the switch was successful.  My bulldog did have a day or two of gas during the switch, but that is no longer a problem.  Will purchase again because my bulldog's coat looks beautiful and she loves the food.  I also use softened Royal Canin as training treats during our walks.
