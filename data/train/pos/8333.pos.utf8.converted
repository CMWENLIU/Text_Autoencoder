These things actually taste like they are described. My girl was so fascinated at the idea of being able to eat candy like Harry Potter ate that she tried the vomit, earwax and soap flavors and giggled her way through every disgusting moment of the assault on her poor little taste buds. She LOVED them. But I guess you need to be a true Potterhead to really appreciate the things. Ugh!!
