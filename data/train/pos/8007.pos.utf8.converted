Please note that the product image is different from the product packaging you will receive; they're the same, just that the present proper name is "Mori-Nu Silken Tofu Extra Firm," not "Silken Style." But it doesn't matter, as this is one of the most convenient products for your pantry if you enjoy tofu in your miso or stir fry. This product, according to the manufacturer, has a recommended shelf life of one year from date of manufacture. I ordered and received this 12-pack in April 2009 and received boxes marked with a late October 2009 expiration, which is fine (this is one of my concerns about ordering food from Amazon; my local Publix supermarket can't even rotate its stock properly [found a dozen packages of out-of-date gourmet Italian cheese there today - but i digress]).<br /><br />This is great product. A real time-saver, and considering that I'm the only one in the house that will eat tofu, saves me money, as there is less waste.
