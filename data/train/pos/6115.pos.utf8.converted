This green drink, (Raw reserve) is the best tasting green drink I have ever tried, and over the years, I have tried several. I add fresh lemon juice and cayenne pepper to it and I actually enjoy the taste.<br /><br /> But here is the best part: I recently bought Ph strips to test my acidity (or alkalinity) level at various points based on what I ate. So yesterday evening I had two glasses of red wine. I decided to test my ph (via urine)afterward and I was as acidic as you can be, not good. So I made myself a big glass of Raw Reserve (with lemon and cayenne)and then later tested my ph again to see if it got better. I was in the "ideal" range, in fact at the top of the alkaline range. This drink was the only thing that I ate/drank after the wine and it corrected the acidity that the wine had created in my body. I was very happy about that. Moral to the story--I will never be without this green drink. Other moral to the story: when I partake in red wine (which can be both beneficial and detrimental to one's health)I will mitigate the potential damage with Raw Reserve. This approach can apply to eating animal protein or other acidic foods: if you must eat the stuff, wash it down with Raw Reserve!
