I was at my daughter's last evening, busy I was on the barbecue grill when she walks out with a small dish she called an appetizer.  One bite and my taste buds screamed "I'm in Heaven".  Okay, kidding aside, but I thought she had brought me leftovers from some 5-star Indian Restaurant.  This curry paste done with tender chicken is heaven.  I am ordering it today.
