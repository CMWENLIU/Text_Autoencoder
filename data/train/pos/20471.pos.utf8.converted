I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but I do love chocolate. I have even been known to nibble unsweetened baking chocolate on occasion (when desperate), but this is WAAAAY better. I'm a little baffled that some people think this is so bitter. I suppose it has a slightly bitter flavor, but it's so creamy and smooth and delicious that who cares! Cappuccino is bitter too, but does that make it unpalatable? I actually find this much mellower tasting than American dark chocolates of 60-80% cocoa which tend to have an acrid, sour after-taste. Granted this is not very sweet AT ALL, so if you need an intense sugar fix, this won't do it. Personally I find that more than a touch of sugar gets in the way of the cocoa flavor anyway.  For my taste, this chocolate is extremely fulfilling,  not to mention that it is probably borderline good for you :)<br /><br />By the way, another great one (though slightly inferior) is Chocolove 77% (Belgian).
