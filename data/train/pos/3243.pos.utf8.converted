I ordered these for my 3 dogs because the ingredient list had nothing I wouldn't eat listed. My dogs absolutely love them. Not only are they good for your dog, but they're made in the USA!  There is no melamine in wheat gluten added to up the protein content.  The first ingredient on the list is Salmon.  AAA+ for Plato treats.
