Great product. Great packaging.<br /><br />I ordered this from amazon a last week and got it two days later, I have prime. It was well packaged. I also have to say I loved the packaging from Brooklyn Bean. I like that the Cardboard box isn't flimsy. I also like the opening, makes it easy to move around without worrying about all the k-cups falling out and having to pick them all up. I love the flavor and think this is a great coffee for my tastes, I like bold and extra dark roasts. The thing I like the best is that the packages come in 36 packs instead of 12-24 packs. This way I only have to order 1 time every 2-3 weeks instead of every other week. Great product. Can't wait for more flavors.
