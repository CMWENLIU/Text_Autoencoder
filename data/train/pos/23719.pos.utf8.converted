For those of us used to Tuna in the can this product seems very unique and certainly economical if you have several people in your family.<br />What you are getting is a single solid slab of tuna measuring approx. 6 inches wide 9 inches long and 1 inch thick. 2 whole pounds of Wild Planet's low mercury wild caught tuna. As you can see from the reviews of their canned Tuna this really is a very delicious Tuna and they cook it right in the aluminum type pouch that it comes in. When you open the pouch the juices from that cooking are evident. I know many of you probably have bought fresh Tuna in the fish market and find canned Tuna of no comparison. I, myself have only done that once and it turned out very dry and leathery when broiled. I don't know how to compare a Tuna loin like this to a fresh cooked piece of Tuna but if you don't have access to fresh tuna or just want a high quality Tuna for sandwiches or other dishes I truly don't know where you could find a higher quality and certainly more economical piece of fish. This truly is a novel idea whose time has come. Taking a large, fresh piece of fish and putting it in a sealed pouch and cooking it. It is the next best thing to fresh fish, especially when your favorite fish is not in season or available frozen.<br />I wish someone would package Sockeye Salmon like this. The only ingredients in this product are Tuna and sea salt. None of the extenders etc.. in commercial store bought Tuna. Now, Wild Planet's new can's of Tuna are 5 ounces, so you would have to buy 6 1/3 cans to equal this 2 lb. pouch. A cost of $27.00 verses $16.00. So you can see it certainly is a better bargin. The only caveat to ordering this product in such a large size is that once you open it you only have x amount of days to eat it. No problem for a family of 3 or 4 but if it is just one person it may prove to be a bit to much when all you want is one Tuna sandwich, but, I have found that by eating a little each day I can finish a package in 4 days just by having a piece once a day. It's a great way to get some extra protein and omega 3's and I really look forward to having it because it tastes so good. I hope this was helpful.
