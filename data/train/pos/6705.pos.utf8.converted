This is about the third kit I have grown. The Hantana bag kit comes with everything you need, except the water, about 2 cups of used coffee grounds and a small amount of hydrogen peroxide. The directions are clear and really very simple. Mix the contents as per instructions, seal the bag. Be patient. A white mycleeium will start to form in about 7 to 14 days. It will continue to grow through out the bag. Again follow directions by cutting an X in the bag, fold back the plastic(tape it out of the way) and spray/mist the opening every day, per directions. Soon small pinheads will form, then it will grow more quickly. Amazing to watch how fast they grow. Your kids or grandkids will love the project. The best part of all is cutting the flush off and eating the mushrooms. They are delecious and you can't get them fresher. The flavor and texture are wonderful. After the first flush, let the bag rest for a few days and start the process (cut X and spray) on the opposite side. After the second flush, I broke the mycellium apart and put it in the compost with some Oak tree shavings/sawdust/chips and began to water it about twice a week. I have picked two flushes in the past two months. Outstanding, and I believe there will be more.<br />March 2nd, 2012-It has been almost a month since I wrote the review. Today I noticed two seperate flushes beginning in the compost. That makes 2 from the grow bag and 4 (so far) from the compost. I will order more soon. The folks at The Imaginary Farmer add a personal touch with their helpful costomer service. My questions by email have been answered promptly.
