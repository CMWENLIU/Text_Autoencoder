Wow! A can of these cost me over five dollars at the store, but I had to try them out.  What you get here is a can of sardines that are so slim that it takes two layers of them to fill the can.  I suppose that means a greater skin-to-meat ratio and even more flavor since the flavor of a sardine tends to be in the skin.<br /><br />Are two layers better than one?  Maybe slightly.  You get most of the small sardine in olive oil flavor with the one layer variety, but it you want to reach for that next level in sardine delicacy and flavor, here they are!
