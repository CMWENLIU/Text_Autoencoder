My bag of flops was quite varied. I was afraid of a pound of pina colada and nutmeg or something, but I got a good combination of all sorts.<br /><br />I thought these would mostly be minor defects, misprintings, that sort of thing. There are some freakishly huge jellybelly monsters in there though: five or six ugly mutants all fused into a sugar bomb you can barely get in your mouth, or weird distorted oddball shapes. Some of the colors also seem...not right.<br /><br />Once you start chewing you can't tell any of this of course, which is why this is such a good bargain.
