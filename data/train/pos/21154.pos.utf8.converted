I hesitated to purchase this "soursop" juice, since the name suggested a sour taste, but after trying a juice box, I was pleasantly surprised; it's not sour at all!  The closest I can come to describing the taste is pear juice.  The delivery was very punctual and although the juice is kind of pricey it is delicious and hopefully healthy too.
