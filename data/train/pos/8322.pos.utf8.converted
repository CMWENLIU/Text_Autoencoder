Of all the brands of shirataki, I prefer Matsuda.  I use the flat noodles, the thin, the bundled "dumpling" type, and the cubed.  Matsuda noodles are packed in a sealed tray, which is then sealed within another wrap. As a result, I think they are the freshes and the least "fishy" of the shirataki brands.<br /><br />The secret of enjoying these noodles is in the preparation.  While water comes to a boil, I open and rinse the noodles under cold running water; place the drained noodles along with some frozen vegetables in a Pyrex quart measure; the cover the noodles and vegetables with boiling water and let them sit while I prepare a protein.  I drain the noodles and vegetables and add them to the protein in a pot or skillet, season, and cook on low heat so the flavors come together.  The noodles, of course, simply absorb the flavors they are cooked with.  Any form of Matsuda noodles can be used the same way.  In cold weather I combine them with soup, etc.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this brand, and think you really don't like shirataki noodles, give Matsuda noodles a try.  I buy them 10 or more packages at a time and just keep them in the frig.  They are easy to use and really help with weight loss.
