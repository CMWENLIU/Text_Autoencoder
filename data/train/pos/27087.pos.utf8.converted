I have tried several of the Quinoa brand products and they have all been great.<br /><br />The instructions on all of their types of pasta that I have tried all say to boil the pasta from 4-6 minutes. I haven't gambled with over-cooking this pasta, though I know other gluten-free pastas will disintegrate if you over-cook.
