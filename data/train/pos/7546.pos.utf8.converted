I've tried all different types of martinis and finally settled on the ICE COLD Grey Goose dirty martini as the best of them all.  I then went in search of the best way to make them and finally stumbled across Dirty Sue.  The other reviews are right - Dirty Sue is just the right blend.  The perfect ingredient for a perfect dirty martini.  I highly recommend it.  In fact, writing about it has made me thirsty.  I'm going to go make one right now!
