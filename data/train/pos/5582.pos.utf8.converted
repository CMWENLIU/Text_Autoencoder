I inadvertently stumbled on to these chips while looking to purchase Avocado oil and I'm so glad I did.  Most companies label their potato ships as "Natural" which is bunch of hooey - and even if they actually start with truly natural ingredients - most oils become damaged when heated and Avocado oil has one the highest smoke points when it comes to oils.<br /><br />They taste GREAT - I only wish they came in larger bags and:<br /><br />AMAZON PLEASE PUT THESE ON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE!  The olive oil version is so I don't know why these aren't.
