Quinoa is one of the healthiest grains you can eat - and one of the most delicious!  It cooks in less than 15 minutes, so you can make a fast dinner using it.  And how delicious it is!  Mmmmmmm!!!!  Softer than rice, it has a slightly sweet and nutty taste.  My favorite recipe is to cook it with a small onion, a tablespoon of butter, and a half cube of vegetarian boullion (or a half-teaspoon if using powdered boullion or fresh refrigerated type).  Bring the water to a boil, add the onion, butter, let boil for a minute.  Then add the quinoa.  Bring to boil again.  Add the bullion, and turn down to a low simmer for 10 - 15 minutes, and there you go!  A fantastic grain that leaves you feeling light and energetic.  As for Bob's products, they are always excellent.  Amazon's price is very good, especially if you live in a small town or out in the country, where it may be hard to get organic and specialty items like Bob's Quinoa.
