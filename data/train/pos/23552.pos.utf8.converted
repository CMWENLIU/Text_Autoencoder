Best popcorn oil I've used.  Pop your corn in this, add Flavacol brand salt afterwards (it can be found from other sellers on Amazon or directly from Wabash Valley Farms' website), then add a bit of the "Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping" which WBF also sells here, and your popcorn will be basically identical to what you get at a movie theater.
