IZZE Grapefruit is great for those who think regular grapefruit juice is too acidic or overpowering. This blend is just perfect -- a bit of sparkling water with the grapefruit juice and not much else. This allows for a refreshing taste, but make sure it is cold. Given that I'm not much of a carbonated soda drinker, this isn't a replacement for a can of Sprite. Rather, it's just another beverage in my arsenal to replace my other daily juices if I don't want to go crazy on the calories.
