I love this popcorn, it's tasty and crunchy and it's my favorite so far. Blue popcorns seem to have more flavor than yellow or white. I think the selling point of this type is that because the kernels are small the hulls shatter when it pops ("hullless"), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. It's not going to be completely hullless but compared to regular large yellow popcorn the hulls are pretty much gone. The resulting popped corn is smaller than you may be used to, though. Try it, it's good!
