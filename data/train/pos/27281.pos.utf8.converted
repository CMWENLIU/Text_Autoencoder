My dog loves this food and all other flavors of the freeze dried Stella and Chewy's.  He would never eat the frozen patties, but for five or six months I've been buying these freeze dried patties and it has worked out great.  I just wish that they had larger bags, like three pound bags, to make this more affordable for people with large active dogs, like mine.  I wish I could make it his total diet, but that would cost me about $400 or more a month to do that, and I'm sort of poor.  I buy it in bulk from somone who advertises on amazon for about $21 per bag when I buy six large bags or more + a coupon.<br /><br />This is great raw food.<br /><br />This is what vet's should be selling.  Not Science Diet.
