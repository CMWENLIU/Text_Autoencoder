love this stuff.  i can tell a difference if i dont take it. quality is exceptional. i cannot say enough great things about bob's red mill products. great in smoothies, mixed with yogurt, salad. bob's flaxseed, lecithin, sunflower and pumpkin seeds make a great dressing for salads, mixed with some olive oil and garlic. diagnosed w/ a metabolic disorder affecting thyroid and adrenal glands, endocrine system, i'm re-evaluating life. simplify and back to basics. bob's red mill products fit into getting healthy. they are such high quality products. and the price is wonderful. thank you amazon and bob's red mill. happy, healthy new year !!
