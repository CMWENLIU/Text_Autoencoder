I am officially a pop head. Not only is the the hands down best chip I've ever had the people who work for the POP CHIP brand are super cool. I emailed them to tell them how much I loved the chips and they sent me a hand written thank you note and a free sample of all their flavors. Now that's how American Business should be run. All these companies with AWFUL customer service should take notes from them. Their small gesture just made a customer for LIFE.
