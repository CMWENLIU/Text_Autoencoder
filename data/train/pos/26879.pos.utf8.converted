When I went to Barbados and discovered these rum cakes I never thought I'd eat them again unless I went back to Barbados.<br />These are the best rum cakes I have ever had (and I am Caribbean.)<br />They taste great and are a wonderful gift at Christmas for co-workers, people who drop by, and neighbors. I even gave one to the maintenance person who came to fix my oven the day before Christmas.<br />Do yourself a favor, order a lot and keep them around. I will warn you now...it is hard not to eat them yourself.
