Even though I just did a review for Barry Farm, which is a highly reputable supplier, for their INSTANT non-fat dry milk powder... I ACTUALLY prefer the NON-instant dry milk powder.<br /><br />One reviewer sought for their ingredient list. I pointed out that the ingredient list IS actually (the label) on the package; the product is simply dry milk powder (whether instant, as in that case, or non-instant in this one).<br /><br />I added: The fact these powders taste sweet may also be a very good indication they products are FRESH. Since any dry milk only has a 6-month shelf life, you seldom want to purchase large quantities. Only buy quantities you will use within 6 months. Whereas, any classic off-taste people dislike about powdered milk is when the dry milk is old.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated she makes superior YOGURT with non-instant powdered milk, which I do too.<br /><br />(Tips & Techniques...)<br /><br />For any who wish for information how to reconstitute this product.<br />Combining 2 1/2 Tbsp NON-instant powder with 1 cup water = 1 cup milk (should be correct).<br /><br />The easiest way to blend, is with an immersion blender. Amazon offers one by Cuisinart, at an affordable price see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G3JRO">Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk and Chopper Attachments</a>.<br /><br />I wish to add that I also make Better Baking Buttermilk (aka: BBB) with non-instant powdered milk, to make much better breads!
