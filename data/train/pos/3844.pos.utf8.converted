Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Xanthan Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />Xanthan Gum is used to modify the viscosity of liquids, on a very low scale (typically 1/3 tsp per 1 gallon). Because of the difficulty in combining Xanthan Gum to a liquid evenly, you should mix this into your liquid very slowly, in a blender at full speed, and it should be one of your steps (before adding other ingredients, including Guar Gum).<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Xanthan Gum and sometimes Guar Gum (also available from Barry Farms: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC5M?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution (again, mix in slowly via blender running on high), but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is the secret to making softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Another interesting characteristic of Xanthan Gum is its ability to thin out when subjected to forces such as shaking (called shearing), which makes it great for poured sauces, as it will thicken back up after having exited the bottle. It can also prevent oils from separating from liquid-oil emulsions (think salad dressing). It is also more stable under a wider range of temperatures and pH than other gums.<br /><br />Xanthan Gum can also be used to give dough the stickiness that is needed in gluten-free baking, as gluten is usually what gives that sticky characteristic to dough. And no matter the use, Xanthan Gum will always remain colorless and flavorless, so it can be used for just about any need that suits it.
