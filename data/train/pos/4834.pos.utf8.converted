I'll start off by saying that Nong shim's products in general are of a higher standard than their competitors. Even their noodles have a much better consistency and are more flavorful than other brands such as nissin.  With that said, lets get to the review of the Spicy Picante flavor.<br /><br />The first thing anyone notices when they try this is just how spicy it is.  It is SPICY.  I love spicy foods and this will probably make your nose run.  I absolutely love it though.  If you think it is too spicy, you can probably use less of the seasoning packet.. so theres some room to fit individual taste.<br /><br />The package contains both a seasoning packet and some dried vegetables to add so you can definitely make a meal out of this if you add some egg or something.  I usually just eat it as is.  Overall, I think the flavor is great and I really recommend it for people that like spicy foods. You'll never go back to the cheaper, tasteless stuff again.
