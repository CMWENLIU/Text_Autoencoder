We love these St Dalfour Conserves. We have tried quite a few of their products and they are all really great quality.<br />These little individual serves are awesome when laying out a breakfast selection for entertaining or just for making breakfast a treat for everyone. We take them on trips because they are not loaded with anything artificial, just strawberries, grape juice, fruit pectin and lemon juice. We are a gluten free household and are very careful about what we eat. My kids usually don't like jelly at all but they love this stuff.
