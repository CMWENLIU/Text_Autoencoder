I try to take this product on a regular basis, every day or every couple of days. It has helped me with an estrogen dominance problem (heavy bleeding) and other pms symptoms. I consider it to be a medicinal product. It is loaded with nutrients women need, like iron, potassium, etc... I love that it is organic.<br />The best way I have found to take it is like a tea. I started out putting about 1 tablespoon in a mug and filling it with hot water, then sipping it.<br />My favorite recipe now is to put 1 Tbsp in the mug and stir in about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Then I add the water, leaving some room at the top. Then I pour in about 2-3 Tbsp of coconut milk and stir. This "tea" is rich and creamy and tastes a lot like hot coco with a little zip from the cayenne.
