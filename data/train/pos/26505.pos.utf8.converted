This coconut nectar is delicious and has a unique tasty flavor.  I am a type II diabetic and the coconut nectar does not raise my blood sugar at all. I am using this as a sweetner in baked goods, as a syrup on gluten free almond and coconut flour pancakes and waffles, as a dressing for fruit salad,sweetner in whipped cream and homemade cheesecake.  I also used this along with Coconut Secret's Coconut Aminos in making homemade ketchup and barbeque sauce.  The flavor of the coconut nectar really enhances both.<br /><br />I only wish it came in a discounted 4 or 6 pack or a bigger bottle.  It can be a bit pricey. That being said, a little goes a long way for sweetner. I also use coconut palm sugar regularly for baked goods but I find the flavor of this raw coconut nectar much more flavorful and the texture of the baked goods more moist.
