When I started my son on solids at 6 months, he developed a rash all over his torso. It seemed strange that he would be allergic to rice cereal, until I noticed that Gerber puts a soy filler in all of their cereals. I looked everywhere to find a soy-free cereal, and finally found this. My son loves it! Beechnut also has a soy-free rice cereal, but the texture is more gummy and makes my son gag. This has been a life saver. I purchase it (in great quantities) at WalMart.
