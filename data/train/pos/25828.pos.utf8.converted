I love Spry gum...high % of xylitol per serving, no gross/weird ingredients, great peppermint flavor. The flavor may fade a little faster than some conventional chewing gums, but it's better than consuming the carcinogenic, disgusting artificial ingredients they use. Also, this is an amazing value for Spry gum...previously I was ordering the 100 pc. tubs from a popular online herb store; that worked out to about $1.10 more per 100 pieces. At local health food stores, a 100 piece tub is even more expensive at about $7-7.5 each before tax! This is a good value anyway, as I have seen tubs of conventional chewing gum cost more than this per 100 pcs. The only thing I wish were different is I wish that you could order bulk Spry in bags...I feel terrible with this growing collection of plastic tubs! Amazon, please work something out with Spry to offer something like 1/2 lb. bags...
