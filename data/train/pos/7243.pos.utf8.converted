Think thin bites taste really great and are only 100 calories.  Most protein bars are high-calorie (at least 150 and often over 200 calories).  I wanted a 100-calorie choice and am very happy with this product.  The bars taste wonderful and go very well with morning coffee.  I think they taste more like peanuts than toffee, so perhaps they should be renamed chocolate-peanut.  In any case though, this product is delicious and provides 6g of protein and some hunger control for only 100 calories.  These bites are smaller than regular protein bars, so don't expect a big bar.  I think it's nice that they are called bites not bars, since their size might otherwise be surprising.
