I've been trying to wean myself off sucralose for some time and decided to try the pure stevia extract from (rhymes with) Traitor Schmoes.  It was mediocre at best.  Bitter.  Then a couple of weeks ago, I was in my local natural foods store.  I stop by there periodically and buy stuff simply to support local business.  I saw a bottle of this product and the label's claim that it's "non-bitter." So I sez to myself I sez, Why not? Brought it home, not expecting much.  Holy cr*p!  INfinitely better than the competition.  Barely--if at all--bitter.  And MUCH less required to achieve equivalent sweetness. I use it primarily in my morning oatmeal and in lemonade and iced tea.  I'm actually able to measure how much I use, because the competition's product comes with a little coke spoon that hold 45 milligrams.  I use two LEVEL spoonfuls of the NuNaturals product to make a humongous bowl of very sweet oatmeal (with pumpkin and apple thrown in) or 24 ounces of lemonade.  I'm going to experiment with lower amounts.  But even if I decide not to go lower, a 90 milligram serving (2 times 45 milligrams) is going to give me around 500 servings out of a one-ounce bottle of NuStevia.  Excellent product!
