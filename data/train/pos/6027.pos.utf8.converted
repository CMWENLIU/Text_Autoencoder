Although I originally started using vital wheat gluten many years ago as a bread enhancer, now I use it most frequently to make vegan meats such as sausages and veggie meatballs (but it is still a staple ingredient in my bread making). The subscription program through Amazon makes a great product much more affordable than buying it at the local chain grocer or health food store. Hodgson Mill is a quality brand, and I just hope it is always available this way through Amazon!
