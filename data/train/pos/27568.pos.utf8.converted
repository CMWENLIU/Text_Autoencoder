I'm amazed at the impact this has on my african violets (I've added a picture above). I was lazy for a couple of months and just watered them without the plant food. I thought the lack of flowers was due to the season. But once I started feeding them again they bloomed in no time, and it was still low-light winter so I'm positive the change was due to the plant food.<br /><br />You only use a few drops at a time, so this stuff truly lasts forever.<br /><br />My boyfriend usually thinks plants/flowers are a waste of time, but the other day he looked at the african violets and spontaneously admitted that "they are actually pretty nice... they're always flowering, it's pretty amazing."
