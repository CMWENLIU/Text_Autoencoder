Bought this today @ the Vitamin Shoppe. I needed a protein suppliment that is Vegan friendly. Just by smelling it I knew if I didn't jazz it up when mixing that it would probably not taste so great. I threw 4 tbsp into a spinach, strawberry, blackberry, apple smoothie and it .. was.. fantastic. I've had worse, more gritter powders (Ulitmate Meal mix). I enjoyed this very much and so did my 3 year niece who is a picky eater. If you add fruit you don't taste the hemp at all. My favorite part .. it's less than $15.00 per bottle & really that is a bargan compared to the other vegan/plant based powders on the market.
