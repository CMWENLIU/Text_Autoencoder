I have tried just about all the more 'natural' litter options, including the pine pellets, pine clumping, and corn products. The pellets are good but with 2 cats we go through them quickly. The pine clumping is hard to scoop and we also go through it lightning fast, and it tracks like crazy; my whole house was covered in pine flakes. The corn smells awful to me so I can't tolerate my house smelling like that.<br /><br />This litter is the best of the bunch. It absorbs odors, dries poo so it's easy to scoop, lasts quite a long time, and doesn't track much. I didn't really experience the 'cloud' when I poured this litter, at least nothing like clay. None of the natural litters really cover the odor of a fresh man-cat poo, so that doesn't really bother me. It dries quickly and the odor dissipates.<br /><br />I'm continuing to use this litter indefinitely, I really like it!
