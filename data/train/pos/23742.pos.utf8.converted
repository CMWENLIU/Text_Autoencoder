*****<br /><br />These are my favorite rice cakes. They are only a little sweet, unlike other brands, and the caramel is not fakey or chemically-tasting, unlike other brands. Sometimes I have just one after a meal, and it really satisfies my sweet tooth, plus fills me up if the meal is really light.<br /><br />Lundberg Rice Cakes are the absolute best rice cakes you can buy---the best ingredients and the best tasting, too. And at less than two dollars per package, buying them from Amazon is really the only way to go. They cost much more at health food stores.<br /><br />*****
