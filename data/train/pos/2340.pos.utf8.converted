Vegan. Natural. Kosher. Gave as a gift to someone who really appreciates high quality macadamias. Very positive response. "Best quality" mac nuts (and this is from someone who has been to Hawaii frequently and has sampled many "macs" in her time.) This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania. Your "helpful" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you.
