I have been buying and brewing Lavazza coffee for about twenty years--beginning with the time that you could only get Lavazza by a) having someone shlep it from Italy for you, or b) driving down Canal street (if you ever had the displeasure of being stuck in NYC). For years I used the Pienaroma, which is a fantastic coffee, and typically billed by the coffee companies as being the same as the "gold" you get over in Italy. The Pienaroma is fantastic for cappuccino and lattes, but I think this gold is better for straight espresso.<br /><br />The Pienaroma is 100% Arabica.  Not sure exactly what's in the Gold, but the crema is amazing.  I suspect Lavazza must drop in a little Robusto to give the Gold the great crema and a slight bite that I feel is missing in the Pienaroma.  Some people mistake this taste, often referred to as "earthy" taste, for a burnt taste.  I suggest brewing some espresso from the Gold and the Pienaroma side-by-side and tasting them at the same time.  You'll appreciate this taste is missing in the Pienaroma, I suspect, and after that the Pienaroma will taste "flat" for straight espresso.  Summary:  if you don't drink espresso, stick with the Pienaroma as it is more economical and is a fantastic coffee.  If you like espresso, give the Gold a shot and see what you think.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I'm not a professional food taster, so all of the above is just one person's opinion.  Surely you know what they say about opinions...
