As a store manager, I was always interested when a customer would purchase alot of an item.  When I had a customer  purchase a 1000 lbs of sugar they said they were making alot of Jelly (or moonshine?)  When a customer came in monthly and bought every package of McLib's Southern Dumplings, I had to ask why.  It turned out that her mom was undergoing Chemo for cancer and McLib's was the only thing she could eat.  This knowledge spread and I began to keep extra cases of dumplings in the back so these special customers wouldn't be disappointed.  I am very glad that AMAZON has started carrying the dumplings and I hope that anyone who loves a great bowl of Chicken and Dumplings or Peach Cobbler will give these a try. There is a wonderful recipe for Lasagna using McLibs on the back of the box.
