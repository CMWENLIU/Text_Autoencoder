I love this little thing! I have successfully grown veggies in my kitchen and they look great. Except the Cilantro and Dill didn't sprout, so it ain't perfect I guess ... still love it though.<br /><br />We plugged it in, placed in the pods, pressed the button for what we were growing and {POOF!} we haven't touched it, other than adding water and the little tablets everyonce and a while.<br /><br />Like others mentioned it puts off a lot of light ... almost like a Flood Light in the Kitchen at night. So be careful where you put it at night.
