I found Starport Foods through Twitter. I checked out their products and found this one to be suitable for my needs. I had to cook fried rice for 40 people and needed a large bottle of sauce. Starport Foods' Brown Stir-fry sauce was perfect, great flavor, and reasonably priced for a huge gallon. I was able to make vegetarian and meat versions too. Customer service for Starport Foods were great in providing nutritional information as well as recipes. I even got a tip on how to bake rice in the oven! I had enough left over to use at home to cook for my family.<br /><br />Rather than gathering all these different types of asian sauce ingredients (ie. garlic, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, chili paste) this one-step and easy-to-use sauce cuts my cooking time in half. I can make a stir-fry or fried rice in under 20 minutes! Glad I ordered this!<br /><br />I also don't understand the fuss with the one star review. Her complaint was that this sauce is not vegan because it has sugar in it. Not all (non "organic") sugar is processed with bone char. It sucks that she felt the company misinformed her. Her review has nothing to do with the quality of the flavor, use, and practicality of the product as well as the helpfulness of their customer service. Don't diss it if you didn't try it.
