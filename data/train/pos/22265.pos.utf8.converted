***For the person with 1 star It states quite clearly on their site FAQ:<br />DOES THIS FOOD CONTAIN ETHOXYQUIN?<br />Taste of the Wild Pet Foods sources all protein meals (chicken meal, fish meal, etc) from vendors that do not use ethoxyquin. As always, only natural preservatives are used in our manufacturing process to preserve the foods.<br /><br />So why someone would review this and give it 1 star is beyond me! I started to use this after my smooth coat chihuahua Herbie seemed a little sickly. I didnt realize soy and grain is not a good thing for our animals. I previously used Royal Canin.  He's full of energy and his coat is darker and shiny! We also augment his food with the Tast Of The Wild Wetlands food and he loves that also.  The high protein content means the animal will be less hungry and consume less food in the long run.  Think about it if you eat chicken or steak your less hungry than if you ate a bunch of rice because carbs get burned quickly. BUY this food your doggy will thank you for it!
