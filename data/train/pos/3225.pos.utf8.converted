Finally! My cat had been eating k/d diet both wet and dry for years. Suddenly she lost interest in the canned and I was forced to add sardines to it. Sort of defeats the purpose of limiting the protein doesn't it? Well, I  was heartsick because already thin to begin with, she wasn't eating enough to gain weight. She would just sit and stare at her bowl. In desperation, I knew I had to find a better food, so I read the reviews here and ordered a case and voila! She eats it without sauce or sardines. She can't get enough of it. I had to order another case. So now she's eating one can a day which is good. Though I wish they would make this in a dry too, so she could nibble through the night. She won't even touch the dry anymore! And we all know what a wet diet can do to the teeth. I highly recommend a dental treat such as enzadent oral chews and a daily cleaning or adding a dental additive to the water. But I shouldn't complain, she's eating and that's what I wanted. Anyway, I don't know what they put in this food, but my cat sure likes it and thanks to it, she's going to be around for a long time still!
