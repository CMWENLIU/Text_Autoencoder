I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos.
