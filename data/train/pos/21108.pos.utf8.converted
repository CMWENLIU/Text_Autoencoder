I consume a lot of this tea on a daily basis while at work.  If you are trying to find a good coffee substitute, this is great because it is very low in caffeine, yet very strong, rich and complex in flavor.  I am sensitive to caffeine, yet this tea does not get me too wired.  It does, however, give me a gentle jazzy infusion of energy.  My personal fave thing to do, tea-wise, is to COMBINE a bag of this kukicha tea with a bag of pure peppermint tea (I favor Celestial Seasonings Pure Peppermint, which has peppermint as the sole ingredient and it is a very strong peppermint) and let them steep together:  VUNDERBAR!  You get a tea with unexpected chocolate overtones that is very delicious, strong and complex.  But back to the straight Haiku kukicha experience:  to sum up, if you are looking for a strong, pure (organic, as a matter of fact) green tea that is heavy on depth and flavor and low in caffeine, you have found it.  ENJOY!
