Vegan. Natural. Very tasty chickpeas (also commonly known as ceci beans, garbanzos, or chana.) Great in salads, soups, as a side, or in many vegan recipes and cuisines. Chana dishes, like chana masala, are some of my Indian favorites. Also try adding a can of chick peas to a can of vegan chili or any vegan soup. These Carmelina beans are even good for healty snacking. Rich flavor. Approx 807 calories and 45g protein per 14.28 oz/400g can. Case of 24 cans. Made with chick peas, water, salt. Product of Italy.
