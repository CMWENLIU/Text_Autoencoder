I have used these for years. They don't totally rid you of moths, but I don't want to use poisonous sprays around the house. They will capture the male moths so it prevents lots of future eggs/larvae that will eat your clothes.<br />It's just unfortunate those males had to come from the larvae that DID eat your clothes. Use other methods (freezer/dryer) to kill those.
