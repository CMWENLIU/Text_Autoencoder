Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare! Just add eggs, milk, and vegetable oil. You can use your bread machine if you put it on the "Quick Bake" cycle.  It comes out of the pan easily and intact with a crusty exterior/moist interior, and maybe just a hint of sweetness.  As for the jalapenos, we don't find them to be hot, but they do add a little zest.  We usually enjoy this with a nice hot soup on a cold day.
