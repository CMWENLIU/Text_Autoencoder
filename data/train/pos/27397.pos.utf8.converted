I use these for emergency blood sugar support when on the road or camping...I think these are great.  I prefer agave over honey because of the lower glycemic index (supports stable blood sugar longer).<br /><br />I don't know why other reviewers had a hard time opening them.  Just bite at 90 degrees to the pinch and it pops right open, and won't open when you don't want it to.  Just don't put them in a crunched bag unless you have them inside plastic to be safe.  I've never had one break open and spill.<br /><br />Great product.
