I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze offers some unusual flavors to suit a variety of tastes, and their Sparkling Pomegranate is one of the best fruit sodas I've tasted. Pomegranate juice is sometimes described as "slightly sweet, slightly tart", but I always found the pure juice too strong. This soda is perfect, though. The sparkling water dilutes the pomegranate flavor just enough to leave its essence without curling your tongue. It's delicious. It tastes more like fresh pomegranate fruit than pomegranate juice, which is too concentrated. And it's lightly carbonated for extra refreshment. If you like a fruit soda that is flavorful but not very sweet, Izze Sparkling Pomegranate fits the bill perfectly. And it contains no artificial ingredients or caffeine. No sugar added. It's sweetened with fruit juice concentrate. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, apple juice concentrate, grape juice concentrate, pineapple juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, pomegranate juice concentrate, cranberry juice concentrate, carrot juice (color), blueberry juice (color), natural flavor.
