These grits are excellent.  Amazon, in their product description says that "hominy grits are coarsely ground hominy or corn".  That statement is incorrect.  Hominy IS corn...that has the germ removed and is soaked in a weak lye solution.<br />Grits made from hominy are superior to grits made from regular cracked corn.  If you like grits, you will love this product from Angelina's Gourmet.  One item missing from Amazon and Angelina is cooking instructions.  Bring 1 1/4 cups of water to a low boil.  Add 1/3 cups of grits. Turn heat to its lowest setting.  You want the grits to barely simmer, not boil!  Stir well and frequently for the first couple of minutes.  Cover pan , removing to stir every couple of minutes.  About 15 minutes will do it.  The longer you can cook without going dry, the creamier the grits will be. Serving size?  It's one serving for me, maybe two for you.  You can figure this out......not rocket science.
