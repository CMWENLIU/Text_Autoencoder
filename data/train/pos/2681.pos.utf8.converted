We were introduced to Siciliani olive oil by Chef Bettancourt at his excellent restaurant, "62 on Wharf" in Salem, Ma. It is the best I've had in over 40 years of dining, but difficult to find in local stores (thus we are delighted to order from Amazon). Believe me, you will never regret buying this product! Dip your bread into a little bowl of Siciliani, and WOW!, what a taste.
