I have tried many teas in my life , &amp; this by far has gone over the top with me ... I have tried 4 different flavors , all of which were very satisfying. The one I liked best is Tazo Chai , it has a spice flavor that just captivates the taste buds . It may not be for every one , but since I like the taste &amp; smell of exotic spices , this does very well for me . I will buy it &amp; keep it on hand as much as possible..
