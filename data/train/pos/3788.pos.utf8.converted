If you want the most fancy crab meat that money can buy, then you should choose lump crab meat.  If you want a good dependable economy crab meat, you may want this one. It is better than any cheap crab meat in my supermarket.  I've had over 12 cans of it and never found a shell fragment.  The meat is totally white and mild.  I use it in soups, cheese bakes and dips, and it works just fine.  This is a good dependable crab meat brand that absolutely doesn't deserve the bad reviews it is getting from former buyers.
