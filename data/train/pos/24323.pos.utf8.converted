I live in South Korea, and needless to say, these suckers are extremely hard to find (if not impossible). Even though I live far away, the package arrived very quickly (quicker than most items of this size would), and the blowpops taste as perfect as they did in the U.S.<br /><br />Enjoying this candy, I could be shot in the face tomorrow and STILL die a happy man, knowing that on my shelf, in my room, next to a picture of my family and others, is a beautiful, gorgeous 100ct. box of Charms Blowpops.
