I had heard about the benefits of coconut oil but it wasn't until I came across Elanaspantry.com that I learned about coconut flour. I had to try it and I love using it!  I have to eat a low glycemic/ gluten free diet and the coconut flour fits right into that diet!  I love making muffins with this flour because I feel like I am eating a treat but they are  higher in fiber and protein and don't make feel that weirdness that I use to get when I ate regular sugar/refined carb muffins.  You have to use a lot of eggs with Coconut flour so it really bumps up the protein value of anything you are making.  My children and husband love the muffins that I make with this and I am excited to venture out and try some other recipes from the site mentioned.  Give it a try!  One of my friends loved the muffins so much I made that she now is a fan of Coconut Flour even though she doesn't need to eliminate wheat.
