I first received the scented bags as a "bonus" with my regular bags.  I loved them so much that I was bummed when I had to switch to the "regular" ones I actually bought.  The scent is very strong, but not to the point where it's offensive in its own right, but is strong enough to mask the unpleasant smells the bags contend with.  I didn't have the other reviewer's problem- the scent remained for as long as I had the bags, and even made my "regular" bags smell good to an extent.<br /><br />Even more importantly- this is the only brand of bags I use.  I've tried others, and I've had breakage or size problems.  These are perfect.  They've never broken, and they're the perfect length for easy, clean tying.  I love them.
