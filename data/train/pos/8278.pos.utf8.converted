I love pasta. I've tried white, wheat, veggie, gluten free (which is aweful). I found miracle noodles. At first it was hard to get past the irredescent look of the noodle but I washed them, parboiled them and put them in my favorite sauce with veggies and it was perfect. Why wouldn't everyone try these. On special occasion like at my Italian grandmother's dinners I will eat pasta but these miracle noodles are an awesome replacement otherwise. I haven't yet tried them with an alfredo or pesto sauce. There is one other noodle that compares with the miracle noodle and that is shirataki noodles. Both are amazing. I can have my pasta and eat it too.
