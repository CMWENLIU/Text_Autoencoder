My wife and I received these as an unexpected Xmas gift through fed-ex on Xmas day this year.  I had never heard of The Tea Room, the makers of this item, nor the product.  After having tried one, I picked up the receipt and made it a point to learn what it was called and who made them.  Simply put, this was one of the most exquisite little bites I've put into my mouth in quite some time.<br /><br />There's a variety of flavors, all sweet, but it's the consistency and texture of these little pillows that hook you.  Also, receiving them as a gift was just perfect - as I don't know that I'd buy them for myself, but I sure would as a gift for a special someone.  A bit expensive? Sure.  Luxurious?  Absolutely! Outstanding product.  Recommended!
