Since we started using the Keurig coffee machine, we have tried all of the coffee on the market including making our own mixture. We are coffee drinkers. We have in our home a professional cappuccino machine, I mean the huge one you would find in a coffee shop or Italian cafe'. We decided that Tully's is the flavor for us, rich, strong and beautiful (every woma's dream huh?) Kidding aside it is a very good coffe. Our favorite is still Kona.
