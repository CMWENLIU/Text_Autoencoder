I use them to make fillers for dumplings and ravioli, I mix a can with a little wasabi mayo for a shrimp salad sandwich, I sprinkle the little guys on a salad (there is no chemical taste that you can sometimes get with canned seafood) ... there are a hundred great uses for these canned shrimp, and that makes me especially glad that they are responsibly harvested.  I am very pleased to be able to order 12 packs of this item at a bulk price.
