I have ordered on 2 separate occasions the 4 pack boxes.  Both had terrific groats but the first shipment one of the 4 packs had broken open during shipping and had spilled its contents.  I contacted Red Mill and they immediately replaced the spilled pack.  That's great service.  I'm on the site again to place another order. Repeat business is the best recommendation.
