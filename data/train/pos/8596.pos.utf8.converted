This review is partially to share my experience, and partially to explain the first review. Azaleas bloom in early spring, one of the first plants to do so, and the one-star reviewer did not realize this. Bonsai is a hobby intended for years of enjoyment, and not as a one-time 'I sent you some flowers' type of gift. Buying it in June and expecting to send a flowery gift is impossible, and not the point of this product. I bought it for what it is, a beautiful bonsai tree that will flower next spring.<br />That being said, my plant arrived quickly, safe as you could ask, and it was fuller and bigger than the one shown. There WAS a tag that said the exact species it was, along with a pamphlet with prevalent care instructions. I couldn't be happier with my plant, I will be buying from this seller again, and I sincerely hope that the one star review will be outweighed or ignored, as it isn't a fair judgement of the product.<br /><br />More concisely, buy this tree if you want a lovely, healthy tree. Don't buy it if you expect to receive a tree in full flower in mid summer. Know what you're shopping for and this is one of the best deals out there.
