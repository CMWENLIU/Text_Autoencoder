I first had this tea served at the Firebird Resturant in New York. They served it in traditional Russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from Moldavia (no sugar). This is by far the best way to enjoy this fine tea, but even when I'm in less civilized parts of the country Prince Vladimir with a spoonful of sugar is wonderful.
