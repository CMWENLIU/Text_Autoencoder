I have used organic valley skim milk for baking, hot coco,yogurt,smoothies, cereals etc. I also use this product for ice cream. I have a NINJA mixer, I'm sure you have seen it advertised, I put a cup of cold water, three heaping teaspoons of organic valley skim milk, four packets of STEVIA and 1 cup or 1 1/2 cups of frozen strawberries or frozen peaches in mixer, pulse approx 4 times and then hold down top for approx 1 min, use judgement. YOU HAVE ICE CREAM, very low in calories. Great product!
