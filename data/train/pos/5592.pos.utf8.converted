This is one of my favorite in the Erin Baker line of Breakfast cookies, the cookie has an oatmeal base but is not a "heavy" cookie. It is nice and moist and has little pieces of caramel in the cookie. I like the fact that the cookie packs a lot in a little package- 280 calories for this cookie, no transfat, 20% of your daily fiber, no cholesterol and chock full of healthy ingredients to get you started (it does however have 23 gr. of sugar, so if you are looking for low sugar, this probably isn't for you). I have to say I was skeptical that this would carry me to lunch because it is just one large cookie, and not like one of those overly heavy, hockey puck like items you expect when you see something is full of fiber, it also didn't have that saw dust kind of texture you get from some power bars. This definitely has enough of the right stuff to keep me full for several hours. My favorite way to eat these cookies are to stick them in the microwave for 20-25 seconds so they get soft and the caramel melts just a little.<br /><br />I pretty much like all of the flavors, but overall this one is probably my most favorite. The other nice thing is that these cookies are meant to freeze and can freeze up to a year. The box of twelve cookies are all individually wrapped and I take them straight from freezer to microwave, for a quick, nutritious breakfast that is both satisfying and delicious.<br /><br />I'm happy to see that amazon seems to be carrying more of the Baker line, which also saves tremendously on the shipping costs!
