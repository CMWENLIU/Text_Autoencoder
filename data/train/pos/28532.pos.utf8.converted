I have been using this salt for nearly three years. My husband has to have a low-sodium diet, but those potassium chloride substitutes taste awful. This salt is full of all sorts of healthy minerals and tastes amazing. We get all the flavor with less actual sodium due to all the minerals taking up space in the salt. Most table salt has 480 mg of sodium per 1/4 teaspoon, and some sea salts go as high as 530 mg per 1/4 teaspoon. Celtic Sea Salt has only 330 mg per 1/4 teaspoon. That my not sound like much of a difference, but 1/4 teaspoon is really small, so the difference gets pretty large when you look at a whole day's worth of meals. Not to mention that all those minerals are great for is heart (and mine)!
