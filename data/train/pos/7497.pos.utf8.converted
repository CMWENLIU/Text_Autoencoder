Time and time again I've heard it said to "get the green bag" of Taste of the Wild. What's the "green bag", you ask?<br /><br />Well, recently TotW came out with an "other" formula, called "Canyon River". And, while it's not bad by any means, it IS different. Some cats like it, some cats don't. My cat isn't picky. My problem was that it smelled so sordid that I couldn't stand to feed my cat (read my review on it here). Since my cat liked the "other" formula so well, I decided to try the original formula in the "green bag". I found a good price locally and the pet shop owner told me about how the "green bag" was far superior to the "other one".<br /><br />And she was right. The Rocky Mountain Feline formula has everything I'm looking for in a dry food, doesn't smell like a hatchery, and is priced fair.<br /><br />My cat loves it, and I don't have any complaints.<br /><br />I'm sticking with this from now on.
