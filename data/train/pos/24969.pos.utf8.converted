This is my favorite breakfast cereal bar none.  It tastes great, it has no sugar and it may even be good for me.  I used to buy it at a local Safeway and a not-so-local Trader Joe's but they both dropped it from inventory.  My new local Trader Joe's has a big selection of Kashi cereal but only the sugar-fortified varieties.  Is there really no market for cereal without sugar or artificial sweeteners?  Anyway, Amazon ships packs of 6 right to my door.  Amazon 1- Safeway and Trader Joe's 0.
