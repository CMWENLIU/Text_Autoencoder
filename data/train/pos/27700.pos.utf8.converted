My fussy dog has been on a grain free diet for about a year and it's made a great difference in her health.  She eats EVO grain free dog food in the small kibble size and thrives on it.  So I thought I'd try the EVO grain free snacks.  She really likes them and eats them up and doesn't hesitate.  They are pricy and when you consider s/h, it's an expensive treat.  But it's good to have the variety of this snack in her diet.
