*****Update 11/17/10****** When I created this review, the product being sold was HNZ Honey New Zealand Active 20+ honey.  This product listing has been changed to an unknown brand.*****<br /><br />This quote is taken from the HNZ website Q & A regarding the difference between "UMF" and "ACTIVE" Manuka.  I don't know who posted the "Product Description" for this product, but it is wrong and falsely leading consumers to purchase something they think is UMF. I am not discrediting the Active 20+ Manuka honey from HNZ.  It may be just as healthy as UMF 20+.  I have the Active 30+ and it tastes amazing, like caramel. In fact, the Active honey HNZ sells is the best honey I have ever tasted.<br /><br />""What is the difference between `UMF' & `Active' Manuka Honey?<br /><br />Not all Manuka honey has UMF (Non peroxide) activity and we differentiate this by using the names UMF Manuka and Active Manuka Honey.<br /><br />UMF Manuka Honey guarantees a Non Peroxide activity that is based on the UMF testing regime initiated by Prof. Molan. This in turn is measured against a standard Phenol (antiseptic/anti bacterial) solution to gauge the relative strength of the Non Peroxide activity against Phenol. So, UMF 20+ guarantees antibacterial Non Peroxide Activity (UMF) level of 20+.<br /><br />For example, Honey New Zealand's Active 20+ honey guarantees honey's total antibacterial activity level of 20+. This Total Activity is mostly from the Hydrogen Peroxide activity of honey (as opposed to the Non Peroxide Activity of UMF Honey).<br /><br />Both Total (Active) and Non Peroxide (UMF) activities are tested by certified independent lab in New Zealand.<br /><br />In regards to health benefits, UMF is more stable over time, does not break down with heat, light or body enzymes and may even grow in strength over time.""
