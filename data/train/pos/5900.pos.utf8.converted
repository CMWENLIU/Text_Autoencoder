These seeds are great! This price is much cheaper than my local co-op, and shipping is free! Would recommend to anyone trying to transition from a "junk food" based diet to a healthier way to snack! While these are not super low-fat, they are nutritious, raw, vegan, and full of proteins and flavor! Much better than potato chips for munching on in front of the T.V..and they do not taste like "health food"! Excellent product.. and hey, don't panic, they're organic!
