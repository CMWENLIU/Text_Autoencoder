This coffee is great! Has a nice smooth rich taste. It's not too light and not too dark but perfect. If you like a medium roast coffee you'll love this. I also like that the price is a little cheaper then some other brands. No problems with the k-cups here, they brewed just fine. I recommend this coffee.
