I have been using ACV for a long time and this one is by far the best tasting of any of them, especially the junk from the Supermarket (don't even bother). I have a 64 ounce jug of water that I drink from through-out the day with an equivalent of about 6 to 8 teaspoons of ACV. I used to use more Honey to sweeten but this doesn't need as much sweetener. I won't go over all the benefits. They are listed over and over here and from other sources. I wouldn't use it though if I wasn't convinced of the benefits.<br /><br />One thing that people should realize though about the usage. Taking a big shot at the start of the day will lesson the effects compared to consuming it through-out the day. Spreading it out all day evens out any PH spikes in your system. One big 'gulp' does taste bad, is very hard on your teeth (acidic), and goes through your system faster. Spread it out over the day. As a little pick me up I like to add a couple teaspoons to a glass of tomato juice or v8 when I get home from work to tie me over until supper.<br /><br />The taste?? I am starting to like it!!<br /><br />Good Luck and enjoy!
