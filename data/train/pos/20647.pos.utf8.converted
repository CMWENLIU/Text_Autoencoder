I had the privilege to visit the town of Cetara on the Amalfi Coast, and actually bought some of these anchovies in person. I am thrilled that Amazon sells them, because otherwise I might have cried when my first jar ran out. This is an area of the world known for its anchovies, and these are the cream of the crop.
