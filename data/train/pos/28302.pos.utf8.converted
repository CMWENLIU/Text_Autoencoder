I recently tried this mix for my stepson's birthday party. At first, I was also put off by the 'beany' smell to the batter. But that flavor and smell disappears once the cake is baked. Not only is it a delicious treat for someone with celiac, but all of my (non celiac) family members tested and devoured this cake. They couldn't tell the difference between it and any other pre-packaged mix from the store. Don't be intimidated by the bean flours! They make for a moist, soft, fantastic chocolate cake! (Not at all dry like some mixes made with rice flour.) And unless you plan on sitting back to chow down a big bowl of raw cake batter, you won't even know the beans are there. Bob's Red Mill has yet to let me down in the gluten free department, and this cake mix is no exception!
