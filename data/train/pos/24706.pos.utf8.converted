I have tried many brands of coconut milk and Chaokoh is my hands-down favorite. It's thicker than most brands--almost like whipped cream--and has a uniformly creamy taste and texture. It makes an excellent dip for fruit and adds delicious creaminess to smoothies and soups. The Chaokoh brand is recommended by many Thai cooking experts, as well as by Food & Wine magazine and Cook's Illustrated. Be warned: it's addictive!
