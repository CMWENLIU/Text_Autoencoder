I struggle to survive without my PG Tips. I got hooked and forever have been paying exhorbitant prices to have it shipped to me. I had friends in the UK buying it at the reasonable prices there and then shipping it to me, but at the parcel rates it took forever, and now with Homeland Security, it seems to take even longer (maybe they think it is not really tea?) I was shouting with happiness when a local grocer finally started carrying it, but only in the tiny 40 bag boxes (which lasts barely a week for a true tea drinker). Here I sit in the home of Starbucks, and while TAZO is okay, but's not the same. THIS is tea!<br /><br />I do drink my tea in the English/Irish/Scots manner, which is to say, with milk, 95% of the time. A strong cuppa in the morning, and continally through the day, in my insulated STARBUCKS 16 oz mug! LOL. PG Tips is the only tea to stand up to the pace. Most of the so-called TEA in the US is what folks from the true tea-drinking countries call "floor sweepings", which is to say, the "tea" that is left, after the real tea is made into packets and bags... it's little crumbs and dust, which is why we get it in thick tea bags, nothing else would hold these little dregs.<br /><br />I am so happy to see it here! The nearest British importer charges $22 plus shipping for the same size box. I am happy! BUY this tea! You will love it. If you want weak tea, one bag will make you nearly a pot. Please use fresh, cold water, bring to a boil, and then make your tea. It does make a difference!
