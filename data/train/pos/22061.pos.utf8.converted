You'll either love this tea or hate it. If you like barbecue or smoked meats of any kind, chances are you'll like this tea. I have to disagree about drinking it pale. The proper way to drink this tea is by pouring boiling water on it and steeping for 5 minutes, which usually make it fairly dark. Unlike other teas, it seems to stay smooth-tasting even when you make it strong and has a nice reddish color to it. I can't get enough of this tea. On the other hand, my wife absolutely hates the flavor.
