When Southwest Specialty Foods first sent me an email about this new product, I was moderately skeptical. Most peanut butter is a god-awful mixture of peanuts, sugar, transfat (for that nice creamy taste) and a bit too much salt thrown in on the side.  I just wasn't interested in another product of that sort, even if it included a touch of habanero pepper dust for seasoning. I like my peanut butter to have peanuts, peanut oils, and more or less nothing else.  So I declined to order any.<br /><br />But then, on a recent visit to Phoenix, I had the pleasure of sampling this new product.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover it was a lot more like Adam's Old Fashioned Peanut Butter than disgusting imitations like Peter Pan and Jif.  Even better, it packs a delayed wallop that few Southwest products, at least in the "A-- Kicking" line do.  Indeed, when I took a heaping spoonful my initial reaction was, "where's the heat?"  But as I walked about the store, I quickly discovered that the "kick" grows on you.  (As an aside, those who love hot foods should visit the Southwest Specialty foods warehouse on Bullard Ave in Goodyear, AZ.  It is like a candy store for those with the right tastes, and all products can be sampled free of charge.  That alone is worth the 350 mile drive to visit my wife's relatives.)  In any event, I purchased two jars on the spot, and sent a third to my father in Boise, Idaho, just to share my good fortune.<br /><br />Bottom line.  There are those people who believe in "global warming."  And then there are those who openly wish for it.  If you are in the latter category, this peanut butter is a great place to start.  High quality, with a lasting kick.  It will enhance your lunches for many days to come.
