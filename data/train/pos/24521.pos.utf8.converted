This is a great waffle mix for using in a belgian waffle maker.  I use it most Saturday mornings (including this morning) and love that Amazon ships it to my door.  I have gone through at least 6 cans of this mix and have never had a "bad" batch.  This mix is far above any of the ones I've tried from my local mega mart.  One piece of advice- let the batter rest for about 5 minutes after mixing it.  The batter is easier to measure accurately and the waffles come out better.  Enjoy!
