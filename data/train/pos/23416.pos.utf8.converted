I switched to an Ayurvedic hair care regimen nearly a year ago. This product along with other herbs (like Brahmi, Amla, Neem & Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder) when mixed with Bhringraj or Neem oil acts as an effective treatment against brittle hair, hair loss, and dryness. I use this mix as a deep conditioner, and apply it to my hair every three weeks. My results? Stronger hair that's no longer brittle and major growth (compared to when I wasn't using this product).
