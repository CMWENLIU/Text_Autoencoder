As the previous reviewer stated, the cans do arrive dented up.<br /><br />However the shipping was timely and free, and the beans are the proper tasting Heinz Beans that I miss so much from Britain.<br /><br />They are wonderful with just buttered toast, or with the toast and a fried egg or two for breakfast. Yum!
