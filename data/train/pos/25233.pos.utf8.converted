This is only my second day using Braggs vinegar and I am impressed. I did an MRI the other day which the results came back saying I have 2 small ovarian cysts.  I googled natural remedies for ovarian cysts and a site came up with tons of women who said after taking organic vinegar for about a month and the follow up ultrasound came back with the cysts gone. [...] I came to Amazon, read every review then decided to purchase this. I plan on taking it for a month then following up on my cysts. In only 2 days I've seen a decrease in my appetite. Im wondering if its my mind playing tricks on me or if this is for real. Last night I wanted something sweet and had no desire for the chips ohoy chewy fudge in the cupboard. I ended up eating 2 nectarines and a banana. Just now I made sphagetti, pasta, and veggies for dinner and didnt have an urge for the pasta. This is amazing!!! I also went ahead and purchased the aztec cream since so many people had rave reviews about it. Indeed my pores look much smaller. Right about now I would be fatigued and passed out on the couch instead Im awake alert typing this review. The taste and smell is not the best but today was much easier than yeterday. I put 2tbs in an 8oz bottle of water in morning and evening then I ate something right after to get rid of the taste. I know its only been 2 days but this stuff is the truth!
