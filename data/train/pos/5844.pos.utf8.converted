My girlfriend of 7 years and I recently visited Spain. One of the many things I discovered there is a custard desert the Mexicans there eat. They call it Flan!<br /><br />I kept cracking my girlfriend up by saying "It's Flantastic!" everytime I had flan. She would just laugh and laugh and laugh.<br /><br />When I returned home, I headed to the grocery store to find Flan. I tried several kinds and Goya's is by far the best. Jell-O makes some too, but it's not even close to the authentic Spanish Flan the Mexicans eat in Spain.<br /><br />Get this Goya Flan, it's FLAN-TASTIC!!!!!!!<br /><br />I wish my girlfriend was here to laugh at that. I'll have to get on the internet tonight and show her this review. It will make her night!
