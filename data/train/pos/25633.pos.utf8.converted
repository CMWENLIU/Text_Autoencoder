Cella's hands down makes the best Chocolate covered Cherries.  We usually buy them seasonally in the local stores but have a hard time finding the dark chocolate as those seem to sell out quicker than the milk chocolate.<br /><br />That said, recently I bought high priced CCC (chocolate covered cherries)from Helen Grace Chocolates.  I was desperate for some and no Cella's in the local stores.  What a disappointment!  Any CCC lover knows that the liquid center makes up for 98% of the taste and the Helen Grace were lacking this.  There was a scant (and I mean very scant) liquid center so all you really tasted was the chocolate, very overpowering!  At 18.50 per pound it was a ripoff!  From now on I am staying with Cella's.  You won't be disappointed at all, they know how to make a cordial center!
