I'm a miserable jerk, and have no manners, temperance,or patience.  I have a crap job installing heavy equipment in filthy cardboard box factories.  I work everyday for months at a time and travel all over the country.  I thoroughly hate my job.  It's hard and dirty.  At the end of the day I'm usually going nuts about wanting to leave.<br />Anyway, one day I'm on break, smoking a cigarette and having a complaint filled temper tantrum when I decide to go into the store and get a drink.  I see this stuff, and I figure what can it hurt.  If nothing else it will get this cigarette taste out my mouth.  So I buy it and chug it and get back to work.  It wasn't 10 minutes later, I was calm as falling snow.  I don't complain about wanting to leave early.  I don't yell at people.  I don't even want to sucker-punch my coworkers, and they deserve it.  I bought one for every guy on the crew the next day, and we all swear by them now.<br />It's not like a drug, so don't expect your mind to get blown, and different things work differently for different people.  It could have just been a placebo effect, but I'm genuinely happier as a result of this product, so I suggest it.<br />And if you're fat like my boss, you need to drink 2 to get the same effect.
