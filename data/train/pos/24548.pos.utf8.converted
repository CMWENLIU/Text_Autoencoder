I recently switched to this brand for dry and wet and Castor&Pollux's dry food. Since they all like the gravy based wet foods, I do add water to the canned food which they then happily devour. My 17 yo cat is very overweight, has bad teeth which cannot be cleaned again due to his age. Otherwise the vet thinks he's healthy. By accident I stumbled on some web based cat food reviews and was appalled at what I had been feeding my babies. I was naive in thinking Purina was healthy food. Since making the switch they all eat less although there is no  change in the litterboxes. For now I'm sticking to these brands and possibly adding Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul brand as they really enjoy the sample bag as bedtime treats.
