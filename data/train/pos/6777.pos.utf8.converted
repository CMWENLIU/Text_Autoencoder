People, PLEASE don't review a product before you've tried it. It gives the impression that the product is not good, which is not the case here.  I understand your concerns about the ingredient list.  Call Betty Crocker or go to their website.<br /><br />I think we need to do all we can to SUPPORT mainstream companies coming out with gluten-free products.  The more we do this, the more products will hit the market.  This will make products easier to find (local grocery stores), cheaper, and tastier!<br /><br />That being said, this product is actually good.  The Betty Crocker website has a lot of recipes to use with the gluten-free mixes.  I tried the carrot cake recipe with the yellow cake mix and it was GREAT.  The only downside is that it only makes one layer, so if you are making a two-layer cake, buy two.  Yes, that gets expensive.  It's part of gluten-free living,is it not?
