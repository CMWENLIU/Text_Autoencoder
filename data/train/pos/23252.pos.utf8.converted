The reason, I suspect, that people have varying results regarding glucose levels after eating Dreamfields. Their website explains that it must be cooked precisely according to the individual box directions in order to retain the low carb aspect. This should probably be explained on the box as well. The website states:<br /><br />"It is very important not to overcook Dreamfields because over cooking can damage the protective matrix and increase the digestible carbs per serving. We also recommend pouring any sauce over the pasta just before serving. If the pasta is mixed in a pan with the sauce, do this only over low heat for a short amount of time."<br /><br />I don't cook mine even a minute longer than the the recommended time.<br /><br />With the exception of the lasagna noodles, it's not recommended for storage after cooking, either. The company recommends only preparing what you will consume at the time. Storage in a sauce, especially an acidic sauce (like one with tomatoes or vinegar), will also break down the protective matrix which prevents digestion.<br /><br />Needless to say, portion control is important, too. A diabetic friend told me that her blood sugar level rose significantly after eating it but, upon further questioning, she admitted she'd eaten almost the entire box at one time.<br /><br />This product does work, but has to be as directed.
