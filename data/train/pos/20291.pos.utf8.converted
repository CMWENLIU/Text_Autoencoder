I ordered both the dry and wet starter because I wasnt sure it would still be alive when received.  Following the directions, in 2 days I had a thriving starter.  I made sourdough according to the "123" method I found on youtube.  It is SO EASY and fun, and the bread is excellent.  The starter keeps going too; I take out 1 cup at a time and replace with 1 cup of water and 7/8 cup of flour.  In a couple hours it is bubbling away and ready to back to the fridge.  I still have the dry starter, haven't needed it yet.
