Finally a great alternative to the other "Dr" soda!  Dr. Zevia has an intense flavor with a lot of cherry in it.  Not quite as much "pepper" flavor as the mainstream brand.  There is a stevia aftertaste, but it's not any worse than an aspartame aftertaste.  I love it and feel good letting my kids drink it, too.
