These are a sweet and chewy alternative to the sugar-laden, princess/pirate/cuddly bear-shaped fruit snacks that kids devour.  My toddlers love them and I am happy knowing they're getting some actual fruit. Of course my 4-year-old knows the difference, but these are all I keep in the house now and she eats them anyway!
