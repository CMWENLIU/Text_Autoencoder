I have one great vice in life.  Sweet, sweet caffeine.  Oh, how I love it so.  For a man who has a habit of burning the candle at both ends way too often, caffeine is like a breakfast essential (as well as lunch, dinner, and several other times during the day)!  However, coffee really irritates my stomach, and I'm not a big tea fan.  Until I found Element, my only previous answer for this problem was soda (because I am also not exactly the No Doze or Vivarin type - "Look, I'm wide awake!  Boy does my stomach hurt and I've really got to go to the bathroom, but after that, it's go time!").  For those of you soda lovers out there, I understand your struggle.  "Do I drink the diet soda that tastes like crap because of artificial sweetener, and lie to myself that it tastes good just long enough to get that sweet, sweet caffeine into my system?" OR "Do I drink the regular soda and gain 5 pounds...today?!!"  Folks, your search for a solution is over.  I give you Element Caffeinated Water!!  And, if you are super Amazon-savvy like me, you were smart enough to search under caffeinated water and discover Water Joe as well (ha ha).  I'm not going to lie, they taste almost identical - in that they are both water!!  Once you purify/distill water, there can only be so much variance in taste without added flavors, which make it less pure.  However, there is one added difference.  Element includes an extra ingredient in their water, along with the caffeine, to help improve focus and concentration while the caffeine does its job of keeping you awake and amping you up for whatever it is that you are trying to confuse your exhausted body into doing!  I realize that I can get down from my soapbox (podium for those of you who need a younger reference) after complaining about adding things like flavors to water, making it less pure, while meanwhile the caffeine itself is an additive - even if it is a naturally occurring source of caffeine.  However, HELLO!!!  Which part of "caffeine is my one great vice in life" did you not understand?!!
