Although this is listed as Cat Food it does adequately meet the dietary needs of hedgehogs.  Most commercial hedgehog foods on the market are mostly filler and contain little nutritional value for hedgehogs.  However, there are various top end cat foods that contain the necessary fat/protein levels to sustain a healthy hedgehog and avoid fatty liver related cancers and diseases.  This is one of the few cat foods I have found which a) provides the proper nutritional balance for my hedgehog and b) he seems to enjoy eating immensely!  I would recommend this to anyone raising a hedgehog who wishes them to be healthy and happy.
