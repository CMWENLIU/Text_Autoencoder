If you start reading cat food labels you will discover few that have the quality of ingredients that this one does.  Well, actually you will discover some - probably in a nice pet food store - but good luck getting your cat to eat it!<br /><br />One of my cats used to be pre-diabetic, asthmatic, and overweight.  At that time his diet was exclusively Iams.  My vet, who has done much research on various foods, has a list of cat food she recommends.  Of all the expensive and exclusive brands of food, the Fancy Feast Turkey & Giblets Feast and the Gourmet Chicken Feast really made a difference, and my other more finicky eaters loved it!  The 'problem cat' is no longer asthmatic, has lost weight, and is not pre-diabetic.  Plus, everyone who sees him can't get over what a fantastic shiny coat he has.  Now I buy these two flavors exclusively.  I highly recommend this product.
