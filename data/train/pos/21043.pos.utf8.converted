Both Bengal Spice and the very similar Celestial Seasonings product, Gingerbread Spice are my faves. I make sun tea in my backyard then pour the tea over ice for a very refreshing herbal 'tea' drink that doesn't need sugar, or lemon to quench a thirst. Here in the Southwest where summers are long, hot & dry, it's important to stay hydrated & this is a great pick-me-up.<br /><br />* This is a non-caffeinated tea<br /><br />(There's one other thing I do with Bengal Spice that might surprise you. When making jam or jelly, I sometimes swirl a bag or two in the hot jam a minute or two before pouring it in the jars. It adds a delightful exotic tone to some plain-jane jam recipes.)
