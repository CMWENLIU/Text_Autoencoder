I innocently sat in my hair colorist's chair one day and was offered a Fizzy Cola.<br /><br />I had never tasted anything better than this treat. Sweet and sour and chewy, sugar,<br /><br />yes. However.. no flour, butter or dairy...this was it!  I was addicted that day and spent two years trying to find them.<br /><br />They are addictive...hence the beware notice.  The grapefruit isn't a disappointment either.
