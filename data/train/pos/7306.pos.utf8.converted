I started using this when my son was 6 months old and have loved it from the first day. I truly wish this was around when I had my first! It is so easy and I didn't feel like I was making separate food for my baby, but rather making him a part of what we were eating. The all-in-one is so perfect. Before I had to steam everything separately then transport into a blender or mixer (which are not designed to puree effectively) and then move again to jars/bowls/storage. Ugh..I felt like a short order cook. With the Baby Brezza, it was simple steps to great food. I also found that I used it for the rest of the family to make berry sauce for oatmeal, yogurt, pancakes, chicken and pork, homemade applesauce in a snap, great guacamole for the whole family and so much more. So if your fear is that "this will just be another gadget in your cupboard" after the baby becomes a toddler, don't worry. This is a product that will become a permanent part of your kitchen for many years. And...easy clean up! I highly recommend.
