This company has great items, especially for children on a gluten-free or gluten-free + dairy-free diet. I have one special diet child and one who doesn't have to be on one, and both adore these cookies. They are great to take to school too. I suggest trying all of Cherrybrook's gluten-free items, especially if you have a mixed household -- no one will feel slighted with these!
