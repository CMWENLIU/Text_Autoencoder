Sometimes you just don't know when you buy things on line, but I am extremely pleased with Black Mountain Gold Coffee. I really enjoy my coffee and I have tried plenty of them, but this coffee is some of the best I have ever tasted. You can smell the rich fresh aroma when you open the bag. Finally, somebody gets it with flavored coffee. I have never tasted more delicious flavors. All of the flavors that I have tried so far are great, but I am not a big Amaretto fan so I won't be drinking that one. I had nothing but compliments from my wife and friends. Thanks Black Mountain Gold for making a product with old fashioned quality.
