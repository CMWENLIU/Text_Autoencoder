After stumbling across the Appletini mix and really liking it -- I was thrilled to find Appletini, Mojito, and Margarita in a single package so I could try all three.  These are a delicious and novel alternative to the more traditional Crystal Light flavors.  I keep coming back to order more.  The Appletini is tart and apply, the mojito and margarita have a strong tart/citrusy taste.  All three flavors are refreshing; none were too sweet for my tastes.<br /><br />Each container contains five foil packets.  Each foil packet makes two quarts.  If you typically use single-serving packets of drink mix and don't plan to make this by the pitcher-full, you'll need to be careful to get the right amount of powder, cause it is easy to mix it a little too strong.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I put these in Christmas stockings for my sister and sister-in-law, and I served some to a friend for lunch one day, with so-so responses.  I don't think that any of them share my level of enthusiasm.  I still like it -- but if you're not a Crystal Light drinker generally, and prefer fresh-squeezed lemonade or just sparkling water, this might be a little artificial for your tastes.
