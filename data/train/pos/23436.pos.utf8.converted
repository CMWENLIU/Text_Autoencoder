There aren't enough words to express how much I love this coconut oil!  I got one jar for cooking and one for my skin and hair.  And, now, I don't ever want to be without it.  I went no-poo about 6 weeks ago and my scalp and hair is so happy! My eczema and dandruff has been under control like never before since I started using coconut oil.  If you have eczema and/or dandruff, soak your hair and scalp with coconut oil, put a plastic cap on (to avoid a big mess) for about 2 hours and then vigorously wash it out thoroughly with very warm forceful water. Apply a detangler (not the spray-on leave-in type); rinse it out after 3 minutes and while hair is soaking wet, massage in a small to medium amount (depending on hair length) of coconut oil as a leave-in conditioner.  Don't worry coconut oil is absorbent and it doesn't cause oil stains.  Style hair as usual...
