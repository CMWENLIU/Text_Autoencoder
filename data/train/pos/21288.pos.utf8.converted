I've been a Sanka fan ever since my Mother introduced me to this gourmet coffee when I was a kid. The flavor is full-bodied yet mild; smooth and uniquely satisfying. It reminds me of the excellent coffee I had while staying in Costa Rica one summer.<br /><br />A medley of the finest Arabica beans harvested from a multitude of premium world-class coffee plantations is used here and it shows! I blend in Coffee-mate Belgian Chocolate Toffee Creamer and the taste is to die for!<br /><br />Many of the finest hotels and restaurants offer their guests this same Sanka decaffeinated coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the masses, Kraft Foods doesn't promote the "Sanka" brand heavily because it competes with the sales of Maxwell House Decaffeinated Coffee. Too bad because Sanka is clearly superior to the Maxwell House labeled offering.<br /><br />As someone here mentioned, it is difficult to find Sanka in the local supermarkets - making this a great find!
