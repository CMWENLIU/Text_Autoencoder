I have been drinking this brand for as long as it has been available. I enjoyed that I could order the 8oz boxes in bulk as the savings is enormous compared to what I might find locally, plus you can mostly buy vanilla flavor as a three pack, and I just find that too sweet. Great for travel and when you just need the Calcium dose, without the soy or dairy which I am allergic to.<br /><br />Every morning, with so many diet restrictions, I look forward to a hot bowl of the rice milk, into which I add two gluten free cereals that I buy in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for making this product available in the smaller quantities. I know in a week the family will be going away for a few days and I know longer have to think of taking the large container and worrying whether or not there is a refrigerator.<br /><br />Is this taste delicious? I would say that it is a taste I have grown to love and that it feels good to have options that my health situation can tolerate.....this make it even more tasty!
