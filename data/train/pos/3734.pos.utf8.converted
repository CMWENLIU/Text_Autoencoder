If you don't live in or close to a metropolitan area, chances are you won't find taramosalata in your grocery store unless your town has a sizeable Greek population.  Krinos is one of the finest brands, and the shipping for the item is well within reason.  I had tried a store in Manhattan (I live 80 miles away) and the shipping was $30!!! You can't beat this price.  Immediate delivery.
