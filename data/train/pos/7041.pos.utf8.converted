Lakewood Organic Pink Grapefruit Juice surpasses even fresh squeezed in balance and quality. It's perfectly balanced without a hint bitterness or unripe "green" taste. It does not disappoint. There was no separation or sediment in the bottle. The pulp was very fine and almost indiscernible in my mouth. This is really a "must try" product.
