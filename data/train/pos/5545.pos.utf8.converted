I have tried the rice based pasta in my efforts to go Gluten Free, but the consistency was too different for me to fool myself and my family . . . we just weren't used to it.  So, I tried Mrs. Leeper's Pasta and we're sold.  I have made Lasagna, Spaghetti, Alfredo, etc. and you can barely tell the difference.  I'm glad I can continue making the dishes we love without compromising the texture and flavor.  I highly recommend this product!
