I don't see a down-side to this product. The first ingredient is chicken, it has other stuff like carrots and blueberries further down the list, my cats eat it, and it's inexpensive!<br /><br />The food came in earlier this week, and I've already mixed it into the old food for my two cats. They don't eat around the Premium Edge pieces, which they would usually do with a new food, so I know they like it. Plus I've given them a piece or two on the sly once or twice [shhhh!].<br /><br />I'm a little mad at myself for not thinking of Amazon for my cats' needs sooner! I mean, this big bag of food, for almost half what it usually costs me locally, and delivered to my door for free! A great find!
