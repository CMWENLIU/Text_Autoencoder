After discovering PG tips on Amazon, I was on the hunt for all my favourite home comforts (not great for the diet, but heh, you only live once and I wouldnt otherwise get them until I head home for a trip).  So for great price and convenience, this is one of my favourite sweet (candy) - combination of chocolate and honeycomb sweetness, light yet mourishly delicious.  I am not kidding.  If you have a sweet tooth, for once in your life - try it and see that I am not kidding.
