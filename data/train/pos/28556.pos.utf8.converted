Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.
