These are very dense, moist snack bars; could even be a meal replacement if you're up for something smallish. There's actually 5 flavors of these, but I believe only this one (Banana Walnut) and the Chocolate Chip one are available right now (and I can't recommend the Chocolate Chip one, it does not taste good to me). I look forward to trying the Brownie and Peanut Butter versions, as well as the Cranberry one. But these are excellent.<br />Each bar contains 5g fiber, 12g whole grain, and 6g of protein. More info on this product and their other things at [...]. I only just heard of this company the other week when a relative gave me one of their bars, but their products look great (if a bit pricey; but high-quality costs more).<br />Update: these are all made much better by warming them up: remove from package, and heat them for 10-15 seconds in the microwave. Makes them smoother and softer, like soft cookies just out of the oven.
