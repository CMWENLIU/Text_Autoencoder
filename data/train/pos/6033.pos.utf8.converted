Why Wheat Gluten? It's a cost saver when I make breads. Gluten is removed in the manufacture of general purpose flour. The main difference in "bread flour" at the store is that gluten has not been removed or it's been added back in.<br />Adding your own gluten to bread recipes is a more cost effective way of improving the texture of bread than buying the expensive "bread flour."<br />Hodgson Mill Vital Wheat Gluten works well and is moderately priced.
