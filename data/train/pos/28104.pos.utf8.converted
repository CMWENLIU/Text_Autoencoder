I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag.  As a good ole Oklahoma girl, I live for my iced tea.  And my tea MUST be sweet, but sugar isn't an option.  So SPLENDA to the rescue.  We use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my Daddy has developed diabetes.  The big bags are often out at our local grocery store, so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem!
