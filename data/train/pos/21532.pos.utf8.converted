I can't say enough good about Eden's Wakame.  I absolutely love it and prepare a simple raw wakame salad from one 2.1 ounce package at least once a week. Furthermore and most importantly to me as a raw vegan resident of Florida, it is a must have in my hurricane pantry for it soaks quickly providing a highly nutritious fresh green vegetable.  This product is truly a delicious and nutritious gift from the sea. I should also add that it is a good buy here at Amazon.
