My father has always had a thing for Banana Laffy Taffy but not the other flavors...a couple of years ago we couldn't find it anymore except in the mixed packs...not even at our local wearhouse store...so when I found this I decided to give it a shot...it was as fresh as the day it was made...we now have a source for all the Banana goodness my dad could ever want...it made for a great gift from Christmas because for once he could guess what he was getting...If your giving it as a gift be sure to put it in a sealed plastic bag or two before wrapping or the person you are giving it to will be able to tell what it is from the smell.
