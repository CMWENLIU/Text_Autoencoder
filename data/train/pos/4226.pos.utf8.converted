A distributor for foods here in Vegas gave me a package to try and I fell in love with it. I couldn't find it anywhere. Then I heard it might be a WalMart, and sure enough it was! I bought two packages and just finished a big bowl of spaghetti. On a hunch I checked Amazon and lo and behold it is here and on PRIME no less! Another reviewer echoed my same feeling that it is the perfect blend of rice and corn, so the corn doesn't overwhelm the sauce. Bravo!!!! I'll be making this pasta our household standard from here on. No more need to look. This is it!<br /><br />Vicki in Vegas
