I purchased this product out of curiosity -- to see if it would work differently (or as well) in my homemade yogurt than the instant powdered milk. And oh, yes, there's a big, big difference -- in taste and consistency (in the liquid milk *and* the yogurt). Based on the cost of instant dry milk around here (GA), it's quite a bit less expensive too -- you use less of it to make a quart than with instant.<br /><br />While I've heard that this form of milk is harder to mix, I didn't find it that much different from reconstituting the instant version, except that I needed to use warm water instead of cold. I did have a first trial that gave, ahem, unexpected results. ((YMMV, of course -- but if you end up needing to use a whisk, and plan to use the milk for yogurt, you might get an interesting "bubble effect" texture in the finished product. :))<br /><br />On my next experiment, also with warm water (just under 120 degrees), a few rounds of patient (slow) spoon-stirring was all it seemed to take -- I just waited a minute in between stirings. In each case, adding the nearly-room-temperature starter-yogurt made the temperature just right for the yogurt-maker. (If you use warm water and plan to use the milk for drinking, you'll want to refrigerate until chilled -- in other words, plan ahead.)<br /><br />So again, the mixing process is a little different, but not that much different -- and the results are very much worth the little bit of extra care. To me, the chilled liquid tastes as good as regular milk from the store -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about powdered milk!<br /><br />Just a couple of downsides to mention, though they're minor:<br /><br />- I wish there were mixing directions on the package -- how much powder to use to how much water. But I eventually found ballpark directions on the Internet. I used about a cup of powder and a bit over 3 cups of water to make a quart of yogurt, but it turned out so thick, I'll probably try a little less next time.<br /><br />- While the product packaging doesn't say this, I suspect this form of milk is the kind without the added Vitamins A & D that most store milks have. I get plenty of these vitamins from other sources, so it's not a deal breaker for me. It might be for you.
