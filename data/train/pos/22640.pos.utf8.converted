My family left Asia, so that we can eat Asian food imported to the USA.  Even more ironic that I'm in San Francisco, and I have to order from Amazon.com, rice that was imported to San Francisco, and have it shipped back to San Francisco.<br /><br />As far as rice goes, this is pretty expensive.  Asian markets sell rice for much less.  But if you're in the middle of some place without an Asian market, then this is a great deal.<br /><br />Some say they can tell the difference between different types of rice.  Supposedly, rice is like wine, coffee, et cetera.  A lot of different fragrances, taste, and textures.  I'm not that sophisticated.  But it works for me when I serve it with a stir fry.  The next day, I take the leftover rice & leftover stir fry, and make a fried rice.
