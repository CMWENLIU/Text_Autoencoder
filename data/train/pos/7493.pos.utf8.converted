Vegan. Natural. Traditional Swedish round kn&auml;ckebr&ouml;d rye crispbreads. Four large (~11"/28cm) round pieces per package. Each piece is approx. 312 calories and weighs 3.5oz/100g. Snap off any size piece as you like. Great with soups or with jams and marmalades.  Two rounds broken in half (4 half pieces) fit in a gallon size ziplock or you can store the whole ones in a large flat tupperware. Made with whole grain rye flour, yeast, water, and salt. My paternal grandfather was born in Sweden. [My mother's family is of French descent.] Siljans has been a tradition in my family for generations. Very happy to find that it is now available on Amazon. Highly recommended. Product of Sweden. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
