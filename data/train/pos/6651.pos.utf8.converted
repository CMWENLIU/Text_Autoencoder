These really give me a nice burst of energy. I drink one before the gym if Im dragging and they purk me right up!  I buy these at the gas station on the corner next to my gym for $1.99.  On here they work out to be $2.87 each with the crazy shipping charge. I was hoping to find these cheaper if I bought in bulk. So far, Im finding that my ritual of stopping and buying one at time on my way to gym is the cheapest option so far.
