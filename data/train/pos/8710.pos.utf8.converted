OK, I know some people will find it hard to get excited about tinned sardines.  But these are excellent quality and well priced, fat and fresh, usually just three or four beheaded fish per tin.  If you occasionally get an uncontrollable urge for sardines in virgin olive oil, as I do, these will do it for you.  I plate them in their own oil, sprinkle them with minced meyer lemon zest or some brine-preserved lemon, piment d'Espelette, a teaspoon or so of aged sherry vinegar, a generous pinch of fleur de sel and some snipped Italian parsley and chives.  Toast and butter slices of baguette and put them in a basket on the side.  Slice up an apple, grab some Picholine olives, pour a glass of chilled Muscadet, and you have a really tasty and very healthy meal (mega omega-3 in them thar sardines!) in under ten minutes.  Now I'm hungry!
