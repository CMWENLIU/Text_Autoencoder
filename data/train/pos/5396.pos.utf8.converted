$2.70 per pound on Subscribe & Save is the best price around for unsweetened shredded coconut, and this is PREMIUM coconut, too! If you get it and its HARD - COMPLAIN - because what you were sent was STALE! This coconut is another fine product from Bob's Red Mill! We freeze ours, vacuum sealing all but the bag we're currently using, and we never have to endure stale, tasteless coconut, even a year or more later. Frozen coconut works just great in ALL recipies, too, no need to thaw! Compare this coconut to that yucky American favorite called "angel flake" coconut which is LOADED with sugar, salt, preservatives, and WATER! You gotta order some of this! If you've never tasted REAL flaked coconut, you're in for a treat!
