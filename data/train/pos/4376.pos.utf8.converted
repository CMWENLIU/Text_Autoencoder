After a lot of trial and error I have decided that Stevia is the best substitute sugar product for me.  SweetLeaf is a good product because the Stevia is still in the powder form, not changed to a granulated form. Reading about stevia I found out that the basic powder or liquid form is better for your health and I find the taste just as good.<br />In our house we use SweetLeaf for coffee and tea, of course, but also cereal, oatmeal, fruit desserts and plain yogurt.  We have not missed regular table sugar.
