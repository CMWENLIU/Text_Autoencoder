After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year, I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth that sold it. Finally! America gets Senseo! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved. The medium and dark roast are my favorites. Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee. Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!
