Well, first of all, if you are already planning on getting a Xylitol sweetener anyway: Emerald Forest is made in the USA from American grown birch trees, unlike most other brands which, of course, come from China. And, as I'm sure you realize, if every american bought only $65 more per year in American products, we would produce literally hundreds of thousands of new jobs (that is not an exaggeration, but rather an estimation, as I cannot recall if the statistic is 200,000 or 300,000).<br /><br />Now, if you aren't sure about getting a Xylitol supplement, allow me to address some of your fears.<br /><br />First, what is Xylitol? It's the sap of Birch trees, gathered much like maple syrup, and dried into a crystal form.<br /><br />What does it taste like: almost exactly like sugar, though you may note a cooling sensation in your mouth. This is where the claims of 'mint flavored' arise from. I, personally, do not taste mint, simply feel the cooling. However, my father is convinced that there is a very mild spearmint taste. Regardless, there is no mint in the product, and it shouldn't create allergies.<br /><br />Why would you use it? Well, aside from being nutritionally superior to sugar, most people use xylitol for one of two reasons: to lower their carbs/calories while still eating/drinking sweets, or to improve their dental health. Xylitol has some mild antiseptic qualities, and has been conclusively shown to help keep teeth and gums cleaner and stronger (it is the main ingredient in all those dental health gums, like Orbit). If you have ever had sugar free gum, you have tasted xylitol- and I bet you couldn't even tell it wasn't sugar!<br /><br />Lastly, what about those upset stomach problems you're seeing in the one star review section? Too much, too soon. My father drinks his coffee with, I kid you not, six tablespoons of sugar. The first day we had Xylitol, he tried to pull that stunt using it. First off, since Xylitol is sweeter than coffee, he had to stop at four tablespoons before it became 'too sweet' (hard to believe he could comprehend such a thing...). But that much Xylitol on a body unused to digesting it gave him massive cramping and diarrhea for about half the day (not very long, and not very painful, just very, very annoying). START SLOWLY. Take no more than a teaspoon a day for the first week, and continue using sugar as you would- mix the two together. Wean yourself off sugar carefully.<br /><br />My father can now handle a few tablespoons in his coffee (which he drinks three-five times a day) with no upset, but he and I have been using it for weeks. Just be sensible, and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Finally, as stated above, this brand is a more trustworthy source for your Xylitol needs than Chinese brands (being sold by American companies, of course), but if you are still unsure, you might not want to spring for the 6-pack just yet. Luckily, you can easily obtain a 1lb bag from the same company, or you can go to your local health grocery and ask the staff if they have Xylitol (maybe also be branded as 'birch sugar'). When you're ready to make the change for real, and drop sugar entirely, you can certainly come back here and buy in bulk. No need to rush.
