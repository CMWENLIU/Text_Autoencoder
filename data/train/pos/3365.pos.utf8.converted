I give my dog a tablespoon of canned pumpkin daily to aid his digestive system but he sees it as the best treat! Libby's uses a variety of pumpkin that seems to have more fiber, less water, than other kinds of canned pumpkin. The difference in pumpkin variety, at least for my pup, makes a HUGE difference between it helping his tummy & adding to the problem. He only seems to benefit from the Libby's pumpkin, the other makes his diarrhea worse.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving a little canned pumpkin daily if your dog suffers w/ food allergies &/or digestive troubles - unusually it can help both constipation & diarrhea depending on what they're suffering with. Canned pumpkin can also help dogs who have have trouble w/ congested anal glands have fewer problems &/or lengthen the amount of time between needing them expressed.<br /><br />It's ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO TALK W/ YOUR VET BEFORE adding anything to your dog's diet to be sure it's the right thing for your dog - ALWAYS check w/ your vet first. Be advised that feeding too much, depending on your dog's needs, can cause diarrhea to be worse OR it could cause constipation. Talk to your vet FIRST & be sure to ask the appropriate amount & way to feed to your dog. The size of the dog is important to how much to give them daily, as is the state of their tummy. My dog is 55 lbs, has food allergies, & a tendency towards diarrhea & a tablespoon a day is enough to keep the balance for his tummy issues... enough to prevent diarrhea but not so much as to cause constipation. I give it to him off of a spoon, as a treat, but you can mix it w/ their kibble if they're an especially sloppy eater!<br /><br />Pumpkin, as well as sweet potato, is a terrific treat for dogs w/ food allergies. But again, check w/ your vet first!
