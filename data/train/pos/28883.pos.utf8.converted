I traveled to Brazil a couple of years ago and was astounded by how good the coffee was. I brought some home with me, but eventually ran out. I was pining for a cup of Brazilian brew when I decided to purchase this coffee online. I was not disappointed. It was so good, I shared one bag with my sister and another with a work colleague. It is authentically good Brazilian coffee!
