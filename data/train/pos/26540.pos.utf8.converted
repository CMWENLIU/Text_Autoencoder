The makers of this raw carob do a fantastic job.  I add a tablespoon to my PERO coffee, with Stevia to sweeten or honey, a drip of vanilla extract and silk soymilk, it tastes like hot chocolate, I drink it every day once or twice a day, like most folks drink coffee.  Being alergic to chocolate this raw carob really fills my cravings.  I really like the raw carob because it doesn't upset my stomach.  For some reason the roasted carob upsets my stomach.  I can't explain it, but raw tastes great!  Thank-You!!!
