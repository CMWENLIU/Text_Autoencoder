Wow very good.  Light and crispy with a great cinnamon and ginger taste.  I'm not a fan of ginger snaps actually, but these have a much lighter and not nearly as spicy taste. Remind me a bit of a graham cracker.  You can also eat a bunch as one serving, which is always a plus.  I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care.
