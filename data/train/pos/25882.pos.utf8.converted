They are sweet without being just another blob of solid corn syrup.  They have a wonderful fruit flavor and smell divine.  They don't have that fake smell.  They smell like real fruit.  Their smell has prompted several people to stop us and ask what our kids had because they wanted to go an buy some too.  They are a hit with kids and adults here.
