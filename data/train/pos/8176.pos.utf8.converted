I love this sauce. My favorite use is over grilled salmon. Try this: bed of greens (arugula or spinach are good), 1-1/2 oz feta cheese, about 1/2 c FRESH pineapple (can throw in some raspberries in-season),  8 roasted almonds, juice of half a lime and about 2 t good olive oil. Top with the grilled salmon (about 6 oz piece)which has been doused with a couple of tablespoons of the raspberry-chipotle sauce. Yum...about 14 points on the WW system but very low fat, high nutrition, lots of volume and tastes GREAT.
