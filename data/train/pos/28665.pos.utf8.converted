As other reviewers have noticed, this is not the cheapest goji berry product on the market.  However, in my experience, as with pretty much every other Sunfood Nutrition product [...] quality is unsurpassable.  I have tasted many goji berry products, and non are as soft and juicy as these little babies.<br /><br />In response to some of the other people who are objecting to the price, I have been to David Wolfe's lectures (the founder of the company that imports these gojis) and he has spoken of the extreme difficulty with proper quality control of goji berries.  They grow in China (and in Tibet) natively, and even many of the products out there that claim they are "organic" may not really be, as some of them can be tested and proven they are still sprayed with sulfur dioxide among other preservatives.<br /><br />Sunfood Nutrition has 4 checkpoints in China and in the export process to absolutely ensure the quality of their product is a high as they say it is.<br /><br />David Wolfe has stated that Sunfood is not at all trying to compete on price with cheaper products that are flooding healthfood stores and internet companies nationwide.  Their only passion is the highest quality available.<br /><br />By the way, I have tasted dozens of raw chocolate products (raw cacao) as well, and NO ONE has the consistent quality and taste of the Sunfood products.  Try it for yourself and see.
