...and yet another recipe, even easier:  Pour as much of whatever milk you like into a microwaveable mug.  Drop in 1/4 of a disc.  Microwave until YOUR microwave gets it as hot as you like.  Stir with a spoon (the chocolate will be all nice and melty) until it mixes up.  Kids might appreciate one extra tsp. of sugar, but I like it like this.  Good, good stuff.  Abuelita is good too, but this just that much better.
