Ethan was really great about getting the berries to us on time for the party. I also called him with some questions before I ordered and he was very helpful and easy to talk to. If you are going to order some miracle berries I would definitely get them from him.<br /><br />The miracle berries are awesome. I suggest eating them the day you get them or the day after. I ate them the day I got them and it the effect lasted for at least two hours. I tried them again a day later and it only lasted for about 45 minutes which is plenty of time to taste. Some friends tried the berries 2 days after we got them and the berries had little effect after that amount of time. They said it didn't last more than 10 min.<br /><br />This is a really fun idea for a party. And Ethan's Gardens is the place to get them!
