I don't even like candy that much, but these are so creamy and balanced, I get tempted to binge as well.  They have the great flavor of strong, rich coffee and enough sweetness to remind me of Vietnamese coffee, a Frappuccino, or really good coffee ice cream.<br /><br />If you like the flavor of good coffee, you'll be happy you tried them.
