I stumbled upon Optimum Rebound in the supermarket about 8 months ago. I was looking to change from typical granola because granola was so high in carbs. There was a sale on Nature's Path items, so after reading the box and being impressed with 10 grams of protein and six grams of fiber in a 3/4 of a cup serving I bought it. Boy, was I glad.<br /><br />The cereal tastes okay by itself, but mixed with 3/4 cup of yogurt it's terrific. (I used to eat the granola with yogurt too.) I top the whole thing off with fruit, a sliced banana and some other fresh or canned fruit. It's like starting off the day with an ice cream sundae that's good for you. I eat it for breakfast every other day. Even my doctor was skeptical, so I brought in a box to show him; 10 grams of soy protein, a complete protein, and 6 grams of fiber. I'm 72, not in such good health, and I live alone. The doctor and my family are worried about malnutrition. When I showed him the box and told him about my breakfast he gave me a pat on the back. Blood tests for protein in the blood are looking better too since I started on Maximum Rebound. By last fall they were normal.<br /><br />I buy Maximum Rebound on subscription. It comes out to about $3.15 a box. No freight! That's really competitive with the standard brand nutritional junk cereals out there. Even the health food store doesn't touch that price when they have it on sale. I heartily recommend it on subscription from Amazon.
