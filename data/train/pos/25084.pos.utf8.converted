This is a fairly large bag of Wakame---a good price for the amount. The product is not strips, but is small individual dehydrated pieces ready for rehydration. No cutting or chopping required unless you want smaller pieces. When rehydrated, it turns nice and green with the typical rehydrated Wakame texture. This is a quality product.
