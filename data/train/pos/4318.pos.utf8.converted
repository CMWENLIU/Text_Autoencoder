I must admit that, being the ripe old age of 31 and part-time middle-school teacher, I didn't quite understand the kids' fascination with Izze drinks.  They bright juice color and brighter, young-looking packaging caused me to theorize that these drinks were just the same-old stuff with a clever marketing angle.<br /><br />Then I tried one.<br /><br />The quality of the product is certainly outstanding.  Pomegranate is a trendy flavor these days, yet many of the pomegranate-flavored products on the market don't adequately reflect the fruit's unique flavor.  Izze, as it says on the can, "stays true to the fruit" and it is evident in the fact that their pomegranate drink actually tastes like pomegranate.  The flavor is full, yet not overpowering, and the flavor tends to stay in your mouth for some time.  Although the product is made with carbonated water, there is certainly no "coca-cola" quality to it.  There is not excessive carbonation, but rather the light carbonation of the water tends to enhance the flavor of the juice itself--yet another way in which Izze stays true to the fruit.<br /><br />It appears as if the middle-schoolers have a more refined taste than I gave them credit for.  Izze Pomegranate drink is excellent.  I highly recommend this product and will be sure to keep it around the house, myself.
