I'm not sure what everyone else uses this product for, buy I have a problem with acidic ph, and this product helps with that problem. Specifically, if I have eaten or drank things that make me too acidic, then I tend to get loose stools or diarrhea, and after taking half a teaspoon of this in water, within about 30 minutes, the problem is resolved. I highly recommend it.
