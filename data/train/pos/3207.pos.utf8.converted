Now that she has a baby sister (Bleu, a miniature Blue Heeler) I started to look for a new type of treat to help reinforce the training.  When Bella was little I used small pieces of hot dogs but I wanted to switch to something healthier.  Zuke's mini treats seem to work really well.  I use the chicken flavored ones and I am really impressed with both how much the dogs like them and how much they smell like real food.  I thought that I would make this quick video to show the treats (and my dogs) in action.
