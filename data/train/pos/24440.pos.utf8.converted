If you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for Bear & Wolf.  This is almost right off the hook good.  It has that "fishy" taste that I actually prefer, but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down.  If you've tried the Kirkland brand, which is delightfully pink and flaky, you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild.  I do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed ... some farming conditions are less than optimal (such a turn off).  This is wild Alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it.<br /><br /> On the label it says, "Satisfaction Guaranteed or your money refunded."  If you like that right off the hook taste, you'll love it.
