There are other, bigger bags of this product available here on Amazon, and many reviews have been written under the 2lb size.<br />The price fluctuates, so it makes sense to do a bit of comparison shopping.  I bought this packaging when it was about $10, which made it worth it.  If you want to save some $$, you can buy bigger package and share with a friend, or just store it in the freezer - it will last quite a long time.<br /><br />I have been drinking this for years, and as just about everyone else, really love it and recommend it.  It has a very pleasant taste, dandelion is 'good for you' and you can use it as a delicious beverage or as an coffee substitute, if you wish.  I usually add some stevia to mine, sometimes a little bit of half and half, could use rice or almond milk, some raw cacao powder, cinnamon, whatever sweeteners, "whiteners" or other enhancements you would put in the coffee and your imagination comes up with.<br />The amount to use will depend on your preferences.  Some people like theirs little less concentrated, I prefer mine strong, so I use quite a bit.  You can just play with it until you find your optimal powder-to-water ratio.<br /><br />Also, from my experience, it is a good idea to keep your supply in the fridge or the freezer, as it does absorb moisture and if kept at room temperature, it very quickly hardens into a block and you have to chisel it if you want it to dissolve.  Plus it loses the flavor, so it pretty much gets ruined.<br />I had to throw away sizable amount before I learned this, so what I started doing was putting whatever amount fits in a small glass mason jar with a plastic lid and keeping that in the fridge.  Whatever is left, stays in the original bag, gets put into a Ziploc bag and goes into freezer.<br /><br />Hope that helps and if you are sitting on the fence and want to just give it a try, definitely go with this size, I am sure you won't regret it!!
