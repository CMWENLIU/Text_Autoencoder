Extremely fresh, massive amount for the money.  I can't see ever buying a little $5 jar of Dill again, and we'll be buying other spices from this company.  The bag is not resealable, so we transferred it to three Zip-Loc type bags and put them back in the shipping bag so that light didn't hit it.  We'll probably have this stuff for a year now.
