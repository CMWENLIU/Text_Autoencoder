I've never been a fan of "energy bars" or "breakfast bars," but I'm hooked on Kashi GoLean Crunchy caramel bars. I eat one every day for breakfast and often have another after dinner in place of dessert.<br /><br />While other breakfast bars are either too small to satify you until lunch or too caloric/sugary to justify their status as a "health food," GoLean Crunchy caramel bars are substantial at 45 grams apiece and truly low-cal at 150 calories.<br /><br />Best of all, these bars do not taste like chemicals but, rather, like a healthy (high-fiber, high-protein) version of a chocolate-dipped rice krispie treat.  All GoLean Crunchy flavors are excellent, but the Peanut Butter and Almond versions pack a few more calories (180 and 170, respectively) than their caramel cousin.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by other breakfast bars that can't offer *both* good taste and low calories (there are plenty of "healthy" breakfast bars that run upwards of 300 calories each). GoLean bars are the real deal -- great-tasting and healthy.
