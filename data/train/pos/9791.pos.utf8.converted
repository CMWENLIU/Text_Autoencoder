I have tried a number of Ghee brands, and hands-down this is my favorite.  It tastes just like you melted your own butter and removed the froth from the top.  Luscious.  I use it to make eggs, and to saute vegetables.  It has never burned or oxidized during even very high heat browning.  Another benefit is that the makers only use grass-fed cows to make this ghee.  I'm totally hooked.
