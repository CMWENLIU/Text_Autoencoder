I grew up in Scotland, and I remember drinking 2 or 3 cups of tea a day, even as a child.  When my family and I came to the US and tasted Lipton Tea, we almost died! It didn't taste anything like "our" tea.  PG Tips has a smooth and very pleasant flavor, without being weak. So I must say, I am very happy to be able to purchase PG Tips at a very reasonable price from Amazon. My family used to have to have tea sent over from our relatives in the UK before Amazon was around! :)  Whenever friends come over and they try it, they ask what it is, thinking its some "high end" expensive loose leaf tea, so they are suprised when they see it comes in a bag.<br /><br />The flavor can be very strong if left to steep for a long time, but as with everything, it depends on each person's preference as to what they like.  I believe this tea is best suited to drink with milk, however it is also pleasant with a little sugar and slice of lemon.  Just remember, when making tea, to use BOILING WATER. I see so many people make tea with hot water, and it just doesn't taste the way it should when made that way.  If you don't believe me, make a cup with each type of water and test it yourself, I think you'll be very surprised.<br /><br />I highly recommend PG Tips, and have not found it less expensive than Amazon's price anywhere else.
