I have drank very many types of Rooibos teas over the past couple of years and Twinings, so far, is my favorite.  It's great hot or cold and especially iced!  I like to drink it with a packet of Sugar in the Raw over crushed ice with just a dash of lemon.  Really smooth and refreshing!  It isn't very strong tea so if that's your thing I would use 2 or 3 bags per serving.  It's caffeine free so it's ok to do that.  Try it out and you'll see!
