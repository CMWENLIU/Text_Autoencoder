I use Yorkshire Loose Tea most of the time, brewing it by the pot. But, sometimes for a quick cup, tea bags come in handy. Everything in my review for the loose tea holds true for Yorkshire's tea bags. Be advised they make strong tea. One tea bag will brew a 14 oz. mug of very good flavourful tea.<br /><br />This is definitely tea for the tea lover. Enjoy!
