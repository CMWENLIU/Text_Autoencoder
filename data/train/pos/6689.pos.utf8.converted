I love them! They're crunchy on the inside and smooth and creamy on the outside. They're basically biscuit (malt) balls covered in chocolate. We have a weak imitation over here (Whoppers), but Maltesers are much better, I think the chocolate is a better quality, or just smoother and creamier. Actually, I don't know if Whoppers or Maltesers came first, but I definitely prefer Maltersers.<br /><br />Get the 5 pack, in fact I once bought a 25 pack box and hid it from my wife. It lasted me one week and I had to see Dr. Johns, DDS soon after that.
