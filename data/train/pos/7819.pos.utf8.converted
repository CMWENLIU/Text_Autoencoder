This is a wonderful tea, very simple and refreshing.  This is my favorite hot weather drink.  But- a warning to all those ice tea drinkers out there: this tea isn't sweetened.  At all.  There's no lemon, mango, or sugar added.  It's just tea.  It happens to be really, really good tea.  It's flavorful but not strong, smooth and not bitter.  It is a very popular tea drink in Japan, available on every street corner, and it's very refreshing on humid days there.  Please try it with an open mind and enjoy!
