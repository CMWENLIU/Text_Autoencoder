This is a mix of lemon, rose and mint flavored turkish delight. It is a nearly no fat,  high carb treat with a mild flavor, a soft chewy texture and covered with powdered sugar. The sugar covering makes the colors hard to distinguish unless you look carefully or brush some of it off. I sometimes serve Turkish Delight with a sweet-tart dipping sauce made by mixing a TBS each of lemon juice and honey. Fans of the Chronicles of Narnia will remember that the Magic Turkish Delight was part of what induced Edmund to betray his siblings to the witch. Enjoy some in the safety of your home.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2CC">Hazer Baba Turkish Delight, Mixed, Lemon Rose Menthe, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>
