I have a daughter with a peanut allergy, so we're constantly on the lookout for products that she can enjoy.  Sun Cups are fantastic! What a great idea, to produce an alternative to that old standby of the peanut-butter filled chocolate cup. This product is far superior in flavor and quality to any similar product I've tried, with or without nuts etc. This is a gourmet product that stands on its own - not just an "alternative". The chocolate (especially the dark chocolate) is really as good as any gourmet chocolate I've had, including Belgian and French chocolates - in combination with the sunflower seed filling, it's just amazing. To boot, you can feel good about the socially responsible and sensitive way they're sourced and manufactured. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!
