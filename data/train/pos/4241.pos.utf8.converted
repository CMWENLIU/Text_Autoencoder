Torcik Wedlowski is a wondeful treat. First found it in Poland but until now I was unable to find on the net. Love the taste and recommend it for a something out of the ordinary. Rich, not too sweet and great looking.  The shipping and handling is high for a small purchase, but probably worth it since going to Poland costs a lot more.
