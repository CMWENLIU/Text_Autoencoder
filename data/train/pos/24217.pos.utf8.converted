WOW! This coffee is amazing...Backcountry coffee is probably the most consistant, freshest whole bean coffee I've experienced. The Espresso roast (Basecamp) is full bodied and aromatic. Unlike other beans that end up dry or overly coated with oils, this roast is consistant from bag to bag. This is an exceptional value for the highest quality, best tasting espresso roast I've had! I highly recommend this coffee!
