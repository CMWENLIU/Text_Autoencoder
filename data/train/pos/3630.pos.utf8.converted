It's just cocoa -- pure, raw, high quality cocoa -- with no ifs, ands, buts, or additives. Great for drinks (it helps to stir it with a bit of syrup or hot liquid first, because the natural cocoa butter tends to keep it on top unless it's emulsified into the liquid) and for baking. Hershey's Natural is not bad, but this cocoa tastes better and is always fresher. Worth the difference in price, especially if you buy at the subscription rate.<br /><br />By the way, the reviewers who complained that this cocoa isn't "dark" enough for them appear not to understand how chocolate is prepared. Dark chocolate is made by treating raw cocoa with lye. Since this product is truly raw, unprocessed cocoa, it will not have the same taste or color as chemically processed cocoa. If that's what you want, buy "dutched" cocoa (or Hershey's Special Dark, which is a mixture of processed and raw cocoa) instead. It will not be "natural," and will not have as much antioxidant activity, but it will be darker.
