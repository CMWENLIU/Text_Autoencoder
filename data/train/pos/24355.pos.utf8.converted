This product is definitely for licorice lovers.  There is an abudance of flavor and a slightly dense texture which I prefer over softer, or gummy versions of licorice candies.  That makes this particular brand and form of licorice my very top choice at present.  I think it's unlikely I'll find one I like more any time soon.  I don't buy it often, but when I'm really in the mood for a licorice flavored treat this is the one for me.  Well done Haribo!
