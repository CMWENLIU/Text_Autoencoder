I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. This gallon costs me only .41 cents an ounce. You cannot get that in Wal-Mart or anywhere else except right through Amazon. Tabasco sent me a free Tabasco salsa as well. Thanks to both great companies with excellent service, Tabasco and Amazon. Simply Bravo...<br /><br />I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco.
