We have two cats, one is a fat pig, and the other is normal.  The fat pig cat will eat anything so she doesn't count.  But the normal one doesn't like food much at all and only really eats when she has too.  She has always been a depressed little cat, not really enjoying anything in life.  We have tried all sorts of treats and she ignores all.<br /><br />We got there because she had dirty teeth.  Well these things are like crack for her.  I don't know how good they are cleaning teeth because we have been only using for a few months.  But she just hears the bag and she goes bonkers.  If we forget to give them she pesters us until we do.<br /><br />Crack for Kitties.  That's what they should be named.
