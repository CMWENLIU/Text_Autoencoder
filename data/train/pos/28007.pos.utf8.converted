I have my favorite K-cup coffee blends, but occasionally I want to explore new ones. This is a great way to try out some I wouldn't try otherwise. Most of the selections are really good. I'm still going back to my favorites, Tully's House Blend and Tully's Italian, and Tully's French (see the pattern here?) I love all of the Tully's selections. The ones in this pack were very good. I'm glad I got a chance to try them. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />By the way, they just come tossed in a box. There is no glossy packaging. That worked fine for me because I have bought these packages before. It helps to know that so you aren't surprised when you open up the box.
