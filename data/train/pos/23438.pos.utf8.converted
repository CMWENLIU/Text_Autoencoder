I've been using coconut oil for cooking and skin moisturizer for years. I've tried many brands, but the Nutiva is the best tasting and smelling for the price.  I wish it were possible to get it in glass to avoid the plastic exposure. This is the only coconut oil I buy, and I've found Amazon has the lowest price.
