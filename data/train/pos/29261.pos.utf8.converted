I love, love, love Carr's Ginger Lemon Cremes.<br /><br />Ginger and lemon are a natural combination. Usually the lemon is overwhelmed by the ginger, but in these cookies the lemon is just right.<br /><br />I also like these because I prefer ginger without molasses (ginger cookies, not ginger snaps).<br /><br />Since they're sandwich cookies, they're fun to eat. And once you start eating them, the flavor is so stimulating it's hard to stop.<br /><br />They're perfect as tea cookies - when people must mind their manners, not yield to temptation and slowly savor the whole package, one cookie right after another.<br /><br />I just wish the fat used in them were a bit healthier.
