I was skeptical at first, but my "wolfie" has been on a raw diet for a while, so this seemed like a good companion snack. Surprisingly, "dried" doesn't always mean lack of moisture, as these are some juicy morsels that keep my pet performing tricks for treats until I give out. Each one is a generous portion, even for my baby who's a pretty big boy, so I always slice them before feeding. It's also great to aid those sometimes finicky eaters, as an occasional sliced topper for meals. The package may seem small, but a little goes a long way.
