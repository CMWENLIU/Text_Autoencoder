I have two feral rescues who have lived with me since 2005.  One, Commander Fluffypants, I trapped as a young kitten.  He already had  considerable parasite damage to his intestines, and he has always been very very sensitive to what's in his food.  I tried feeding many high quality super premium diets before discovering inadvertently that Iams Indoor Hairball Control was a food that, unlike everything else I had tried, would not give him projectile diarrhea.  Less than two months later, I managed to trap his mother, Mary-Kate, right before she dropped four more kittens who went through the TNR group to wonderful adoptive homes.  I thought she would go back to her colony when her kittens were weaned, especially after that whole spaying thing, but she stayed inside and has been my strange little indoor feral queen ever since.  And she did fine on the Iams.<br /><br />Until about 6 weeks ago.  I do not know what changed.  She had some teeth pulled, but that was about a month before the trouble started.  At first, she was just yarfing about every other day, and it looked like maybe she was eating too fast from time to time, so I stopped filling their bowls and leaving the food down and gave her small amounts.  Didn't work.  I tried the feeding balls to slow her down.  Also didn't work, but I wasn't that concerned, because she was eating, drinking, using the box, and seemed fine.<br /><br />Until she wasn't.  She got really sick fairly quickly, and I was extra-worried for her, because she tolerates very little physical contact, which makes medical intervention difficult.  Her vet, a wonderful feral cat doctor, thought she might have developed a grain allergy, so I tried a couple of grain-free foods (thoroughly unsuccessfully) before this one.  She keeps this down just fine, and Fluffypants has experienced no ill effects from it.  They both are doing great, no stomach issues, no weight gain (after M-K got back up to her usual perfect self) and I credit the Felidae.
