Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  "dark brown sugar" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is "green cut." This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
