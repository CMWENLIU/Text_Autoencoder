I have been purchasing this calorie free chocolate syrup directly from Walden Farms for nearly a year now - and I absolutely love it! I add it to skim milk or drizzle it over fruit for a satisfying sweet treat - and it is great not to feel guilty afterward (smile)!<br /><br />I am truly amazed that Walden Farms is able to create such a great tasting sweet syrup without all the calories, sugar & fat - and they use mostly natural ingredients to boot!<br /><br />There is sodium in this chocolate syrup, so if you have to watch your sodium intake, be sure to check out the nutritional facts on the Walden Farms site to be sure it fits within your allowance.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend the Walden Farms calorie free chocolate syrup for anyone trying to lose weight, as well as those who need to reduce their sugar intake - it is a great way to satisfy your sweet tooth!
