All of my German shepherds are very picky when it comes to any food or treats, but they LOVE these treats. Although I won't give them the unhealthy processed stuff that is offered at most pet stores, I have tested numerous brands just to see what their reactions are and they walk away from all of it.<br /><br />I have had permanent vocal cord damage for over 3 years now and can't speak above a very low whisper. I was really nervous when I had to train my new male GSD puppy because I am unable to show any emotion with my voice. Loud praise and "good boys!" aren't possible for me.<br /><br />Instead, I strapped a treat pouch on my waist filled with these treats. In no time I had him behaving like a perfect little gentleman - all because he knew he was being a good boy everytime I gave him a treat!<br /><br />That puppy is now 3 years old and we live on over 6 acres of land that's filled with all kinds of wildlife - bunnies, deer, coyotes, fox, etc and with these treats (and of course LOTS of love) I have even been able to train him to stay right beside me when he sees or hears another critter. Anyone who has spent even a little time with a German shepherd knows that they love nothing more than to chase after all kinds of animals.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about these treats - they are the only one's I can recommend 100%. Buy with confidence and know that your dog will LOVE them!
