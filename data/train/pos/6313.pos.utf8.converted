These are great!  When we were kids, my parents used to buy us a box of our favorite cereal (cereal was a 'treat' in our house) as one of our Christmas gifts.  In contrast to the rest of the year, we didn't have to share 'our' box with any of the other kids.  The oldest of my younger sisters favorite cereal was Lucky Charms.  After getting her box, she would sit down with two bowls and sort the cereal from the marshmallows.  She'd dump the cereal back in the box and eat it as you normally would cereal.  But the marshmallows, she'd keep those aside, eating them like candy.<br /><br />Now, all grown up, she still loves Lucky Charms, and her two boys, 6 and 7 love them as well.  For Christmas this year, she decided to give them a special surprise from 'Santa'.  She saved an empty Lucky Charms box and the bag.  I had a gold burnishing cream that we used to burnish the box a gold color, but allowed the picture to show through underneath.  Then we filled the bag with these marshmallows and sealed it with my Seal-A-Meal.  Her boys were so surprised when they got up on Christmas morning and found a 'magic' box of cereal from Santa - with only marshmallows (the most important part) inside!<br /><br />My sister was happy, too, because it only took two of the three bags of these marshmallows to fill the box, which meant she had an extra bag to enjoy herself.  Win-win!
