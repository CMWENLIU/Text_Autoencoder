I tried both this brand and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand of ghee because as far as I can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows, which I was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits.<br /><br />I'll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department. It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.<br /><br />That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.<br /><br />So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand ghee.
