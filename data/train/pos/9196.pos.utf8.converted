These sardines are fantastic - probably why they stopped offering them. Actually, they spoiled me from regular sardines; after you eat these, the skin and tails and bones of regular sardines tend to make you quesy.  These have a mild flavor, so even if you don't like sardines, you may changer your opinion after these...<br /><br />I eat them, one tin per day, at work - much to the dismay of my co workers.  Then I crumble some whole wheat crackers and spices into the fish oil and olive oil left over, let it absorb, and chug it down! Omega-3 fatty oils, protien, and olive oil! You cannot go wrong, and here in Butler (30 miles N. of Pittsburgh) Giant Eagle charges 2.99 per tin...so you save as well.<br /><br />Eat. Get Healthy. Annoy your weak-stomache co-workers (smak your lips, smile, sigh as you eat). Can you go wrong? I think not.
