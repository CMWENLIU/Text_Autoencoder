I was introduced to Zevia by a friend.  This is the "cleanest" pop you will find and it is delicious!  The grapefruit is my favorite but all have been really good. Warning to those who have NEVER tasted anything with Stevia in it be prepared for a different taste.  I recommend you use stevia in other foods to get accustomed to the taste before forking out the $$$ for this.  If you haven't had stevia before then you probably won't care to much for it.  In my opinion stevia is an acquired taste...which now I love!  I like the fact that I can give this to my kids with worrying about what the harsh chemicals and sugar are going to do to them!  They both love it too...especially the orange and grape.  Even my husband likes the rootbeer!  I can't wait to get the rainbow pack in this week!!  Yummy!
