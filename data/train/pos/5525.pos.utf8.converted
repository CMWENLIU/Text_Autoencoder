These Kashi bars are awesome!  I've tried Kashi products before and was really not all that impressed.  I saw this flavor and I LOVE coconut and chocolate together.  I thought I would give them a try but thought they would at best be tolerable.  To my surprise they are wonderful.  They have a thick coat of dark chocolate not a sparse little drizzle.  They are only 120 calories and make a great snack.  I will buy more of these.
