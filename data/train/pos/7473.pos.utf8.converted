Now I can eat chocolate everyday!  These are really good in yogurt and I know I'll find more uses.  I will definitely buy this product again, most likely in bulk.  I'm a health food junkie and nibs will probably be a new staple in my diet.  In case you're wondering, I thought these were bite-size (from the picture) but they're actually little flakes.  You shouldn't compare the taste to "normal" chocolate because all you really taste is the tons of added sugar.  There is no sugar in these, think bitter cocoa powder.
