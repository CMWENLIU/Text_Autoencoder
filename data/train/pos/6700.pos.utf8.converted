I ordered the 6 pack even though the price was high just to try it.  It arrived last night and all the ice cream was still frozen if sitting on my porch all day...great packaging.  Anyway, I tried the chocolate peanut butter.  Of course, it's not as good as say a pint of Ben&Jerry's...but it was pretty good.  Good chocolate flavor, and enough like ice cream that your cravings are satisfied without all the fat and calories.  As a runner, I think I've found the perfect recovery snack after a long, hot summer run!  Lots of protein and some carbs as well.  I just wish it was more affordable.
