This is a Nut Milk Bag by The Raw Food World sold by RawReform--sorry, coudn't do the product link on this one. Holds a large quantity. Easy to use and easy to clean! Very close mesh material. I first saw this bag in the "Spunky Coconut Cookbook"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439235767">The Spunky Coconut Cookbook: Gluten Free, Casein Free, Sugar Free</a>and I love it! I have used storebought nut/coconut/alternative milks over the years because I didn't want to mess with making my own. This bag makes it easy and economical to do it yourself! The nice thing is you know exactly what's going into your beverages because you are putting it there! Try it yourself! You won't look back! Also this looks good too:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21KYK">Nut Milk, Juicing and Sprout Bag - Amazing Nutmilk Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UEPGFY">Amazing Nut-Milk Bag from Elaina Love's Pure Joy Planet</a>
