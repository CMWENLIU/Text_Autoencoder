I love this coffee: not weak ... not strong.  I took the coffee maker and this particular blend to my office a week ago.  My co-workers are now asking if they can have a cup (nope - let 'em buy their own).  Worth every cent. I have changed from a 2 cup/coffee a day to a 3 cup/coffee a day drinker. Highly recommend this coffee maker and blend.
