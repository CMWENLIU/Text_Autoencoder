TLDR: Its so good that its almost addictive. Stay away or get addicted for life.<br /><br />So I am a sucker for Saag. Its my favorite food in the universe (yes for me, it even beats medium cooked steak). Unfortunately in Seattle I have had a lot of trouble finding it. Its available very rarely in some seasons.<br /><br />I stumbled upon these on amazon and ordered 12 cans that arrived in two days. Here is how I made it<br />1.) Heated oil<br />2.) Fried pieces of garlic, ginger and chopped green pepper.<br />3.) Added red chilli pepper<br />4.) Added one can and let it cook for 5 minutes.<br /><br />And the result is nothing short of phenomenal. The taste was so amazing that I had tears of joy. I cannot stop thinking about it and cannot stop eating. I am hooked!<br /><br />All I need to do is to figure out how to order enough to last me for a lifetime.
