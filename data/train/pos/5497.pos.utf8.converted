I bought the Fi-shock kit to keep a raccoon out of my small backyard pond. The raccoon was destroying my water plants, and I later learned that they love water hyacinth (it's like candy to them).<br /><br />After I set up the fence, I didn't have a single attack for a whole summer.<br /><br />This year, I am setting up a garden in the back, and know from experience that raccoons will attack the corn I'm planning to grow. I think I'm going to order a new kit and use that rather than attempt to build an ugly fence or cages for my raised beds. During the day, I can turn off the system and the wires will still keep out my small dog and child.
