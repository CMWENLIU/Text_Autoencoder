I've always preferred butter to other spreads. I lived in New Zealand almost 7 years. New Zealand butter is the best I've ever had. I've tried others available in gourmet stores, but have never had anything better. After moving back to the U.S., I started buying it in bulk and freezing it. I was really spoiled in New Zealand when it was readily available! When I first got some after being back in the U.S. for several years, my daughter pulled a Paula Deen and ate it strait off a plate. I've seen the happy cows and happy cows = awesome butter. Now if I could just get some New Zealand triple cream brie in the U.S.... New Zealand butter is the most prized commodity in my kitchen.
