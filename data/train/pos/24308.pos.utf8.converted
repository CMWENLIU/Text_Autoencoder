First of all the shipping on this product was super fast and took me by surprise.  Second the quality of this product is outstanding.  Finally in Iowa I can drink some restaurant qualiy and tasting Thai tea.  Although the package does not indicate this, sweetened condensed milk is also amazing as a sweetener.  That is how my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago prepares it.  So basically if you're looking for quality, a great price and authentic Thai taste, this product is what you're looking for!
