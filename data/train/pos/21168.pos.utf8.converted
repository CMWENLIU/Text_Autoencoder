Don't know why I decided to try my spelt flakes with my oatmeal but I did and am so glad I decided to experiment! I do 50/50 oatmeal/spelt. It makes the oatmeal  chewy, which I like and so does the little one with whom I share my breakfast! I like them so much I have them delivered regularly by Amazon so I don't run out.<br /><br />Little hint.... I have saved up little butter tubs(8 oz. ones). I spread them out on the table, put 1/4 cup of oatmeal in each, add 1/4 cup of spelt flakes to each and top off with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in each. Top goes on and I stack them on the pantry shelf. Time comes to eat, I dump the contents in a bowl, fill the butter tub with water, which I pour over the cereals, pop them in the microwave for 2 min. (on my microwave) and I have a quick yummy breakfast!
