Bought these to replace the Equisicat crystals and Heartfelt beads in my fridgadors and couldn't be happier. They are crystal clear, round, hold water well, self regulate around 70% RH (68 RH for me), have zero smell and are a priced right. I can't get these around the Bay Area in CA, only Equisicat crystals and like these much better. The are identical to beads that costs much more that are marketed specifically for cigar but is essentially the same product for all intensive purposes.
