I have enjoyed nong shim's flavorful ramyun offerings for 10 years now.  I only recently saw their Black label product and hesitantly indulged as it was $2 a pack.  worth it for me.  I think i like it a little better than their classic "gourmet spicy" and am now subscribing for a case every 6 months.  It has beef and beef bone flavorings, perhaps an acquired taste, but they are well executed for an instant product.  It's less piquant than the "gourmet spicy" classic flavor, but very rich in taste thanks to the beef bone extract and other seasonings.  If you like nong shim's gourmet spicy, you'll probably like this.  I like pork bone ramen (Tonkotsu) and really like this as it has the same milky richness in the broth.  I am excited that it's relatively lower sodium (920mg per serving=half pack) than most similar products and apparently has no added MSG... with so much flavor they apparently don't MSG or so much salt.<br /><br />*edit- to other folks that prefer gourmet spicy... i agree that is a classic but enjoyed these more: very good broth especially, less heat but more rich flavor than gourmet spicy.  the lack of sumptuous hunks of freeze dried beef doesn't bother me, I'll garnish mine with whatever I have in the fridge.  I'm disappointed amazon has raised the price somewhat, a case was about $10 cheaper in december.  If you're hesitant, try a single pack at your local korean grocer before you get a case.
