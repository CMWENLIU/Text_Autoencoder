Yes, it's true:  I've never been so impressed with a consumer gadget in my life.  In fact, it changed my life, awakening an interest in urban gardening.  Having proceeded to get up to my chin in hydroponics, I bought 5000 shares in Aerogrow (pretty cheap at its current price).<br /><br />I received my first Aerogarden (I have two) as a gift.  The first thing I grew was lettuce.  You don't know what you're missing until you've yanked fresh leaves off of living lettuce right on your kitchen counter to put in your sandwich!  So simple, so fresh (no refrigeration!).  Anyone who buys lettuce regularly should consider replacing that habit with this, the 7-pod Aerogarden.<br /><br />The complaints that interest me the most are those regarding the cost of seed kits, the failure of supplied seeds to germinate, or the failure of plants to grow adequately.  Currently I have one Aerogarden going.  The only Aerogarden-supplied plant in there is a cherry tomato.  The others I supplied myself: three pods are growing miniature Mexican sour gherkins (a sort of miniature cucumber) and another is growing purple tomatillos.  The remaining two pods I am using for experiments.  I asked myself, could I germinate fruit trees in my Aerogarden?  The answer is yes.  An apple seed (simply from a grocery store apple) is now a four-inch "tree", and an orange seed is just starting to get going.  I have also grown small varieties of eggplant and sweet peppers to (delicious!) maturity.  So, I recommend that you acquire your own seeds rather than rely on the Aerogarden seed kits.  (Do consider whether a given plant will fit the dimensions of the Aerogarden.  I started an okra plant in it and it did too well, too fast--for one thing, I didn't know that okra leaves are gigantic!)  In fact, I think the company should give up on the seed kits and just concentrate on selling the basic things you need to plant your own seeds (like the sponges).  They do already offer these items, by the way.<br /><br />The Aerogarden is not a Ronco-like novelty item.  It is simply hydroponics made simple.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no other all-in-one hydroponics setup available.  The closest competitor was the Prepara Power Plant, now no longer manufactured.<br /><br />If you were to put together a similar set-up yourself (which you can do, as the construction is easy to understand), you would find that your $100 would not buy much more than a proper lighting fixture and light bulbs.  Incidentally, the light has a marvelous daylight quality which I find brightens the mood of the room.  This might be a consideration for you if you live far north (esp. in Seattle, I would think!).<br /><br />I haven't noticed any reviews that mention placing an Aerogarden in an office.  While the 3-pod and 6-pod models might be slightly too noise for that setting (they operate on a different principle), the 7-pod model is whisper quiet and would, I think, be just as welcome in an office or lobby as an aquarium.
