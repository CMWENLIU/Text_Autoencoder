This oil is the best, I am a cooking aficionado and after trying dozens of oils this is my favorite all-around for cooking. I use Lodge Logic cast iron to cook and have had the best results using this. The quality is superb. The oil is light and healthy. It's great for anything from salad dressings to saut&eacute;ing. If you want a raw sunflower oil this is not it, this seems to be slightly processed to refine and deodorize so I suspect the raw sunflower would have additional nutritional benefits, but might not be as versatile for cooking.
