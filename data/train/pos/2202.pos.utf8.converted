I have spent the better of my adult life chasing locations for Skinner's Raisin Bran. And the quest has always been worth the journey, when I can find it. Like one other review states...I,too, think that there must be a Skinner's Cult! I could be their leader. My first taste was when my Grandpa bought me a box...and that was around 56 years ago. Hooked instantly! If you are NOT one of their sugar junkies, that our generation created..you will LOVE this cereal!
