I HAVE BEEN USING HODGSON BREAD MIX PRODUCTS SINCE I PURCHASED A BREAD MACHINE. I HAVE USED THE 9 GRAIN MIX,THE CARAWAY RYE,ACTUALLY ALL THE MIXES. I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH THESE PRODUCTS AND HAVE RE-ORDERED MANY TIME. ACTUALLY , IHAVE A SHIPMENT ON THE WAY. THEY ALWAYS ARRIVE INTACT IN GOOD CONDITION. I WILL CONTINUE ORDERING. I AM 82 YEARS OLD, A WIDOWER AND DO MY OWN COOKING,ETC.
