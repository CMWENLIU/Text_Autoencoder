I have been searching for a high quality fenugreek for a while now, for a specialty Indian dish that I make, and this is absolutely amazing! It smells so wonderful, and is packaged very nicely. The spice is fresh, and I don't know how I'll every use it all, there is so much, But I will happily try!
