Nothing will satiate your appetite like sardines.  My favorite is Season's Sardines, Skinless & Boneless<br />in Water with No Salt Added. They are hard to come by at the market so I am very pleased  that Amazon<br />offers the pack of twelve.  I like to add them to a salad of mixed greens with a little olive oil & balsamic<br />vinegar for a quick & nutritious meal.
