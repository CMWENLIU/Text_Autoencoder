Although they are sugar free, they pack a very good flavor.  My wife had gestational diabetes and the nurses suggested sugar free lollipops to snack on.  I searched high and low but no one in my area had any such product. As luck would have it, I found this brand.  Not only did the order get to me quickly, the receipt was personalize w/a happy face and signature.  Will buy from again, as well as recommend to all my friends and family.
