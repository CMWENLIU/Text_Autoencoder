When I received the news that I had to put one of my dogs on this special low fat diet my heart sunk. I envisioned more money down the drain for a specialty food that my pets wouldn't touch.  To my surprise they LOVE this food, even more then their usual Science Diet.  Also the dry variety of this low fat dog food makes a great treats that my dogs don't turn their noses up to making it handy for doling out very controlled amount of small sized treats.
