I have ordered 3 gallons of this olive oil before and found it to be very good. After reading some of the recent reviews, I was hesitant to order it again. However, because of my past very good experience with the oil, I ordered it again. It arrived today and is of the same high quality as before. The taste is as good as many of the boutique oils that are 5 or more times as expensive. The price is very good and it always arrives packaged very well.
