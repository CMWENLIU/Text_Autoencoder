Move over oyster - the smoked baby is the new pearl.  Now the signature mark of the outdoorsman - or woman - of impeccable taste in transportable haute cuisine, legend has it that most of the peaks in the Santa Catalina range, AZ have a can or two of these beautiful Bivalvia stashed away for those in the know.

From wind-blown mountaintops to surf-swept beaches around the globe, I find these little canned clams to simply be the cat's meow.
