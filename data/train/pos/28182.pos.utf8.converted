First let me say, this stuff is the secret behind movie theatre popcorn. It is SO good. It's mostly salt, but some flavorings and colors.<br /><br />To get movie theatre style popcorn, you must pop in hot coconut oil with this mixed in. Then use a buttery topping and sprinkle a little more of this one top. That's literally the 'recipe" & it is delicious.<br /><br />Coconut oil is ideal, but sometimes I use canola oil, because it's cheaper and I have it on hand.<br /><br />Another cheat I use is turning this into "microwave" popcorn... since I don't want to clean a stove top popper. Mix your oil and flavorings in a small bowl, stir in unpopped kernels around a couple tablespoons. Place a brown paper lunch sack on a plate and dump in the kernel mixture. Roll the top over on itself a bit. Microwave on the plate. Obviously times will vary, but mine takes about 90 seconds. Viola.<br /><br />It seems a little pricey by the time you pay for shipping, but bear in mind each of these containers has 992 servings in it. Imagine a milk carton full of salt--- that's more or less what this is. One of these will last a long time, but I will order this again, it's tasty stuff!
