Great Product! We started experimenting with soy milk due to allergy concerns/sinus congestion with regular organic milk.  We wanted to see if we were less congested with soy milk.  The consensus is that it does seem to help a bit, so we wanted to stay with it.  BUT---> it destroyed our morning lattes, UNTIL we found soy blenders.  It's a staple in our home,now.<br /><br />We use a Superautomatic Espresso machine for daily coffee/lattes (Saeco Talea Touch) and anyone who's ever tried steaming soy milk knows it doesn't steam correctly for lattes.  Traditional soy milk is too runny to whip up and produce a lovely microfoam.  These soy blenders were designed to steam and produce microfoam for your latte!<br /><br />Do know though, that it *seems* like traditional soy milk until you steam it, that's when the magic happens.  I do find that occassionally it produces too thick a microfoam, but I simply remove that from the top of my steaming pitcher and use the lovely silky foam that's underneath the surface of the denser bubbles!<br /><br />Overall, if you're making lattes, there is NO other alternative if you use soy milk!  Trouble is, it goes out of stock on Amazon too quickly, I'd like to see them stock it more reliably.  When it's in, I stock up, and since you can store it on the shelf in the pantry without refrigeration, (another plus!) it's no problem to stockpile some so you don't need to order too frequently!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
