This is possibly my favorite coffee of all time. It comes the closest to tasting like it smells (unlike most coffee) I do add one caveat, if you use the ratio of coffee to water they recommend it will be extremely strong, I advise using less coffee and more water but as always, it's a matter of personal preference. Enjoy!
