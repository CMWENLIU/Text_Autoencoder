This year I used Gu Energy Gel as an aid for long training runs in preparation for a marathon and also during the marathon.  Every six or seven miles I'd ingest a pack along with some water and I noticed that I didn't seem to hit the proverbial wall as I had in previous marathons.  I wasn't the only runner using Gu as empty packs were strewn throughout the course.  The race organizers had an official Gu station at the fifteen mile mark.  As others have previously mentioned, the chocolate flavor Gu does taste like frosting and did indeed hit the spot.
