My wife first found this in Walgreen's and bought both Vanilla and Hazelnut flavors just to try them out. And here is our verdict: WE LOVED THEM. The Vanilla one, that is. We didn't care for the Hazelnut too much. And since my wife hates favors in her coffee you can say that the Vanilla flavored Splenda is really good. Now why would I mention by name where she bought it first? Well because you should know that it cost us a dollar more per box that what we would have spend here in Amazon. And since this product qualifies for free shipping it's a no lose situation. Here is a little more on this item:<br /><br />The Vanilla Splenda tastes like... well, Vanilla; the good vanilla, not the artificial stuff. It's delicate and subtle. You can easily taste both the vanilla and your favorite ground coffee separately and yet appreciate how wonderfully they come together. (Can you tell that I am sipping a hot cup of vanilla flavored coffee as I am writing?)<br /><br />The Hazelnut Splenda is a little too roasted for my taste, and in my opinion it kind of kills the otherwise nutty hazelnut flavor. But don't let that stop you from at least trying it. You might like it a lot more that we did.<br /><br />THERE IS NO AFTERTASTE. I hate Nutra Sweet because of that.<br /><br />Splenda No Calorie Sweetener comes in three flavors Vanilla, Hazelnut and Mocha. I give Vanilla 5 stars, Hazelnut 4 Stars and I have not tasted the Mocha yet. But if you are wondering if you should try this product, the answer is YES, go for it, you will love it. You will even impress a couple of friends too. Que te aproveche.
