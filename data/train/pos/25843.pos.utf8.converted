If you have kids sensitive to food colorings or are just trying to avoid artificial ingredients, these are great treats to have.  My children have only recently made the adjustment from commercial, artificially flavored and colored candies.  So, they are picky about organic treats.  These lollipops have passed the test with my eight children.  Their quality control seems to be pretty good (something I don't always see with organic foods), and the flavors and colors are really nice (not boring or tasteless).  I keep these on hand to trade for candies others give them that they are not able to eat (due to sensitivities with food coloring).
