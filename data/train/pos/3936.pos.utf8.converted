I used to live close to Fastachi and went there often to purchase nuts for myself as well as friends and family for holidays and house warming. They roast the nuts there in the shop. The cashews just melt in your mouth they are so fresh. The mixes they offer are awesome. I personally love the cranberry nut mix. I was surprised and delighted to see they can be purchased here on Amazon! You won't be disappointed! Enjoy!
