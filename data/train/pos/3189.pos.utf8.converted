I ordered four bags of Por Kwan Thai Iced Tea Mix and they shipped quickly. I was unsure what to expect since I have never made Thai tea before, but when it says "tea mix" it is not in individual bags, nor is it dissolving tea mix, but is loose tea with a texture similar to coffee grounds. They even included brief instructions on preparing Thai Iced Tea on the stove, how much sugar and milk to add, etc. I was happy to discover after doing some googleing though that the tea is easily brewed using a coffee maker and coffee filter instead of the traditional method which requires a fabric tea bag thing that I don't have. I highly recommend this product and am excited to find it on Amazon after several unsuccessful trips to Asian food stores in search of Thai Tea.
