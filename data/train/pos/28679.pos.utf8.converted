I really enjoy both Living Harvest Original Hempmilk Unsweetened along with Living Harvest Hempmilk Vanilla Unsweetened. Of all the Milks that I have tried (Almond, Coconut, etc.), these are my favorite for just drinking and for baking and cooking with. They are both Low Carb, which is a big plus, (only 1 Carb per cup of milk) (2) Two they both taste good,(It has a refreshing nutty taste, closer in taste to real milk)(3)three they don't have any sugar cane or any other sweeteners mixed in or any odd chemicals or ingredients that would be bad for you, which is a huge plus for me, and (4) Fourth I love the fact that it has Omega 3's packed naturally into the milk. Hemp naturally has its own Omega 3's, so it's not added it's there naturally. AND Omega 3's are really important for the brain. So, since I can't drink Raw Milk, because of Casein sensitivities. . .I now choose Living Harvest Original and Vanilla unsweetened to drink and cook with. I hope they will continue to make these two milks.
