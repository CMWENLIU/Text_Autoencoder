This superfood is so yummy! Not gritty, or frothy, just right! It helps me get thru my busy day and I love knowing I got tons of great greens in.<br />The ONE thing you must know about this drink is you need to mix the powder with ONE oz. of water when you make your cup before you add the milk. If you don't it will be chunky and gross.<br />I also add chocolate whey protein to it and that makes it even yummier!
