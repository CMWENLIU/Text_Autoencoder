I just got my first "subscription" order for this item.  I set it up for every 6 months.  The items that came only had a 5-month expiration period from my order date.  I simply contacted Amazon.com to let them know I would expect to have at least a 6-month period based on my use needs and, just like that, they are trying to resolve the issue with a replacement, at no charge, and say they will refund it all if the freshness issue remains.  With the amazing cost savings with this product from them and no s/h fees with a subscription refill and the fact that they are standing behind the quality of it with no back and forth "arguing" or excuse making, I have to give a 5 star rating.  This kind of service is so hard to find anymore.  I recommend using them to get this, especially if, like me, there are no stores willing to stock it or, if they do, they charge 3-5x the price noted here.
