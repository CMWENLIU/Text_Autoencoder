My son loves these and I feel good giving them to him as a snack.  I always have some in my purse and they are great if he is fussy and needs a small snack.  I even use them when we go out to eat to keep him happy until our food comes.  I just wish a store near me sold them so I could buy them in lesser quantities if I wanted to.  The canisters take up a lot of room in my cabinet and we don't have a lot of cabinet space.
