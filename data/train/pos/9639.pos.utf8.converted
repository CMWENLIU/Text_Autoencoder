Since cats are obligate carnivores, high protein and very low carbs are a must for keeping your companion animals happy & healthy. When you read the cat food labels you will see that Wellness has eliminated the grain, useless fillers and by-products from their formulas.My kitties love all the flavors and will always come back for more. Just remember when changing to a new food to start gradually by adding a small amount to their regular food and keep increasing until you replace the old with the new. This is one of the best and healthiest cat food on the market and it was NOT involved in the massive pet food recalls of couple years ago.
