This is quite possibly the best tahini that I have tried. Although it is a bit pricey, it is so worth the price and you can actually taste the difference. I had previously bought Al Wadi Tahina and Joyva Sesame Tahini, but compared to Kevala Organic Tahini, this one tastes so much better. Could be the glass jar that the tahini comes in or maybe because it's organic? Whatever the reason, I will continue to buy this one because it makes the BEST hummus and my Middle Eastern dishes taste a lot better with this tahini too. Overall, I am quite pleased and highly recommend this product.
