I'm not sure where the folks are saying this is bitter.  I would guess that they are just using too much at one time.  You need far far less stevia than other sugar substitutes or sugar. Actually I think it is almost sweeter than sugar.  I use this in my hot tea.  Great product.  I love the idea that it is not sugar and that it is not a chemical substitute for sugar.
