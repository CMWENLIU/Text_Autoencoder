I'd wager that my fellow reviewers are children of the 70's, just like me.  Raised back in the day when there weren't 400 different kinds of Pop-Tarts and NONE of them were frosted!  (Maybe there were some frosted varieties but my mother would have NEVER bought them!)  By far, my favorite are the unfrosted Blueberry.  There's nothing better than a freshly toasted Blueberry Pop-Tart with a dab of butter melted on top - heaven!  Finding them is a challenge.  Way to go Amazon!!
