First of all I would like to say that HANDS DOWN, Haribo makes the best Gummi Candies. It's true! If you've ever tried another brand, you'd know, and once you try Haribo, you'd never go back!<br /><br />These Haribo Gummi Candy Super Cola Bottles, are just Bursting with Flavor! They are soft and chewy. (But not so soft that they are sticky and stick to your teeth)! I've loved these since I was young and now my son loves them too. They come in a delicious cola flavor and a cute soda bottle shape!  These are the smaller pieces of candy, like the bears and not the very large cola bottles that can also be found in the five pound bag as well. They're a great snack and most people can eat them because they're not a "chocolate-type candy" where you'd have to worry about allergies.<br /><br />They arrived at my home fresh,delicious and full of flavor.  To keep<br />them this way, I put them into two different "freezer type bags" and of course, I kept some out. Everyone that's stopped by has had the temptation to eat some and that's OK. I bought this HUGE five pound bag!<br /><br />Speaking of the Five Pound Bag, the price for this is a true VALUE! These cost so much at the market or candy store at the mall per pound! And these are the same exact cola bottles that you get there, without the worry that everyone has touched them or how long they've been out in the open before you came along to scoop them up in your bag! That's a big plus for me!<br /><br />I definitely recommend these gummi super cola bottles, they are a sweet<br />and delicious treat and the VALUE is phenomenal! I will definitely be ordering more cola bottles, plus a few different kinds of other gummis as well.  Simply because, we all have our favorites!
