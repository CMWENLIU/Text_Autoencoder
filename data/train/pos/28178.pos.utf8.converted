I got a sample of these treats in an box of litter which I had ordered on the internet, and offered them to Corey the Cat.  It was my downfall.  Now he will eat practically nothing else, and crunches them up ecstatically, and whines and butts his head against the cabinet door where they are kept, when his dish is empty.
