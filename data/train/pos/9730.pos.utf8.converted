This is one of the most marvelous items that  I've purchased to date from the "Grocery" section of Amazon.  These containers, which I think of as "motel morning" portions, are extremely convenient and quite delicious, presuming one is a Raisin Bran fan. Likewise, no matter how long the food stays in storage, my cabinets, or in the crate sitting in this cluttered abode's  back room, I note that the little, light plastic, sealed containers never seem to let the bran or raisins go stale or lose their taste.  I'm now working on my third crate of these little wonders.  I suspect that most readers would skeptically snicker at this reviewer's infatuation with such a mundane product, but one should always take matters involving quenching of the munchies seriously, especially at an advancing age when the ol' love-beaten, soul-searching heart needn't be weighed down with the added burdens of fat, cholesterol, salt, sugars and other modern processed sludge.<br /><br />Rex Lewis Field
