This is the perfect put-it-in-the-cabinet-and-forget-it emergency meat with a very long shelf life.<br /><br />How long a shelf life? Well, I've got some that says "Best by Apr. 27, 2012" which has probably been in the cabinet for at least two or three years already.<br /><br />It's not something you'll probably want to eat every day (or even every week), but it's great to keep on-hand. Good for natural disasters, power outages, camping, college dorms, financial shortages or times when you just don't feel like cooking anything.<br /><br />One pack is the perfect serving size for a sandwich or to chop up and mix with a can of beans for a filling meal.<br /><br />You can also eat it straight from the package without barfing because it doesn't have a ring of gelatinous goo like its canned counterpart.
