This tea is amazingly delicious. I have always been a fan of Early Grey tea and didn't think I'd find anything I like more BUT then I drank Stash's DOUBLE Bergamot, which just happens to be the ingredient in Earl Grey that makes it so good, and I've been hooked ever since. I drink alot of tea and this is what I drink....Try it, you'll like it!
