Having lived more than two decades in Los Angeles....with endless access to a variety of Mexican (and other) cuisines that use smoked Jalapeno chilis (i.e., chipotle), this sauce is a great find.  Some of the ways we've used it so far (and love it):  mixed 50/50 with mayonnaise yields the "Subway chipotle sauce" good for sandwiches, mixed 50/50 with Italian dressing makes a deliciously different salad dressing, as a marinade for pulled pork...makes excellent Carnitas, alone on grilled chicken breast,  in burritos and tacos with ground beef or roast beef, etc.  Have not tried it on seafood or fish (and probably won't; it would overpower those).  If you enjoy the flavor of chipotle, but want to save the time needed to make chipotle sauce from scratch, you'll enjoy this condiment.
