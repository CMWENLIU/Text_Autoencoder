OK - So I admit, I bought this for the possibility to lose weight with zero effort. I am not overweight at all but have ZERO muscle and a few curves I am not proud of. Anyway, my hopes were low but I figured I would have a healthy caffeinated tea in the long-run. So I have been drinking it for 2-3 weeks now and I don't think the scale is lying but I have lost about 5 lbs. Now, I understand that many factors could have caused this but I am pretty sure my eating habits have stayed the same. I still don't drink coffee or soda and I definitely don't exercise. I have not been drinking as much alcohol as I was during Football season so I know that might be a factor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I know anything could have caused the weight loss but the only thing that I have done drastically different is drink 1-2 cups of this tea per day. It tastes great (hot not cold or warm), gives me a healthy pep and focus, and I have not seen the scale consistently this low in a couple of years. Not to mention is comes nicely packaged. You can't go wrong here and I highly recommend it.
