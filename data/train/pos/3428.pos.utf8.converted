Potassium punch in a pouch - an envelope of electrolytes - this stuff is awesome.  I love my coconut water daily and was horrified at the waste I was responsible for as a result.  This product is going to be my new favorite regular amazon purchase until I can find it in my local stores.  The flavor is fantastic (as is the plain - sadly for me I had to knock a star off the Pom-Ras), the dissolvability great, and the convenience can't be beat.  Thank you Big Tree boys - for making the precious nectar accessible and affordable!
