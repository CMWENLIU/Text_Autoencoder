This cat food is great.  There is no grain and it's natural.  Also, my cats love it.  My cats are fed a variety of cat foods, never the same food day in day out; would you like to eat the same thing everyday?  This is one of their favorites.  They like food that is chunky or shredded, like real meat, and do not like any of the pate style foods that are so popular.  I would recommend this food for people looking for healthy cat food.
