I am a lifelong celiac who has had to avoid oats.  I ordered the Lara oats a few months ago to try them and have had great success.  The oats themselves are high quality and taste very good.  My wife likes having oats to use in baking again.  Had them in meatloaf as well.  I make oatmeal in the morning.  I followed the suggestion on the box that you start slowly in incorporating them in your gluten-free diet, and have had no problems.  I am back at the item now because I am placing another order.  Enjoy.
