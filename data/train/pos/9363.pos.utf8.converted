What's great about this mix? 1) Super easy, 2) Great, moist texture even when you change the recipe, and 3) Really good value, especially on Subscribe and Save. It's got a healthful set of ingredients -- whole wheat flour, molasses, brown sugar, baking soda, and spices. The large amount of molasses is unusual for a mix, and it adds rich flavor and lots of magnesium, calcium, potassium and iron. The whole grain adds nutrition and fiber. And best of all, it mixes easily, bakes up perfectly every time (I've made about 15 batches so far), and my 5-year-old loves it. It's great as an after-school snack; it satisfies his sweet tooth without feeding him junk.<br /><br />The one fault this mix has, IMO, is that it's a little bland. For some, that's perfect. But for me, it's a challenge -- what can I do to pump up the flavor? Here are some of the "hacks" I use to make my gingerbread tastier:<br /><br />I grate a hefty amount of fresh ginger into the mix, and/or add a heaping teaspoon of powdered ginger and/or cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Orange zest also adds to the flavor. And I frequently substitute orange juice or carrot juice, or a mix, for the 1-1/2 cups of milk that's called for in the recipe.<br /><br />I mash two ripe bananas, put them into a measuring cup, add fresh grated nutmeg and fresh ginger, and add milk or carrot juice to make 1-1/2 cups of wet ingredients to substitute for the milk. Wow, you wouldn't believe how great banana gingerbread smells and tastes, and the texture is so moist and tender.<br /><br />The Hodgson Mill site also taught me a great hack -- substitute a 15-oz can of pumpkin and 3/4 cup orange juice for the milk and fat.<br /><br />You can add nuts, grated carrots, craisins, pretty much whatever you want, and this extremely reliable mix always turns out well. Pretty much any flavor or food that works with ginger and molasses can be added to this bread with good results, as long as you don't change the dry/wet ratio.<br /><br />I highly recommend this mix either as an enjoyable, if mild, snack, or as a base for your own expansions and explorations.
