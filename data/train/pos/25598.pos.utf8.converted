I started drinking Chai tea in 2000, having given up coffee. I needed something to replace my coffee,without the ferocious caffeine attack that begins shortly afterwards.  In my search for the best chai tea, I have tried<br /><br />Tazo[very good},Celestial seasonings[okay]Stash[good] Big Train[a mix, sweet}<br /><br />Yogi{okay-good} Revolution Bombay Chai[very good]Alto eco ceylon Chai{very Good} Kashmiri Chai[very Good}Tetley{surprisingly good} looose Chai from Stash[good} Fresh Direct[very good] Tazo{very Good] and local tea sellers. NUMI TEA GOLDEN CHAI IS THE BEST I HAVE TASTED. Not too spicey,it hold the tea flavor both with milk and soy milk,plain and with sugar[and splenda] It is spicey not biting, strong not overpowering. Simply excellent! And organic to boot!
