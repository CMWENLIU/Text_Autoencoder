BEST Belgian waffles I've ever had! So easy, health and delicious. Love the ingredients list. Contains TLC....I compared this mix to another I'd made a few days earlier. Couldn't believe the difference. The other mix by a company I won't name was so tough you had to tear a piece off by force. Heartland Foods was delectable!! Just perfect. Just add water!
