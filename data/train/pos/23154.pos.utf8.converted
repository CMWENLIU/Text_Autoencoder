I know how sweet southern ice tea should taste. Well this Chick is no longer in Dixie. I've been searching for the perfect sweet tea for the past 5 yrs. Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that's done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself "SWEET" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It's what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You'd better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer. The company considers the GREEN MOUNTAIN SOUTHERN SWEET PERFECT ICE TEA a seasonal item, (the NERVE!!) making them almost impossible to get in the winter and tripple the cost!!!! Enjoy!!!
