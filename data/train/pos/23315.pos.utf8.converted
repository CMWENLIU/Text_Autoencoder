Panko breadcrumbs, for anyone that has not used them, are the best things for fried chicken, fried fish, crumb toppings and anything else you can think of for breadcrumbs. They don't get soggy, or fall off the meat/fish. Some products are not what they are trumped up to be. Panko breadcrumbs are the exception. I gave a box to my girlfriend and we both profess to be good cooks. She has a yen for fried chicken and was just amazed how well the panko breadcrumbs held up. Her husband kept raving about them. I am glad I bought 6 boxes, you will be too.
