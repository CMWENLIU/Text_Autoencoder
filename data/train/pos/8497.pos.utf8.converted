Mojo criollo is one of the better marinades I've used, and compared to most of the stuff you'll find at the grocery, it's a unique, and to be frank, superior alternative. A mixture of vinegar, spices (garic chief among them), onion and citrus juices (lime, bitter orange), Mojo Criollo will impart a full, tangy flavor to whatever meat or poultry you're cooking, as well as add to it's overall juicyness. Wonderful for grilling (grilled some chicken breasts marinated in it earlier tonight), and a vital addition to black beans if you want to prepare them in the traditional Cuban manner (my mother, a native of Jovellanos, Matanzas in Cuba swears by it...and I'll swear by her black beans).
