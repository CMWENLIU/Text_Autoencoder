I tried all the green superfoods from no flavor to berry and believe me, the chocolate is the best one.  It almost reminds me of those instant breakfast chocolate drinks I use to drink as a kid.  I am a really picky when it comes to tastes with eating and drinking natural things that are good for you.  What most people think is an acceptable taste from vitamins to energy drinks and bars, I usually never agree.  I have to admit, for a healthy drink the taste pretty darn good and I have to mix mine with rice milk since I am allergic to regular milk.  I am sure if it's mixed with regular milk, it would taste even better.  This is a great way to get those healthy foods we never find time to eat throughout the day.  The instructions say to  have two to three times a day and that is a bit much for me.  One every morning is plenty for me, IMO.
