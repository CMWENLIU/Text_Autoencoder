I would give this tea 10 stars if I could! I recently wrote the following to Traditional Medicinals corporate office and meant every word! "Folks, I wanted to share with you my outstanding experience with Gypsy Cold tea and a use which is not directly listed on the label.  I originally bought and absolutely loved your product to get over a cold and found it effective and really delicious even without a sweetener.  As a nearly 15 year chronic severe allergy sufferer (a nightmare in Northern VA) almost year round I decided to keep drinking it in the morning to see if the anti-inflammatory properties could address my issues. I never looked back and now six months later have so many colleagues doing the same that we stock it in the office.  Another colleague's very young children demand it daily after I sent a box to them as a gift to get over a cold and told them that if Totoro drank tea, that is what he would drink because it's so twiggy woodsy tasting. They now call it 'Totoro tea'.<br />Just one 16 oz cup in the morning does the trick. If I forget, my allregies return with a vengeance but easily corrected as soon as I down a cup and reminds me just how effective it is. The residual benefits are extensive since each OTC and prescription allergy med has some side effects - from dry skin/eyes, dry mouth, heart palpitations.  There were times when I couldn't even wear my contact lenses for weeks but no more. It's fantastic!<br /><br />I do wish you may bring it to others' attention - for expanded business and, more importantly, much needed relief to desperate people like I (used to be).  I've handed out tea bags to everyone who would listen and found that it is as effective for them as it's been for me.  Thank you so much!!!!<br /><br />A bit more about me - I am a health conscious non-smoker female.  I usually buy it on Amazon. A never skip a day and it is as routine as taking my supplements. By the way - Breathe Easy does not work the same way so it is definintely this particular tea. We love you guys!
