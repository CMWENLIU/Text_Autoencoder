My 5 year old just prepared a cup of this for me and it tastes just like the dairy version, or at least the way I remember regular hot cocoa tasting. I wish Amazon sold this directly because I would most definatly buy a whole case for the entire family to drink. Having a dairy allergy there are alot of things a person misses out on. I no longer have to drool over the hot cocoa my husband and kids drink on those cozy winter nights.
