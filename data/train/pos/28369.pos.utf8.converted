This one tastes exactly as an Earl Grey should. Medium body, flavorful: the black tea is perfectly balanced with hints of the bergamot & jasmine. The bergamot is non-intrusive (I say this because sometimes tea makers go overboard with it) yet still there, subtle in the background; the jasmine makes the aroma very appealing. It has an almost sweet aftertaste.<br /><br />Make sure to use boiling water since it's a black tea and don't oversteep, or it'll get bitter. (Take the teabag out of your cup after about 2-4 min. depending on how you like it, but no longer.) Suggested brew time is 4 min. I like 2-3 min since it's a fast-steeping tea. You can prime the leaves for steeping by pouring hot water over the bag in the cup first and then immediately throwing that water out. This will allow  some water to soak into the leaves and help them start to release their oils & aroma (also known as "Chinese rinsing," this gets out some of the caffeine). Or, if you you like a darker brew you could just shake the bag up and down in your cup in the first few seconds so all the surface of the leaves have contact with water. Whichever.
