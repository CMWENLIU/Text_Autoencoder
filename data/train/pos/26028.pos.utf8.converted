Unless you're a health nut, tuna in olive oil is almost always preferable to that in water. And Genova is the best of the normally priced ones. (there are some super-expensive imported brands in a jar, but they cost as much as fresh tuna) For a quick meal, I like to open a can over a salad mix, complete with the oil, then add some fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper and that's it! A quick, delicious healthy meal.
