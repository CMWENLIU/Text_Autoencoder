An exceptional meal for 2, was a wonderful birthday dinner for the wife. Here in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, it isn't that easy to get a good seafood meal. Real seafood. From the sea. Don't have any near here you see..... when the restaurant advertises seafood here, it's catfish, trout, and shrimp...... hmmm.......
