Being diabetic, I am always on the watch for sugar free snacks. The "Jolly Rancher Sugar Free Hard Candies" are a great addition to my snaking list.<br /><br />At only 35 calories and 0 Net Carbs for 4 pieces, these do not impact my blood sugar levels or ruin my diet. They are slightly less sweet than regular candies, but do not seem to cause the "laxative" effect other dietetic candies can have.<br /><br />Highly recommended! I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HTYIES">GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Candy, Just Chocolates Hard Candy, 4-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>
