Hi! 1st batch we made - had an unusual inside texture for a pancake - they were still very good - but .. a little wierd.  The inside texture was a bit - spongy or like the way an eggs are that are whipped/beaten and then used in an omelet or breakfast casserole.  A couple of days later, my son, husband and I made our 2nd batch, but this time we modified the recipe on the back. We used only 1 egg -- and that was the right modification!  Now the pancakes were just like regular pancakes!  They are delicious and certainly satisfy the "pancake craving".  We always add extracts to our pancakes - usually vanilla and maple, sometimes vanilla and coconut, sometimes vanilla and banana plus walnuts!  My ONLY issue is the SHIPPING cost us MORE than the product!! UGH .. bummer... nevertheless we are ordering another package - I will check to see if ordering more cost more in shipping -- if not might order 3 boxes as once. It's a shame food that is 'better' for us is always more costly -- but, that is not going to change.
