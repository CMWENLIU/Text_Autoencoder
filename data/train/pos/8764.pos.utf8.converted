This product is FABULOUS!  I had a cat impacted with hairballs who wouldn't eat.  I literally squirted this down his throat twice a day.  Kept him going until he could throw up the hairball and begin to recover on his own.  Now, my 15 year old cat wants some every morning.  Has increased her weight a little, has made her coat look better, and she is generally quite happy.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
