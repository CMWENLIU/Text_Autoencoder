When I researched top end cat food, EVO kept coming up. I asked a pet store owner about it and she said, "It's the best we have. If your cat is too skinny, it will put on weight. If your cat is too fat, it will make them loose weight". I laughed and said that was the most outrageous claim I have ever heard for any food product,human or animal.<br /><br />Guess what?  Buy it.
