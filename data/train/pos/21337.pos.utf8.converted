Wedderspooon's raw organic manuka honey is the very best. Amazon is the right place to buy it too! You should try to get the 12+ or better still, the 16+ or higher. It is more expensvie as you go up the scale but if you suffer from any of the maladies this mends, buy it and use it daily one to three times.<br />Google manuka honey and you'll find a vast assortment of studies and facts. I am a 100% combat disabled Vietnam Vet and I was exposed to alot of agent orange plus I breathed in a micro bacteria that VA cannot cure. THIS HONEY has given me fantastic results in fighting the constant lung infections I have.
