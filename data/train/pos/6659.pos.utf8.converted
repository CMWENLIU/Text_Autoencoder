And it is soooo good.  If you like the tub of whipped topping at the grocery store, but have food allergies or just an aversion to nasty ingredients like hydrogenated oils, etc this is the whipped topping for you.  Made from cashews and almonds this whipped topping adds that creamy yumminess without all the dairy or hydrogenated oils to your favorite desserts.  You simply put the box right in the freezer to get super cold, but not frozen.  Put the mixer bowl and beaters in the freezer to chill too.  Then once cold, whip up in your stand mixer for 3-5 minutes and viola, now hide it from the family or it will get gone before you have a chance to use it for its intended purpose.
