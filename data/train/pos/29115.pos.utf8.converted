Nutiva Organic Hemp 50% Protein Powder is consistently excellent. I have been using it daily for about nine months now in a morning breakfast smoothie with other organic nutritional products recommended by my doctor, one of which is The Ultimate Meal. The results are highly satisfying. Hemp powder is an excellent source of protein from one of the most nutritious sources known. It blends well with fresh or frozen berries and fruits, but usually I prefer a whole fresh organic avocado in the smoothie for added protein and energy that satisfies and keeps me going for hours, and on occasion instead use organic fresh or frozen berries or fruit for variety.. I recommend Nutiva hemp powder for anyone interested in achieving and maintaining superior health. It always arrives very well packaged, in superb condition. My best suggestion is that anyone interested try it and see for yourself. Personally, I wouldn't want to be without it. One of the services amazon.com provides that I use for this product is Subscribe and Save because shipments can be scheduled and changed or suspended easily as one chooses.
