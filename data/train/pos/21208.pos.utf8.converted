No, I'm not bored or hungry at the moment, I'm trying to avoid doing our shIpping, so I'm shOpping instead.<br /><br />I am not only over the age of 13 (as if someone under 13 would admit it and not check the box), I'm WELL over the age of 13 and after a lifetime of trying to pull my teeth out on gummies and beef jerky (I miss that stuff), I've almost succeeded...so no more true gummies.<br /><br />I love these things because:<br /><br />1. They're not chocolate (I love chocolate but I can't have chocolate)<br /><br />2. They're not too hard<br /><br />3. The little non pareils are fun and crunchy, but don't stick in my teeth<br /><br />4. They're fat-free and if you used to own a gallbladder that was on a recall list, you can't have any fat :)<br /><br />5. They're cheap here. And I got 10 bucks off by ordering these along with stuff I really did need. (These are over $5.00 a pound in the supermarket and the last time I asked my husband to 'bring me a bag of those rasberry things', he spent $23.00 on them! Someone needs to invent some sort of force-field to keep men out of the candy aisle!)<br /><br />So, I ordered them. I'll eventually eat them all..I am going to seal them in 1/2 pound FoodSaver bags and I figure they'll last a year ;)
