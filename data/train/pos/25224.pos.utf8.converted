Seems since I hit 40 I have also been hit with horrid GERD. Never had any problems before and could eat pretty much anything I wanted! Spicy, really spicy, chocolate, etc. Now if I eat those things I have heartburn constantly. I happen to LOVE spicy foods! I read where apple cider vinegar can really help with acid reflux, heartburn and GERD. I don't like to take any medications so I decided what the heck. Well, I can honestly say it does work! I take 1 TBS in a glass of water after every meal and voila! no more heartburn. It also seems to be helping with severe sinus issues I have. I swear I feel less congested. I buy my apple cider vinegar from trader joe's. It's organic & unfiltered and about $2.99 a bottle!
