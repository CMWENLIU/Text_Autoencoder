This is one of the better bread machine mixes out there. Hodgson Mill has managed to provide us with some very fine products that don't contain a bunch of preservatives and great tasting loaves of bread.<br /><br />They are one of the only ones that recommend using the whole wheat cycle for a box mix, and it works well. This may be the reason that some reviewer wound up with a bad loaf. Funny thing is, the first time I used it, I neglected to read the instructions and used the basic white setting on my bread machine and it still turned out pretty good.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this mix on a regular basis.
