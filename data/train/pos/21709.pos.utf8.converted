I love this tea. It tastes like nothing I've tried before - soft, rich, earthy taste, dark in color, and it doesn't get too strong and bitter, like regular black tea. I wouldn't even call it a black tea, it stands on its own. It also has great health benefits, some kind of spacial fermentation - as I've heard... I've ordered 2 more packages after I tried it.
