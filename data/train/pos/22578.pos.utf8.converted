This pinole is a great product!  It tastes great and is properly advertised.  My husband and I use the pinole with water, almond milk or soymilk before and/or during our long runs which helps provide a lot of much-needed energy.  We've even tried it warm (drank it like tea) and my husband has added it to his morning, pre-run coffee with excellent results.  This pinole really is a versatile product that I highly recommend.  The shipping was a little pricey considering the cost of the product, but it is coming all the way from California so I guess that's about right.  We had no problems at all with the Seller.
