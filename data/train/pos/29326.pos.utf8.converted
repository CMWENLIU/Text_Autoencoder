My daughter often had a Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) for breakfast when she was in high school, leading my wife and I to give her grief for not having a good breakfast.<br /><br />Years later, when my aging father was ill and it was difficult to get him to eat as doctors said he should, a nurse recommended CIB, saying that it was a complete meal. Fortunately, my father loved it.<br /><br />Since then at least two other nurses have mentioned it to me, and for the past several years I've been drinking it fairly regularly. Now, it's rare that a day goes by when I don't have CIB for one of my meals.<br /><br />A major ice storm hit the rural area I live in recently, knocking out power, telephone, and even cellular service and water. Part of a tree in our front yard landed on the power line, and limbs of two tall trees fell onto our driveway, blocking our means of exit.<br /><br />Fortunately we had a fresh box of CIB on hand (French Vanilla, our favorite flavor) and a gallon of milk (which we kept "refrigerated" by keeping it in a cooler outside where the temps were below freezing). After that experience I realized that having a supply of CIB plus some powdered milk and bottled water on hand was as important as having flashlights, a portable radio, batteries, candles, and matches, etc., in case of emergency.<br /><br />I'm a big guy who likes to eat and who does a fair amount of physical labor, and a glass of CIB fills me up, gives me an energy boost, and keeps me satisfied till lunchtime (assuming I've had it in the morning; sometimes I have it for lunch instead).<br /><br />When I travel by car to visit relatives out of state I carry a supply of CIB with me. They may offer me eggs and sausage or bacon, etc., for breakfast, but if I have my CIB and milk is available, that and a good cup of coffee are all I need. I've also gotten into the habit of carrying a thermos with a pre-mixed CIB drink in it when I go on such road trips, so that I can have that for a meal when I'm on the road instead of having a McDonald's meal. I have noticed that I stay more awake and alert throughout the 8 1/2 hour drive if I substitute a CIB for a McMeal, and don't feel a need to pull into a rest area for a nap as I usually do after eating a McMeal.<br /><br />I swear by it and even though Amazon's price is only a few cents below what my local WalMart charges, getting CIB delivered to the door 3 boxes at a time is convenient and seems a good way to avoid ever getting low on it.<br /><br />I like it blended with a banana too, and in hot weather blending CIB with a banana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream makes for an extra special treat.<br /><br />I have apologized to my daughter for giving her a hard time about her CIB breakfasts when she was in high school. When I tell her that at least 3 nurses have raved about CIB to me, she says, "See? SEE? And you and mom gave me such a hard time, telling me it wasn't enough to have for breakfast! Grrrr!!" ;-)
