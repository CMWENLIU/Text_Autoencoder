These are my all-time favorite Kashi bar. I never cared that much for the chewy type of Kashi bar. I favored the crunchy type more so-until these! A combo of chocolate with just a little flavor of coffee all topped with almonds mixed in. I use these as a meal replacement such as breakfast or lunch or , can use them as a snack. Hope these come back into stock VERY soon!
