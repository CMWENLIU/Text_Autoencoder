If you're looking for authentic, Thai curry, this is it.  After you've made the dish a few times, you can tailor it to your liking.  We like it VERY spicy, so we're generous with the portions, and add chili flakes and a little madras curry powder.<br /><br />Buy with confidence, and keep your pantry stocked!
