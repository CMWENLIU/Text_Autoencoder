My cat has been eating this food since he was a month old, and is now a sleek, highly active and brilliantly healthy 6 month-old. I have never seen a shinier coat on a cat. He is active, interested, talkative and very playful.<br /><br />I checked carefully to ensure that my cat would be getting all the nutrients he requires from a vegan product, and Evolution's certifications were sound.<br /><br />I feed him on demand, with a handful of the food as required. I am quite happy handling the food knowing that there are no questionable animal products and other undesirable ingredients that could also sicken me. The food smells great and he loves it.<br /><br />I transitioned him from a standard dry kitten food, and he was initially reluctant. I had been feeding him the Evolution food after soaking it in a little water, but after I stopped wetting it, he immediately switched fully.<br /><br />Even if you yourself are not a vegetarian, this food makes sense on all levels. You are guaranteed of high quality ingredients without the horrific waste meat and other byproducts in standard pet foods, Evolution itself is healthy to handle and keep in the house and of course, cats thrive on it!
