This is a simple yet delicious candy bar. Crunchy foamed honey covered in Cadbury's milk chocolate. You can eat it quickly, or take your time and nibble off the outer chocolate and let the honey melt in your mouth. I even like them frozen! No other candy bar is like this. Give them a try, and if you don't like them, I'll take them.
