I was recently introduced to coconut water and really enjoyed it, however it was one of the sugar added brands that only had 80% juice (with pulp). After some searching, I found some pure coconut water (for twice the price as the sugar added one) at a grocery store and was eager to try it only to be let down. It was decent enough, but pretty bland. There weren't other options, so I searched Amazon. Amy and Brian's was a great deal compared to the bland grocery store option and had good reviews so I ordered a case.<br /><br />A couple cans came slightly dented as others have mentioned, but it clearly happened during shipping and did not compromise the product in the least. When I finally opened a can, I was so excited by the amount of pulp in it (a lot!). Even better, they had the same sweetness as the sugar added ones but with a much cleaner taste. They use Thai coconuts, which are naturally sweeter than others. I love the pulp - it's really soft, so you can easily drink without chewing it. I've got a major sweet tooth but I've been working on eating better. A cup of it after dinner or throughout the day provides just enough sweetness to curb my dessert cravings, especially taking the time to chew the pulp. I definately enjoy it more at room temp too.<br /><br />A wonderful side effect I've noticed is it helping with dry mouth! A medication I'm on causes pretty bad dry mouth and this helps much more then those dry mouth mouthwashes. It's rehydration properties are amazing for hangovers too(or preventing/lessening them when drinking a cup before bed).
