After feeding my dogs what I THOUGHT was a "Premium Brand" food: (Iams Healthy Natural), and paying for that as well, I stumbled upon this website: [...]/ and found out how it was actually rated.  Much to my sadness, the Iams premium food that I had been paying so much for, was not only one of the WORST foods for my dogs, it was also probably contributing to the downfall of my older dogs health. She was slow and sluggish, and just didn't want to participate. At first, I thought that she was just old, and then I read about what I was feeding her, and her younger sibling. I was Horrified. Think of the movie "Super Size Me" -30 days and nothing but McD's for every meal) - Now compare this "movie diet" to a Dogs Diet. If that horrible Fast Food, did that much damage to the director, in a very short amount of time, then just imagine - what is a constant diet of poor grade dog food, doing to our furry family members?<br />That was when I figured out that, I was even paying more for the Iams as well! The Iams has a 17.5 pound bag for $21.87- that comes to $43.74 for 35 pounds! Premium Edge? Only $39.99 for a 35 pound bag, and, I don't have to go to a fancy food store either! Thanks to Amazon, it gets delivered for free, by my UPS guy, (he isn't too happy about it, but I remember this, at Christmas time, and really hot days when cold water and a snack is much needed).<br />Now, if you could actually SEE the difference in my dogs coat, her disposition and energy! Oh my goodness! It changed so much that, I even went so far as to order a book, on how to bake their doggie treats as well! From now on, they get nothing but REAL FOOD. My dogs are like my children, and I would NEVER feed my kids, all of that horrible  junk that some of those other foods are made from. In EVERY commercial, they (the dog food companies) spend millions to, lead you to believe that, you are buying the BEST - but in reality - some of the supermarket brands, are actually BETTER than the Iams food. I'm just upset that I was spending premium money on sub par food.<br />My advice: look up the brands on that website, look it over, and purchase the BEST food that YOU can afford, for YOUR dogs - my shelties don't eat much (some people can't afford premium food but at least get what you CAN afford, by the crude breakdown) - For Us,,, this works out to be a win win situation - I don't have to go to the store - my dogs are eating PHENOMENAL food, and they show it. All for the same price, (if not actually less) than the Iams Healthy Naturals.<br />I never thought that I would actually SEE the difference in my dogs, just from the food that they are being fed! All it took was, four weeks for my Older dog, to turn back the clock, and start acting like a younger dog - my other one that is only four - he was already acting like a pup, but at least I know now that, what he is eating, won't start aging him prematurely. I could not be happier, nor can I say enough about this incredible brand of food - Just look for "Premium Edge" (in ANY flavor).
