The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft.
