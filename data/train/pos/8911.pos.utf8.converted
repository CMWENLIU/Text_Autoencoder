I love this product, but wanted to point out that this 2-oz bottle is diluted in strength compared to the 0.5-oz bottles.  Yes it's very sweet, but not as sweet as the smaller bottles (which I do not understand).<br /><br />Look at the smaller bottles - it will tell you that 1 drop = 1 tsp sugar.  On this larger bottle, it shows that 2 drops = 1 tsp sugar.  SO, just be aware that if you're used to the small bottles, you'll have to use twice as much if you buy this one.<br /><br />As far as price, you are paying exactly the same amount PER SERVING (at the time of this review anyway), so that is not an issue (i.e., one drop from the small bottle is the same price as 2 drops from the larger bottle).<br /><br />Aside from this confusion, this is an EXCELLENT product and I use it all the time.  I make iced tea with this product and people think it's real sugar.  I have also used it in recipes calling for Splenda.  Remember, Splenda is cut with carbohydrates but this product has ZERO carbs even in large amounts.
