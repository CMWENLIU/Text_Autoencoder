This dill weed came in a heat sealed metallic plastic bag. When I cut it open and took a whiff, the aroma was heavenly. Wow. I poured it out into several plastic spice containers to find that it has a deep green color, is fresh, not old or faded in color or aroma. There were no cut up stems or filler of any kind.<br /><br />I use dill weed in so many things, from baking to cooking to popcorn topping. This dill is, hands down, the best I've ever purchased. It's even better than when I've bought dill weed fresh at the store and dried it myself. The flavor is bold and rich and delicious.<br /><br />This 16 oz bag is a fraction of the cost that I'd pay at the grocery store, where a 2 oz bottle is $5.99. This is an economical way to buy dill weed.<br /><br />Excellent quality. I will definitely purchase this again when I run out.
