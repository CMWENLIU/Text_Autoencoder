I've tried several high-cacao content chocolate, and most of them are not very tasty. There's usually a waxy quality and the chocolate doesn't really seem to melt in my mouth. And the "intense" chocolate is often kind of bitter. Bitter and waxy.. what's not to like about that?!?!<br /><br />Midnight Reverie is a great mid-morning or mid-afternoon chocolate when you don't want something really sweet. The flavor is warmly intense, balanced chocolate that melts very nicely in your mouth - not too fast. But even if you get excited and chew it up - it still melts. And the intensity is not bitterness.<br /><br />I was happy to see no hydrogenated oils - which are in some of the other Ghirardelli filled dark chocolates.
