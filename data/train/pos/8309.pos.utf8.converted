I went looking for this pasta after I recently tried a dish at a restaurant recently that featured this form of pasta.  The local regular supermarkets did not carry this kind of pasta and it seemed a bit overpriced at the local exotic markets.  I turned to Amazon to find a great deal.  Since there were no reviews on this pasta I took a leap of faith.  Having had the pasta a few times now I am excited to say that this is an excellent product and is worth purchasing at Amazon.  I am now inclined to try the other pasta's from the same brand.  I have tried it with both salt added and no salt added to the water and they turn out great both ways.  It depends on how you plan to cook the sauce I guess but the pasta itself is versatile and very easy to cook.  Just follow the instructions. I used a large 12qt pasta pot to make it and it worked out great.
