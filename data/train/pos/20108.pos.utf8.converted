This stuff is wonderful. The taste is rich and creamy and, I think, far superior to any of the domestic packaged butters available. As someone of Irish extraction it pains me to say that my family even prefers this to KerryGold --- which is no mean accomplishment. Apparently they won't ship to the southern US in summer so we are waiting for the return of cooler weather so we can get our next "fix."<br /><br />Try this, you WILL like it.
