You have to understand -- "healthy" and "my husband" generally don't go together. If it says "low-fat" or "whole grain," he seems to have a prejudice against the product from the start. Enter baked lentil chips - WOW...Something healthy he actually likes! He is munching them as we speak -- not even with a dip -- just plain!<br /><br />They are delicious -- crisp but not "hard" -- great flavor. They are amazing with hummus or plain.<br /><br />Very happy they have them here on Amazon because our local store that carries them keeps selling out!
