Hello. My daughter and I actually stumbled upon these tastey little treats 3 months ago and have been looking for them since.  Nowhere in the area seems to carry them,  Thank the internet for Search engines and Amazon.com.  Anyways I just ordered 10pks, they are a great little pick me up durring the day and they dont leave a funky aftertaste.  So if your willing to try new things Jump Aboard and give Apollo a chance! -^_^-<br /><br />*~Alicia~*
