I prefer shelled pistachios, & these actually taste like pistachios (unlike the over-salted Sunkist brand shelled pistachios I'd been getting at the local Wal Mart). When Wal Mart ran out of them, I decided to try ordering them online & am glad I did. These pistachios are lightly salted & not quite as crunchy as Sunkist brand (which is fine with me; they taste great & are easier on my teeth). I plan to continue purchasing shelled pistachios from Keenan Farms (through Amazon.com).
