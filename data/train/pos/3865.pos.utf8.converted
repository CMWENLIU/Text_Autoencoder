The seller is really nice.<br />The paste teases good.<br />I am a Chinese and I love Korean food.<br />It's nice to make pibim pap(dont know how to type it in English) ''' 'noodles.<br />I also used it in kimchi.<br />It's not very hot, also has a little bit sweet flavor.<br />Worth it to have a try!
