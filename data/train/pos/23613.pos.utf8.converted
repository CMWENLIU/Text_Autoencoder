I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I was so happy to find a 10-lb box of it.  Yes, it came in a plastic bag with a twist tie, but they could have delivered it in a wheelbarrow and I would have been happy.  My bag did weigh a full 10 pounds and there was no powder residue outside of it, so mine was apparently better sealed than the other reviewers' bags.  My only caution, if you have a milk, peanut or tree nut allergy, then this product is not safe for you.
