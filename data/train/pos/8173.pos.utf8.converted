This product is truly delcious for people who are following a clean/healthy lifestyle.  It is no Ben & Jerry's peanut butter cup, but its not meant to be.  Its light and fluffy and has a truly chocolately taste with a hint of PB.  I'm so satisfied with customer service and the shipment stayed frozen for a while...seeing as I wasn't home when it was delivered.  But it was fine.  In fact i had to let it defrost a little so i could taste it!  I am extremely pleased with this product and look forward to trying the other flavors!
