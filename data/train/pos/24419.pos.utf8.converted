I have been eating this product for the past 2 years.  I picked them up one day at the supermarket because they looked interesting.  To my surprise, they were great.  I love this product.  The noodles are filling and are certainly NOT as bad as some of these reviews suggest.  I think that eating healthy is always a challenge.  This food does not taste gross.  Actually, there is not too much taste to it at all until you put a sauce on it (just like most Tofu products).  The texture is a little softer than most noodles but certainly far from GROSS.  We need to do what we need to do for health's sake!  Give em a try; I think you will be pleasantly surprised!!
