Very impressed with company and am hoping to reap the benefits of these little berries.  If you wonder what it tastes like, I would say that a raisin is the closest comparison, but gojis seem to leave an aftertaste that is a little gritty.  If you can put up with it, it is a great way to curb cravings for something sweet and an awesome way to get antioxidents.
