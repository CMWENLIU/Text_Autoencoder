I have done the math. After one school year of buying (substandard) iced tea at Starbucks, I have spent $578 and approximately 33 hours of my life (2.89 for a tea, 10 minutes to go and wait and get it). For my own home brewed tea, which takes close to NO TIME to make, I am spending 60 dollars a school year (30 cents a cup, 2 tea bags a morning). With my 518 dollars in savings, I will be buying a pair of exorbitantly expensive boots. WHICH I LOVE. Everyone wins: Twinings, Frye Boots, and America. THIS TEA IS GREAT.
