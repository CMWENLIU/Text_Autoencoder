I tried this curry paste after I found it recommended in Pressure Perfect by Lorna Sass, a cookbook with recipes for pressure cookers.  Well, the first thing that I made with it was curry chicken.  It became an instant family favorite.  Since then, I have tried it in other dishes and I was never disappointed.  The flavor is rich and intense without being overpowering.  I have also used it in Hot and we like it too, but it would not be good for people who are not used to heat.  I find the paste to be much better than any powders that I have tried and it gives a more authentic flavor.
