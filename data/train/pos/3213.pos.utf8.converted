I got this and it sat in my shelf for a while because I didn't really expect much. Then I made it one night to share with my son (2) and daughter (4) and we all loved it! My daughter has celiac and is super picky, so I was happy it said "gluten free" right on the box. And it was so good - we ate the other box we had too (peanut flavor). Both were fantastic, the Pad thai is a little more spicy (but not too much). I was so surprised it was so good, I can't wait to get more!
