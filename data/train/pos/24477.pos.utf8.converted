I heard the health benefits of eating pistachios so I purchased some from the local store.  Because of the expense, I began to look online for a better price.  I ran accross these and I must say they are great.  The cost is low.  The nuts are very lightly salted, fresh and approximately 98% are fully opened.  I will purchase them again.
