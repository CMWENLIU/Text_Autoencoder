I have a Rescue Weiner dog with teeth that had very bad tartar from front to back. Simply said, they were total brown. The vet suggested scraping which costs about $90.00. She sold me the large size (bag of 15 each) for about $18.00. Foxie the Weiner dog loves them. I also gave her Cow knees fron the butcher shop. (You can bake the knees to get rid of the grease and rancid smell.)The combination of the two has cleaned the dogs teeth remarkably in about thirty + days. She no longer needs to have her teeth scraped. I searched many internet sources for these products. With the $25.00 minimum Amazon supersaver shiping I saved about 45% off of the vet's cost and about 20% to 30% from many online vendor's.I saved $ by buying the large size, then cut them in half with a sharp knife or poultry shears.To keep you dog from vomiting the chew, use the large or extra large size. Take the chew away after 15-20 minutes before the dog can soften the entire chew, swallow it whole and gag/vomit!<br /><br />  Bob Howard, Seattle Wa
