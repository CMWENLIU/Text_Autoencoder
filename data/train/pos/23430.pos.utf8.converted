I've tried others, but Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is by far the tastiest and easiest to eat.  I absolutely love it.  I just eat it right out of the jar, several tablespoonfuls a day, for the health and weight loss benefits.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.<br /><br />I've read through the reviews and just wanted to clarify some things with actual facts for those who are interested.  Saturated fat, such as coconut oil, butter, lard, tallow, etc., is not only NOT harmful, but it is ESSENTIAL for good health and need not and should not be limited in quantity as the government suggests.  It does NOT clog arteries--that is a lie that has been propagated for the last 60 years and thankfully there are finally practitioners with the courage and common sense to speak the truth.  I am a dentist, intimately involved in nutrition, and I know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />The majority of coconut oil is medium chain triglycerides which are broken down quickly by the liver for energy.  It raises metabolic rate, thus promoting weight loss, and it does work.  But you should know that butter is healthy, too, and has some important long chain fatty acids, and it, too, will promote weight loss.  Heavy cream is essentially butter before it's been churned.  So certainly eat coconut oil--it has myriad health benefits--but eat all your saturated fats, including plenty of fatty, red meat.<br /><br />Coconut oil will not oxidize and go rancid.  You can leave it on the counter probably for years.  So don't worry about buying too much.  And for the same reason, a dark jar is not necessary.  Please know that liquid seed and nut oils, and even fish oil, will go rancid, because of the high unsaturated content.  These oils oxidize quickly and form free radicals.  They are a major contributing factor in virtually all the prevalent diseases and disorders from which people suffer.<br /><br />And finally to those complaining of the plastic jar, most of us, especially those who use a lot of coconut oil, would just as soon accept the "horrifying" risks of plastic jars rather than paying a fortune for shipping glass jars.  We don't all have extra bags of cash lying around.
