I work in a business that sells gourmet coffee beans so I like to check out the competition. We sell lots of organic coffee. These espresso roast beans were perfectly roasted. The coffee is smooth and deceptively subtle for such a dark roast. I was jealous. The blend was just right. Clean on the palate with an immaculately gentle mouth feel. Well done!
