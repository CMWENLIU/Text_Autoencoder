This is the very best mayonaise on the market. It tastes exactly like homemade mayonaise! I had never had "bought mayonaise" until I was in high school, as my Mother always made it at home. I also never dreamed how hard it is to make, keeping the perfect drop by drop of the oil, steady, constantly beating it into the beaten egg yolks, salt,pepper, dry mustard-then gradually adding the lemon juice, then in a nano second-it goes bad--and you have to start all over! Dukes gives me my Mom's mayonaise in all its creamy, tart, glory--Thank you, Dukes!
