My dog is 16 now and has always been a finicky eater, it has always been hard to find things she likes, but these are one of her favorites! They are also so healthy. She has also always had itchy skin in the late summer to fall, I found these treats last fall and this past summer her skin was so much better, hardly any itching. I would recommend them. Be sure to read the directions though, the amount you give your dog is recommended by their weight. They are also good for dogs if they tend to eat grass.
