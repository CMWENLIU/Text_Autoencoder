I thought I'd give the tea powder itself a try. I heard it was more condensed and packed more of a punch than the bags. Personally, I liked it and can see how it would be ideal should one have a tea maker (like a coffee machine), but with the coca tea overall it doesn't really effect me--energy wise--as much as regular tea does. I do, however, appreciate its flavor. It's a welcome change-up as compared to black tea. I should note though that I'm not sure it is worth the price premium we have to pay for it here in the USA.
