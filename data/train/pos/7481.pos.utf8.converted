Soon after I ordered them, (Pistachios, Shelled, Raw* - 5 Lb Bag / Box Each<br />by Angelina's Gourmet), I got this box in the mail with an unmarked 5lb bag of pistachios in it.<br />I looked around to make sure no one could see me as I opened the box.<br />Into the plain plastic bag, I dove in and started to slam back the wrinkled nutty goodness into my pie hole:They were fresh and amazing! I eat a LOT of salads, and like them for snacks and they are amazing in bread. I ate them all in a scary amount of time! It was like I had this private stash of pistachio happiness and I didn't share them with anyone! Oh the horror of having harbored such a marvelous treat all to myself! Not a single kernel shared! So many, and I could have offered them to my nut-less friends and to the under-nutted strangers who passed me by with a hunger in their eyes...But they are all gone now....snif. I think I'll order more:this time I will share...I hope.<br />-The Pistachio Nut
