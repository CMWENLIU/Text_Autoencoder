I bought these for my son, who was always a little slow and uncoordinated. When they arrived, i mixed them in with his normal jellybeans (he eats quite alot) and next thing i know he's running up and down the house nonstop! when he finally calms down around around 1 am, the next morning he gets up, goes to school normally, but the school calls around noon and says that my son bit the middle finger off of a fellow student! Not only did i dispose of the beans that were left, i sent a harsh letter to the company!<br /><br />PROS<br />-nice lime flavor<br />-easy hold package<br /><br />CONS<br />-no dosage instructions<br />-why sport? what sport is HAND MUTILATION?
