I usually rotate between several brands of moist dog food to keep breakfast interesting for our JRT.  This product is wonderful to have on hand and our dog loves it.<br /><br />It's the moist food I normally stock up on when we plan to be away and our friend tends our pet.  It's extremely quick and easy to tear, empty and toss the individual packets.<br /><br />I'm glad Amazon sells it since many of our grocers seem to offer only individual packets.
