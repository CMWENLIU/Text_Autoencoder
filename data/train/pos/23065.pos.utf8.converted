I have recently adopted my son's cat and have spent the last few months educating myself about cats.  After learning that most cat foods are too high in carbs I decided to change his food supply. Transitioning him was easy, lucky me!!  Over time I've bought various brands of grain free cat food, both dry and wet. Most he ate, but some he just picked at. Then I came across the wellness brand and bought all their varieties.  He loves them, some flavors more than others, but he'll eat them. I recently bought wellness core and bingo!...we have a winner here.  He absolutely loves this food and wipes his plate clean every time; something he has never done with any other brand.  He especially loves the chicken, turkey and chicken liver.  The minute I put this down in front of him he doesn't come up for air until it's all gone.  It makes me happy to see him enjoy his food so thoroughly. His coat has developed a nice sheen to it and he has lost his excess weight. I'm glad that he prefers this food but even if he didn't, it doesn't say anything negative about this brand. Cats have preferences just like us.  This is one of the best canned, grain free foods out there.  I highly recommend it.
