disclaimer first: lindt is the chocolate brand i like, not milka. in theory.<br />in practice, i love 2 milka products.<br />no 1 is this chocolate: i am CRAZY about it!<br />caramel is actually liquid and although this is not exactly "FILLED chocolate", they weren't goin cheap on just how much caramel filling they spritzed in it.<br />to make a long story short, if you love caramel, you will LOVE this chocolate.
