I love NuNaturals liquid stevia!  It has a great, sweet flavor without the weird aftertaste that some brands of stevia have.  I made the mistake of buying regular NuNaturals liquid stevia (WITH alcohol, in the white bottle) the last time, and it isn't as good.  It takes a lot more drops to get the same amount of sweetening as the alcohol free.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying this again.
