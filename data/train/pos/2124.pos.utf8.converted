Ganocafe is a product derived from coffee, so it retains the flavor of coffee, but the Reishi mushroom is what I enjoy most about this product. Reishi mushroom is not an easy ingredient to find and has been touted as a wonderdrug for hundreds of ailments and preventative for even more, including many forms of cancer.<br />I'm unable to consume caffeine, so I had to find alternatives. Many coffee alternatives taste too "earthy" or "forest-y" and not much like coffee at all.<br />This is the best that I've found.<br />The classic style is no cream, no sugar, just a plain old cup of coffee and while it's not exactly like coffee, it's the closest to the real flavor.<br />For all the people out there who can't drink coffee, enjoy!
