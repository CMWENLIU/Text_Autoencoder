These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.
