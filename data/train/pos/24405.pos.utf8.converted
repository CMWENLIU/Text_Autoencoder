I've been eat Fiber One bars daily for one year. These contain 35% of your daily fiber allowance and have a pretty good consistency and flavor. My only problem with the Fiber bars is that they do contain sugar, but other than that, I try to eat one everyday for breakfast. The Peanut butter flavor has less sugar than the chocolate ones. These are pretty filling. It takes a little bit to get used to the Fiber Bomb, so give your body a few days to adjust.
