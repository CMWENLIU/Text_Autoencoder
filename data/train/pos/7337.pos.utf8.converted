I was a little hesitant ordering meat online, but decided to give it a try since I love Korean BBQ. I'm glad I did, this was some of the best Galbi I've ever had! I've been to a bunch of Korean BBQ restaurants, and this was right up there with the best of them. The amount of meat you get is more than enough to feed 4, and for the price it's a great value.<br /><br />If you like Galbi, or Korean BBQ in general, I highly recommend Mama Eun's!!!
