I add a tablespoon of this to my cold cereal every morning. Perfect blend of flavor and texture. Not too 'bitey', not too gritty. The flavor is not overpowering but you know it's there. Can even be eaten directly out of the bag, although I would not recommend doing it this way :-) Great as a ice-cream topping too. Shop around before purchasing though. I paid almost 50% less per 16oz pack at the supermarket, so this is not a good deal at all, unless you live in an area where it's simply not available at your local store.
