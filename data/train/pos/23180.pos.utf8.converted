Not bad.  The usual bent can or two when buying canned goods from Amazon, but the price is right.  Try a can from your local grocery store to see if you like it, first, of course.<br /><br />The "steak" isn't bad at all with a decent texture and taste. Similar to the Roadhouse Chili line.  It will fill you up and is not bad on a cold day.  There is a generous amount of meat and a fairly tasty sauce -- it also has large beans in it which are good, and some corn, red peppers, tomatoes, and so on.  Overall, this is a pretty good quick meal and fairly tasty.  It's probably not easy making a canned meal with consistent quality and taste in mass quantities, so have to give the food engineers at Campbell a thumbs up on this one.<br /><br />After eating a few more cans of this, I actually came back and bumped my rating up from 3 to 4 stars.  In context, I am comparing this to other canned chilis, not home cooked chili!  It's a filling and satisfying meal.<br /><br />As someone else here mentioned, you can buy via "Subscribe and Save" for best price.  It's a good service and very convenient if you want a case of this stuff.<br /><br />2011-2-17 Update: I am now on my second case and this has become my favorite canned chili.  It's a good meal. very filling, and the quality has been consistent.  I find myself eating this fairly often during these cold wintry days for lunch or dinner when I'm looking for something quick and convenient, or just want a good bowl of chili.  A little grated cheddar on top and you're all set!<br /><br />2011-10 -- Raised rating to 5 stars as I have now been through several cases and no more dented cans, quality has remained good, and I really enjoy these.  Very hearty and filling and flavor is good.  Lots of meat chunks.  Best canned chili I've found so far.
