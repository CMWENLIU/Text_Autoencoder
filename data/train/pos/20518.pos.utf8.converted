Recently on a new diet (that works) - Cannot eat whole eggs so was trying to find a large container for a good price. Honeyville grain company has this 2.25 lb can for $14.99. I paid $13.99 for 57 egg white in a 8 oz can - Figure this out - This can has 301 egg whites.<br /><br />Also, Steel Cut Oats from Honeville Grain - a 70 oz can for $7.99 - You can't beat this price.<br /><br />Gloria
