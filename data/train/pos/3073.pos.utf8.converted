I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!
