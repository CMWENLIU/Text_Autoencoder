I bought this in bulk because I'm in my 3rd trimester and need to drink this daily to prepare for labor... it's amazing. I love the taste, and buying it on here saves me money because it's much cheaper than paying retail store prices here. You aren't able to reuse the bags, but that's fine with me. (one bag makes one cup, strictly. trying to milk a 2nd cup out of a used teabag will only result in funny-tasting water)
