Oh pasta, how I love thee in all your wonderful forms! But the toothy wonderful texture of bucatini and perciatelli is the most sublime of them all! This pasta is the opposite of Angel Hair pasta - it's a chewier, thicker version of Spaghetti and is wonderful with all kinds of strong sauces. We love Perciatelli with a garlic, chili, olive oil sauce with spicy Italian sausage or even sauteed boconcini. De Cecco brand pasta is wonderful quality too and very reasonably priced.
