I want to comment on a previous review which asserts that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDBPZC">Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Buckwheat Groats Raw, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> are misadvertised and are not a raw product.  I beg to differ please.<br /><br />These wonderful groats are in fact RAW.  I buy them often from Amazon and being a raw foodie, sprout them before consuming.  I've never had a problem with these groats not sprouting and they would NOT sprout had they been steamed as the disgruntled reviewer claims.  They seem to green up after soaking and will sprout quickly  ~ as a matter of fact, just yesterday I made some buckwheat brownies and cookies for Christmas treats and the groats sprouted in 12 hours!  (Of course I live in Florida and the warm weather may be a factor). By the way, my treats turned out incredibly delicious and I give credit to the quality of the Bob's buckwheat.<br /><br />I love this product, especially that it is organic, and trust completely that if Bob's Red Mill says they are organic and raw, well then they are.<br /><br />I also want to add that when purchased at Amazon, and in particular at Subscribe and Save, they are a real value.  They are so much cheaper here than at my local health food store.
