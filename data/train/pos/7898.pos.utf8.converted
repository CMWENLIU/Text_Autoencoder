These cookies are a little pricey in my opinion but you always pay more for natural food products and these cookies are made from natural ingredients. Sometimes you do not get that many cookies in a bag but that's okay, just go eat another bag of cookies. :) They taste great and have mostly if not 100% natural ingredients. I have made many orders for these cookies and plan on making more orders for them in the future. Highly recommended if you are looking for a delicious, individually packaged, chocolate chip cookie snack.
