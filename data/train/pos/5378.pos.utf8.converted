If you love those white chocolate mocha lattes at Starbucks, this is a nice substitute. Yes, you can go on ebay and order soon-to-be-expired gigantic bottles of the real deal, but it's so expensive that the savings over just going to Starbucks in the first place is negligible.<br /><br />Torani sauces and syrups are great in their own right. We use this with our Tassimo system (with both the latte/espresso discs and the cappuccino/espresso), and it's fantastic. If you're going for lattes, get this over the syrups as the consistency is much better. This stuff is great mixed into hot chocolate and over ice cream, as well. I've even made milkshakes with it. In fact, I've made so many things with this stuff that I think the next time, I'm going to have to go for the sugar free version!
