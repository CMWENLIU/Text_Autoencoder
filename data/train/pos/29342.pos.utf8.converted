The Ghost Pepper version of "Dave's" has a great lingering heat from which rises an excellent flavor that enhances rather than hides the taste of your food.  Did I mention that it is a LINGERING heat?  This is a great sauce with a familiar, distinctive "Dave's" taste that leans a little more toward sweet (and away from bitter) than original "Dave's".  Personally I prefer this slight shift toward sweet with most foods on which I've tried the sauce.  This will not keep me from continuing to use the original on hotdogs, perogies, and chili, etc...
