Strange, but I don't like eating bananas, and I have never liked eating mushy oatmeal for breakfast, but I really like this banana walnut oatmeal breakfast cookie. It's just like eating a very substantial banana walnut muffin. It fills me up, and sticks with me until lunch time thanks to the whole grain oats, and it tastes really good, too.<br /><br />We've been told that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but I'm often in a rush, and/or I've forgotten to restock the frig, so I would end up skipping breakfast. Not good. I'm very happy to have such a convenient, and tasty way of fueling up, and it's economical, too. I signed up for the subscription price which makes this breakfast less than a $1/day.<br /><br />I tried the chocolate chunk flavor, too, but it was a little too sweet for me. I honestly don't know if I'll try any other flavors, since I hit the jackpot with the banana walnut flavor.
