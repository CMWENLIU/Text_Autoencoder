I lived in Europe for several years and Belgian chocolates are what made me a chocoholic. Of course, being young when I came back (preteen) I forgot about exactly how good Belgian chocolates are. I tasted my first Leonidas Manon Caf&eacute; and it all flooded back... I was in heaven. I won't eat any other chocolate now!
