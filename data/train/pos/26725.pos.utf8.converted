The order arrived fast with fresh product in great condition. I will order again. Red Quinoa has a differenct taste and texture from the Golden Quinoa. The red is slightly sweeter and crunchier. I like mixing the red and yellow 50:50 when I cook. I boil for 10 minutes and then let it sit for 8 minutes. 1 cup dry quinoa to 1 cup water. It needs no seasoning or additives - tastes great as is.
