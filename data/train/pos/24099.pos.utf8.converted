I couldn't wait to bedtime to try this as it had been so many years since I had it. I took lowfat soymilk and heated 1/2 cup and put in 2 teaspoons. Tastes just like it did as a child. Next thing I knew the dog was barking to go out and I had been out cold. I hope it works as well wen I have sleepless nights.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful if you like malt flavor like the inside of a malted milk ball.
