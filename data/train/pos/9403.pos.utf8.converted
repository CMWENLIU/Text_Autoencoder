I was very upset when I was unable to find an organic & healthier alternative to Gerber Graduate puffs. When I saw this item I was so excited because this was my answer. It was not released at the time so I had to wait.<br /><br />My daughter loves these treats. We also have the banana flavored one too. The container is huge -- much larger than I expected which makes the price a bargain. I like that the container is BPA free and that the amount of sugar in this product is lower than Gerber Graduates puffs.
