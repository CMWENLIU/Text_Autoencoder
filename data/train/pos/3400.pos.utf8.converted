I grew up on this product and always buy boxes of them when I visit Philadelphia. Great buttery, ginger, spice infused cookie which is very crisp. Love them!<br />However, the supplier on this site is overcharging customers. My most recent purchase in December, 2009 was from a Shop-Rite Supermarket in Philadelphia at $1.00 per box! Local supermarkets outside of PA charge no more than $2.29 per box during Fall season.<br /><br />These cookies are outrageously priced at $8.99 per box from this Amazon supplier.<br />Definitely not worth it at this price!
