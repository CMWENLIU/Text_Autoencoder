I give one of these sticks every day to my 14-15 pound pooch.  She loves them!  I use them to supplement her oral hygiene, especially since smaller dogs are notorious for placque accumulation.  Even my vet has remarked on the improved state of her teeth, and I told her about DentaStix!  I highly recommend this product--I'm just disappointed that I can't order it from Amazon because for some reason they can't ship this particular item to where I live (in Hawaii). :(
