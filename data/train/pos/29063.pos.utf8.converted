This soup rocks my tastebuds. I love cream of tomato soup (though I don't necessarily love the high salt of some and the high fat of others). This soup is lighter in salt (but could go lighter, if you ask me) and very high in sweet, satisfying tomato flavor. For those of us/you who love the comfort food power of a good creamy, tomato-ey soup, this one gives you that with organic ingredients, less salt, and has only 2 WW points per serving (4 WW points, about 200 calories, for the whole can). With some whole grain toast with melted lowfat cheese all gooey in the middle, it's a primo comfort food lunch/supper.<br /><br />I had some of this soup last night for supper with penne pasta tossed in and some parmesan on top and it was sublime.<br /><br />Better than Campbells and the other tomato soups I've had from cans. Amy's makes some wretched frozen entrees, but this soup they get right. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Mir
