Eight O'Clock Decaf Whole Bean Coffee is the best decaf we've ever drank.  It was recommended by a total stranger who saw us purchasing our Cuisinart coffee maker that grinds the whole beans.  I cannot speak to their already ground decaf but the whole bean decaf is excellent.  We do not like most decaf coffee - just doesn't taste right but we cannot tell a flavor difference in the Eight O'Clock whole bean decaf and regular coffee.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a great tasting decaf!
