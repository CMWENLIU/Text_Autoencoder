I was extremely happy with the freshness and packaging of these cookies the last time I ordered. Another reviewer stated that they were extremely disapointed with the cookies, arriving broken. To that I ask, why didn't they contact the company for a replacement?  Granted, it's disappointing to have paid for your item and then find it arrived damaged, but stuff happens in transit and I'm sure the company would have been happy to make up for that and make good on their quality product.<br /><br />In the past Biscoff was more expensive through their site, biscoff.com. Now they're offering this Family Pack (256 cookies) also on their site for $23.95.  If you're just looking to get the biscuit cookied, this is the best deal, whether you buy on Amazon or Biscoff.com.  That's just 9 cents per cookie. If you do the math the other cookie items range from 11 to 30 cents per cookie, ouch! So buy the "Family Pack" if you're looking to get the basic Biscoff cookies for as cheaply as you can. They won't last long enough to get stale anyway!
