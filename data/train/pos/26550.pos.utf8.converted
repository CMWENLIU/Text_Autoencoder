I've heard how stinky tripe can be, but these tripe treats have about the same "stinkiness" level as the dried beef lung that I've given to my little sheltie.  Not too bad.  Just in case, I do give these treats to my 30 lb sheltie on her "meal blanket" to keep any tripe bits or tripe-scented drool off the carpet, because my dog would lick the carpet for days.  (When I gave these to her on our wood deck, she licked the deck for a few minutes afterward until I pulled her away.... ow, tongue splinters!)<br /><br />So, Zoey gives these treats two paws up.  It takes her about 2 or 3 minutes to eat an entire treat (she chews her food thoroughly, she's not a gulper).  I give her one treat a day, and it hasn't adversely affected her stools at all.  Her tummy accepted it into her diet quite readily.<br /><br />There were 15 treats in my 5 oz bag, each 5-6" long.  A couple were thin (a little thicker than a pencil), but most are quite thick, at least as big around as my thumb.<br /><br />Sitstay.com is a great store, I've always had stellar service from them.
