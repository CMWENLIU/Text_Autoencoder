Although bonito flakes are marketed as cat treats (some very expensive ones at that), these are not the cat treat kind.  Actually I'm appalled to see them being so popular as a cat treat.  I'm not saying you can't feed them to your cat, but has even ONE of you considered what an insult it is to Japanese cuisine that you are only feeding this to your cat?  These aren't even marketed as cat treats on this page!<br /><br />They're really delicious and made FOR PEOPLE, for whom they are really intended no matter how crazy kitty goes to eat them.  Of course he does- but he reaps no more health benefit from this than if you gave him tuna from a 50 cent can, and a few notable exceptions aside, probably isn't picky about getting any variety of tuna!<br /><br />Please, even if you order this for your cat, try making okonomiyaki some night.  There are lots of tutorial videos on making said dish, and it's quite good- provided you like seafood anyway.  If you need help finding one, go to YouTube, and search Okonomiyaki, look at the video by the user "cookingwithdog".  It's very easy to follow and they always list ingredients at the bottom so you don't have to pause the video constantly.<br /><br />You can even order the sauce for it on amazon, over here, or sometimes at various Asian food markets:  http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Okonomi-Sauce-12-bottles/dp/B000FKHVW0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=grocery&qid=1281996897&sr=8-2
