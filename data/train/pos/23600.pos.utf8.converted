*****<br />What a wonderful tea this is! Herb-y tasting in a good way, and slightly sweet (from the licorice root) with lemongrass overtones and jasmine reminisces. This Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant from Yogi Tea is one of my favorite teas. It has everything to make it a perfect everyday green tea. It is made from Organic Lemongrass, Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Licorice Root, Jasmine Green Tea Leaf, Organic Alfalfa Leaf, Organic Burdock Root, Organic Dandelion Root, Grapeseed Extract, Irish Moss Powder, and Emblic Fruit (Amla) Extract.<br /><br />Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 80% organic and is intended combat the damage of free radicals in the body that accelerate aging. It contains 21mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />Yogi Green Tea Super Anti-Oxidant makes me glad every day that I stopped drinking coffee and switched to teas---it's that good! If you've only tried commercial brands like Stash and Celestial Seasoning, and you think you don't like tea because they taste fake and full of strong flavorings, then you owe it to yourself to give this tea a try. If you enjoy Stash and Celestial Seasonings, love their strong flavors, and disagree with me, you may not like this tea as it is subtle and a very different tea-drinking experience. You'll know what type of tea drinker you are!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
