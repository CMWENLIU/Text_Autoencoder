Peanut oil is good for baking and frying. It does not have an odor in baking and it does not easily burn at high temperatures when frying. I am just a regular house wife who likes to cook. Peanut oil does not make my house stink. I used to be afraid of frying because of the smell but that has changed. I am more willing to fry now. I tried to find peanut oil in regular grocery stores but couln't. Costco used to carry it but not any more. I ordered through Amazon.com and I am very happy with the purchase.
