We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.  He can't get enough of them.<br /><br />We also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a> made by Zuke's.  He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies.<br /><br />I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog.  Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well.  These are highly recommended.<br /><br />[Edit: August 14, 2011]<br /><br />He still loves them!<br /><br />We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had.  These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.  Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer.<br /><br />[Edit: September 29, 2012]<br /><br />Anyone else notice that they seem different??  The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle.  They also weren't as potent as the other ones were.  He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.  I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed.  I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.  A little disappointed...
