To be honest, I committed a heinous act I originally swore I never would: I bought this product because the presentation (bottle shape, color, font) was visually appealing and I liked that it stated the drink contains only 35 calories (you'd have to drink five of these to equal the caloric content of a Dr. Pepper!).<br /><br />It has a sort of grapefruit-like taste, although subtle, which I like. More important, however, is the fact that this drink, in the end, is a nutritional supplement. Being a petite, small-framed woman, I don't take in 2000 calories a day--but if I did, one bottle of Neuro Bliss would provide me with 200% of my daily Vitamin B6 and 100% of my Vitamin B12. For those of you who aren't familiar, Vitamin B is HUGE for mood regulation; many people with depression and anxiety have critically low levels of B in their systems. Again, compared to soda, this drink can and will give you a natural, healthy boost for the day.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this product to anyone dissatisfied with watery or faux-chocolate-tasting nutritional supplements, or otherwise looking to replace soda in their daily diets. It's a little more expensive, but your body will thank you.
