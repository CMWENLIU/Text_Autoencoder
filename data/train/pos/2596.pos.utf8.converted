I was looking for virgin coconut oil and it can get very expensive. I decided on 3 moderately priced oils to try. This one is very good, as is Jarrows, don't bother with the NOW brand. This does not have that gag factor that some of the oils do. I couldn't really tell the difference between this and the Jarrows, they were both very good oils.
