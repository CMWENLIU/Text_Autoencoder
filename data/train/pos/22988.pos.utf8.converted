I have tried every kibble known to man on my dogs over the years, and this one is the best. I feed a primarily raw diet, but supplement with kibble.  Previously Wellness Core had given me fairly good results with allergies etc, but the stools were 'greasy'. I also had them on Orijin, but had horrible sloppy stools on that.  I had been searching for a grain free food that had some carbohydrates in it to reduce the protein and fat content, but has no grains.  This food ticks all the boxes and then some! Great stools, shiny coats, no more 'eye goop', less hair loss, no more 'itchies'!  They have been on it about a month and a half, and the difference in the three girls is absolutely amazing.  Love it!
