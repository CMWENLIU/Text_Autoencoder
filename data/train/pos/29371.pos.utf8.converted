This tastes just as it did when my Grandmother Couvillion made it every morning till the day she died. I have to disagree with the other review -- my father WORKED at the local Folger plant and he came home and drank Community! I will say that this is NOT the darkest Community blend -- those would be the French Roast and Evangeline Blends (also available on Amazon), and the Evangeline being the best coffee I have ever tasted -- dark but not bitter at all. It is more expensive though and so this is my alternative since cash is tight. I COULD buy even cheaper coffee but life is short.
