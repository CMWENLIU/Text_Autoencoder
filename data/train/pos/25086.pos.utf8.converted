I started out buying this to use in my homemade dog food, but I wound up using it for all sorts of stuff! Pies, casseroles, and I've used it in place of pumpkin and/or oil in baked goods to add a little extra nutritional value. I'm confused about some of the other poor reviews, I thought the texture was great as was the flavor, and yes a couple of cans were dented slightly but none so severely that it was a problem.
