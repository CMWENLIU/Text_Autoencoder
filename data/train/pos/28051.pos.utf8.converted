For those pasta aficionados, do not miss this pasta.  It is hard to explain how it can be so different from any other pasta, but it is.  To say that it is very, very thin does not explain well enough its unique texture and flavor.  It is exceptionally light, and holds sauce beautifully.  I can only say "Try it, and you'll know what I mean."
