Even if these bars did have a lower cal and fat count once, I never used them until after the company changed their formula. I have tried countless raw/alkalizing bars and this is by far the greatest. I eat one for breakfast and one for lunch and my weight has stabilized after loosing 50 pounds. When considering this bar as a meal replacement, I don't see what the big deal is if the fat calories and regular calories and carbohydrates come from healthy, raw, organic foods. There is nothing wrong with healthy fat and plenty of it--especially when trying to loose weight the healthy way. The Green's plus bars that I would recommend staying away from are the peanut butter protein bars which have an unhealthy cholesterol count and the chocolate coated greens bars which just seem counter intuitive to me.
