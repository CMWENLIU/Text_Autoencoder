This does exactly what it's made for. I grind up almonds and water to get almond milk and strain it through the bag. The liquid comes through with no debris what so ever. And then you can keep the grounds and dry them. Turn the bag inside out and it cleans right up no problem. Also got a coupon for other items the seller makes and some free samples. Definitely worth the 12 bucks.
