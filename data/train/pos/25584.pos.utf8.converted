This is a fantastic product, I just ordered my second tub.  The seeds smell very fresh and keep well.  The protein is primarily edestin, which is a native protein to the human being and is the ideal protein for anti-body and immunoglobulin production.  There are also no enzyme inhibitors on shelled cannabis which makes it very easily digestible.  Also,  the fat content is literally a perfect source of essential fats, with the same ratio of fats as are found in our brain!  Of course they are short chain omega 3 fatty acids, as with all vegetarian fair, however the human body produces the enzyme delta-9 desaturase which transform them into long chain fatty acids, like those found in fish.  It is this process of the human being developing the long chain fats that Rudolf Steiner hints at as being one of the real spiritual reasons to consume vegetarian foods, is that our body becomes a factory for certain fats, which has a certain alchemical effect within the individual.<br /><br />I thought it would take me awhile to go through these but I finished the tub within 2 weeks.  Excellent to sprinkle on salads, steamed veggies, base in smoothies, additive to yogurts and oatmeals, mixed with potatoes, pretty much mix it with anything.<br /><br />I was showing the tub off to one of my friends who eats more of a mainstream diet and I put it up to her nose to smell it and she said it smelled like dirt - it really sort of does, it smells great.  It is very earthy and almost bitter in taste, however it is very mild when mixed with other things.  The seeds have a robust character of tremendous value to the human species, anyone committed to the development and future of humanity would be wise to befriend and defend this plant of nearly unequivocal value to the human species.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be hemp farms in America soon - If we had eyes to see this food would be a staple in all hosptials, schools, and other major food institutions.  The plant is easy to grow and extremely useful in a multitude of ways.  Word to the wise: Keep your eye on hemp.
