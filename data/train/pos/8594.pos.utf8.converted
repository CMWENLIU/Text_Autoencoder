I really appreciate Thai Pavilion's quality. especially when it comes to their sauces. their sauces are just not a watery paste they have real vegetables in them. open up any other thai product and just look at the sauces, I think you'll see literally that Thai Pavilion is much higher quality. taste them smell them. I think you agree with me Thai Pavilion is head and shoulders above the competition. I found this to be true with all their flavors.
