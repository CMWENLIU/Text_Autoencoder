I see this ingredient on product labels everywhere so I thought I'd check it out. I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses.
