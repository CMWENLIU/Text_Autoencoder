We moved down south after living in Maine for several years & missed the incredible lobster rolls we used to get.  I ended up getting these as a treat for my husband's birthday and he was ever so delighted.  The rolls themselves are hard to come by outside of New England and if you can get them, you pay through the nose.  This was the best of everything!  The lobster meat was wonderful...just the right amount of mayonnaise on it too!  And the quality of everything was just superb.  In fact, I can't remember having a better lobster roll...and I've had lots of them from all over southern coastal Maine & various other New England spots.  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPONTED!
