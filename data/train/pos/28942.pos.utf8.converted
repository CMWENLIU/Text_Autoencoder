A friend gave me my first Flake over 20 years ago.  Her father had brought home a precious handful of them from a business trip to the UK.  Boy, she must have really loved me to give me one of my very own!<br /><br />Cadbury makes good chocolate, but what sets these apart is how they are made.  Of course - they are flaky.  They are so fragile, they will fall apart in your hand really easily.  Because of this fragility, they also melt in your mouth very nicely.<br /><br />One of the best (and I think this may be traditional) ways to indulge with a Flake is to stab it into a malt or milk shake and then let it fall apart.  Yum!
