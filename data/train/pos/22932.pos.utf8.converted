Please read the page at the following link to see what the problem was with the change in the Natural Value Coconut Milk.  I rated this product as a 5-star because I admire the company for putting the explanation on their home page!!  Besides that, I think that the original coconut milk is one of very few that does not have any guar gum or preservatives and I am so happy that they will be going back to the original.<br /><br />It seems like the link didn't work.  Here is the gist of what happened -<br /><br />On our last order from the canner, we received a totally different product. Our natural coconut milk now has guar gum in it, plus unspecified emulsifiers and stabilizers. We did not order it like that, and unfortunately, the canner not only changed the formula and the ingredients, they took the word "Natural" out of the "Natural Coconut Milk" description. They made some other changes to the ingredients and nutritional information as well - all without telling us in advance they were doing that. The Light Coconut Milk has been changed as well. If they had told us in advance, we would have said "No Thanks" and found a different canner. So we are back to producing our original formula natural coconut milk, with no guar gum and no emulsifiers and no stabilizers...but it will be about 60 days before the "same old" product is back on store shelves.<br /><br />Also, I have emailed Cohen at the Natural Value site and he answered as follows:<br /><br />Amazon pulled the coconut milk at my request and told me they may not bring it back...it's going to be "up to you" to ask for it. We're looking at about 45 days.<br /><br />So, if you want Amazon to carry it (the original formula) again, please email them and tell them!!<br /><br />Doreen
