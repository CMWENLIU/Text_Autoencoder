We love "real" popcorn popped in a pot.  With most of the corn crop in the US GMO this is the only popcorn I feel good about.  Purchased in bulk at Amazon it's cheaper than most brands at the grocery store.  It pops up light and fluffy.  Pop in orgainc oil with organic butter and sea salt and it's the best popcorn you'll ever have!
