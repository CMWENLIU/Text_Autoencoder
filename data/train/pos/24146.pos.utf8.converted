I'm a newcomer to Travedi water. Unlike most bottled water, Travedi water tastes good. One noticeable difference--and I'm still testing the effect--is my skin. It looks healthier. (And, yes, I drink water all the time anyway, and I stay away from soda, and other carbonated beverages). All in all, this water can be delivered to your front door and tastes good. In another couple of weeks, I'll give more feedback.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
