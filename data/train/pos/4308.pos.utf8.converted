This is great.  My two, older adopted cats, are strictly indoors.  I start a quarter cup of seeds every 3 months or so, and they love the fresh greens.  If I get behind on schedule, they try to eat houseplants, which is dangerous.  It starts easier than the package suggests.  You do not have to go the dark, covered route.  Just keep it misted.  When the seeds sprout, they take off on their own.  I put a rubber band over the pot, so the grass can grow great and the cats can't get too excited and steal the entire plant. If you don't secure the planting, the cats will take it out of the container.
