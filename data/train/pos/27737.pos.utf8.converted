This cereal is my mainstay.  While trying to keep my weight down, it's a great snack to grab instead of something not near as healthy.  I can no longer find it in any of the nearby stores, so I have it delivered monthly from Amazon.  Really helpful.  A healthy, delicious cereal for kids and adults.  My grandchildren love to snack on it while watching TV.
