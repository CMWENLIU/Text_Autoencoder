I tried the boardwalk blend,The package says smooth, medium roast with some extra bold flavor<br /><br />I would say the description if pretty accurate.  I did not have an problem with execution in my<br />machine like some people are writing about.  I have been mostly "rolling my own" with the ekobrew<br />refillable cup which I love!! but when I am in hurry out the door this works great to get my buzz on.
