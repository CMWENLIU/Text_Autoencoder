I have pretty much kicked my coke/diet coke habit and its thanks to products like this. I wanted to drink more water and less canned soda. I have a hard time getting excited to drink water so I needed something to spice it up. I've tried other products and liked them but not many offer a great taste with low/no calorie, while being enhanced with vitamins.<br /><br />I've tried zipfizz and loved them but at more than a dollar a pop it was getting expensive. I ran across this while looking at the Mio products and thought it was cheaper while also containing vitamins so I'll give it a try first. I have been pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. It has a little bit of a vitamin'y taste (cant think of a better way to describe it) but not bad at all. You can meter however much you want into your water so your tastes may be different than mine. All in all the taste is very close to Hawaiian Punch. I don't get the same energy buzz I got from ZipFizz but it does give you a small kick to help you out. This costs ~$0.20 a shot for me, I take about 2 full shots in my water bottle and I'm done.<br /><br />I think I've found my new favorite water enhancer and only wish I had the option of "Subscribe and Save" so I don't have to worry about running out.
