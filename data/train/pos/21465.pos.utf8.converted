These do a great job of catching moths in my closet, but you have to assemble them properly. The traps come with little lure tabs -- when you're ready to place the trap, open a lure envelope and find the small lure square inside. Stick the lure square to the adhesive inside the trap. It's the lure that the moths find irresistible, and then they get stuck to the adhesive. My traps generally get full in about 2 months, and then I have to replace them.
