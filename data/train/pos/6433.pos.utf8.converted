I have tried several brands of almond flour in the last year, and they are languishing in my freezer. The others are more coarse and good for a non-flour, or non-gluten pie crust, (as in a pie crust that would call for crushed nuts anyway) or something not needing a refined, soft texture, like a granola bar perhaps. But if you want success in your baking, especially for cakes, pancakes, muffins, biscuits,(oh so good and tender!), then this is the almond flour to use.<br /><br />The texture is very fine, so it incorporates well in beaten batters. As it is not as heavy, whatever you are baking will rise higher, be lighter, and have a soft, nice texture, than when using more coarse almond flour. I have used it alone for low carb, or non-wheat baking, and have mixed it with non-gluten, and non-wheat, (but with gluten) flours, with complete success.  Some flours are so strong in taste, they overpower anything else one puts in the batter. The soft flavor allows your other flavors, like sweetener, flavoring, extracts, nuts, or fruits, to be more flavorful, and balanced in the baked goods.<br /><br />what I received was slightly sweet, almost no nutty flavor, without any trace of oxidation or spoiling. I keep a recipe or two worth in my refrigerator, and the bulk of it in my freezer. Depending on what I am making , I may let it come to room temperature, or just use it cold. Your recipe will guide you.<br />To use, just stir gently, measure lightly, and continue with your recipe.<br /><br />The flour costs a bit more, but can be purchased in bulk quantities. See the box for information if you cannot get the size you want on Amazon.<br /><br />I think you will be happy using this flour. This flour is a great answer to low carb, non-wheat, or non-gluten baking!<br />And no, I do not work for the company or Amazon, but am happy to have found such an excellent product for my low carb, non-wheat baking!
