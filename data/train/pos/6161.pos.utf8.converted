This is a wonderfully grassy, fresh-tasting oil.  It is worth EVERY penny;  I use it anywhere that I want the fresh flavor of the oil to shine through -- fresh lemon vinegrette, homemade hummus, as a dipping oil for fresh bread, etc.  It works fine for cooking or sauteeing but to be honest, it's best used in items that aren't cooked so that the flavor can really sing.
