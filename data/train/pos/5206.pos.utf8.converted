We got a couple packs of this gravy in a gift basket one christmas and made it over biscuits for breakfast one day. it was DELICIOUS!!! I looked for it in stores and couldn't find it. That's when i turned to the internet and ordered a case. It is so simple to make and tastes delicious--even better than the canned gravies. Brown some ground sausage and mix it in or leave it plain-either way a real treat.
