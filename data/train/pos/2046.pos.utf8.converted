Let me make this very simple. Unless you're spending $30/oz. on "inexpensive" sturgeon caviar, this may be your best option for flavor, and it's almost certainly your best option on a price / value basis. The black caviar is small (which you'd expect of white fish), but it's clean and crisp tasting, with the freshness of the sea. Works really well as a garnish. At this price and this quantity, you can't ask for anything more. Highly recommended.
