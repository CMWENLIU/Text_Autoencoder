My wife and I make and go through a 2-lb. batch of hummus a week (we pack it for lunch every day) - we have been doing this for 3 years.  I just used the Al-Wadi tahini I got via Amazon and it made the best batch of hummus I have ever had.  Until now I have been using tahini I bought at the nearby supermarket, and I always thought that the bitterness I tasted was just a natural part of the tahini.  The Al-Wadi has nothing but pure nutty creaminess and no bitterness.  I also noticed that it is runnier than what I usually get, indicating that it has a higher oil content and also that it was in fresher condition than what I had been buying.  It had not had time to settle out and clump up at the bottom - so it's easier to use.  Buying it this way is also much cheaper than what I have been getting at the store.  So I think I have found my Secret Key Ingredient for great hummus and will stick with this from now on.
