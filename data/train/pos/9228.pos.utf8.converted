I took a tour of the Numi facility in Oakland and I am totally sold on them as a company. If you are going to drink tea, drink their tea. Its a brother and sister operation, they are good to their suppliers all the way down the chain, they try to be really efficient with the way they ship and their products are all real - not "natural flavors" ie jasmine tea uses real jasmine flowers to scent the tea - most spray it on to get the smell.<br /><br />The Puerh bricks are really cool, like a choclolate bar. Break off the one chunk and drop it in the pot and you can get several steeps. Good rich flavor.
