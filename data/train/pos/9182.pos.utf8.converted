I buy this flour for our younger son who is on Glutet-free/Casein-free diet but all family enjoy teff pancakes.<br /><br />Recipe cannot be easier:<br />- 3 large eggs,<br />- 2 tbs of fructose or honey (can be substituted with sugar),<br />- 4 cups of spring water,<br />- 2 + (1/4) cup of teff flour,<br />- 1/2 tsp of baking soda + 2 tsp of freshly squeezed lemon juice (you can add this mix at the end as a multi-purpose rising agent for any baking).<br />Usually I use two 10" frying pans at once to make flat pancakes as fast as possible.<br />:)
