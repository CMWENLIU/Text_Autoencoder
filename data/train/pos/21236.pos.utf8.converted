I can't believe there are only two reviews for this product.<br /><br />This pizza crust is simply amazing.  I made one pizza according to package directions (it makes 2 large crusts) and with the left over dough I made some pizza rolls for the kids and a calzone for my husband.  You can roll this out with ease, fill it, seal it etc.  The kids loved the pizza rolls, my husband raved over the crispiness of the crust on his calzone and my pizza was perfect.<br /><br />Includes the yeast packet and xanthan gum.  Requires egg, oil, water, cider vinegar, and sugar (which is optional).  Easy to make, easy to roll, very tasty.
