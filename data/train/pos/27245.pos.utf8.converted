I have searched high and low for anything that would satisfy my sweet tooth and chocolate cravings without a ton of fat and sugar.  Well I am now addicted to these.  I LOVE THEM.  I have two a day at least - bad days 3 - very satisfying - feel full afterwards.  With a glass of skim milk is a great snack.  Dropped all candy snacks and other bars - having just these for my snacks - and I've lost 22 lbs - and I do not exercise.  I couldn't be happier.  If you have chocolate cravings or crave snacks - even late at night - you have got to try these.  This is my only review ever - only time I felt so strong about something that I took the time to do it.  Hope you all enjoy as much as I do.  I have them delivered monthly from Amazon automatically for a better price - with free shipping.
