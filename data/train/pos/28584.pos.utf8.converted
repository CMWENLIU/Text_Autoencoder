I'm old-school in the toothpick department. We'd fill old Rx bottles with cinnamon oil that we bought at the drugstore and eat them on the bus. The hotter the better.<br /><br />Personally, I think these babies are great for everything from weight-control to quitting smoking. Sugar free too. Packs pop in your purse. Yes, I'm a lady but I still love me some cinnamon-picks!
