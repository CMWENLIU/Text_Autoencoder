I bought this to season home made french fries for guests.  It was a big hit for those that like Vinegar chips like me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I developed an allergy to potatoes, bread, wheat and other starches.  Gives me arthritis for the short answer.<br /><br />So, I use it on my home made chicken wings.  Wow, bangin'. I really like this stuff.<br /><br />I have not tried a whole bunch of Vinegar powder/salt options but this stuff tastes real good.<br />My wife really likes fries and vinegar chips as well.  This was a great addition to my seasonings.<br /><br />BIG DEAL...  This stuff does not have any kind of flower in it to prevent caking. This means those with some allergies can eat it!!!<br />Check first to be sure they don't change the formula on me.
