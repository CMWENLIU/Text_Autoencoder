I can't understand how something that smells so terrible to humans can be "so loved" by dogs??  I have been using canned tripe and thought that these would be a good treat, especially when we are traveling on the road.  I know that there are tremendous healthy benefits from green tripe (enzymes) and this product is a bulls-eye.  A healthy supplement to a dogs everyday diet.  I particularly like that these treats are stick-like and similar to jerky, which gives the dog some time to consume rather than a small "treat" - although I know I can break into pieces, it's much more effective to use whole.  Product is 100 percent green tripe and nothing else - I noticed that they reduced the price on this product since I placed my last order - much appreciated!  Be warned to keep the bag pointed away from you when opening, otherwise you'll be exposed to the smell......
