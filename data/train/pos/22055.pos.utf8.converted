I saw all the great reviews for the Bragg's brand apple cider vinegar and bought some to try for my many issues.  The only way I could drink it was by mixing a tablespoon with V-8.  I decided to order these capsules instead and have been taking them for about a week.  For years I have been suffering from lower back pain.  Trouble sleeping, bending over, etc. without moaning from the pain.  I woke up this morning and was completely amazed that I did not have any back pain!!  All day I have been bending over to touch the ground to test and make sure that I'm not going crazy, but the pain is gone!  I'm telling everyone who will listen to me about this miracle.  I sure hope that my relief lasts and I can only give the credit to these ACV caplets since I do not take anything else for any kind of pain relief...except for the occasional Advil for a rare headache.  I'm not sure if these little guys will help with other issues going forward, but I have decided to subscribe to a monthly shipment just for the pain relief.  They smell like vinegar and go down easily.  I am more than pleased and still in shock at how I feel!
