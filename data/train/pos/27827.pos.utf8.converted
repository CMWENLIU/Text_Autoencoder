I have an allergy to onions so I can't eat most canned chili. There is onion powder in this but not actual onions. I find the turkey variety to be very flavorful and appealing. It's not overly greasy like the beef variety tends to be. It is high in sodium if that is a concern for you. It's great for a quick high protein meal. On days that I know I'm going to roller derby practice or the gym, I'll have a can a couple hours before I go and don't get that weak/shaking feeling while I'm working out. Word of warning however; the cans are shipped individually. 3 of the 6 cans were dented upon arrival. Since I don't care about the aesthetics of a can, it's no problem as far as I'm concerned but others might find that disconcerting.
