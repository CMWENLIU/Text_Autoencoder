If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm, that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, non-fat dry milk, dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali. The blend of cocoa powders is especially rich and smooth.<br /><br />This is a super fast dessert to make because all you do is put milk (even nonfat milk works) in a blender, add the packet of cocoa and then blend with a few cups of ice.<br /><br />Within seconds of sharing this with my husband, we both knew we had been drinking this beverage too fast. Brain freeze! You can drink this much faster than a milkshake. You have been warned. It is tempting and delicious, but may need to be sipped more slowly...or not.<br /><br />Optional toppings include whipped cream and of course chocolate shavings. Sipping this while wearing Opium perfume is a fun experience. It seems to enhance the experience and add new levels to the chocolate perfection. Oh I think I feel a sugar rush coming on...<br /><br />My favorite way to drink this:<br /><br />1. Turn on heating blanket when the weather turns cold.<br /><br />2. Climb into bed wearing something silky.<br /><br />3. Sip away while reading poetry.<br /><br />So delicious!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
