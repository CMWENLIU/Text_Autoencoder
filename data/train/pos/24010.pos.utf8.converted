My husband has cancer, and we have eliminated sugar and white flour from our diet but enjoy sweets. He had been craving honey,and acacia honey does not boost the glycemic index as regular honey does. To our dismay we could not find acacia honey in our local stores. He was so happy I found and ordered St. Dalfour honey online abd got it for him for Christmas!<br /><br />The honey is delicious, the sale price was fair, and we received it quickly, in plenty of time for Christmas.
