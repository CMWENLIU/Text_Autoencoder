I am a huge fan of the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte which is a seasonal item.  I don't get to Starbucks every day and, let's face it, I'm not thrilled at shelling out $4.50 or so for their PSL.  I've been able to find listings for the Starbucks PS Sauce on auction sites, but the prices range from about $40 on up once all is said and done.  I ordered this product and it arrived quickly.  I now make my own Pumpkin Spice Lattes at home - they taste great - and I can have them every day!<br /><br />Highly recommended....
