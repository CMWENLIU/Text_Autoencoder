Great product at a good price.  It used to be possible to buy edible silver and gold leaf (vark) at Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays importing it.  So I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  You can use the silver leaf to cover an entire cake, if you wish.  I made an Indian-inspired cheesecake, putting a thin layer of rose-petal jam on top of the cookie crumb/nut base, making a traditional cheesecake filling using rosewater for flavoring, and then covering it with silver vark.  It was an amazing success -- nobody had ever seen anything like it before and they were just fascinated by it!  To cover the cake, just carefully slide the sheets of silver onto the cake from the paper leaves they're packed on.  Smooth the silver using a brush, like a cosmetic brush.  It won't be perfectly smooth, but good enough to impress your guests.  You can further decorate the cake with some silver dragees, if you wish.  Don't overdo, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit excessive with a dessert like this!!!
