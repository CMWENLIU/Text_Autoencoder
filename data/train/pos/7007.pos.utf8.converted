I never liked eating brown rice growing up even though my parents tried it for quite some time.  I looked and tried several different brown rice brands before sticking with this brand a few years ago.<br /><br />Some of my friends that brown rice takes a lot longer time to cook.  Well, this brand allows me to cook with white rice setting in a rice cooker.  The only adjustment that I have to do is to use 1.25 cup of water for every cup of rice.  I do like my rice to be separated, so I add 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  With this method, the rice always comes up good and chewy.
