Add Vitamin E to help with wrinkles and stretch marks. Only moisturizer that does not break out my Ultra sensitive skin, no clogged pores. Really after thirty years of searching countless products this actually helps my face look way way better. The sking on my hands, neck, chest, and lips love it too. Use it all over, makes skin almost as soft as skin so soft does. :)<br /><br />Better price on Amazon with auto-delivery than at Earth-fare, which carries tons of this stuff. Any product that is carried in such quantity at a health food store always catches my attention.<br /><br />Strong smell with cooking, use limited amounts for introducing taste to family members. Butter replacement.  When I have kids it will be my go-to oil for adding full fat flavor to veggies, muffins, and toast.<br /><br />Great in the bedroom too. ;)<br /><br />Look up health benefits and uses with an online search.
