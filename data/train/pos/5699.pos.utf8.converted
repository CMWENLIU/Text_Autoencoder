I ordered this plant along with the red and green leaf prayer plants.  All arrived packaged very well.  No dirt was spilled or anything like that.  All three plants were beautiful, healthy, and ready to be repotted and take off growing.  I still have them all in their original containters but will repot them soon.  They are still looking great after being "home" for a few days.  I would recommend ordering from Amazon and Hirt's.
