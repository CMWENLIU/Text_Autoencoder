Growing up in Southeast Asia, we had easy access to New Zealand's Anchor butter for everyday consumption. Moving to the States as an adult, I found the butters here tasteless. I thought it was just a change in my tastebuds, but when I was able to get Anchor butter again, I did a simple taste test and realized that the high quality flavour of the NZ butter was real!  I have tried all kinds of butter here - organic and not, even butters imported from France, Ireland, Germany, etc. Nothing - NOTHING - comes close to the fresh taste of New Zealand's Anchor Butter, which has hints of clover and something really special that's hard to describe!  The NZ government has very strict regulations for its cows and all, and these cows graze upon meadow grasses - you can taste it in the butter!<br /><br />So if you're reading this and getting curious - don't waste another second - order yourself some real Anchor Butter. You won't regret it, and you won't look back!
