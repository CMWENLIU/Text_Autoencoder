This is the first time I've purchased "Dutch process" cocoa, and I have to say, it is delicious! It is rich and mild, lacking the bitterness of regular cocoa powders. I bought it with no particular purpose in mind (I don't bake), just looking for ways to add more cocoa into my diet to get that great chocolate taste as well as the healthy antioxidants it provides. I've been enjoying experimenting mainly with adding it to hot beverages such as coffee or coffee substitutes. Often I don't even bother to sweeten these beverages - the mild flavor of this cocoa allows me to enjoy its natural chocolate flavor unsweetened. I even added a big spoonful to my oatmeal recently, along with everything else I normally add, and that was a treat! I'm looking forward to finding more ways to work it into my diet.
