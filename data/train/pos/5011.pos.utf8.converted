The other reviewers are right: hands down the best coconut juice out there. The flavor is natural, good-bodied, and with none of that tinny after-taste you get from supermarket brands. One 17 oz can is amazingly filling and low calorie, which makes this an ideal mid-afternoon snack with none of the suspect ingredients in protein bars. With summer coming up, here's a tip: we also use Amy & Brian coconut juice in our hotel bar to mix unusual and refreshing cocktails - big hits. We prefer the version with pulp.
