I'm an American, born and bred, but also an admitted British tea snob. And this is my absolute favorite bagged tea. I love TofA Gold as a loose leaf, but sometimes I just want to grab a quick mug. These bags are an excellent bagged cuppa!<br /><br />Great rich flavored blend of black teas, without the funk of some Chinese varieties or the perfume-y taste of other blends. Good balance all around.<br /><br />If you appreciate a really good cup of tea, with the convenience of a tea bag, this is the tea for you.
