Our water comes from a well and is super high in mineral content.  So the minerals build up on everything it touches.  So, the minerals "ate" our hot tub, our hot water heater, and a couple dishwashers!  AUGH!  I stumbled upon the idea of using citric acid in the dishwasher to clear out the debris and eureka!  It works!  It just makes everything that was dull...sparkle!  So now I clean the shower stall and bathtub, sinks, anything that has been affected...with a little citric acid added to my cleaner.  Good trick.  What I'm not sure of is..will the citric acid corrode things eventually?<br />At our local drugstore you can buy 5 ounces of citric acid for $18!  The NOW Foods 5 pound tub is close to that same price and came very quickly.  I'm about to order more.
