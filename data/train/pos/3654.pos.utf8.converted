I ordered these chicken strips because they were Made in the US. After having  a friend lose two dogs to the contaminated dog food from China I made the decision to not purchase anything for my Shih Tzu that is made in China. She is too precious to give her anything that is made there. The item is a little pricey but well worth it for the health and well being of my pet.
