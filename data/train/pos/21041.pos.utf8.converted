I used to buy Mrs. May's nut crunches for my family....until I discovered they were made of Chinese grown ingredients.  They used to also put their products together in China, which I see they've changed.  But that aside, they are still sourcing their ingredients from a country that sees nothing wrong with putting melamine in milk and dog food and uses lead based paints on childrens' toys.  I tried Mareblu's Cashew Crunch a few months ago because their products are made in the U.S. of ingredients sourced in the U.S.  They're wonderful!  They are as good or better than Mrs. May's and the carbon footprint used to create these products has to be half.
