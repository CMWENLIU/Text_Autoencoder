I have never been a big fan of maple syrup but I set up an Amazon subscribe and save subscription for this product because everyone else in my family loves maple syrup and I wanted to get an organic product since we go through it so fast.  Also, my husband kept complaining that the maple syrup I was buying at Costco just wasn't all that great.  You can imagine my surprise when I tasted this maple syrup and discovered how amazingly good it is.  I never used to put syrup on my pancakes but now I want to make pancakes simply so I can eat some of this syrup.  It is that good.  I highly recommend this product.
