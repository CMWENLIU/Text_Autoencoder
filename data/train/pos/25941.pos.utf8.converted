I bought this from their online site last year.  It's a wonderful product.  I use it mainly for skin and hair.  Smells great like fresh coconuts. Not overly greasy like baby oil.  Solid at cooler temperatures so bring the jar in the bathroom with you so that it heats up after your shower and pour it into a squeeze bottle (ketchup bottles works well).  Apply after bathing like you would any bath oil.  My skin is moist and smells yummy.  Also can be used as anti-frizz hair serum.<br />I almost bought another brand on amazon because of free shipping, but glad I didn't because other brands come in plastic jars.  I think glass jars keeps better.  The oil I bought a year ago still smells the same.  And if you buy at their site, you'll sometimes come across special offers like buy one get one free.  Also, their site has interesting info such as why there's no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil.  I bought several jars and gave one to my mom and my best friend's mom.  That's how much I love this stuff.  Just bought 6 more jars today so I won't run out.  Planning to give away some jars to friends too.
