A little mayo and sweet relish and great tasting ham salad results.<br />DAK Ham is priced right, tasty and easy to store in quanity.<br />We have been using it for years. Unfortunatly the main grocery stores do not shelve it. Drug outlets are our only local source. Walgreens has a knock off brand.
