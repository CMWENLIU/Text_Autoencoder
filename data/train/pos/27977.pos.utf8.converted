If tragic events in your life have brought you to such a point where you would actually consider eating this stuff, do yourself a favor and try only a single drop on a chip first (though using even this much is not recommended). If, after enduring heat that transcends time and space, you manage to survive, then you can up the ante.<br /><br />This is not to be confused with your average "hot sauce." This is capsaicin oil, which is the pure extract of the hottest chilis. If you do not respect this substance, it will end you.<br /><br />That being said, I love this stuff. You can add a drop or two to a pot of chili and it spices it up perfectly. Many people are discouraged by the price tag, but this is extract and it will last you a long time (even if you eat spicy food often).<br /><br />The menacingly dark bottle itself comes with a little eye-dropper. This bottle is also put in a mock-prescription bottle (complete with a functioning child-safe push/twist cap). Overall I find this to be a great value, and I'm on bottle #2 now. The first one lasted over a year.
