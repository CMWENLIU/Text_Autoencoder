My wife and I lived in Germany in the late 1980s.  We love coffee and tried many 'local brands' until we finally found Prodomo.  We loved it immediately.  Since beginning to drink Prodomo, we have never 'gone back'!  On more than one occasion, we visited their primary shop in Munich (a truly amazing place that caters to everything gourmet!!)  When we first returned to the US, I was smuggling the coffee home on my frequent business trips or, when I wasn't going to Germany, we had friends of ours in Germany send the coffee to us.  FINALLY, it became available in the US.  We have hooked many people on this coffee.  Honestly, I have never had anyone not LOVE it!<br /><br />We still drink Dallmayr Prodomo every day - in fact, at least twice on most days.
