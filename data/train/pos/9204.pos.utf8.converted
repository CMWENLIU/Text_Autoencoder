Being a type II diabetic is challenging when it comes to desserts. Concerned that I was consuming too many products using artificial sweeteners and while researching some other products (allergic to stevia and agave), I came across the SweetTree Blonde evaporated palm sugar which claims a glycemic index of 35. My body has had positive gylcemic reactions to sesame and coconut products and I made the purchase on faith that the glycemic load using this sugar versus artificial sweeteners would be similar. I made a batch of cookies using Splenda and another batch using the SweetTree blonde sugar and then tested my blood glucose.  I did this repeatedly over the course of about 7 days and was pleasantly surprised that my blood sugars in both cases were consistently within a few points of each other.  So, for my body I found this sugar to be just as good a substitute as splenda.  For my money, I would rather put something in me that is closer to nature. We use it now in our morning coffee and the company will be releasing a new liquid version of the product in the fall sometime.
