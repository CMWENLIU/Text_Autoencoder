I have now tried several different Matcha's. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST<br /><br />I am very sensitive to substances that go into my body. Do your research. I did.<br /><br />I drink Green Tea for the health benefits. I am 61 years old now. My metabolism has slowed. My brain never tolerated caffeine very well. And, I do not want or like to be physically addicted to any drug (caffeine). When I was in Iraq, I drank caffeinate concentrated coffee (1 can of triple shot) per day. When I missed a day or two, my body went into a sluggish withdrawal with headache/stuffy brain. That was awful.<br /><br />I read about this Do Matcha Green Tea and how the other substances (Catechins, etc.) in it were so healthful and that the caffeine was low. I tried it and found there were no withdrawal symptoms after drinking one cup every day for a week. To my surprise it was just as uplifting as the Triple Shot had been, but with less than a third of the caffeine. It also had a very calming effect and produced a mental clarity I enjoyed in my 20's and 30's.<br /><br />The other Matcha's I tried because of cheaper price failed to produce the mental clarity. Mental clarity is what I missed the most in getting older. Only Do Matcha first harvest (Ceremonial Grade) has produced this. Read up on this so that I do not have to write so much to impart knowledge to those who do not know.<br /><br />I do not drink this for the taste. I drink it for the health benefits. The others DO NOT measure up to Do Matcha!!!<br /><br />You get what you pay for. Many extoll the different mixes they use Green Tea for. That is not me. I drink it straight with cool water. I don't want to lose any of the nutrition because of heated water. I use a battery operated frother to mix it. I like the veggie taste (like raw spinach). It is a quick drink that uplifts, enlivens, and clarifies. If you need to enhance your life. Pay for this. Yes, it is expensive... and worth the extra cost if you value your health.<br /><br />My body has become more supple. No more morning stiffness. No more morning grogginess. No more sore feet when getting out of bed. I have been using Do Matcha (and tried others) for 7 months now. I can quit without any signs of withdrawal. But, the age factors set in again.<br /><br />So, one cup a day of Do Matcha seems to be quite therapeutic for me.
