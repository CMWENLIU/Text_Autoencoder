I thought that one of my cats was just going to have a dry coat that wasn't very nice looking. After about 1/2 of a bag of this his coat became shiny and soft. Now he's just gorgeous. While my cats don't act like this is kitty crack, they seem to like it, and eat it just as they should without overeating. The price is great and I'm really happy that I found the right food for my cats.
