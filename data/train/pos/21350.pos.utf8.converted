Fantastically-addictive German candies -- if you've never had them, try them -- you're in for a treat.  It's the way these soft chewy candies dissolve on your tongue that is so special.  The tart strawberry taste is fantastic and you get that wonderful rush just when both the grainy-marshmallowy inside and crystal sugar outside dissolves together.  A great candy buzz.
