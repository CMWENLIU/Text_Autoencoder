When I worked in a local cafe, we used Torani chocolcate, caramel, and mayan chocolate sauces.  The store didn't last long, but it wasn't because of the sauces!  Our lattes were the most popular things on the menu, and many people ordered the mocha (that we called Dame Holda), which used this sauce.<br /><br />This sauce is sure to impress if you are whipping up espresso drinks for friends, because it is the cafe stuff--just remember to use good-quality espresso beans with it ;)
