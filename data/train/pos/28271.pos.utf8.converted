I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QRPH3M">Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Treats, Medium</a> actually worked really well. We have a medium-sized lab + something mix and she really enjoyed these. I'm generally not a big fan of dog treats, because they stink,, they don't help her breath/teeth much, they have funky things inside, and she has powerful jaws that enable her to go through just about any treat in a short amount of time.<br /><br />ODOR<br />As far as the smell goes, this wasn't bad at all. In fact, not only did it improve her breath, but there was a noticeable reduction in plaque. I didn't expect the treats to actually accomplish this, and was glad to see how well they worked.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />All natural and healthy.<br /><br />LONGEVITY<br />Unfortunately, the treats didn't last long. She finished each one in just a few minutes. I suppose I shouldn't expect treats like this to last too long (hence, the five stars), but it would be nice if they did.
