I was expecting this chocolate to not taste good because it's healthy and is made with stevia.  I am on the maintenance phase of the hcg diet, so cannot have any sugar at all.  I LOVE this chocolate and am getting ready to place another order for it.  I had to request the nutrition information because none came with it.  Here it is for anyone that wants it:<br />Serving size:  1 bar (45g)<br />Calories:  260<br />Calories from fat:  210<br />Total fat:  24g<br />Saturated fat: 14g<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br />Total carbohydrate:  12g<br />Dietary fiber:  7g<br />Sugars:  0g<br />Protein 7g<br /><br />I eat about half a bar a day after lunch and it really hits the spot!  Good for anyone on a sugar-free or low carb diet.
