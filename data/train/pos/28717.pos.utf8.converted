I was really worried about this cheese. Would it arrive and already be bad? Would it get here and be horrible? Too salty? Too mushy?<br /><br />Well it arrived packed with cold packs, not enough to freeze it though. The texture, flavor and everything about it was wonderful!<br /><br />I was also worried that since it was so cheap that it would be a low quality feta, but it was WAY better than anything I've been able to get around here. And you certainly can't beat that even with the shipping it was cheaper a 1/4 the cost of what I can find locally.<br /><br />Of course there was that issue that it was 2lbs of feta, which I can't go through very quickly. Fortunately, all the greek sites I found said that freezing it is fine. The texture will change slightly and may put off some people if they just want to snack on it, but its perfectly fine for cooking, salads, omlettes, etc.<br /><br />I have added this seller to my list of favorites and expect to return again and again.
