So, good, in fact, that they may lead to oversnacking, which would defeat the purpose.  Basically the fruit crisps are just like thin pop-tarts, so the idea behind it is to finish off the meal or enjoy them with a cup of coffee rather than pig out on them like a chunk of cheesecake.  I think they are overpriced, however, the net weight per pound is right up there with top sirloin, and any time they charge that much for sugar and flour, I have to wait for them to go on sale.  Very delicious, though, I have to limit myself to one pack at a time or else I'll get in trouble...
