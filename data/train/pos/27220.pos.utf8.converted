I tried several varieties before committing to the subscribe program and this one edged out my second favorite, the French Roast. Every batch is as good as the first and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />I'm also delighted with Amazon's subscriber program, especially since I rely on others to shop for me and this is just one more thing that I can get for myself, on my own timetable, and not have to wait until they are ready to go. Thanks Amazon! Please continue to add more quality items to your grocery service.
