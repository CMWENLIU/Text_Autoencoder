I'm new to Korean food but I have an adventurous palate.  Here is my American way to "ruin" this dish:  Boil about double the water they recommend, then reduce to a simmer.  Add diced or sliced fresh soup vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, okra, etc) and the spice mix and the dried veggie mix.  Cook until the carrots are softened. Then toss in diced fresh tomato and the noodles (I like to pulverize the noodles in the package first so they will stay on my soup spoon; cannot master chopsticks!). Just before you take it off the heat, toss in a raw egg or two and mix rapidly.<br /><br />Then you have a big hearty pot of soup, with the salt and MSG diluted but still full of flavor, feeds 2 or 3.
