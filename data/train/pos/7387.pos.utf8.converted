*Update*<br /><br />These are now in my regular lunch rotation, regardless of whether that's during the school year, or during summer. The meal presented in this kit is healthy AND delicious, and the perfect size for carrying aboard a long flight, on a road trip, or for a quick lunch at work. For me, Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature also adds an extra incentive to keep these on hand, with the 15% discount, $1.00 off coupon promo that's currently on for it, and the free shipping feature. SO many reasons to keep these around!<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />I got lucky enough to come across one of these at, of all places, my local TJ Maxx store. Having tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLF2E">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> before, and enjoyed it, I was excited to see this one on the shelf, as it has the same dry roasted edamame in it that I've been craving since the salmon salad meal kit.<br /><br />Honestly, I think THIS one may be my favorite of the two!<br /><br />The first thing that I dove into was, of course, the lightly salted dry roasted edamame. As in my previous experience with them, they were super dry, and needed some liquid help getting to my belly, but they're tasty & filling enough that they still have me wanting more of them.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix was delicious, but don't ask me to give you any details on what, exactly, I liked most about it, because I devoured it so quickly that, outside of the spicy & sweet kick of it, it's hard to give details. Just let it be said that if you're looking for a trail mix without too much sweet or salty, this will perfectly satisfy that craving, while adding a nice crunch from the nuts, chewiness from the flavored dried cranberries, and spicy bite from the pepper coating on the almonds. Delicious!<br /><br />There were no utensils in this GoPicnic box whatsoever, but the only thing I needed was a pair of scissors to snip a corner off of the hummus pouch. If you take this with you on a hike, you'll undoubtedly already be carrying either a Leatherman-type tool, or a Victorinox-style Swiss army knife, so either of those will have what you need. If you DON'T have a comparable tool with you, opening the hummus pouch might be a bit more laborious, but I can't imagine it'd be impossible. Since I like skinny lines of hummus or whatever I happen to be applying to a surface for consumption (horsey sauce at Arby's, mustard & catsup on my burger, etc., etc., etc.), I only cut off a small corner to ensure that I could get the thin lines of hummus that I wanted onto my Crunchmaster multigrain crackers (which, incidentally, I'd never had before, but am now in love with). The WildGarden Traditional flavored hummus (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IMSQ">Hummos-Single Serve Packet (10 Packets)</a> had a delightful tang, and was delicious! There was plenty to cover every Crunchmaster cracker, pieces and all, and still enough left to squeeze a generous dollop onto my finger for a final tangy treat.<br /><br />As always, the box contained a delicious, smooth square of dark chocolate that was just the right amount of sweet and tasty, without being too much of anything else. The box also had a Sudoku puzzle on the bottom of it, as had the box containing the salmon salad meal that I'd tried before.<br /><br />Overall, I'm finding that these GoPicnic meals are just right for me for a satisfying cold lunch at work when I don't have time to nuke anything before my next class, and I'm seriously considering subscribing to one of 'em, just to have 'em around. I honestly wish Amazon would make up a variety pack of these as an option, because, having liked both of the two that I've tried, I'm starting to think that I'd like 'em all!<br /><br />Delicious, convenient, AND healthy! This one covers all the bases!
