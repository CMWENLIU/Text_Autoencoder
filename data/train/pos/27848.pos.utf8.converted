This is a classic candy bar. I love this candy and probably rate it among the best. There is only ONE problem, and that is if you bought it at the store it would be a little cheaper. I purchased a case of 25 bars and it came to a little over a dollar a bar. I can get it at most convenient store or even CVS for about 75 cents each. not a good internet bargain. Also let me add that if you put it next to another kind of bar like snickers or almond joy it seems very little for the money. Come on Planters get with the program!
