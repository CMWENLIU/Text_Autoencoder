I've been drinking Lipton Cold Brew for several years now, and honestly, it's one of my favorite drinks. All you have to do is soak a tea bag in a pitcher of cold water for a few minutes, add a little sugar according to your tastes (although, really, you could drink it without any) and you're good to go!<br /><br />Although Lipton also offers Cold Brew bags for individual glasses, I find that's kind of a pain, if you drink any real amount. It's much easier to brew an entire pitcher and put it in your fridge, instead of bothering with individual glasses.
