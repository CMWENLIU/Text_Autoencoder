Kukicha, and Eden Kukicha in particular, is an old and trusted friend of mine.  When prepared well (and there may be many alternatives to skillfully preparing this brew) it has a mildly rich and mellow flavor that is very settling to both mind and body.  A great follow-up to sushi with pickled ginger (an Eden-style treat to be sure) or (perhaps a more distant match but equally well suited) to good chocolate, it is my favorite beverage for many and most occasions.<br /><br />To maximize that rcih and mellow flavor, prepare several cups at a time by boiling water (for optimal results, use a pyrex or other non-metallic pot) and steeping one teabag per cup.  When I am thinking ahead and have the time, I make a quart in a saucepan in the evening, keeping the water just below boiling for a few minutes after the four teabags have been added for the tea to really brew.  Then allowing it to stand overnight, it mellows and loses that tannic edge.  In the morning, I re-heat and put in a thermos to enjoy through the day.  You may find with this method that you can use only two or three teabags per quart of water to get the flavor you like.<br /><br />Or, for more immediate resutls on a cup-by-cup basis, pre-heat your cup with some hot water, then discard the water and fill with just-boiled water, add a teabag, and allow to steep until it has cooled to drinking temperature, at which time the teabag can be removed.<br /><br />Kukicha has health benefits, too.  For one, it can help to neutralize the stomach.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this good tea as much as I do!  I give Eden five stars for consistently having that rich and mellow quality that I like so much in this tea, and also for the good wrapping it puts its teabags in, which  I think must help preserve freshness and flavor.
