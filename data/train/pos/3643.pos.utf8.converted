Just like a Mounds bar ... only better because it has milk chocolate instead of dark.  I remembered these from their initial marketing in the early 90s, then they disappeared.  Imagine my delight when I went to the UK and found them there.  I found them in Germany.  I found them in Bahrain.  They're made in America, but not sold here?  "Whazzupwidat"???
