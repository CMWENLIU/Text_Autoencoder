This salt is really good. I have a lot of salt in my cupboard that I bought before buying this salt, that claimed to be grinder salt, but was not.I decided to go to Amazon to see what they had and sure enough, Amazon delivered once again!!!<br />The Spice Lab Company has a great product, delivered quickly, and at a very reasonable price. The bag of salt is quite large also. It has a pink color to it, I don't know why...but it's kinda neat! I put it in my grinder and tried it and it is absolutely perfect!  I will definitley order from them again. Thank you Amazon and Spice Lab for coming through. If you want a great product for a great price and great service, then order your salt and other items from The Spice Lab<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ROJ3FQ">1 Kg Himalayan Coarse Grinder Salt</a> Company. You won't be dissappointed!!!!! Five stars for you guys!!<br />Thank you!
