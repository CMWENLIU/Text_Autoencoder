I use the wine saver almost daily to seal my favorite merlots.  I have never lost a bottle of wine since I began using it about 8 months ago.  Recently the unit suddenly froze up and would not work until I lubricated it with a little vegetable oil.  Unfortunately after that it no longer clicked when a seal was reached.  I decided to contact Vacu Vin directly via e-mail.  What a pleasant surprise when I received a reply asking me to mail them the unit for immediate replacement.  My new unit arrived several days later.  I give the product 4 Stars but the company gets 5 Stars for customer service.
