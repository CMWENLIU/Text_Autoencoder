I love it.  Hard to find in the single pack, which I want for both home and work.  At work, everyone asks for that "brown" sugar.  I love it, and so does everyone else.  The packets insure that you don't overdo it, because this sugar is sweeter (and better) than refined sugar.  The price here is great, and the only thing you have to know is that when you get the sugar, you should probably repackage it immediately into air tight containers, as it does come in a cardboard box.  Hence, the price.
