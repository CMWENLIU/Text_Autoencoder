The best, most delicious and totally consistant pumpkin pies are made from Libby's 100% Pure Pumpkin.<br /><br />A single 15 oz can makes one deep dish 9" pie (4 cup volume) or two shallow 9" pies (2 cup volume). If you are making two deep dish pies buy the 29 oz can which is far more economical.<br /><br />This is what comes in the can: 100% pure pumpkin....which can also be called pumpkin puree or solid pack pumpkin. Nothing else, so salt, no preservatives.  The pumpkin is cooked during the canning process so you could eat it straight from the can, should you so desire.<br /><br />The pumpkin pie recipe is on the back of the can. I've tried other, fancier, more complicated recipies over the years but have always come back to the tried and true because, to me, this is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like. You get a fragrant and flavorful pie with an excellent texture. The recipe calls for sugar, evaporated milk, eggs, cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, and salt. I add 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg and a dash of white pepper. Also, I like to slightly froth the eggs because it gives the filling a smoother and more delicate texture.<br /><br />The recipe calls for baking the pie 15 minutes at 425 and then 40-50 minutes at 350. I cover the crust with foil for the first 25 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Also, I find that 40 minutes at 350 is more than enough. Don't overbake! If a knife comes out clean from the center of the pie, its done.<br /><br />On average, this 15 oz can should be about two dollars and fifty cents at a supermarket.<br /><br />One last thing, if you remove the label from the can, you will find other recipies and helpful tips printed on the other side. Its a total win-win!
