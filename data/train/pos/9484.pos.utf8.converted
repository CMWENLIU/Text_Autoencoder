Good,mild tasting avocado oil.Excellent value.Bottles arrived well packaged.This is a great oil for healthy stir-fries.Safe for high heat.Cheap enough to use for everyday cooking.  4-26-12:.After using this oil for last few months I upped my rating to five stars. Just placed another order for this excellent all purpose oil.This is not a misprint,the Order does include two-1 liter bottles.Great value compared to the smaller 250ml-500ml bottles sold by other companies.And no sacrifice in quality.5-1-12,I just received my new order.Again the oil tastes great.New this time was custom molded packaging-similar to egg cartons.Bottles arrived safe and secure.Will happily keep ordering as needed.
