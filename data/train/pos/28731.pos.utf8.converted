I've tried more than ten different brands. I've tried things billed as "stock" and things billed as "broth." I've tried powdered and cubed and pastes and the liquid in a box. So one day I tried these.<br /><br />I was totally shocked. The flavor was large and complex, not overly salty, and the most like real homemade chicken stock of anything I've tried.<br /><br />The packs look about like what you would find in a BBQ dipping packet from a fast food restaurant, and are about the same size. It comes out of the pack gelatinous, just like real stock is when it is cold (though I suspect some industrial food magic is involved there). It gradually dissolves in the hot water. I found that it dissolved completely with no difficulty.<br /><br />I have so far used it to flavor grains when cooking them, in a slowcooker with roasted chicken, and as soup. Delicious every way. Highly recommended.
