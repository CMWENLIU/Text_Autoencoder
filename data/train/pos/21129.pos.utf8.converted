I've eaten stuffed grape leaves from a variety of sources and recently, I decided I'd like to add more interesting and varied on hand foods.<br /><br />I received my order today. I opened a can and it's funny to write this, but when I emptied them out onto a plate I realized what a good job they did packing them! They came out nice, and I'm amazed at how well and how many. I was going to heat them, and I figured I'd eat one cold...well, I just ate all of them without heating them, they're that good!<br /><br />I'll definitely keep this on my list.
