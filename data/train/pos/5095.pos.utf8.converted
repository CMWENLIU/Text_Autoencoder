For those of us who want to cook these noodles using traditional Japanese cooking techniques; here are the instructions:<br /><br />Traditional Cooking Instructions for Japanese Noodles: You can boil the noodles as you would any other pasta or you can use the traditional Japanese style of cooking noodles, which takes a little longer but is well worth the effort. This method is referred to as the shocking method, cold water is added to boiling water several times during the cooking process, creating a more firm, tastier noodle. For this method, place 2 quarts of cold water in a large pot, cover and bring to a boil. Remove the cover, add the noodles and stir to prevent sticking. As soon as the water comes to a boil again, add enough cold water to stop the water from boiling (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup). Bring to a boil again, and add cold water again. Repeat one or two additional times until the noodles are done. Periodically check the noodles by removing a strand and biting or cutting it in half. If the center of the noodle strand is white and the outside is darker, the noodles are not done. When the center of the noodle is the same color as the outside, and the noodles are firm yet tender to the bite they are done. Rinse Japanese noodles under cold water to prevent clumping.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Eden doesn't include the instructions on the package but they are on their website.<br /><br />Yes, I put a little peanut oil in the water and do the cool/boil 3 times over the 8 minute cooking time.  I made my own Tsuyu sauce because it's much less expensive than the prepared suace and easy enough to do.  The recipe is simple:<br /><br />3 cups dashi (bonito and konbu (kelp))<br />1 cup dark soy<br />1 cup mirin (or sake with 3/4 cup sugar)<br /><br />It lasts for months in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Enjoy...
