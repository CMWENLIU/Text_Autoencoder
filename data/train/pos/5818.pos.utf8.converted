I first tried Vegeta after hearing about it while visiting Eastern Europe in the late 90's.  It has since become a kitchen staple.  I use Vegeta when making soups, stews, Chicken or Veal Marsala or Piccata.  Vegeta can be used to season rice or pasta.  Since it is made from vegetables, I have used it to enrich the flavor of vegetarian Thanksgiving 'stuffing'.  Vegeta can also be used to enhance sauces and gravies.  If you haven't tried Vegeta, I urge you to do so.  I believe that it is widely used across Europe.
