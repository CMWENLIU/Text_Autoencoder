Last week I decided to try something new with this milk instead of just drink it from the glass. Well,have you ever tried this stuff over cereal?  AWESOME! I can't say enough good things about how it changes the dry, bland, and sometimes boring taste of plain cereal.  Without a doubt, the greatest find of '09.  I'll be sure to come back if I find any other uses for this product.
