I recently purchased this product without the subscribe and save deal, and man, was I wrong! I will definitely be purchasing Red Rain on a subscription basis. This product tastes much LESS bitter than the leading brand, but tastes better. It is almost sweet, but verrry light on the palate. I quite enjoyed sipping it. I ordered the extra strength because it is cheaper and has more bang-for-your-buck. I generally will drink half a bottle at once and judge where I am over the next half hour. If I need the extra boost, I will go for sipping the latter half of the bottle over the next half hour until my energy is right where I want it, then save the rest for later. Brilliant! when you can buy an extra-strength shot at LESS THAN HALF the original strength leading shot price! I believe this product may be the "hidden gem" of energy drinks. It is hard enough to find a cheaper energy drink that even matches the higher-priced, but tasty, competitor(s), yet this one supercedes them all! I have tried 5-hour Energy ($$), Energy 2000 Berry Flavor (taste? energy?), Monster shots (ok), 6-hour power (ok), and above all, Red Rain Extra Strength Berry (the best!)<br /><br />The search is over!!
