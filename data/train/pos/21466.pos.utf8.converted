I've had a really bad clothes moth infestation for over a year now. I have these little traps all over the house and they are all almost full. One way that I've been more successful with them lately is instead of folding the traps up in a little triangle like they're shown, I've been laying them flat under things. I discovered our infestation was the worst on my wool rug, right where the coffee table is over it (only about 1" apart). The larve were hanging from the bottom of the coffe table, which is so low that I couldn't see them. I opened a bunch of these traps up, slid them under the coffee table & the problem has almost disappeared. Each time I take them out to check, they're filled with not only the moths, but also the larvae (the real problem). As soon as they come out, they're trapped... this seems to be the key for us. Hope this helps someone!
