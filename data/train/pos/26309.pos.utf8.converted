I have tried most of the "Just the Cheese" products and I find them satisfying, at least for the most part. Some might be a little salty; some might be a little dry. Hey, they are low carb,... what do you expect! I like to keep a drink at hand for the salty or dry ones but I have found that nacho flavor stands alone. It has a strong nacho taste in crispy (rice cracker like) rounds. It is a great snack for those of us who are watching their carbs. I say, two thumbs up for this high in protien, low in carbs snack!
