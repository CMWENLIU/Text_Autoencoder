cheap ramen smell disgusting and aren't vegan. this one is and it tastes delicious. the price does suck but really that's what convenience foods like this should cost. it should always be cheaper to make your own food. so for the few times when i do not have time to cook, it is worth the $2 (or 1.50 on sale sometimes in supermarket)
