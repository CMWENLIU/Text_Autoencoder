1.  Your cocoa dusted marshmallows<br />2.  Your grand graham taste<br />3.  Thine taste of a s'more, but without the fire hazard<br />4.  The lack of apostrophe in thy name<br />5.  Your crunch that endures the early dawn<br />6.  That milk is more delicious after knowing thee<br />7.  Your daring complexity of creamy and crunch<br />8.  Your bold, yet inviting container<br />9.  Every spoonful is a sweet kiss and<br />10. Ever bite is thy salvation
