Coffee burns my throat and tea makes me shaky.  Most soda is way too sugary and Diet Coke tastes a bit like malted battery acid.<br /><br />And yet I work better with caffeine. :-(<br /><br />This is the perfect alternative.<br /><br />I only wish they sold it in California or on Amazon Prime, because the shipping cost is pretty high.
