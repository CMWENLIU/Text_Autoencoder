I suppose a gringo like me would think this is something completely different.  The peppers from which this paste is made are familiar, but you don't think of turning them into essentially a puree and cooking with them.  My favorite is mixing aji with olive oil and basting a good steak while grilling - gives it a whole new dimension.  It seems that even high heat won't break it down or make it bitter.  If you're not into spicy food, this isn't for you.  It's caliente, but not ridiculous.  Yeah, the shipping will probably cost more than the product - but unless you're in a the very big city, you won't find anything like this as your local grocer.
