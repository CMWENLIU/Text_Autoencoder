I was fairly skeptical when trying these, thinking they'd probably have little to no affect on me. I was way off. The tablets themselves are actually pretty nasty, like sucking on a vitamin, they take some time to dissolve so you've really got to be willing to put up with having these fairly unpleasant things in your mouth for at least 3-5 minutes. I recommend rolling them around all over the top of your tongue as you do, and trying not to swallow too often so you can really let your tongue absorb as much as it can. Another tip is that if you plan on trying this with liquids, do so after you've tried it with more solid foods as liquids will dissipate the effects much quicker.<br /><br />I gave it the old lemon test and I was shocked at just how sweet and delicious they were. Really, it made lemons taste like delicious lemon candy, not at all like those artificially flavored lemon drops. Natural applesauce was a bit much, but apples are already sweet so I sort of expected it. I also tried cheese, carrots, peanut butter, and while the peanut butter seemed a bit sweeter, the others didn't seem to show any affect at all.<br /><br />What impressed me the most, however, was tea. I poured myself a tall glass of unsweetened Lipton and it wasn't at all what I expected. Rather than making it taste sweet, it just removed the bitterness. Again, it's hard to articulate the sensation, but I can say that if you've ever wondered what tea tastes like without being overpowered by sweeteners or the natural bitterness found in most teas, try it with these tablets. The effect will wear off after a few minutes when you drink, but the taste you get is so uniquely pure. In all honesty, you haven't experienced tea until you've had a cup with one of these.<br /><br />I've read that wine is also good, so I may try that sometime in the future, along with other bitter fruits. I'm also curious how tomatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and bell peppers will taste. Whatever I decide, I really feel these things have opened up a whole new world of flavor experiences, and I'm really looking forward to trying them all.<br /><br />I totally recommend these tabs just for the experience, but as an alternative to sugar, they're way too expensive at this point.<br /><br />Happy Tasting!
