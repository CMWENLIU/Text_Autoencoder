I recently switched to protein supplements in an attempt to build lean muscle.  Whey protein worked well but left me feeling bloated.  I stumbled across this product while looking for an alternative, and it is fantastic! No bloating, no bog down, leaves me feeling fantastic.  The taste leaves something to be desired, but what can you expect?  It's raw, organic, and has no additives whatsoever, so protein is all you get.  Mix it with a bit of almond milk, almond butter, and a banana, and it's the best thing ever!
