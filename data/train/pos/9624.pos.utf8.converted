This is an awesome buy! It was different than I thought it would be, but is still great! I thought it was going to be like a whole cake (I received it as a gift) but it turned out to be like 6 little miniature pineapple upsidedown cakes. They are DELICIOUS! And they're the size of one piece of pineapple upside down cake so you can have like an individual piece. This is a great gift idea. My husband was deployed for my birthday and he sent this to me...it was so sweet!
