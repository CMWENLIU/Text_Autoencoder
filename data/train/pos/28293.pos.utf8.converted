I got the flour in a short amount of time from Amazon and eagerly made a batch of pizza dough from the Caputo website. The pizza was made on a pizza stone, 500 degree oven. The crust was light, crisp and tasty. I could not ask for more. It was easy to stretch out so I did not over work the tender dough. I made it in the morning and then chilled the dough until 2 hours before making the pizza. I am learning about chemistry in the food world, very facinating. Next, I am going to try to add some King Aurthur Pizza dough flavor to the dough mix. I will try out some different recipes for crusts with this great flour to find my favorite one. I am always on the quest for perfection in baking.The 2.2 pound sack will not last long.
