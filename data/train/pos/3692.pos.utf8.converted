I like figs, but I don't love them.  However, these chocolate covered, chocolate filled, brandy infused figs are fantastic.  The brandy is a little strong, which I prefer, so if you like your alcoholic-based treats to be really tame, then this might be too much.  The chocolate is quite nice, particularly the creamy filling.  These treats are worth the price; I would buy them again.  Even if you're not too sure, I'd recommend trying them out.
