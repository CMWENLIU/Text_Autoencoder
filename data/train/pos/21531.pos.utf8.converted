I like to use these frequently in cooking, but when I buy them in small containers at the grocery store they don't last long, and I'm overpaying.<br /><br />I was impressed at how much I got of these for the price.  The three bags will last me quite a while.  They taste fresh.  I'm happy I bought them.
