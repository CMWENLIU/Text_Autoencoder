A number of reviews have remarked that the bag smelled fermented or like vinegar when opened. I experienced the same thing, and being a first time consumer of cacao nibs, specifically this brand, I was concerned that I received a bad batch. Upon further research, I learned that fermentation is a necessary part of cacao processing, used to reduce astringency and develop the flavor we associate with chocolate. Fresh cacao seeds have no chocolatey flavor at all. So, much like my first real piece of Roquefort cheese, I learned that this can be surprising in smell and taste to those of us who have only ever had the overly processed derivatives. While it is possible that some really did receive a compromised product, I found no detectable rancidity or otherwise off flavors in mine. I do pour the nibs into a bowl so they breath a little and this helps to dissipate the fermented aroma when I am eating some plain.<br /><br />This is an item you do not want to buy in quantity until you have a chance to sample first (like that case of vegetarian canned chili I once ordered.)<br /><br />I enjoy the product and plan to incorporate into a trail-mix type bar for some extra flavor.
