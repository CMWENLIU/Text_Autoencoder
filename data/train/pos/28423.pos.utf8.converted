Hi:<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack of these 2 ounce bags (size you would get at Quiznos or Subway with a sandwich) since they were less than I could get them at Costco in a equal pack of Frito chips. I had tried previously by buying a bag at my local Albertsons and they are good. Good chip for dipping sicne they're a little thicker than Lays. The chips are fresh, crisp and great tasting; perfect for putting a bag lunch for work or school.<br /><br />NOTE: Bags are made extra thick paper with a plastic lining for freshness and very difficult to open by hand. Use a knife or scissors.
