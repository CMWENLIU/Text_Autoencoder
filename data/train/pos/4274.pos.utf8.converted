I have only used Carnation or generic instant milk before. awful stuff. this product is excellent. I added it to oatmeal while it was cooking vs plain water and I was very pleased. I USED IT FOR MY ELDERLY MOMS COFFEE VS USING NON NUTRITIOUS COFFEE CREAMER.  Looking forward to trying it other ways but at this point I can forsee me ordering it again. I have now started using it in canned cream soups for my elderly mom. i fill the empty can with desired amount of water and then add the Peak.  and the best part because i use non fat or skim for myself....THERE IS NEVER ANY SPOILED OR WASTED MILK OR YOU NEVER HAVE TO GO WITHOUT MILK.
