I bought these chocolates as a birthday gift for my wife. They came super fast, well packed in a custom styrofoam shipping carton.<br /><br />I'm not a big chocolate fan but I know quality. These are rich and smooth and deeply satisfying. I can imagine that a true chocolate lover would really love them!
