This product is amazing. It works great, smells great, is all organic and is about 4x cheaper than any other enzyme peel on the market (because it is half the price and twice the size). You can also get it almost anywhere. It made a huge difference on my skin and I would recommend it to anyone who has acne or a dull, bumpy complexion. The one down side is that it stings quite a bit, but it's supposed to do that. And afterward it feels great.
