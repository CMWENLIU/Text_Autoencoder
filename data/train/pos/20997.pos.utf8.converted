I must admit I was totally and completely addicted to honey before these came along. Now it's even worse. Easily portable and packable, these suckers are awesome! Ingredients are simple, healthy, and effective.<br /><br />Unless I'm blind I did not see an ingredient list on the product page so here ya go (note that this is the GOLD flavor only):<br />honey, pure water, potassium citrate, salt, maltodextrin, niacinamide (Vitamin B3), calcium panthothenate (Vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (Vitamin B1), cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)<br /><br />That's it! Honey for carbs, water to thin it down for easy consumption, salt for lost sweat, and B-Vitamins for the metabolism and immune system. With a taste like real honey, quality ingredients, and a decent price these are a must buy!<br /><br />Well that's all I've got to say about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010TGK18">Honey Stinger Gold Energy Gel, 1.3-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 24)</a>
