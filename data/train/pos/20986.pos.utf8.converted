Movie Theater Style is an accurate description.<br /><br />This products captures the taste you get from a movie theater or popcorn cart style popcorn maker. Rather salty and the butter flavor is not exactly butter flavored.<br /><br />That said, I LOVE that flavor, and it's delicious on the home popped popcorn without nearly as much grease as the movie theater machines need to add.
