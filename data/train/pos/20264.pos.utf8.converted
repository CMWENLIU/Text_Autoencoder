This tea's flavor was better than I expected.  Slightly-strong, earthy flavor is a nice twist to those teas which barely zest the water.  I purchased enough boxes to negate shipping.  The result, one of the best Oolong teas I've tasted at about $.50 cheaper than I can find it in the store.  Having nearly ten-times the flavenoids as regular green tea, with its great taste, it the logical choice.
