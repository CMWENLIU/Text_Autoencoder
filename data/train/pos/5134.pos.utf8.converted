Wow !!  This is the most delicious cinnamon I have ever tasted.<br /><br />There are two types of cinnamon - Cassia (Cinnamomum aromaticum, found in most supermarkets) and Ceylon ( Cinnamomum verum - also called true cinnamon).<br /><br />This is Organic Ceylon (True) Cinnamon which is  tastier, of  finer texture, and healthier than Cassia.<br /><br />Great for flavoring tea, yogurt, etc. or for medicinal anti-inflammatory treatment.<br /><br />This is three 2 ounce packages - but is also offered in one six ounce package.  Amazon should stock this item!
