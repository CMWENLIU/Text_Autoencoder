Just received my order today. I immediately tasted the oil & it is amazing! Anyone that cooks can improve their dishes with a small splash of this product! I had a rather common appetizer last weekend until my host poured a little bit of this oil on the hummus. OMG, nectar of the Gods! I ate all of the dip myself. Probably would have snarled at anyone who dared to touch it!<br /><br />I was also very impressed with this company, their responsiveness, the speed of delivery, and their packaging. Seriously, this oil could have been tossed under the wheel of a truck & it could not have been broken. I will absolutely use this company again & refer all my foodie friends!
