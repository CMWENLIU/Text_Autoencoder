I was skeptical about purchasing a coffee specifically formulated for making iced coffee. I mean, I spent all last summer making iced coffee from extra bold k cups and they were very good. So, what's the big deal? I'll tell you, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I didn't realize it before, but the flavors of doing it my old way were not quite as rich and complex as these Nantucket blend iced coffee k cup. Plus, when I was brewing it my old way on the iced coffee setting and barely getting a cup full. With the iced coffee k cups, I brew it on the 6 oz setting, and get a nice big full cup of iced coffee with just enough room to add a little 1/2 and 1/2. Sir in a generous spoon of sugar and you get an iced coffee better than the donut and coffee shops for a mere fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Try these; you'll love 'em. Oh, and it might be worth noting, for those of you who feel the same way and were wondering, I do not particularly like the regular Nantucket K cups for hot coffee.
