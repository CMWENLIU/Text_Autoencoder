I am soooo glad they have amazon in the age of gluten free mania. People who dont even have celiac disease are avoiding gluten and making this awesome meat substitute ingredient scarce! THANKS amazon! I made some wheat meat with this mix and it was great! Why spend tons of cash on gimme lean when you can make it at home? The answer is NO REASON! If anyone is curious look up wheat meat online, you can boil gluten and then you have a quality meat substitute! SOOOO cool. I am not always a vegetarian, but it IS healthier- I am about 90% veg these days and gluten has saved the day. It is healthier for my body and the environment- and thanks to amazon I can make wheat meat! yay! PLEASE dont stop selling this! These boxes are just right, they are an affordable starter pack for making your own wheat meat. You can add about a cup of water and your own seasonings per package and you knead it into a very very dense ball.It is great when it is really dense. You can twist it and make it into more of an oval. Boil for approx 2 hours, cool. Once it sets you can get an idea of what you are working with, it is a lot like many other meat substitutes. So cool. (UPDATE: I tried adding TVP, dont do it! Hah ha... Herbs are one thing, but your TVP will fall out, its a mess. Unless you want it to -which it is actually kinda cool because it makes the wheat meat hold sauces easilly... If that is what you want, little holes from falen TVP -go right ahead. Its a cooking tactic I suppose!)----I am so excited! Try adding marinades in the place of water. However much you use it should be dense (very) yet still pliable. After a test run on the first box you will be able to see how you would like your own texture. It does take about 1.5 to 2 hours to cook, so batch cooking is a must. After it is completely cooked you can refrigerate and it seems even better after it has been cold. It browns very fast after it has been refrigerated. Re-cooking in various forms is so fun! Stir frys, anything. Buying more gluten, may end up with this brand again because it is so afforadable.
