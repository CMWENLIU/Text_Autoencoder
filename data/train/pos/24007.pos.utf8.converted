I GOT THESE FOR MY 2 YR OLD ABOUT A WEEK AGO. I LOVE THE NUTRITION IN THE BARS AND SHE LIKES THE TASTE. NO CORN SYRUP!!!!!!!!! GO TO THEIR WEBSITE FOR MORE REVIEWS AND INFO.<br />Update(1 yr later): my now 3yr old and 1 1/2 yr old love to split the pack since there are two pieces in each wrapper. I can't get them to eat any other nutrional bars and I tried all the Clif for kids bars. They prefer this one(chocolate crunch) to the other(cookies and creme).
