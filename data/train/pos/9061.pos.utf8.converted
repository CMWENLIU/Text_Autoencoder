I am into non-medicinal care as much as possible.  I don't do well with all sorts of prescribed medicines; last go around caused my immune system to crash and I was a long time in rebuilding it.  When you find something that works so well with simple herbs you are delighted.  Gypsy Cold Care isn't bad tasting.  Sort of a twiggy with a strong mint-type flavour.  Only who cares what it takes like!  This stuff works for me.  At the first hint of a cold or sore throat, I brew a pot and drink it.  Generally all the cold symptoms just fade away in just a few hours.  I have recommended it to dozens of friends and it works well for them, too.<br /><br />So if you are looking for all natural alternatives, you might consider this the next time you feel a cold coming on.  I keep it on hand all winter.
