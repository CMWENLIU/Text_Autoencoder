I was rummaging through our kitchen's lazy-susan-corner-cabinet, looking for something quick, easy & "of substance" to eat and noticed 1 lone pack, so I decided to try it.  My mother-in-law must've bought it, 'cause I've never seen the brand before.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Brisling Sardines, extra virgin olive oil, garlic powder, black olives & red bell pepper.  I've had some history of eating sardines so I knew what to expect...or so I thought.<br /><br />Opened the can and immediately, I was pleasantly surpised = no outstanding fishy smell.<br /><br />I started eating and man, oh man, I had never had sardines like these before!  They are so delicate & buttery with the perfect amount of saltiness.  Yum, yum and yum.  So much so, I wanted to look this up in Amazon and write a review.  I'll be buying more right this very second!
