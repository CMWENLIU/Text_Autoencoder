I know I could never possibly afford a plane ticket to any country that may be a featured/sold item for a purchase through igourmet. So the next best possibility to experience this country would be a taste of the authenticity. I have never been disappointed in the quality and selection (cheese and teas). They may argue with my choice of wine (slightly chilled merlot) when I enjoy any luxury. Nevertheless, I ENJOY IT. You should too!
