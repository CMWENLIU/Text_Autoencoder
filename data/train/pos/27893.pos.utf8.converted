I've only recently started drinking coffee, but I was turned on to Douwe Egberts Aroma Rood by a work colleague from the Netherlands.  I drink it black, and haven't worked up the courage to taint it with sugar or creamer... I somehow feel that would upset the balance of the universe causing the earth to stop spinning, hurling us all into the air at 1000MPH.  But maybe its just the coffee talking there.<br /><br />In all seriousness, the only down-side to this coffee that I've found is that it makes all your standard Folgers', Maxwell Houses, and other cheap blends taste like crap in comparison.  I am not a coffee snob/connoisseur, I don't know a darn thing about ingredients, or how to describe flavors... I just know what I like, and this is it.
