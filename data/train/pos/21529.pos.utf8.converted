I found this gem while living in Australia and thank goodness for Amazon because I wanted some bad when I got back to the States...they are so much better than instant noodles or top ramen, they have several packets of different add-ins that really make this come alive...though it seems that they have changed them somewhat from what I remember in Australia, they are still delicious and I would recommend them to anyone...and at this price, you are not paying that much more (if at all) compared to the other stuff!
