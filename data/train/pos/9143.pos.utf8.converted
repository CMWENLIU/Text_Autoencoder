I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven't experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup. I fill used K-Cups and Kap them days before I plan to use them and seal the hole in the top of the Kap and the hole in the bottom of the K-Cup with those "dot-type" stickers one can get in office supply stores and discount stores. This keeps the coffee/tea/hot chocolate, etc. from getting stale before brewing. To clean used K-Cups, I bought a cheap eyebrow brush to "sweep" the wet grounds out of the Cup and filter after use. I do keep numerous used, clean and dry K-Cups to fill and cap while recently used K-Cups are drying. I've found that the regular grind coffee that I buy in the grocery store works well for brewing as fine grind coffee tends to clog the needle in the brewer. To get the correct strength in tea, I fill the K-Cup with the equivalent of 2 teabags, then cap. For coffee, I fill the K-Cup to nearly the bottom edge of the K-Kap. So far my Kaps are working well and saving me money. Before discovering these, I was somewhat regretting having bought my Keurig brewer because of the high cost of the K-Cups and the number of people living in my house who drink multiple cups of coffee daily. The bill for buying K-Cups was starting to look like my mortgage payment! These saved my bank account.
