This seems to be a good all-around moisturizer.  I use it at night, as I like my day products to contain an spf.  It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.  If you are looking for gentle, oil-free moisture, this is your golden ticket.
