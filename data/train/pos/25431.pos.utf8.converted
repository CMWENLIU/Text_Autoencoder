Absolutely the best flavor vanilla bean I have tasted to date.  No kidding.  My kids love vanilla icecream so I got a Cusineart ice cream maker and do a batch every week.  I started with the standard Madagascar beans, moved to the gourmet Madagascar beans, tried the Hawaiian (over priced), then tried the Tahitian variety.  Wow, I was very pleased.  The Tahitian has a mellow full flavor.  The Madagascar is harder and doesn't sit on the tongue as well as the Tahitian (Hawaiian is very similar).  For the Fremch custard (8 egg yolks, 40% cream and organic milk) recipie, I find the Tahitian is Excellent! I have bought beans from several distributors online and from local stores.  This seller is excellent, the beans are moist, fresh, vaccuum packed, arrive quickly and taste great.  I have been using this vendor for several orders - always pleased.
