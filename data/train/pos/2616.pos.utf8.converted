Our family avoids chemicals as much as possible, so we use coconut oil for cooking, haircare, skincare and more!<br /><br />We use coconut oil as a moisturizer in place of skin lotion (add a couple drops of a good quality essential oil!) We use coconut oil to saute or steam saute foods; I use a spoonful of coconut oil in our stainless steel cookware so foods NEVER stick! We also use it in our microwave popcorn popper with sea salt for the healthiest, tastiest popcorn around!<br /><br />Coconut is a solid at cooler temperatures, it will turn to liquid when warmed "slightly" to the mid 70s.  Hence I store this bottle above our stove / microwave so it's usually a liquid. To make it MUCH easier to use, I have a wide mouth glass jar that I keep refilled.  When the jar turns solid I can still scoop the oil paste out with a spoon.
