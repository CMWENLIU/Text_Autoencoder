i first discovered this product through the vermont country store catalog.  however, it cost more for an 8oz jar than the 16oz jar costs on amazon.<br /><br />i can't say enough good things about this product.  i will eat it straight out of the jar.  my favorite way to enjoy it is to put a couple tablespoons into a big mug of hot water.  no sweetener needed.  so nice on  a cold evening! or anytime!
