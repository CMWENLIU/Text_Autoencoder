...SNAP INTO A SLIM-JIM!  Oh yeah!  As Macho Man Randy Savage puts it!  Hey if this guy and the Ultimate Warrior, Jim Helwig, like it, why not you?  It's has the perfect marketing campaign and the colorful red and yellow almost matches the Hulkster's tights!  The small size version of these beef links has a good dose of oil.  You can practically squeeze out the oil in a stick so I get a napkin and press down on it and you'll be amazed of how much oil goes into your blood veins.  But, would I trade that for the beefy taste, HECK NO!  Meat-lovers unite!  Get your daily dose of MSG and Sodium Nitrate, both which are cancer causing agents!  Ye-Haw!
