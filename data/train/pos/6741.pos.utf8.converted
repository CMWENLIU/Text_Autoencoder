Fugeddaboutit coffee has a nice rich taste that both my husband and I like, a tough task to hit.  The packaging is a plus, as well, insofar that it allows you to open it as a dispenser.  This is a pet peeve I have with many of the other K-cups I purchase because there is no easy storage option. Finally, the little character makes me smile.
