Ever since first seeing Risotto being prepared on a Gordon Ramsay program, my boyfriend and I couldn't wait to try to make it ourselves.  Finding the correct rice (arborio) was difficult enough, and after trying the brands from 2 or 3 different stores, we decided RiceSelect made for the best Risotto.  We used to buy it at SuperTarget before finding it here on Amazon.<br /><br />Our basic recipe:<br /><br />Serves 3-4, as a side<br /><br />1 cup RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto<br />1 tablespoon olive oil<br />1/3 cup cooking wine (we've tried all kinds)<br />4-5 cups chicken broth<br />1 - 1 1/2 cups grated parmesan cheese (NOT the powder kind)<br />1 tablespoon butter (optional)<br /><br />Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a shallow saucepan over medium heat and add risotto rice.  Stir risotto for a couple of minutes then add cooking wine.  CAUTION:  the wine will cook off rapidly and could cause steam that will burn you if you're not careful!  Stir 30 - 60 seconds until all wine has been absorbed then add 1 cup chicken broth.  SAME CAUTION AS ABOVE!  Stir constantly until broth has been absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup of broth.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  Wait until the previous amount of broth has been absorbed/cooked off before adding the next.  It typically takes about 20 minutes to make the risotto.  You'll know you're ready for the next step when the Risotto is soft, but not mushy.  You'll notice as you're adding chicken broth, that most of the liquid will be absorbed or cooked off, leave you will a creamy base.<br />Remove risotto from heat and add one cup parmesan cheese.  Stir until melted.  Serve immediately.  Garnish with extra parmesan cheese.<br /><br />OPTIONAL:  if after adding parmesan, the risotto seems stiff, add one tablespoon of butter.  Or if you like butter, add butter! ;-)<br /><br />RiceSelect Arborio Rice/Risotto has consistently given us great results and we're always sure to have 2 or 3 containers in the pantry.
