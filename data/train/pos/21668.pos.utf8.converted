I have to disagree with other reviewers who said that the banana chips in this are the same as any other.  Normal banana chips are like eating rocks and are really tasteless.  These however, are little intense bites of banana which are soft enough for a toddler.  My son, who is incredibly picky and won't touch most fruits and vegetables, loves these and specifically asks for the strawberries (though he won't eat fresh ones).  As to the cost, while you certainly can buy these at Whole Foods and other similar places the packages they sell there are far smaller and are more expensive per ounce.  Actually, the Amazon price is even a little cheaper than buying direct from the manufacturer.
