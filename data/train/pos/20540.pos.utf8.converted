The Senseo pods are, at the time of this writing, unavailable anywhere.  Not in stores, not from Amazon, not from Senseo.  According to Senseo customer service, they will be available "this summer", but only through Amazon and Senseo.com.  No longer in retail stores in the US market. These Melitta pods work fine in my Senseo machine.  Good froth on top, look just like the senseo pods.  I have a few senseo pods left; might do a side by side taste comparison.  Anyway, at time of writing Amazon is out of stock on these Melitta pods; everyone else must have heard they'd work in their Senseo machines and are buying them up.  If you look in most retail stores you won't find them; currently they are only available in Walmarts. Walmart's website will tell you if the store nearest you has these in stock.  Melitta's website says they will expand into other retail stores soon.  Good news, because I have lost all confidence in Senseo for making their pods online only.  I've always ordered them online but not everyone wants to buy 6 bags/case at a time, especially if they like to have a bag of regular and a bag of decaf going.  Then they'd have 12 bags in the pantry.  How silly.<br /><br />Editd to add: Melitta makes two kinds of pods, this one in a bag like Senseo's, and another in a box.  If you are shopping for Senseo replacements, buy this one (in bag). The boxed variety don't fit.
