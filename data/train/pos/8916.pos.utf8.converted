My golden retriever, Jake, is 8 years old. I use to buy him the best dog food I could afford (or at least that's what I thought) ... It was grain-free and I would throw in raw meat and sometime fruits and veges. Dogs are meant to be mainly meat eaters, but that can be very costly, so the bulk of the meal was the kibble type food with warm water. Just like us, dogs do need nutritional value in their diet. Unfortunately like us, they don't get proper nutrition or digestion through most of the food out there.<br />  The medical doctors (both people and vets) are not promoting natural whole foods and vitamins. Instead, we are seeing medications dispensed for ailments that can reversed through good nutriton. I truly believe that most of the dog and cat foods out there are doing more harm than good ... cancer, etc,. has become rampant ... these foods are also very poor in moisture and live enzymes that are needed.<br />  After reserching furthur and gaining knowledge from natural vets, I found the best diet to use was the "raw or dehydrated raw" dog food diet. That's when I came across Honest Kitchen ... Jake loves it! His stomach NO longer "gurgles" ... I usually add 2 EFAs (essential fatty acids), a selenium capsule (for added cancer protection), and extra plant derived calcium. When available I will alternate adding raw organic eggs or raw meats.<br />  Please consider this awesome food for your dog or cat ... especially if there are skin, stomach, stool or eating issues ... you might be very surprised at the results!<br />  Warmest wishes for a prosperous and healthy NEW YEAR!
