The FDA has not studied xylitol.  However I have a lot of problems with oral thrush, fungal based ear infections, stomach distress, etc. This product not only replaces sugar for me, but it cleared up a lot of my symptoms.  There are some european studies that show that xylitol does kill Candida albicans in the mouth but they have a lot more research to do.  I'm not sure if it will work for everyone, but for me it's been a blessing.  Like someone meantioned though, pets cannot have it, it causes severe and rapid hypoglycemia in them.  Also, don't binge on it unless you want to spend the day in the bathroom.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants lower blood sugar, to avoid white sugar, with candida issues, and to have squeaky clean teeth.
