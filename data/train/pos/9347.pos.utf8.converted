My two vices, if you want to call them that, are coffee and chocolate. I keep both in the house at all times. M&Ms are just very satisfying when the chocolate craving hits, and it makes sense to have the biggest bag on hand if you crave it a lot! This size is also ideal for a party. I like that these bags are reclosable. Some chocolate has hydrogenated oil, but not M&Ms! Maybe food coloring isn't ideal, but oh well, they are such a happy snack! And they are easy to enjoy -- M&Ms don't make a melty mess like a chocolate bar. If you purposely put some in a warm place, the chocolate melts inside the crispy candy shell, which is a yummy sensation when you eat them!<br /><br />My stars and review are for the product only. I really wish Amazon would start to carry these at a comparable price with prime shipping (especially with subscribe and save!). Until then, I stock up when they go on sale for eight bucks at my local Target, drugstore or grocery store.
