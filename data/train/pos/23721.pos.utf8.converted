With a son recently diagnosed with Autism, I was faced with revamping his diet to a gluten-free, dairy-free diet.  I tried mixing different gluten free flours (rice, potato, tapioca) myself, but it's not nearly as good as this flour blend. I really think the addition of the bean flours makes the difference. I made chocolate chip cookies (dark chocolate chips--no dairy)with it and served it to my daughter's girl scout troop, and they couldn't tell the difference.  That's all the validation I needed.
