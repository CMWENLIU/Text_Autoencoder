Purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and we have been very impressed with the quality of the cheeses we received. We usually grab some wine and cheese on a fairly regular basis from restaurants or specialty stores so when I saw this online I figured it would be a great gift to try. It certainly opened our eyes to some varieties we had not tried in the past that we were both really pleased with. Overall it was a great gift and value!
