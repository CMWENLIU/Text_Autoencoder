I used this product on a black carpenter ant colony I had living in a planter made of landscape timbers in the yard of a house I bought.  Every time you would mow around the planter, or trim around the planter swarms of carpenter ants would emerge from any cracks where the timbers came together.  I dusted the perimeter of the planter, taking care to dust in the cracks as well.  The next week when I was mowing/trimming, very few ants emerged, and the following week there was nothing.  I haven't seen any sign of ants since, so I assume it took care of them.  I have used several other Terro products, and I would definitely recommend them as something to try before calling the exterminator.
