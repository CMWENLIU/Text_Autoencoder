I delivered twin girls at 34 weeks and they weighed in at 3 lbs 15 oz and 4 lbs 8 oz.  We supplemented my milk with 1-2 bottles of Neosure plus added 1/2 tsp per 3 oz of breastmilk to add 2 calories per oz.  They now weigh 8 lbs and 2 oz and 8 lbs 8 oz 46 day later.  They gained 3 lbs 4 oz and 3 lbs 4.5 oz in the 31 days they have been home.  We are now on normal formula.<br /><br />Buy it at Safeway for 14.99 each, $89.94 for 6 though
