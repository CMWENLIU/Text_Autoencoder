We have tried most of the brands out there, Pacari, Navitas, Frontier, Sunfood etc but keep coming back to Wilderness Family Cacao.  Its mild but rich and the same time.  The flavor is not overwhelmingly tart or strong and blends nicely with other flavors.  Its very smooth tasting as opposed to the grittyness of other brands.  They source this from Peru and package it well.  Highly recommend this Cacao if chocolate is your thing.
