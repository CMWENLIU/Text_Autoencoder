This is obviously a red-hot item & will definitely decorate the page appropriately  for February 14th. If your recipient doesn't like their OUTSTANDING FLAVOR, there is always the option of passing them along, as in the HOT POTATO GAME. Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends a trial run of such a hot item, but says they do wonders for one's breath!
