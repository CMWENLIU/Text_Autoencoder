This jerky is the best jerky I've had - period.<br />I'm an omnivore and this stuff tastes better than meat jerky.<br /><br />It has a rich meaty flavor without being overpowering -<br />unlike most jerkies, meat-less or otherwise.<br /><br />Also it's low in sugar and sodium, which is rare for a<br />meat-less jerky. Other meat-less jerkies usually use that<br />and a ton of spice to over compensate for being meat-less.<br /><br />Totally worth it.
