I have been using this food for the last year and it has just worked miracles on my two German Shepherds.  Lots of energy (sometimes to much, lol), great looking coats and my dogs love it.  My female will eat anything you put in front of her but my male is extremely picky.  They both eat this food like its desert.  I have recommended this food to several other friends and Shepherd breeders in the area and they have all had positive experiences.  A friend has a 4 year old Shepherd who is allergic to items such as corn and grains, he has been using this food for less than 2 months and his dog has completely stopped itching, has not had a hot spot and has less odor.  His coat has also started to really turn around from the dry blotchy coat he had before.  This food is basically Taste of the Wild with Diamond's packaging and name put on the bag but cost about $15.00 less and you get 10 extra pounds.  I would tell anyone if they are looking for a grain free, highend food, then as far as cost, quality and product is concerned, this is the best food on the market.
