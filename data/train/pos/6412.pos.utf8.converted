OK, you can keep buying the stuff in the store for $5 for a total of 5 slices, or you can get the real thing right here.  When my package arrived I immeadately opened it and popped a couple of pieces in my mouth....wow, talk about great flavor and texture, this is it.  I've been to Italy and when I tasted this particular Prosciutto Di Parma for the first time, it took me right back to Italy.  You can't miss with this one!
