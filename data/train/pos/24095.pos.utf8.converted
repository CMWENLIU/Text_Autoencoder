We drink about 4-5 K-cups in our house each day, and this one always seems to be a favorite.  It's hard to find decaf flavors that actually taste good, but I really enjoy this one.  It's the same as most flavored coffees, in that it's a mild/lighter brew.  It tastes exactly like you'd expect a standard French Vanilla brew to, and I don't notice any fun aftertaste (like I do with some brands).  If you love dark/bold brews, this one won't do it for you, but if you just like a little after-dinner treat and don't want to be up all night, this is your K-cup.  Oh - and the person who said they sent the wrong product - you need to rate the seller that sent it (in your account/history settings).  It's not right to take it out on the actual product.
