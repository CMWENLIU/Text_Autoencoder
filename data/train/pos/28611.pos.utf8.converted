I happened up on this at my local natural grocery store and it spoiled me for any other sauce! This is the BEST JARRED sauce I have found - better than Rao's, and better than Francis Ford Coppola's brand (my two previous faves). This tastes FRESH from the garden and can be used for so much more than a pasta sauce. I use it for grilled vegetables, ratatouille, cous cous, soups, mediterranean bean dishes, and imitation meat products. The flavors will blow you over. This is truly exceptional.  I can't believe it sells for $5.95 in Florida (based on the other reviews). Here in California, we get to pay $10 a jar, but it's worth it. Highly recommended!!!
