This is a very versatile spice and it does add a smoky flavor.  The spice is quality and isnt clumpy or anything like that.  I ordered it because I wanted to make one specific recipe (swiss steak - alton brown), but have experimented on my own where I might want to impart a slight smoky flavor.  Must have in my spice rack from now on.
