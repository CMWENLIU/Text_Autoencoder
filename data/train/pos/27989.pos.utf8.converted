I was originaly hooked on Green Mountains "Dark Magic". The only reason I got this one was because I mistakenly thought this was the Dark Magic and ordered it instead. I wasnt to thrilled to try it since I havent had much luck with Timothys brand coffee. But after trying, I was amazed at the flavor. It has a much richer flavor than the GM roast. I think I am sticking with this one.
