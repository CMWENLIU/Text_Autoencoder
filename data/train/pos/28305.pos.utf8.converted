Our vet recommended getting "C.E.T. chews" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being "C.E.T chews" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the HEXtra chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews.
