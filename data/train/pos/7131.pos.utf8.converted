It has a different texture than the white Quinoa....more nutty I guess you could say since the hull around the red Quinoa is slightly thicker. This makes it taste a tad bit different as well which isn't a bad thing at all...but it's hard to put my finger on it though. The thing is, if you like or are used to the white Quinoa, you may welcome this as a good change. You have to cook this a bit longer than the white Quinoa as well to get near to its fluffiness. What happens is that the hulls surrounding the red Quinoa (which the white Quinoa has as well but they are much thinner so it's not noticeable when eating) stay on the red Quinoa giving it that nuttier texture. I don't really care for that (I guess since I'm so used to eating the white Quinoa) BUT I cook it a bit longer than the box says to (about 5 - 7 minutes longer) and it's almost as fluffy. You cook it just like rice in a pot on the stove. I have not tried to cook this in the rice cooker as of yet nor do I think I will...that goes for the white Quinoa as well. Other than that, it's great for a number of things although I use it primarily for my stir fry veggie meals. Try a box at your local co-op/health food store and if you like it order it here. Its way cheaper to by it through Amazon even with a small shipping costs.
