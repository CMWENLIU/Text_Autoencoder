Ordered my third jar yesterday. This is so delicious! I use it as a minestrone base, a substitute for the ramen MSG laden soup packets, add it to my gravies and chile verde. I'd use it sparingly until you figure out what works for you. For myself, about two teaspoons per three cups of water seems to work.
