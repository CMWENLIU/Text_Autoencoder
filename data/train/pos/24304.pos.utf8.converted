The company is called JUST TOMATOES.  But they have so much<br />more. I originally started  buying their products for my 4<br />PARROTS.  So now when my family sees me use it in our food<br />they accuse me of feeding them BIRD FOOD.  They have almost<br />every fruit and vegs you could want.  I put the vegs in soups<br />and stews and I even sprinkle them over green salad.  You can<br />not believe how much flavor they add.  I buy the red pepper, onions &<br />tomatoes to  add to sauces. They do not carry the dried mushrooms<br />any more that I really liked.  They will never SPOIL.<br />The fruits are good snacks for the grandkids.  I have a hard time<br />making them understand you do not need a lot because they are<br />so concentrated.  I like the FRUIT MUNCHIES  &  STRAWBERRYS<br />and BANANAS.<br />The only negative thing I can so is they are EXPENSIVE. $$$$<br />I wish they were cheaper.<br /><br />SO BUY SOME AND FEED YOUR FAMILY BIRD FOOD too.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012---I have found another product I like very much too<br />...HARMONY HOUSE dried fruit and veggies--for sale on Amazon too.
