I was a little be leary of buying this after having tried the Annie's whole wheat shell macaroni and cheese which we thought was just horrible.  This macaroni, however, tasted wonderful!  I think that this has a lot more flavor than the Kraft macaroni and it's so much better for you too!  At first, my two year old would not try it as it was not the yellow color of the Kraft macaroni.  So, I added a little bit of orange food coloring (the sauce is white so any color would work perfectly) and he was so excited about orange macaroni that he gobbled it right up, telling me repeatedly how yummy it was.  I think we can have some fun mixing up the colors in the future.  I would highly recommend this!
