Growing up on Quaker and therefore eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the mornings, I was pleasantly surprised when I bought Nature's Path Oatmeal on a whim one day seeing it in my goldbox. I have since been ordering nothing but Nature's Path Oatmeal from Amazon. It's cheaper on Amazon than at Costco or Sprouts (local farmer's market) and I will likely never go back to anything else.<br /><br />The multigrain raisin flavor is my favorite for both flavor and texture, having a sweet, but not too sweet, cinnamon raisin flavor and a mixed-size and texture oat consistency. If you like raisins in your oatmeal buy this once and you'll likely never go back to anything else (except maybe the other Nature's Path flavors)<br /><br />I know this probably sounds like I work for Nature's Path or something, but really the oatmeal is that good that I took the time to go online and write a review about it. I hope Amazon keeps stocking it and I hope more people can enjoy it based on my review.
