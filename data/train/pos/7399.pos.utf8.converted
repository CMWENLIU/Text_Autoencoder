I just received my 3-pack Nutella today. I do have to say i am actually a little surprised at the size of the containers. They are actually 3-pack 13oz Nutella's. I love this product. Even for the price not to bad. I would definitely get this item again. Shipping was pretty quick also. I ordered on a Wednesday and received on a Friday. I am over all happy!!!!!!
