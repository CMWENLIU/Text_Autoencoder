I was pumping and bringing home abt 15-16oz a day then literally overnight my supply decreased to 6-8oz a day. Trying to pump when I got home wasn't working out! I was upset and frustrated thinking that I couldn't feed my baby; and I really didn't want to resort to formula.  I tried drinking more water, eating more oatmeal..nothing seemed to work.  So a friend recommended Mother's Milk and my milk has INCREASED!!! I started Friday night and I now have that FULL feeling again.  It's Monday morning now and about 11:30 - pre-Mother's Milk I would have pumped abt  2-3oz. in one session...post-Mother's Milk 6oz in one session. Now the taste to me...a combinations of dirt and licerious, it's awful! But I would drink mud if it would help my milk supply! My little one is 6 months now and I trying to make it to her first b-day.  Hopefully this review will sway you to at least try it, it does work!
