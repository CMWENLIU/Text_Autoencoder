OMG, you have to try this tea.  I bought it because I read on a website that hibiscus tea would reduce your blood pressure (whether that is true or not, I don't know, I haven't used it long enough to tell).  But whether it works for the blood pressure or not, this is a wonderful tea.  It has a beautiful color and great aroma and it is very flavorful even with out adding a sweetner.  I would recommend it highly.  The fact that it is organic and fairtrade just adds value to me.
