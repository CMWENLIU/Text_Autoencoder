Finally I am able to make the same, if not better, popcorn than the one I religiously buy at the Farmer's Market every Saturday.<br />The kernels arrived in a resealable bag, which is very convenient.  The popcorn is fluffy and delicious; not to mention the fact that I was very successful on popping the kernels using a hot air popper machine and a stove top popper.<br />I am VERY happy with my purchase!!
