I love this pectin. It allows me to make low sugar jams reliably without having to cook the fruit down to a paste. My jams turn out great every time with a fruity, bright taste, a pleasant texture and a lovely color. And the best part is that it tastes like FRUIT instead of tasting ridiculously oversweet.<br /><br />One thing to note, though, is that low-sugar jam will always have a slightly different texture than the sugary stuff, regardless of whether you use this pectin or other types of low-sugar pectin. I describe it as less of the sticky quality that sugar gives. I notice it, but people who get me jam don't seem to notice or care.<br /><br />I just found a canning book on Amazon that uses Pomona's for all of it's jams: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603425462">Put 'em Up!: A Comprehensive Home Preserving Guide for the Creative Cook, from Drying and Freezing to Canning and Pickling</a>. I have not read it yet, but I think it'll be worth a look.
