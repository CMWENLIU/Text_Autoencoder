I've been buying this syrup through mail order from the ABCStores (located in Hawaii) since my trip to the islands in 2004. It doesn't have a high sugar content like some other coconut syrups. We've lived in Pennsylvania, Maryland and now Connecticut and I've had it delivered to all three states from Hawaii. I'm hoping they'll get more of this on Amazon and the shipping won't be so extreme as it is being sent from Hawaii (but you can see, how I obviously feel it's worth the extra shipping just to have a taste of it on my homemade recipe of macadamia/coconut waffles - a specialty of mine that brings me back to my wonderful vacation in Paradise. By the way, ABCStores sells it for 3.99 a bottle on its Website.
