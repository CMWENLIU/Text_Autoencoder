These Ghirardelli raspberry filled chocolates are the best of their kind! There are just so many disappointing raspberry filled chocolates on the market that it'll make you sick, but these on the other hand... what quality!<br /><br />The dark chocolate is smooth and with a hint of bitterness, but not too much (like 80% dark and up).<br /><br />And the raspberry filling is nothing short of addictive. The filling is very thick and not runny at all (unlike the mint filled version) which I really like (I have a beard... you do the math).<br /><br />Ghirardelli achieved the correct balance between a semi-sweet/almost bitter chocolate and the not too sweet/still kinda tangy raspberry filling to create one of my new favorite chocolates on the market.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The filling actually tastes like raspberries!<br />The filling isn't super sweet, yet isn't sour like raspberries can sometimes get.<br />Smooth velvety chocolate.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Kinda pricey, but that can be said about most any high quality chocolate on the market.<br />Filling does contain actual raspberry seeds... some people might dislike this.
