We love this product since we are vegans and don't drink cow's milk and we don't have many recipes that call for milk.  When we do need it for things  like in cereal or non dairy fresh fruit desserts this product comes in handy because it is always on our shelf and we don't have to worry about it going bad.  We also do a lot of traveling and camping so it keeps in the camper and we are never without it.  Not to mention the taste is GREAT!
