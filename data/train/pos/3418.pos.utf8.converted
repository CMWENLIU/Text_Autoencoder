There's something geniunely weird about turkey being called Shoulder of Pork and Ham.  Obviously, it's not that.<br /><br />So what to call this stuff?  Turkey Meat and Stuff?  TUMS?  Nope, that one's been taken. TWAM? Turkey Wing and Meat?  Who knows what turkey parts are in here?  I just assume that the really good turkeys are sold intact, with the innards removed, so there must be plenty of other parts we don't get to see, or turkeys that are not worth trying to sell intact, that goes into this lowest fat of all of the famous and legandary SPAM product.<br /><br />The good news is that it's way easier to slice than a real turkey, and you can cook it in a few minutes.  And yes, I really recommend slicing and browning this stuff in a frying pan.  Otherwise it does sort of resemble cat food.<br /><br />Personally, I'm experimenting with shifting my breakfast toward protein and away from fat and carbs so won't be tempted to eat a huge lunch in the middle of the day when my job is basically sitting and moving a mouse around.<br /><br />So, I gave this a try and if you fry it a bit it isn't bad.  It's sort of like going to Arby's without getting in the car.  Oh yeah, and if there's another economic downturn, it's a really cheap way to have a Thanksgiving dinner.  Better stock up now!
