I switched to this cat food randomly--Whole Foods was out of the Halo brand cat food I had been buying, and this was the next best option they sold.  I'm really glad I switched though! My 2 cats used to vomit up their food once or twice a week, and never liked the Halo brand food.  The vomiting is way down now, and they both seem to really like this food.  Plus the quality of this cat food is great, which is something I really care about.<br /><br />This 12 lb bag is a great deal.  At whole foods, it's $14 for a 3lb bag!  With the 12 lb bag, I save $22.  Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).<br /><br />I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.
