I have been taking Fenugreek to increase my milk production, but I haven't noticed much of a difference.  I started drinking the Organic Mother's Milk Tea twice a day and I noticed an increase in production in one day.  This is a great product!  I only wish I had tried it sooner!  Some people complain about the taste, but I think is fine.  I usually drink it plain, without any type of sweetener.  I actually look forward to drinking it now.
