I've cooked 8 loaves of this bread in my bread machine and every one of them has been fantastic. Even friends that made fun of me for getting the bread machine were considering getting one themselves after tasting this sourdough.<br /><br />I've never cooked sourdough from scratch before, but it's extremely difficult for me to imagine that it's that much better than this bread mix. Especially when you factor in it's literally: Add a cup of water, Dump in mix, Add included yeast, Press a button. You can't really beat that. Every batch I have made rose no problem.<br /><br />There is only one problem I have with it. After I make a loaf, it's gone so fast, I rarely have it when I want it. But that's a great problem to have.<br /><br />I hardly review on amazon, but this bread deserves a higher rating than this. I've also had the white bread mix and it's extremely good too.
