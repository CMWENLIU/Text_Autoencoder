OMG, I can't believe the variety of these "Sides" that Lipton has to offer. After devouring the tasty Stroganoff Side, I just had to try another "stick-to-your-ribs" meal, so I went for this Rice Medley.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding like a glutton, I'm going to confess I made those little, impolite moaning sounds while eating this dish ... but who wouldn't? The flavor of this yummy rice dish is enhanced by vermicelli, dried peas, carrots, and onions in chicken-flavored sauce.  Mmmmmm ... Oops, there I go again! (Well, at least I'm not burping. ... lol)<br /><br />Oh-hhh, I see other tempting varieties: Asian Sides, Fiesta Sides and more, and all just as easy to prepare as the Stroganoff (see previous review).<br /><br />Excuse me, I'm off to the kitchen again. These are so easy, so delicious, I may never "cook" again.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: Millennium Babe: The Prophecy
