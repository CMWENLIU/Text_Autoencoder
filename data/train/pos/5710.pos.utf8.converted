Yogi Redbush Chai is an exceptional brew that has found itself a subject of particular fondness. Mixed with a little bit of sweetener and just enough soy milk to create a faintly cloudy caramel hue, this chai makes a spectacular any-time tea. It's spicy, though not overwhelmingly so, and when mixed with milk it becomes a delicate but warm tea. Give this one a go if you're on the lookout for a good chai tea.
