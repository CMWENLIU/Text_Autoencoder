We tried this soup when they had it on sale at Safeway in the Specialty Items section.  It is so good we wanted more.  They discontinued it, so we Amazon-ed and were pleased to find it here.  This soup is great made to order or with all sorts of items added.  We put chicken, black beans, corn, 2 small cans of authentic salsa, jalapenos and sometimes leftovers of all sorts into the mix and it is always great.  Wonderful winter warmer.  Try it, you'll see.
