Because my local WholeFoods and other stores had run out of quinoa, I looked into buying it online.  And even with shipping costs, this turned out to be a good decision, as in the US Northeast, quinoa costs skyrocketed around August 2008, from $2/pound to $4 and up.<br /><br />This is a bulk bag of quinoa from Angelina's Gourmet, shipped quickly in a box, and is in all respects just like what you'd buy in the bulk section of your local health food store.  Excellent value both financially and nutritionally.
