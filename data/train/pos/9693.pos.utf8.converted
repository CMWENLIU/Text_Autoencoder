This is a handy way to get sparkling water (via the UPS man)!  And this product is truly delicious - no after taste just.  I like plain carbonated water, but to add flavor, I just thoroughly mix a little one-serving package of Wyler's or Crystal Light or Miro in a little plain water and then pour in the TalkingRain and I have orange or lemon or whatever calorie-light soda.  My first shipment was not packaged properly and some cans were damaged and leaking but Amazon took care of that by sending out a replacement shipment right away which arrived thoroughly bubble wrapped and in the proper size box.  I'll reorder this fine product.
