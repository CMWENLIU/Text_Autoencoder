This is my new favorite tea.  It's black as coffee maybe even darker.  It has a very strong flavor.  You will either love it or hate it.  The tea leaves are allowed to decompose or compost a bit.... it is weird but it makes a amazingly powerful tea.  It is supposed to promote weight loss if you want to use it for that reason.
