We tried Tortuga Rum cake while vacationing in Bahamas...many told us that Bacardi rum cake is really good...well if you try this one you are not going back to Bacardi Rum Cake..we tried almost 5-6 flavors of Tortuga and most of them are nice..Our all time favorite is Chocolate Rum cake..<br /><br />After coming back from Bahamas, we ordered these cakes through Amazon and whenever we take a bite..it freshened up sweet memories of Bahamas..
