My cat's really like this food, and when Wal-Mart stopped carrying it in our area, I found it at Target for a good price.  However, when the price went up there, I found it on Amazon. The price was a little higher, but with gas and sales tax I figured out it would be cheaper, Plus, I save 15% off the price since I have it delivered each month.  Now I don't have to lug it around the store, it just get's delivered to my house! Plus, no sales tax!!
