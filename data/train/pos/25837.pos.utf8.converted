I originally bought this just because it was cheaper than the regular parchment paper in the grocery store. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to find out that it's actually much more useful than regular parchment paper.<br /><br />The silicone non-stick coating is no joke. Before I got this, I would often line pans with aluminum foil and spray them with oil to roast peppers, cook frozen samosas, etc. Now, I instead just lay the food on top of a piece of parchment paper, and the non-stick coating makes oil unnecessary. And, this paper is *much* cheaper than aluminum foil.<br /><br />Two things to note: at 13" wide, it's a couple of inches narrower than most regular parchment paper. Also, unlike most grocery store brands, it doesn't have a metal band to help you tear off sheets. (They claim that you can use the cardboard edge to do that, but it doesn't work.) But 13" is plenty for almost everything I do. And using scissors to cut the paper is a small price to pay given how well this paper works.
