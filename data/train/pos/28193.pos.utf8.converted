I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer.
