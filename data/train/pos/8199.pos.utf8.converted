A miracle in my life! I tried this out of desperation, and it really does work. Over 20% of Americans suffer from Stomach problems and Doctors truly cannot help.  They will give you tests, limited diets, medicines and generally albeit Innocently...they do not help.  This is not weird Health food, it truly works.  Plus it is good.  Over the years...I have had chronic gastritis or IBS and or maybe an ulcer.  Knowing that Medical intervention is limited at best, I sought alternative means of helping myself.  Read up for yourself and you will understand how incredibly simple and logical this is.  Plus it is delicious.  I take a couple lg teaspoons /day, am careful about what I eat and have experienced an amazing recovery.  Try it yourself, you can't loose.
