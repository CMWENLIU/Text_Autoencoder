The wine is very good but the package was totally demolished when it arrived. The bag with the must survived OK but the corks etc were going all over the place. I had enough corks left over from previous kits so everything was OK. It's my opinion that the packaging for this 40 pound kit is not substantial enough to survive a UPS trip. Thanks for all the really good wine kits that I have recieved from AMAZON.<br /><br />Tommy
