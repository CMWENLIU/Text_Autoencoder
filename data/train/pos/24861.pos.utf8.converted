I, too, have been looking for larger amount of organic cinnamon to use for blood sugar/pancreas regulation.<br />This was a fantastic deal.  The cinnamon is very fresh, strong smelling and tastes wonderful.<br />I paid little under $14 for two 1lb bags with free shipping...  compared with the price of the little spice containers<br />bought in the store, this was a definite winner.<br />Very highly recommended.  Just make sure you have someone to share the 'extra' with, or get some airtight containers,<br />as one pound worth is A LOT of cinnamon (and you are getting two!).
