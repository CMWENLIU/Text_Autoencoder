I wish I would have known about this with my first child!<br /><br />I successfully breastfed my first child for three years but also had the luxury of staying home with her.  Returning to work after my second child has been a little easier in knowing that I can still provide pumped breast milk for him!<br /><br />I tried this tea in hopes that it would both help with my supply when I cannot be home and with my letdown while pumping.  So far a success!  I drink three cups daily.  I try to drink a cup about a half hour before pumping while at work, as well! It helps tremendously!<br /><br />For those of you who are truly committed to breastfeeding this product is very much a help!!
