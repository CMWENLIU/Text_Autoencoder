Everyone has their own personal tastes, but to me this is a Wow. Why so? First I love the taste. It reminds me of the days when I was young drinking Boones Farm Apple wine on a Friday night. Some may prefer, or liken it to champagne.<br />I'm on a diet, lost the first 10 pounds in 12 days. It is a simple diet, eat as much natural fruit, and vegetables, and salads as I want, and limit my sandwiches at lunch to whole grain bread with lean meats, like chicken, fish, or Boka/Morning Star (soy) burgers, and the same type of meat entree at night for dinner on top of a pile of steamed veggies, and Olive Oil. Yeah lots of olive oil. (Not to excess though) My sandwiches, and dinner's meats/steamed veggies always enjoy piles of saut&eacute;ed onions, bell pepper, etc. to put on top of them. You could say that it is not a fast, but rather a feast. One of the key ingredients is I have all the fruit I want. At night time if I get hungry, I will eat a whole small jar of natural apple sauce. No sugar added. Oh, and I drink plenty of water. Eight glasses a day? Probably, I don't measure; I just walk around with a large plastic mug, filled with water, and sip all day long.<br />So what does all of this have to do with the IZZE sparkling apple? Namely this. It is a special treat.<br />I would not call it diet food, because in order for fruit to be dietetic, it must be in its natural state. It can be cut into chunks, and fresh frozen, and blended into smoothies, which is my preferred method; eliminates spoilage, and adds to the fun. But you have to avoid concentrating it, thereby increasing the sugar content. In this case, it is from concentrate, but then they add sparkling water. So it is kind of teetering on the fence. That is why I call it a special treat.<br />So for those who may not agree with my dieting methods, or the fact that I easily drop 20 pounds in the spring, and have been doing it for well over 25 years, (Yes I have lost over 500 pounds in my lifetime) and are more interested in having a good time, let's talk about the Wow factor.<br />This stuff tastes great. I quit drinking some 10 years ago, but this is an opportunity to live it up. Whenever I open a can of Izze, it is like a celebration. By the way, I am talking about the apple, and am curious about the other flavors as well. One thing is certain, I will be purchaing more of this when my current case runs out.<br />When dieting, the big enemy is cane sugar, which is fattening. Fruit sugar in its natural state is immediately absorbed by the body, and does not convert to fat readily the way cane sugar does. (All I know is when I eat cane sugar I immediately gain weight, and when I eat all the fruit I want, I lose it)<br />If you are looking to break the canned soda habit, Izze is the way to go. Canned soda has some ungodly amount of cane sugar in it.<br />Another interesting factoid, according to Dr Weil M.D., the nutritional, and natural healing guru, the main benefit from drinking wine is not in the alcohol, but in the grapes. By getting Izze apple, the primary ingredient is grape juice, then apple, etc. So help your heart, or arteries, or whatever they espouse about the benefits of drinking wine, and get some Izze. I'm sold. Once you taste it, many will be too.<br />I think the Izze people are really on to something here. Highly recommended.
