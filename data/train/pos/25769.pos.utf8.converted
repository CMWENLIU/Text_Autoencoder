I have had products from the Coombs farm in my pantry for years.  This is what Maple Syrup tastes like.  This is the best Maple syrup I know of.  I use the Grade B for cooking (it has a stronger flavor that withstands cooking) - everything from breads to cookies and glazes.<p>This Grade A syrup is wonderful with anything, but I love just a tsp or two with real oatmeal.  I hear that some people make &quot;Mapletinis&quot; out of this syrup and vodka, but I can't say that I have tried one.
