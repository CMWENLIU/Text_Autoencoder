Our daughter was diagnosed with allergies to Gluten, Casein & Soy when she was 18 months old.  Unfortunately, one of her favorite food treats was rice with soy sauce.  We tried making all kinds of alternative soy sauces using recipes we found online that met her allergy restrictions and nothing appealed to her taste buds.  Finally, one day we accidentally found Coconut Aminos!!  This has been a lifesaver!  We love the product, and unlike another reviewer, we DO use it for fried rice...we just add fish sauce to offset the sweetness.  We don't have any other option for soy sauce, and it works great!<br /><br />The only thing we do NOT like about this product is that it has a bit of an effervescent quality to it...MANY bottles that we have purchased have burst and leaked.  Also, it is a mess to pour.  I asked the company if it would harm the product at all to put it in a soy sauce type dispenser bottle and they "didn't think so."  LOL  We tried it and have not noticed a quality difference, so that is how we use it now...from a spouted dispenser.<br /><br />We feel very blessed to have found this (luckily we stumbled upon it early in her diet and she is now 3...so we have used it for 18 months or so...
