Nutiva organic extra virgin coconut oil tastes and smells like coconut, and it makes any food cooked with it taste amazing! I use it for frying, I add it to my morning oatmeal or amaranth, I put it on baked sweet potatoes with a sprinkle of nutmeg, and I use it in baking as a substitute for any other oil that the recipe calls for.<br /><br />I tried Nutiva for the first time over a year ago and bought a small, 15-ounce jar the first time, just to check it out.  Now, I buy a gallon each time I order.  It sits on my counter next to the stove so it is readily available for any cooking or baking I might do.<br /><br />I respect the Nutiva company, as its mission is to "nourish people and planet by using healthy organic ingredients, enriching the soil, and supporting just and sustainable causes."
