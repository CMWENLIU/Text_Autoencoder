I have two 6-year-old rescue keeshonden to which I feed a grain-free diet. The three grain-free Acana varieties are the major portion of their food rotation.  One of my two has a delicate constitution and cannot handle the foods with the highest level of protein.  However, they both do extremely well on the moderate-protein Acana.  Other foods with which they have had success are Canidae, Instinct, Barking at the Moon, and Wellness Core. But for the past several months, it has all been Acana.  Acana is highly-rated by dog food rating organizations.  It is made by Champion Pet Foods in Canada, which also makes Orijen.  Champion uses local sources for their ingredients - nothing from China or other questionable areas.  Sometimes I think my dogs eat better than I do!
