This review focuses on the pomegranate and grapefruit flavors of Izze.<br /><br />Izze's all natural sparkling juice is a nice alternative to soda.  There is no caffeine, no processed sugar, and no unnatural ingredients.  It is refreshing to read the ingredients and find that I recognize every ingredient!  And they are all safe!<br /><br />The pomegranate juice is mixed in with a bit of grape and apple juice, to mitigate a mild (but not unpleasant) bitter citrus aftertaste, somewhat like grapefruit juice.  The sparkle has a feel closer to sparkling water than to carbonated soda -- and I like that.  It is a distinctive flavor -- and I like that too.  I wasn't sure what to think after just one can, but after trying it a couple of times I have found that it is quite nice.<br /><br />I liked the ruby red grapefruit flavor all at once -- it has the perfect grapefruit flavor, the sweet tangy delicious zing, without the bitter aftertaste of grapefruit.  It is not too sweet, but just right for that grapefruit flavor fix that I like now and again.  This is the perfect size container, especially for my kids who also love the grapefruit flavor.  Good stuff.<br /><br />What I also like is that Izze appears to be a company with a conscience.  Started by a couple of friends in 2003 who liked the idea of an all natural and distinctive beverage as an alternative to soda, Izze uses their product as a platform from which to promote awareness of the Global Education Fund (and other good causes, both environmental and global) that they support.
