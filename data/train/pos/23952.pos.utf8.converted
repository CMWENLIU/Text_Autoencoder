I normally use loose tea rather than tea bags since it tends to be less expensive and more flavorful. But on occasion it's more convenient to use a tea bag. These make a very nice cup of tea - good black tea flavor, strong but not overpowering. One bag per 8 oz of water comes out just right for me.<br /><br />I like that it comes in a round bag without any strings or wrapping - easier to use, less waste, and easier to compost.<br /><br />Definitely a step up in taste from the usual bagged decaf, such as Liptons, and much better than store brand decaf black teas. Excellent value if you can get it on sale.
