I have used this product for a long time.  Really handy for baking that uses buttermilk.  The local grocery wasn't getting the ROI from the shelf space required for marketing this product and discontinued carrying it.  This is my first purchase of this product from Amazon. The shipping was prompt, but did arrive with dents in two of the cartons.  Not damaging to the enclosed product. It comes as a three pack product.  I will have to 1) make more biscuits, 2) give some away, 3) try is as 'drinking' buttermilk.  The use by date is 05/19/2015.<br />If you do a lot of baking, I believe you will enjoy and appreciate the convenience of this product.
