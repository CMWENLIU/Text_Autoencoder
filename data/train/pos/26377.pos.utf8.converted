I love these and I think they are one of the better flavors. I find several of the flavors leave me with a slightly acidic aftertaste. Not so here. Do not get confused by the BIG PRINT on the front of the box about 5 Grams of whole grain per serving. That only means it is contains 5 Grams of flour (whole wheat). Most people think it contains 5 Grams of FIBER but it does not. Only 1 Gram of fiber per serving. Now if they only could lower the fat content by 10 percent and double the fiber this would be much healthier as a snack. I won't hold my breath but will still enjoy these and have them on auto-delivery. Peace!
