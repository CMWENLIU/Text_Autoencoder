This supplier knows what she is doing! I wasn't sure about ordering calendula flowers but gave it a try. (Her lavender and muslim bags were great). However, I needed some for facial care products and baby cream I was making. She delivers again. I am quite pleased with the quality and the look. A pound of calendula is a lot! I plan on making teas out of it as well. She also included a sheet on good uses for it.
