I realized a week and a half before Christmas that I didn't have any lingonberries to put on my meatballs for our Swedish Smorgasbord.  So I looked up lingonberries on amazon and came across these.  So I bought them and got them really quickly. They tasted yummy and I think these are the same brand that they sell at Ikea. I was very pleased with the product and the fast shipping.
