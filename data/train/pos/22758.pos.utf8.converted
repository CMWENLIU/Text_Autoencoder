This bar is tasty, filling and good for you.  I love them and have one for breakfast every morning with a cup of brewed chai with almond milk.<br /><br />I am looking to eat free of wheat/gluten/yeast and this bar fits the bill.  Only 9 grams of sugar (compared to the 15 - 30 grams that other bars contain), plus 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein.  The ingredients are organic and the hint of spice is very nice.<br /><br />I highly recommend!
