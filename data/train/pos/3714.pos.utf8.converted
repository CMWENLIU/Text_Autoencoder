I just finished making my 1st batch.. Great price, great taste..PLUS corks, labels, capsules and everything you need truly does come with it. I saw that a couple people were saying that some of these wines are a little weak.. What I do is make 5 gallon instead of 6. You get 25 bottles, I's still under $2.00 per bottle and the flavor is excellent.
