Thanks to the other reviewers for offering their useful experiences with this product; now I can try many of their suggestions -- and offer my own.  This product has become my seasoning of choice (well, after pepper) and useful additive in:  homemade jams, marmalades, sourdough breads, salads, soups, reconstituted dried veggies, hot chili sauces, et al.  Who needs salt?  NOW products have turned up in many forms in my kitchen, always with high quality.  Many, many thanks, folks!
