I've looked all over for a decent selection of espresso pods. I was so<br /><br />happy to find PodMerchant's Super Sampler. There are two each of 29<br /><br />different pods so I was able to try out more different pods than I'd be<br /><br />able to otherwise. This is an espresso-lover's dream! I'm also going to<br /><br />try PodMerchant's Decaf Sampler.
