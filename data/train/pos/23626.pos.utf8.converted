The Cavalli silver label is an amazing Balsamic unlike anything you will have ever bought in the grocery store. It's very rich and sweet with a mild acidic finish.  You will not use this for salads but for cheeses or drizzled as a glaze for quality beef dishes. The good thing is that you need only use a few drops at a time so while expensive, this product will last for 4-6 months with occasional usage.  It's worth it in my humble opinion. I've had a "thing" for balsamic vinegars for many years in the same way that many people do for fine wines. I've experimented with many of the best and this is one of them. Only the Gold label from Cavelli is better but it's considerably more expensive and though I love great Balsamic's I do have limits.
