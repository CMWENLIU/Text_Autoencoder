These things are a giggle!  I won't bore you with too much detail because the other reviewer has done a great job covering all the details.  I will say my husband and I are not particularly into Japanese cuisine or anything exotic yet we find these kelp noodles delightful in every way.  Your imagination will run riot with them!  There is nothing NOT to like because they have no flavor but will absorb any flavor you put them with.  When kept cold they are crunchy, when cooked with liquid they soften.  Delightful to look at and fun to eat. Best of all they are full of minerals - including iodine - which are good for you.  Don't be a chicken - buy these.  If you don't want the whole case offered here you can order just one package directly from Gold Mine.
