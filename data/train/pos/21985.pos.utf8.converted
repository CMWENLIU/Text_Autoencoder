I have loved elderberry jelly since I was a child in the 60s. As an adult, I was extremely dismayed to find Smucker's no longer offered elderberry in their line of jellies. After much searching, I found Mrs. Miller's Homemade Elderberry Jelly on Amazon and could not wait for my order to arrive. And I was not disappointed! In fact I do believe Mrs. Miller's Homemade Jelly is the best I have ever had. The taste so fresh and crisp. The jelly wholesome and packed with flavor! The taste transported me back to my childhood and wonderful memories of warm toast and jelly in the mornings shared with my Mom. She would have loved it, too. My next order is going to be a big one!
