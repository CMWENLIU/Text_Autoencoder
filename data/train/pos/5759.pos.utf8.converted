I haven't been a vegetarian for over a decade, but I still make a lot of vegetarian meals.  Better Than Bouillon (BTB) is one of my go-to ingredients for adding flavor to vegetable soup and stock, and also less expected dishes like pasta, or braised veggies and even stir-fry sauces.  Though shelf-stable when you buy it, the BTB needs to be refrigerated once open.  I keep mine in the door of the fridge for easy access, and can fit three or four varieties of BTB in the shelf where eggs are meant to be stored.  Though it takes up space in the fridge, it gives me lots more room in my pantry and freezer, since I'm no longer storing boxes, cans or jars of broth.<br /><br />I also like the flexibility to use the amount I need for a specific recipe.  I wouldn't always open a huge box of broth if I only wanted a splash of it to loosen a stew, for example, but I can easily use a 1/2 tsp of BTB in water and dilute my gravies without diluting their flavor as well.  You'd be surprised how many places you can ramp up flavor with this product.  I often use it in place of salt as well, particularly in saucy dishes where it blends easily.  The sodium content is comparable to other bouillon I've seen, but the flavor seems richer, so less is required overall.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist but I feel like I should comment on the reviews which blast BTB for adding MSG; as far as I can tell from my research, they don't add MSG.  Now, not *adding* MSG is not the same as not *having* any MSG, which is I think what confuses and frustrates some people.  MSG is a naturally occurring compound in some foods, but can also be isolated and added into foods where it doesn't naturally occur.  BTB *does* contain ingredients that have natural MSG in them, therefore it has some natural MSG as well, but is stating the truth when they say they don't use MSG as an additive.<br /><br />For what it's worth, completely avoiding MSG in a typical American diet can be quite a challenge.  I've gotten really horrid migraines for a long time and spent years cutting out all kinds of different foods, including MSG, to try to decrease the frequency of my headaches.  For me, MSG can make pain worse, but doesn't cause it to occur altogether.  My husband, being a thoughtful man, has made soups for me using BTB when I've been knocked out due to a migraine, and with the quantities we use in our cooking, I haven't had any problems.  Of course, your experience may differ.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Better Than Bouillon's Vegetable Base.  It's an excellent way to add flavor to dishes, easy to use and undeniably better for you than most traditional bouillon cubes.
