I purchased these for my 93 year old Grandmother.  She loves pine nuts.  She has seen many pine nuts in her 93 years.  She declared Klein's Naturals Pine Nuts (Chinese Grade) to be the best she has ever tasted.  She likes them so much she wants to give Klein's as gifts just to show off.  She indicated the flavor, freshness and appearance make this a very high quality product.
