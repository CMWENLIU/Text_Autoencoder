Yes, let me be the first to tell you how great tasting they are. Why pay more for Dop Certifed Imported San Marzano tomatoes. Do me a favor and check out the Mangia Carmelina website , it explains it all. Yes, I too was doubtful it would not  taste the same  but it does.Yes they are a product of Italy , not processed here. also, nothing is added to preserve the shelf life. The cans I got had a 2 year expiration date. So, stay healthy ,eat well Retired Early.
