First of all, 5 stars for Goya Mojo Criollo.  It is fabulous.  I use it to marinate everthing:  chicken, fish, shrimp, pork, or beef.  If you love tangy, citrusy, flavorful food then this is the best marinade in my opinion.  It also helps keep the food moist.  However 1 star for Amazon Grocery, I was pretty annoyed after I bought the two bottles from Amazon for 13.99 and then walked into a regular grocery store to find that each bottle sells for 2.94.
