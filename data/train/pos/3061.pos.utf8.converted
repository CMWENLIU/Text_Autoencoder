I had never liked the flavor of green tea but I was trying to drink it because of the health benefits but no matter how much I tried to drink regular green tea, I couldn't get it down because of the taste.  So I decided to order this flavor along with their other green tea flavor, Citrus Green, and now I can finally drink and enjoy green tea.  I steep the tea for 5 minutes for best flavor.<br /><br />The cherry flavor is very light, just enough to let you know it is flavored but not so much that it is overwhelming.<br /><br />I have been drinking both flavors of Gevalia green tea for over 10 years now and I like them so much that I usually ask for them as Christmas gifts from family and friends.
