Purchased two bags of these - 2 pounds each. It's something like 1500 kernels per bag.  The packaging what very professional looking - sealed fresh. Once opened it has a ziplock press n seal thing to keep the bag closed.<br /><br />My wife and i take these up to 5 per day. Experience has taught us that unless you can handle the very bitter taste of these its best to take with some other form of food. You can also grind these in a coffee grinder which we've done and then sprinkle over salad, pasta or what have you.<br /><br />We came up with a great way to consume these without making you wince over the bitterness - buy a bag (or more) of organic, raw dried apricots (without sulfites or other additives) and take one of these with a kernel and chew it that way. Its like putting the kernel back in the apricot. Makes it a lot easier to eat the kernel if you are eating it whole and taste great that way.
