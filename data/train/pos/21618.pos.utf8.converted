It was 1971 when I started my day with a bowl of Product 19 and half a grapefruit.  Yet, the daily anticipation of the flavor, crunch and satisfaction of obtaining so many RDA's has never wavered.  Only Total cereal approaches Product 19's vitamin content but with a flavor I consider minimally palatable at best.<br />When the last store in my area stopped carrying Product 19, I was driven to call Kellogg's who provided no consolation.  Then, I found Amazon.com promoting their grocery line.... Amazon is a life-saver!..<br />I recommend any reader of this review that has Product 19 in their market to try this product.  Read the box text, become a believer and enjoy!
