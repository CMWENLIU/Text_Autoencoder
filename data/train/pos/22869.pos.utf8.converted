Valentine's Day is the hardest day of the year for my 9-year-old. He has a sensitivity to red dye 40. Almost all the candy you buy has it in it. M&Ms have it - IN THE CHOCOLATE. Most chocolate cake mixes have it, but worse... all that red candy you get from your classmates? Yeah... it has it too. Luckily, his sister will usually trade him for things that he can have and the families that we know will try to make sure he gets something (like one specifically got green fun dip for him - I mean, how sweet is that?). We always give away little party favor toys or something and skip the candy all together, but...<br /><br />He had been really down about the candy issue and Valentine's Day and I went looking for something he could have. Surely, there's a red hard candy that doesn't have red40 in it, right? Yeah, you'd be surprised... it's not easy to find, but I ran across this product and ordered it. As a bonus, it has a good chunk of Vitamin C, doesn't use HFCS (all natural sugars and other ingredients). Sold! But, will it be nasty? Oh well, we had 150 lollipops to find out!<br /><br />... and they are good. REALLY good, they are just the right amount of sweet and tartness. I had to move them off the counter because I kept dipping in there myself. My son LOVES them. He can have strawberry flavored candy again. I know this sounds simplistic and overly dramatic, but when you are 9, it can be really depressing. But yeah, he has to share with the rest of the family too because we are all hooked.<br /><br />Thanks, YummyEarth. Thanks for giving my son back his Valentine's Day :)<br /><br />Note: The container we got only had 3 flavors in it, but it didn't matter, but be aware when ordering that your selection of flavors will vary.
