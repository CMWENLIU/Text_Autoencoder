We've been very happy providing occasional treats to each of our Cockers. However we were reluctant to give them dried rawhide chews (tied up bone shape) because the rawhide pieces can cause blockage in their intestinal tract. But our Vet (Dr. Purewal) advised us about the C.E.T. products. The fact that they are formed-and-flaked into the shape of a strip would prevent them from getting stuck in the intestines. And a great plus is that they have beneficial enzymes which will help prevent plaque build-up besides being nutritious. Shopping for them through Amazon helps us control the cost as well. Buying through a Vet can make them a bit pricey. I think you should try them if you haven't done so before.<br />Michael
