I currently use Coffee People's version of Donut Shop and when I saw Timothy's version I wanted to give it a try. This is not as full body as Coffee People's version but I really like the smooth low acidity taste. If you don't want a bold rich flavor I think you will love this smooth great tasting coffee as much as I do.
