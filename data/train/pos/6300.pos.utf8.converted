Although my 4 month-old kitten was initially a little hesitant when I started feeding her CORE (I have no idea what she was eating at the shelter, and the taste was probably pretty different than what she was used to), after 3-4 days she really warmed up to it.  Now, about two weeks later, she starts meowing as soon as she sees me get out the food container and can't wait to start eating.<br /><br />Even after only 2-3 weeks eating CORE, her coat is noticeably shinier and smoother than it was when I brought her from the shelter, and she seems very happy and healthy otherwise.  I can't say enough good things about this food!
