I found this once in the store, bought it, and found it to be an excellent mole sauce. It's not especially salty, and the fruit notes really shine through in this. Works well as a late addition or even condiment for roasted meats. The opened jar kept in the fridge for a couple of weeks. I haven't found it in the store again, and have been reluctant to order online due to the price, but it is tasty stuff.
