If you are looking for taste, nutrition, and low carbs/calories, this beverage is for you. Add to that low sodium in this particular variation and you have a drink we should all be drinking. I was always a bit reluctant to indulge in this yummy veg-fest because of the huge amount of added sodium, but now the low-sodium product has become much more available and costs only 30% more than the original high-sodium version. Typically, this low-sodium, mixed 100% vegetable juice is the type of drink that sells for $2-4 at a juice bar per 8-ounce serving or about $8-$10 per quart from a health food store in bottles. WHY?<br /><br />There are more than 8 reasons WHY V8 is so special -- Tomatoes, Beets, Celery, Carrots, Lettuce, Parsley, Watercress and Spinach are the first eight. Low carbs/calories and no added sugar are the 9th and 10th reasons. Low sodium and the resulting favorable potassium/sodium ratio give this particular version an 11th reason to become a truly 5-star product. Also, the 17 mg. of naturally-occurring lycopene in an 8-ounce serving is more than the average amount that you would find in single-nutrient lycopene supplements which cost an average of 16 cents per pill and which are less bio-available than the naturally-occurring lycopene in the V8 juice. With all the naturally occurring vitamins, minerals, and anti-oxidants in "V8 100% Vegetable Juice", this is a really healthy dietetic treat as an in-between snack.<br /><br />If you are not allergic to the ingredients [e.g., tomato allergy], this is the most practical and convenient way to add a very healthy serving of mixed vegetables to your diet. This variety in a small can is a little pricey, but it is very convenient and your body will thank you.<br /><br />TASTING THE CAN????<br /><br />Some people mentioned that they tasted the can. I always pour the contents out of the can when I first open it, unless I am going to finish it in one gulp. The aluminium in the container does leach into the acidic vegetable drink due to oxidation once it is opened, so remove it or drink it ASAP. The bottles all have an expiration date stamped on them, but since I do not have the cans on hand I can't say for sure whether they do as well.
