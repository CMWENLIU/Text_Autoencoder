I have been eating Fiber One bars for 2 years now, and I've lost 50lbs. I am a runner and I'm always thinking of ways to increase my fiber intake. Luckily Fiber One products have me covered. These bars are so easy to take with you; to the gym, work, lunch, as a snack! I buy them in bulk now and enjoy them in my lunches. The recommended amount of fiber a person should have a day is about 18-25 grams...and this one little bar can take care of 9 of those grams! How awesome is that?!  I love the chocolate ones the best, but they now have a new one call chocolate mocha! And the gas that people have talked about on these reviews goes away once your body is able to handle more fiber. I have none of those side effects now.  Enjoy!
