In the July/Aug issue of Victoria Bliss Magazine there was a recipe for Raspberry Rose Blancmange. I was pleased to find this culinary rose water on amazon because it's not like it's a staple at the market- am I right? I ordered it on a Friday I think and it was there by Monday- woosh- super fast! I was able to create the Blancmange for a garden party on Tuesday evening (mid-summer night). There is nothing quite as poetic, romantic, or exotic as edible and fragrant flora.
