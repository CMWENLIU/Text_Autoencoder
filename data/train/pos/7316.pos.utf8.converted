Rave Rave Rave!  I've been doing some research on raw foods and health foods and I know of all the benifits of kelp and other seaweeds.  I live in central WI which has a pretty big Hmong population (as well as other asian influence).  I stopped at 5 different asian markets and stores in the area asking for kelp noodles... every place lead me to nori seaweed.  No kelp noodles.  I read the other reviews that said the price was high.  However with my limitations I couldn't be picky and thought I would go ahead and try.  The worst case senerio, I was out $15.  No biggie.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did!!!  I split the package in half (two servings each).  One portion I threw in with some shrimp and herbs last night.  Tonight I just made a chicken and veggie stir fry and threw the kelp noodles in towards the end.<br /><br />I can't believe how filling these are!  And they take on all of the flavors you are cooking with.<br /><br />So here is the nutrition facts break down.  I'm going to compare this with a package of Hokkien noodles.<br /><br />4 oz of kelp noodles vs 3.5 oz of Hokkin noodles<br /><br />Calories : 6 kelp (170 hokkin)<br />Total fat: 0 kelp (2 g hokkin)<br />saturated fat: 0 (1g)<br />Trans Fat: 0 (0)<br />Cholesterol: 0 (0)<br />Sodium: 35 mg - 1% dv  (170 mg - 7% dv)<br />Carbs: 1 g (32g)<br />Fiber: 1g (2g)<br />Sugars: 0 (1g)<br />Protein: 0 (5g)<br /><br />Vitamin A: 0 (0)<br />Calcium: 15%  (0%)<br />Vitamin c: 0 (0)<br />Iron: 4% (2%)<br /><br />I won't by these from Amazon again.  I'm going to buy directly from [...](website on the package).  Where I can get 12-12 oz. packages per case for [...] + shipping.<br /><br />Another great aspect, made in the USA!  San Diego to be exact.  They have two other products, green tea kelp noodles and sea vegtables that I'm also very interested in trying.<br /><br />So all in all: Awesome product, iffy price on amazon.  However I think amazon is a great way to test out if you would like to try the kelp noodles without buying in bulk, and if you don't have access to kelp noodles where you live.  (BTW, on [...] they also have a list of where you can find these products).<br /><br />I can't wait until I get more so I can try these in other pasta dishes, soups and salads!<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.
