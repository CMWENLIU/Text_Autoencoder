These are very tasty nori strips.  I like the teriyaki flavor on these strips, and I am picky when it comes to teriyaki.  I also love how these are packaged.  One complaint I have with sea's gift and annie chun's seaweed snacks is the packaging.  You get a tray, in a foil wrapper, with a silica packet, in a box.  These jars are jam packed with much much more nori.  Plus the jars are useful after you are done (if you don't mind a slight fish smell... works great to store cat food haha). All in all a great product!<br /><br />FYI (I've seen this complaint on other nori reviews)... if you have never eaten nori... STOP... go to the grocery store... throw down a few bucks on some nori sheets for sushi.  Take those home and eat them.  If you don't like the flavor, you probably won't like these.  Nori has a fishy taste.  I hate when I see reviews on nori with people whining about the fact it tastes like fish and they just spent $20-$30 on something in bulk.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!
