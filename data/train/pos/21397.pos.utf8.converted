As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality.  It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc...  You know the drill, a top quality food that is unavailable in grocery stores.  Actually one of the best on the market amongst hundreds of different kinds.<br /><br />This stuff is pricey but your dog will eat less so it sort of offsets the price a bit.  With regular food your dog is eating corn, potato peelings, rotten rice, and animal guts and blood swept off the floor of the slaughter house.  That food is so low in nutrients your dog must eat tons of it and poop out all the poison that shouldn't be in the food.  With a great food like Orijen your dog will eat less, absorb most of it, and have fewer and more solid stools.<br /><br />There are a few people who are a little weary of Canidae.  Canidae now makes a grain free formula which is excellent.  It's almost as good as Orijen and cheaper as well.  If you want one of the better foods on the market and a good price, Canidae grain free is your ticket.  But if you absolutely want the Lamborghini of dog foods then Orijen is your buy, although Canidae is a Porsche and still pretty darn good.
