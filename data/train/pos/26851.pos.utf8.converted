When I met my last rescue pet, Dixie, approximately 6.5 years ago, she was a real mess--both externally and internally.  She exhibited a nervous condition {G.E.R.D.} that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions; that is to say, that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up!  She was painfully emaciated, skeletal almost, and her blood-work was all over the place.  So, after a round of IV fluids and 2 bags of 'Science Diet' chow, Dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home.  The first thing I did was to research which pet foods would address her particular condition; I knew that I didn't want to keep her on the 'Science Diet' regimen--it's too full of ingredients that I feel don't belong in a proper diet for dogs.  Lo' and behold, I stumbled upon the "Nature's Variety Instinct" formula for dogs.  It seemed like a good fit, due to all of the proper ratios {protein/fat} and totally 'GRAIN-FREE".  Viola!  The rest, as they say, is history.... 6.5 years later, Dixie now weighs in at approximately 20 loving, happy pounds of my friendly and well-adjusted best friend.
