Have had Keurig machine nearly a year and tried many coffees. This is a rich, flavorful, but not overly strong coffee. It's a good coffee flavor like this that makes me so glad to have a Keurig.<br /><br />I drink decaf occasionally and want a good decaf to offer friends. Getting a delicious cup of decaf on demand is wonderful. And I will keep ordering this blend.
