This is the best margarita mix that I have tasted. The others have too much sugar, too sweet and have too many calories. I have them both frozen and on the rocks. Here is a great recipe:<br /><br />Any Baja Bob Margarita Recipe.<br /><br />Large Martini Shaker - Fill with Ice<br /><br />Add 1/4 Shaker - Tequila - See if you can find Cuervo Black (Very Smooth) or Cuervo Gold<br /><br />Add 1/8 Shaker - Triple Sec<br /><br />Add Small Amount Grand Mariner<br /><br />Add - Balance of Baja Bob Any Margarita Mix.<br /><br />Add Lime Juice (1/2 Lime)<br /><br />Shake and serve over Crushed or Cubed Ice or Blend into a Frozen Margarita.<br /><br />Let me know what you think.
