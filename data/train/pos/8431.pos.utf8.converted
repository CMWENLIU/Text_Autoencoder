A year ago we brought the Senseo machine back from Holland and have been using it with a $100 transformer here in the States, but it was worth it all. Now we're overjoyed that the machines have finally come to the USA, we already purchased three and have recommended it to friends who also have bought the machine. Our favorite is the Dark Roast as we have tried all flavors while in Holland.  Yesterday we brought back the newest flavors from Europe: Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, and Milano.....but most of all DARK ROAST (Mocca Gourmet is pretty good too). I just hope the collection expands quickly over here....
