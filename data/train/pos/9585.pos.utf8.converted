This is a unique product that will become a conversation piece. I currently have three of them and they do take some space. It is a good idea to put them in an area where you dont mind all the light they emit. This may be helpful in an otherwise dark room. The product works as advertised. Depending on what you grow, you will get a particular yield. The lettuce and herbs grow fast and quickly. Excellent for those people in an apartment of where weather or critters can be an issue. This is a great product to educate kids. The product seems to be well constructed and alot of fun. You wont grow enough to stop shopping but you will have fun with this item. Makes a great gift.
