I make these for my daughter, the only member of our family that needs to be GF.  These brownies are EXCELLENT!  Even my husband and I can't help but have a few ourselves--they are really quite indistinguishable from the "real" thing.  My daughter also has allergies to casein (milk protein) and I've had no troubles substituting a casein-free margarine for the butter called for in the recipe.<br /><br />The only downside to these brownies is that they don't hold up very well after a few days (they get quite hard).  This isn't usually a problem and we manage to eat them pretty quickly (the recipe makes a 9x9 pan, which we cut into 9 brownies).  I have not tried freezing them to preserve them longer but that has worked well with other gluten free brownie recipes in the past so you may want to give it a try if longer term storage is necessary for you.
