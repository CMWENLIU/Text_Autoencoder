I give this product 5 starts, but not for eating it as a cereal. I think that eating it plain/with milk is a little rough: as a cereal, I'd give it 2 stars. However, I LOVE using this stuff in yogurt (any flavor)--it adds more of a crunch than granola does--and it's also fantastic when you put it on top of fruit (espeically strawberries and melons like canteloupe...not so much watermelon). I really like the Ezekiel 4:9 with almonds best!<br /><br />And as an FYI, 22 bucks for 6 boxes is a great deal. The cereal usually runs about $5-6 a box in-store.<br /><br />Enjoy!
