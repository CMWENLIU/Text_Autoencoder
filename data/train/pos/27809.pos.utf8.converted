These are healthy treats, not intended to be a large part of a dog's diet. The ingredients of most of the Wet Noses products are all good for dogs. NOT included are wheat and corn, which some dogs react poorly to, and which may be contaminated, especially if imported.<br /><br />These biscuits break in two fairly easily, but are firm enough give the dog some crunchy chewing exercise. I only use rewards to train my dog, and these are very motivating for him.
