I had to work in Turkey through New Year's evening this year at a remote warehouse / office for my company's franchise there. Desperate for coffee in the off hours, a co-worker and I searched the canteen cupboards and found a container of this exact coffee and some sugar. We actually made it in a microwave on low power stirring and watching and, amazingly enough, it came out extremely well. If you like authentic Turkish coffee, this is the real thing and it's as easy to make as hot chocolate.
