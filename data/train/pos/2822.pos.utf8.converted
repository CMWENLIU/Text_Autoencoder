I've used them all - saccharine, Sweet 'n Low, Equal, and Splenda.  None of these sweetners tasted like sugar, but with a family history of diabetes and obesity, I chose to make that trade-off.  Some of the sweetners were acceptable; some just didn't sweeten enough (Equal), using only one packet, to be cost effective.  Splenda has been my sweetner of choice for the past several years, but it still didn't taste like sugar.<br /><br />One of the warehouse stores was demonstrating PureVia, so my spouse and I tried it.  Imagine how surprised I was to find the taste and texture were as close to granulated sugar as I have encountered in a sweetner.  Even my picky spouse thought he could use this on his cereal in the morning - instead of several tablespoons of sugar.  I used PureVia in my coffee this morning.  PureVia was truly as close to sugar as I have found - one packet was sufficient and the coffee tasted great!  We did find that PureVia did not dissolve well in iced tea; again, it performed very much like sugar when that sweetner is put into cold tea.<br /><br />If you use some type of artificial sweetner, then you should definitely consider PureVia.  The per packet cost is higher than the other artificial sweetners when compared on a one-to-one basis.  For example and in my opinion, one packet of PureVia sweetens as much as one packet of Sweet 'n Low, three packets of Equal, and two packets of Splenda.  However, factoring in the requirement to use multiple packets of most of the other sweetners and the superior taste of PureVia, I think it is clearly the best sweetner available.  I will be switching to PureVia as my sweetner of choice and recommend it to anyone who also uses sweetners instead of sugar.
