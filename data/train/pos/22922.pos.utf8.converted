The company emailed me and let me know that this was back-ordered.  That was nice.  The kits even arrived before some of my other Amazon purchases, which were not back-ordered. My best friend loved it, I gave her one as a birthday-housewarming present.  She is really tough to shop for because she seems to have everything, and buys everything, so I really lucked out finding the perfect gift! She just purchased a condo, and does not get to go out very much these days, so I thought 'fun family project!' However her teenage daughter thought it was "gross"  and didn't want it in the kitchen, so I guess this is a project just for her!  -M. R. ;)
