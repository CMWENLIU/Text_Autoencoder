The coffee machine is probably the best coffee maker I've ever used, so long as you use their coffee Senseo Douwe Egberts pods.  I purchased my coffee maker from Target...what a disaster since they don't keep consistent stock of the recommended coffee pods for this coffee maker.  I now purchase my pods from Amazon...they are dependable, in-stock and tax free.
