Two days after the envelope arrived, I have a quart ball jar about to overflow with active starter, and I'm ready to bake.<br /><br />When you place your order, buy some spring water and have a quart ball jar ready. When the starter comes in the mail, measure a couple of TB of spring water directly into the zip lock bag, and massage the very stiff mixture over several minutes into a loose batter. Squeeze the contents into your ball jar, stir in a couple of TB of flour, and set to rest with the lid loose enough to let expanding air out. Twice a day, double the weight of the jar contents, half and half flour and spring water by weight. Leave plenty of room for expansion; start tossing out half to make room once you've scaled up to your jar size. The provided instructions are simpler, and probably also work just fine.<br /><br />It is worth reading multiple sources (e.g. every book covering sourdough at a bookstore) for perspective. There's a school of thought that this sourdough starter is a visiting tribe of friendlies, to protect the wild yeast on your flour from unfriendlies as your own wild yeast (and its entourage; sourdough is complex) gets established. A month from now, there will only be your yeast. Know another source that dates to the Oregon Trail? Yeah, right. Just like trying to track down Mohito mint; mint is indeterminate, and all you can actually grow is YOUR mint. Mint adapts. Yeast adapts.<br /><br />Thus, any reliable starter is as good as any other, to bootstrap getting your own wild yeast going. This source is the real deal, as good as any, and a convenient Amazon one-click. No need to hesitate.<br /><br />This same school of thought holds that the source doesn't affect your sourdough flavor, once it is replaced by your local friendlies. Rather, the proportion (by weight) between flour and water, and the flours used, affect the response to proofing temperature and the flavor. It is important to train your starter with the same flours you'll be using to bake, perhaps along with some rye no matter what. I'm using freshly ground red wheat and rye, and 1:1 water to flour by weight.<br /><br />There are those who prefer spring water to distilled, as the minerals create a nice environment. Once a starter gets going, plenty of people just use tap water. In any case, the chlorine leaves standing water pretty quickly; one can simply plan ahead and set aside tap water, e.g. in a Brita.
