We were on one of those exhausting road trips, the kind where the map is wrong, the air conditioning is busted and you're too far from home to make turning around feasible.  We'd stopped at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and I'd bought a couple of caffeinated sodas and a big bag of these Blazin' Buffalo & Ranch Doritos.  It might say more about my trip than these chips, but they were hands down the best part of that horrible "vacation."<br /><br />They were spicy, but not truly hot, with the right blend of heat and tanginess that good buffalo wings have, and a little lingering ranch flavor at the end.  They're sort of a cross between Spicy Nacho and Ranch, but with a little more kick. It took two crunches to proclaim these "my new favorite flavor!"<br /><br />But, aside from that single bag, I haven't seen these ANYWHERE!  I can't justify the current price on these (about 10 -12 times what I'd pay at a local supermarket!) despite their rarity, and there's no way I'll be trekking back to that gas station anytime in the future, but in the off chance you find a bag somewhere, give 'em a try.
