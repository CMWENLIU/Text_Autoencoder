I was a little skeptical but I have to say, this is a great product. First, like everyone said it tastes like water, no weird after-taste or anything. I'm a regular coffee drinker but during the summer it's not very appealing and you feel a little gross after two or three sodas during the day. This hits the spot for a little caffeine, especially when it's already 85+ by 8 a.m. We had a few sample bottles in NY and wound up getting a case. We gave a few bottles away and everyone's loved it - maybe you'll get some more orders from down south. Nice job!
