A delicious soy sauce thats short on "salty" and long on "savory" flavor, I discovered this condiment years ago at several of my prefered meal stops, offered as the accent sauce to their already tasty dishes that we were delighted to learn are marinated in Kimlan sauces.<br />After years of hoarding their sauce-packets from take-out lunches for at-home enjoyment, we were thrilled when they put their products on supermarket shelves -<br />Regretably the public's taste-buds weren't in tune with this product when it was offered for several years, accustomed to the saltier more well-established products on the shelves, but for your good taste as well as your health, try Kimlan!
