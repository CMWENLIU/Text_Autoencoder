I'm not big on chips period, however I do like salt and vinegar chips when they are not greasy and thick.  My husband brought home a bag of salt and vinegar Pop Chips and I tried them and loved them!  Especially since they are NOT fried and don't have that un-tasty "healthy" baked lack of flavor.  I wanted to try the other flavors so I bought the mixed flavors on Amazon.  I have to say, my favorite is the salt and vinegar-but I'm vinegar mad.  The black pepper and sour cream and onion come in second, then the cheese and plain.  My least fav is the bbq as the flavor is just too strong for me.  I like that its a kind of "junk food" product I can have in the house and not feel guilty about because it only tastes like its bad for you!
