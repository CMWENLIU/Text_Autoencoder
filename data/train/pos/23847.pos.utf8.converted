I've tried others but I keep coming back to this one.  The price is the best overall and I seem to always be able to get it from Amazon quickly.<br />I've been making yogurt for years now and I can't stand the stuff in the store.  Unfortunately, I never seem to be able to save the last couple tablespoons of the previous batch for the next!  This stuff is so inexpensive and convenient, I really don't mind anymore.  I use this for at least half the batches I make and the consistency of each batch is wonderful!  By far my favorite brand.
