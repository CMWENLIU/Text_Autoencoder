I love Chai Tea Lattes from Starbucks and tried many kinds of Chai Tea bags at home.  Stash comes the closest.  The spices are well balanced with the tea and one bag is strong enough for an 8 ounce cup.  Just add sweetner and a little cream and voila - Chai Tea Latte with fewer calories than Starbucks!  This is my favorite drink for a cool evening or afternoon pick-me-up.
