The Starbucks t-discs are truly superior. While on the surface they might seem more expensive due to the fact that you get fewer discs, the discs contain about three times the coffee as do the Gevalia. Secondly, opening a newly used Gevalia and Starbucks t-disc revealed the Starbucks to be much dryer, making me thing they drain better and give a better extraction. The net result is a stronger and more flavorful cup.<br />  The only drawback is that they only make a few of their blends in this format. If they put their Sumatra, Italian Roast, espresso, and a few others in this format there would be no need to buy any other brand.
