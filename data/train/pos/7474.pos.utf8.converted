I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this product because of the bad reviews on it.  I like bittersweet chocolate though so, maybe that's why.  I also mix it with yogurt as it says on the bag.  The "nibs" are more like crumbles however, that is inconsequential to me as I mix them.  These have helped greatly with curbing my chocolate addiction and keeping me on track with my diet.
