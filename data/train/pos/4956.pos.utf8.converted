This bacon-flavored salt can be used on pretty much anything to give it a little extra (non-fat, probably non-pork) flavor. I've even used it to season other meats (hamburgers, chicken), which is probably a little strange and just one of the things that gives Americans a bad name in the rest of the world :)<br /><br />Good stuff, albeit a tad pricey...but then again, a shaker of this size will probably last the average user a year or two (and if it doesn't, you've got bigger problems than reading reviews of what flavor of salt to buy on Amazon).
