My favorite parmesan cheese. The price was great and the quality is too. Highly recommended. It is packaged to avoid damage during shipping. Freshness... very good. Nice aroma. I have received this product 3 times so far to this date and have no complaints. You cannot beat this price unless i am wrong. I eat alot of this parmesan and have no regrets buying another 12 pack. I use it on lots of foods. I always check the price and shipping costs before i purchase this product and buy at the best price. I put some in the freezer if they approach the freshness date. They fit in small places.
