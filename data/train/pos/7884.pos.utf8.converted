I have horrible, huge bags and dark circles under my eyes and have all my life (I'm 59 years old).  I've toyed with the idea of plastic surgery and then decided to give this a try.  Within two or three days I saw a HUGE difference.  I use it not only under my eyes but above on the eyelid.  It does smell a bit different but it's so creamy and absorbs quickly. You only need a tiny bit!  I use it in the morning and at night and highly recommend this product.  What a find!!!!!
