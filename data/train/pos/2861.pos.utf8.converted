This is the first time I've tried sea vegetables and I just love these.<br />They have just the right amount of crunch with no taste and they're good for you. I use them on my salad.  They take the place of croutons, crackers or any bread.  Easy to use, just rinse and throw in a salad. Haven't tried them any other way yet. Will definely buy again.
