For the purpose of food, "organic" means raised or cultured without the use of pesticides and other chemicals.  It does not mean "raised in a mythical land without pollution" or even "good for you."  Lotus Foods looks to be a California company so my guess is that this was certified organic in the US, not China.  The objections of the other reviewer are silly -- sure, Chinese cities are polluted, and the country has many other problems, but this does not mean every kernel of rice from this vast expanse of geography is inedible.  I have eaten this rice and I love it; it has a great flavor and texture, and it holds together well if you want it to.  Its green color is visually pleasing.  And it is no more inherently unsafe based on being from somewhere in China than a carrot from North Carolina inherently tastes like cigarettes.
