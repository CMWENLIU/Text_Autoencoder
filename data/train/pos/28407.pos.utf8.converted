Ariana Coconut Butter is better than I imagined it could be!!! And I thought I liked peanut butter. Wow. This coconut butter is like food from heaven or something.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a way to incorporate more coconut oil into my diet. I'm definitely adding this product to my staple foods list! It is so delicious, I think I could eat a whole jar in one sitting! I haven't tried melting it, or using it as an ingredient. So far, I just can't stop eating it right out of the jar.<br /><br />I have never tasted other coconut butters, so I can't compare this one with other brands. I just know this is so good.
