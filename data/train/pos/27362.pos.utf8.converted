I like using protein bars for breakfasts on the go and as meal supplements, so I'm always looking to find new ones that are healthy AND taste great.  Kashi's GOLEAN bar in the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie flavor is my latest discovery.  The tasty bar really is reminiscent of an oatmeal cookie, with a similar chewy texture.  It also offers 13 grams of protein--not as high as some sports-marketed bars, but still very good--and a whopping 6 grams of fiber (more than All Bran bars!).  An added bonus is the 10% RDA of Calcium, and finally, like all Kashi products, these bars are made with seven whole grains.  Definitely a recommended addition to any healthy diet!
