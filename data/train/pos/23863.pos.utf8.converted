Yes, I must admit that I first heard about lingonberry anything from the Dr. Oz show.  He made a smoothie with this jam and some soy milk and other ingredients, which I have since forgotten.  Ordered from Amazon.com (where else) and it arrived practically overnight.  Couldn't find Oz's recipe but this jam makes bagels and English muffins absolutely delicious!  Better than blueberry, strawberry, orange marmalade....  I should have bought a dozen jars instead of two.  If Oz says is good for me, that's fantastic but as far as I am concerned, this jam has now become a daily breakfast staple.  Thanks.
