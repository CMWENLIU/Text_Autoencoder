I see that there are presently 30 reviews for this Hodgson Mill Barley Bread Mix, so why, you may ask, do we need another?<br /><br />Glad you asked. I ordered this bread for a few reasons:<br /><br />1) To save a few bucks over store bought<br /><br />2) To always have on hand in pantry<br /><br />3) To enjoy the aroma of fresh baked bread in my home<br /><br />When it was time to bake this bread, I proofed the yeast & it bubbled up.  Just what you want to see. I kneaded the dough for the time stated, & covered it as instructed. When I checked it after 1 1/2 hrs., it had not risen at all, yet I had done all the right things. So I punched it down, fitted it flat onto a quarter size sheet pan, sprinkled it w/rosemary, garlic, black pepper & extra virgin olive oil.<br /><br />It turned out a delicious flatbread, but what went wrong?<br /><br />I called Hodgson Mill, turns out my house temp. of 64 degrees is good for the heat bill but not for bread. The rep was great, told me to preheat oven to 200 deg. for 2 min. then turn off oven. Let dough rise in oven.<br /><br />Great bread mix, fast delivery by Amazon, fair price & great customer service. I am sold.<br /><br />Just ordered more. You should too.  Enjoy your bread.
