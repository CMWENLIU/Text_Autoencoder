Great teff flour for making a teff pancake that I eat with everything from stews, to eggs, to cheese, to ethiopian style vegetables.  I mix it with slightly more that half filtered water, and let ferment in a 1-1/2 quart covered glass casserole until real bubbly, with a touch of salt and a bit of oil.  The trick is in the fermenting.  I keep using the old batch as starter and it gets better and ferments faster after several time. (Once you get your starter, it will ferment faster.)  I also find the pancake is lighter if you start in the center and spiral the dough as you pour it into a hot pan.  If you need it a touch lighter add a pinch of backing soda. Its easy, has more protein and fiber than wheat flour.
