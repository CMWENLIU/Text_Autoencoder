During shipment, the lid detached, leaking the contents of the starter culture. Contacted the seller who immediately responded. Received a personal note stating they would replace the item, that they had identified the container flaw, and had already implemented a new process to ensure it wouldn't happen again in the future. Later the same day, was surprised to receive an email that they had additinally credited my account $10 for delay in receiving (based on original order date, not replacement date). Very impressed. This is how customer service used to be and what every company should strive for. I predict success for this company. Would gladly do business with them in the future. About the product, it is a culture.  I had these growing in my kitchen when I lived in Poland and Russia. Very straightforward and easy to use.....when it arrives (live I hope!) it will do the job.
