Been eating this cereal for about a year now. For a couple of years I had been eating a brand that's sold in our area, but it was not organic. Once I saw this on amazon I had to try it. I eat it five to six mornings a week. I substitute once or twice a week with organic eggs, cheese & vege's. When I eat this cereal I mix it with organic frozen blueberries & a banana. What a way to start the day. My blood work at my last yearly physical was excellent, and my doctor let me know. I'm 52 years old and abused my body for 25 years with drugs and alcohol. I now live a clean life, spirit, mind, & body and this product fits right in. Have plans to try a few more of Bob's products in the future.
