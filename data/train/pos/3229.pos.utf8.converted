My 15 yr old cat was diagnosed with kidney disease a couple months ago and upon my vet's suggestion I began feeding kitty the Prescription Diet K/D wet and dry food.  My cat stopped eating the wet food all together after about a week (the dry food wasn't touched from the start) and started losing weight which was concerning.  I tried the Hi-Tor Neo Diet after reading the good reviews on Amazon.  I'm pleased to say my cat eats the Hi-Tor (my cat didn't care for the vita gravy stuff) so I didn't have to resort to force feeding (thank goodness!).  I'd definitely recommend the Hi-Tor as it's low protien and it's more palatable than the K/D.
