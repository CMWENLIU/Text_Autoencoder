I have been buying this by the quart directly from Tropical Traditions for years, waiting until it is on sale with free shipping and stocking up. We use it for cooking and as a skin moisturizer. We first began using it for popping Orville Redenbacher popcorn in a stir popper because it adds such a wonderful taste and smell to the popcorn and helps keep it crunchy. We sprinkle it with freshly ground pink Himalayan Sea Salt. It tastes wonderful, just the way movie theater popcorn used to when they popped it in coconut oil. We learned that coconut oil had wrongly gotten a bad rap for being a saturated fat, when it truth it is healthful, so I started finding more ways to use it. I like to make an oil saturated toast using a whole grain bread and browning it on both sides in a skillet - sometimes using olive oil instead or using a combination. It makes a quick, tasteful, and healthy appetite suppressant. The coconut oil makes it brown more evenly than olive oil as well as have a lighter coconutty taste. Sometimes I top it with a fried egg lightly cooked in the same oil. Recently I tried topping it with a dollop of strawberry preserves and topping that with a couple of tablespoons of chia seeds [which I recently learned are a "superfood" for health with calcium, fiber, and omega 3 fatty acids]. It was delicious and most nutritious! It also keeps the appetite at bay for several hours, which is just one more benefit. Have I mentioned that coconut oil does not turn rancid!<br /><br />It also makes a wonderful skin moisturizer and I use it daily. For convenience I transfer a portion of it into a small plastic screw cap container for the bathroom and take it with me when traveling. I daily put a small amount under my eyes to keep the skin smooth and wrinkle free. Whenever my skin feels dry and itchy, I apply a small amount and smooth it in and the itch is gone. Solves the problem! [My dermatologist recently said, "You look wonderful!" Then repeated it.] Life is good...<br /><br />This is my story and I'm sticking to it!
