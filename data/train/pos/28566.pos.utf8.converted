I had this once and its an amzing tea. This is the 2nd Dilmah tea i have had and i think they have a winner. THis tea refreshed me and gave me such energy that i fiund myself revitalized.<br /><br />I will surely recommend this Tea.<br />You can either brew it in warm water and add sugar or you can also add a dash of milk while brewing.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Vikram
