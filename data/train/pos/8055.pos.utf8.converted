I use these frequently.  Calorie and carbohydrate free, but just as filling as spaghetti.  Although they don't taste like standard pasta, they're a wonderful substitute for when you have carb cravings.  The fishy smell rinses right away and they absorb the flavor of the sauce.  A little on the strange side with texture - 'rubbery' sounds worse than it is, but I can't figure out another description.  Still really enjoy them.  I use udon seasoning packets or boullion usually, but pasta sauce works well. I find that if you rinse and prepare them, then allow to sit an hour or so to absorb the flavor, it works really well.  Toss them in the microwave and voila!  Great product.
