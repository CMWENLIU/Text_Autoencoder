Vita Coco Coconut Water has become a vital part of my day. A few months ago, I read that Vita Coco has 15 times more electrolytes than any sports drink on the market. However, I do not consider this drink just a sports drink. For example I have swapped my morning coffee with a 100% pure Vita Coco. Unlike drinking coffee and than crashing, Vita Coco makes me feel energized throughout the day! Whenever I make breakfast smoothies, I always use Vita Coco. Below is a great recipe to try!<br /><br />3 cups frozen strawberries<br />1 banana (or 1 cup of blueberries)<br />1 cup Vita Coco (I use 100% pure)<br />1 cup of icecubes (optional)<br /><br />Place all ingredients in a blender and puree well. Add more Vita Coco if needed for smoothier consistency. Too easy, too good!<br /><br />I swear by this drink. I used to get cramping in my muscles and shin splints after running...but when I drink this before and after my run, I do not feel any pain....<br /><br />Simply put when I drink Vita Coco, I feel more refreshed and healthier. So thanks for making such a great product!
