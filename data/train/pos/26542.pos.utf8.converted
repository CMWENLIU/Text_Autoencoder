I grew up with carob. I love it, I'm used to the toasted kind and didn't know that raw was available until now. Now that I've tried the raw version I won't go back. The raw flavor is lighter, more friendly and just tastes smoother on the tongue to me. With any carob powder know that it gets everywhere when measuring it so just be extra careful and gentle with it and you'll be okay. If you like carob powder try this version! You might be pleasantly surprised!
