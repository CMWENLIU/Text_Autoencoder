I got my first bonsai back in 1973, and I know quality when I see it.  The trident maple bonsai forest which I received from them was definitely high quality - beyond what I expected.<br /><br />I highly recommend them to anyone - new or experienced - looking to buy a bonsai forest which is truly a work of art.<br /><br />I thank you sincerely.....Mike
