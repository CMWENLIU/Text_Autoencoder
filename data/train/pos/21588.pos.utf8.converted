These blueberry biscuits have a wonderful crunch and a strong blueberry smell and flavor that is great.  All natural ingredients and a convenient, healthy way to start my day.  Easy to take on the road in the am. Each pouch has 4 biscuits. Just enough for a quick snack. Better prices at the grocery store right now because of the shipping costs. I hope Amazon puts these on the subscribe and save list so we can stock up! YUM!
