My cousin sent me home with a sample packet of this stuff (I was having problems losing weight and my battle with sugar was severely hindering my goals). I remember thanking her and thinking about her words of "It has no after-taste AND is all-natural", I thought "YEAH, right!" and didn't try it until about 3 months later.<br /><br />I thought, with the name "Xylitol" that it HAD to be a chemical compound, but because she was into all-natural health like me AND she is super tiny, that she must not be lying!<br /><br />Who knew that such a tiny packet could finally change my life. I am finally optimistic in my battle of the buldge because now, there is not only an alternative sweetener to sugar, but that it is absolutely VOID of ANY after-taste AND actually anti-bacterial??!!!<br /><br />I ramble, but seriously, I am chewing the ("Spry") gum that Xlear sent me as a sample after purchasing this 5lb bag of Xlyo-Sweet and what a yummy piece of gum! My mouth feels clean, even after 8 in the morning and having my 'sweetened' cup of coffee, they almost feel like I just hopped out of the dentist chair!<br /><br />Xlear is new to Amazon and they want to widen their customer base, so I am going to go give them a good review, as I received my order SUPER fast AND with sample gum :-)
