I have just recently purchased the Woodstream Corp 0610 gopher trap, and  within 10 minutes of laying the traps i was catching  gophers. This product  is the best i have ever used. The 0610 gopher trap is easy to set and works  with great success. Also, remember to use a wire attached to the trap and  tie it to a steak to prevent gophers from dragging the trap further into  their hole once they are caught. I hope you find this product as easy to  use as i did, Good luck.
