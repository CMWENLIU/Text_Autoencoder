I got a Tin for Christmas from my wife.  I did not know what to think as I have never heard of Chocolate Tea...  We prepared a few cups for some friends and were very pleasantly surprised.  The rich aroma of chocolate in a cup.  MORE enticing is the smooth texture of this magical elixer... It is truly a nectar of the gods... If you don't believe me check out the buzz from other reviewers and tea bloggers...
