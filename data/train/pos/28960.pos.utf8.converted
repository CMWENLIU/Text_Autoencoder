I have been eating these for years now and I absolutely love them!  They're good with salsa, hummus, or alone.  The other Glenny's crisps are just too salty for me, but these are perfect.  I will continue to buy cases of these here at Amazon (best price!).<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  The nutritional information here at Amazon is what is on the bag, but just be aware that it is for ONE SERVING and the 1.3 oz bag contains TWO servings.
