Why are five stars "the best" when B&M Brown Bread in a can is so much better?  This star system must be flawed.  I suppose that if you're reading this you already know of the manna under discussion.  If, however, you haven't tried canned brown bread, please stop reading and get to your local B&M dispenser.  It is clearly in your interest.
