Glace de Viande Gold in a classic brown stock reduction.  It can be reconstituted into a full flavored stock by using 1 part glace to 20 parts water.  The stock is great for moistening stuffing, making soups or making a jus for dipping.  The flavor is much more complex and professional tasting than other prepared stocks and broths found in most grocery stores.<br /><br />A glace is traditionally made by reducing stock veal stock for 8-12 hours until it has the consistency of a thick syrup.  To bring this product to the consistency of a classic glace add 1 part de Viande Gold to 3 parts water. I use the glace for adding flavor to sauces when I don't want any extra thickening agent.  If I want the flavor of a glace but also want it to help hold a sauce together I use More than Gourmet's Demi-Glace Gold which is pretty much the same thing but it contains a roux.<br /><br />These products last for months in the frig so I purchase these in the 16 oz. tubs.  For some of the glaces and stock reductions that I use less frequently I purchase the 1.5 oz. pucks.  They are made using classic recipes and are the real deal.  I keep 8-10 different varieties on hand in my kitchen and would not want to think about cooking without them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010OQQ2Q">More Than Gourmet Demi-glace Gold
