I ordered this on a whim after reading the reviews and I was not disappointed! This sugar is so flavorful you won't want to go back to using regular brown sugar. The only problem you'll have is trying not to eat it! Sometimes I find myself sneaking teaspoons from the bag :P  I use it regularly in coffee, oatmeal, etc. and I can't wait to try baking with it. Someone here mentioned it's the secret ingredient in their chocolate chip cookies. My mouth is watering just imagining how yummy that would be. Try this sugar - you will be amazed!
