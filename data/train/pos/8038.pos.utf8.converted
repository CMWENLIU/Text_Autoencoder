I prefer this hemp powder over the Living Harvest brand.  The Navitas hemp protein powder is a much finer grind, almost a powder, which makes it much easier to blend into drinks and smoothies.  I also appreciate that it has a higher protein content: 50% rather than the 43% the Living Harvest brand boasts.  It costs a little extra, but I think it's a much better product.
