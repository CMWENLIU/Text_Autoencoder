I agree with the other reviewer--this might be a bit pricey but the flour is very finely ground and yields excellent results!  If you use a lot, it might be cheaper to buy directly from the manufacturer, but otherwise Amazon's price is pretty good considering the free shipping.  The other almond flour I used was Honeyville--this brand is finer and much preferred!
