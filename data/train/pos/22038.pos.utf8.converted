I have spent a while trying to find the perfect snack bar, and my search ends here. I've tried Luna, Odwalla, Balance, Power Bars, Quaker, Nature Valley, Cliff, and Kind bars, all of which are too sweet and taste funny to me. This one tastes almost exactly like its ingredients: a whole bunch of nuts, some seeds, and a little fruit. They find some magic way to stick them all together with the minimum possible amount of sugar (6g, as opposed to 17 or more). It's like a bag of trail mix in bar form--heavenly.<br /><br />But you should also know that each bar is quite small -- closer in size to a Kind bar than an Odwalla. That said, the low amount of sugar makes them more filling and satisfying.
