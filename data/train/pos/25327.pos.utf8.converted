A long-ago discovery for me, Roastaroma will always be a regular in my favorite teacups, alongside other Celestial Seasonings stars. Roasted barley and chicory combined with cocoa-copycat carob, hint of something similar to mocha for those who wish to avoid coffee and even chocolate; and the touches of cinnamon, allspice and star anise gives this brew an extra special lift. For those who wish to add a little cocoa to the mix before adding your brand of milk or cream to top it off, this perfect blend is a lovely pick-me-up any time of the day or night, and particularly throughout the cooler months when a warm cup of something special comforts the soul.<br />Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author<br /><br />P.S.
