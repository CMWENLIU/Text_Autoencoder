This is a delicious salt-free mustard for those of us watching our sodium intake. You could probably serve this to anyone and they wouldn't even realize it's salt free. I have been having some trouble finding low sodium/low cholesterol snack options (suggestions welcome and appreciated!), but this with some salt free pretzels makes a great snack that doesn't make me feel like I'm depriving myself. I'd still like to find something with a spicier mustard flavor, but this is a good basic mustard with a lot of flavor.
