Claxton fruitcake is so very good!  I love slices of it with coffee at Christmas.  The taste is perfect.  What I am going to say may seem a little strange, but I delight in the texture of it.  I like to chomp on the pecans, and I like the way the cherries feel when I dig my teeth into them.  It is fruitcake like no other.<br /><br />This fruitcake has been a well-received gift sent to my family for many years from beloved cousins.
