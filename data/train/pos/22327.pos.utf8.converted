I've been composting for several years, and bought one of those crocks that sits on the counter.  I just put things in the crock and carried them out to the compost for years.  But every time, you then have to wash out the messy, stinky crock.  With these bags, the mess (and stink) is greatly reduced.  I just put a folded paper towel in the bottom (to catch juices) and then the bag.  When it is full it comes out of the crock much better than loose scraps.  I started using them last year, and when I turned the compost this summer there was no trace of the older bags so they DO biodegrade as stated.  The only thing I wish is that they were a little smaller; they are so big they stick out of the crock quite a bit and it seems wasteful.
