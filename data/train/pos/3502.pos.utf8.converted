I'm extremely pleased to see Amazon offering this cereal. Alpen (No Sugar Added version) is the best muesli available in Britain. Believe me, I've tried most of them (British expat). And your American mueslis don't come anywhere close to the deliciousness of this. Swiss-style muesli in general is much easier to eat than traditional muesli - mainly due to the fact that it softens in milk much faster and it includes whey powder which makes it a little sweeter and creamier when you add milk. I've tried a few other brands of Swiss-style muesli and this one beats the lot. It has just the right amount of raisins and nuts in it. :-)<br />A perfect breakfast, can't wait to eat it again!
