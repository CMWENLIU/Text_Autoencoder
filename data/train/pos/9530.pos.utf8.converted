I use this to put on my psoriasis to help keep the skin layers down and itching away. Has worked very well. I would recommend to anyone who is tired of all the prescription and over-the-counter endless, useless topicals that are out on the market today. I have had psoriasis for 20 years and have tried several chemotherapy treatments, one almost killed me. So, I'm going all natural. I also soak in Dead Sea salt baths three to four times each week to help keep the layers and itching down. It has changed my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
