This is a wonderful product.  I am buying another case tonight to take advantage of the great price.  My son was amazed at what an improvement this product is over the Kraft products. The sauce is similar in consistancy to Alfredo and the pasta is fabulous.  The pasta holds up to cooking and mantains it's al dente consistancy. Amazing what plain and simple ingredients produce. Great product.
