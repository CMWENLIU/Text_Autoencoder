It all began in the summer of 2010 when my brother could no longer handle the border collie I had bought for my nephews' 10th Birthday. The dog, Oreo, had destroyed all of the plants and flowers in his back yard and was close to being sent to the pound. Times were rough so when he offered me $100 to take Oreo back, I jumped at the opportunity.<br />  BIG MISTAKE! I already had a dog and had installed a doggie entrance in my back door, so short of tying Oreo up in my back yard, she had full reign of my property. Not a day went by when I would come home from work and find something missing or chewed to bits. My CD collection, DVD collection, appliance power cords, furniture, shoes, remote controls, plants, etc., etc.!!! If I were to put a price on the damage she caused, it would be $1,000 to $2,000 minimum! I tried spraying vinegar as well as commercial products to save my new furniture but nothing worked.<br />  The dog whisperer had a busy schedule so it dawned on me to try Trivedi water. This miraculous water had helped me with digestive problems and I was hearing about all the other wonderful things credited to Trivedi infused water. I filled Oreo's water bowl for three days straight with Trivedi water. That's all it took!!!<br />  After the third day, Oreo COMPLETELY stopped her destructive behavior! Every now and then she would take one of my shoes to the living room but would NOT chew it!:) I have continued to give her Trivedi water every now and then and she has become one of the sweetest, most well-behaved dogs I have ever owned! It has reached a point where I believe we are psychically connected. She is extremely intelligent and intuitive and has evolved into a wog...half woman/half dog! (haha!)
