If you like honey, you are going to love this one. It is incredible, awesome and gorgeous. It is so good, you are not going to want to 'waste' this honey over toast bread. I eat it with teaspoon ever day and night, sometimes put a tiny bit of it in my home-made oatmeal reduced in organic milk and stir it together. Oh my god, it turns my oatmeal to the best recipe on Earth! I have not yet received a single negative or even a so-so reference from any of the people around me who has tasted this honey.<br /><br />A shopping tip: Due to its unique and wonderful taste, and the pretty package, it makes one of the best gifts for honey lovers. Two of these together makes a better Christmas gift than useless & cheap electronics or textiles.
