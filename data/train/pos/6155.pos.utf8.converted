This just came out and I found it at a Duane Reade store in NYC. I love Vita Coco (EXCELLENT hangover cure and workout recovery drink after capoeira!) Since I grew up with a mom who was obsessed with Guava Nectar- I was pleasantly surprised to find that this drink tastes a lot like the exotic juices my mom always had at the house! I was afraid it was going to be more Hawaiian Punch, but, as hoped, Vita Coco stayed true to form and actually made an authentic Tropical Fruit Coconut Water flavour! Yum Yum Yum!
