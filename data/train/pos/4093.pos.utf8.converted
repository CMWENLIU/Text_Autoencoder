When I came across this Amish Country Popcorn I thought, well why not have some fun and diversity for a change. Ol' Orville looks like a fun-loving guy, so he would agree I'm sure. Heck, he is probably living in Malibu, floating in his horizon pool with his companion Bonita...<br /><br />Started out with the smallest variety, the Ladyfinger. Tiny yellow kernels pop into tiny tender popcorns. Hardly a hull, nothing sticks in your teeth. Harder to eat because of the small size. Cute and delicious. Little kids would like this, cooked just for them.<br /><br />Next was the Baby White. These barely yellow kernels are sort of medium size and like the Ladyfinger variety have little in the way of hulls and are very tender. A quality choice and easier to eat because it pops up larger. Probably more like popcorn from the old days.<br /><br />Lastly, the Purple. Most seem to like this the best. Full size and easy to eat. Again, not too much in the way of hulls. The kernels are purple and they pop to white with purple flecks. Attractive and full size, easy to eat. Nice sort of nutty taste, although popcorn is pretty mild stuff no matter what brand you get.<br /><br />I used a Whirly Pop, a device I recommend. Coat the bottom with olive oil, almost cover the bottom with seeds, turn the heat up to around medium (not too low) and slowly turn the crank. Stop when the popping stops, as it does pretty abruptly, and pour it into a bowl. I season with sea salt and ground pepper. For the butter part, I mix about a small spoonfull of real butter with a slug or three of olive oil, heated together in the micro. Definite butter flavor without all the fat. Not a bad compromise at all.<br /><br />All varieties popped almost completely, not many duds.<br /><br />This makes a great breakfast, takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />This popcorn is advertised as from Amish country and presumably is more a traditional style of corn, maybe a heritage variety, not a genetically modified product like Orville's. This is a controversial subject, important to many people and this product is an alternative to "Corporate Popcorn" for them.
