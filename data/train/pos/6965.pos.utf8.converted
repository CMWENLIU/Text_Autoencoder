I love Sesmark Rice Thins!  I have intolerances to wheat, dairy, soy and eggs.  So, finding a cracker that does not contain either of these are hard.  So, I found out about Sesmark about 5 months ago and every since then, I have been hooked.  So, if you have intolerances but still crave something crunchy, slightly salty, then the Sesmark Rice Thins are for you.
