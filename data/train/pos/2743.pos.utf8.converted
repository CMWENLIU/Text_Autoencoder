About ten years ago I had the priviledge of going to Emilio Romano and enjoyed visiting the place where the famous Balsamic vinegar was brewed and stored and to see the way they aged it in all the wooden casks.  I brought home a b ottle of the real thing (over $100.)<br />and let a few friends have a tiny taste.  At their tasting room they served it on strawberries and even ice cream.  Amazing.<br /><br />Five years ago I was introduced to Villa Manadoro and was ecstatic with the quality and consisteny.  This past holiday season we splurged and ordered two bottles and have no regrets.<br /><br />If you travel I highly recommend a trip to Emilio Romano.  Parmesano Reggiano being processed and aged.  The cheese is  periodically lifted off of its four story rack by a robot which washes and dries it and puts it back in its nest.  There was more than one robot although I dont know how many.  It is a huge storage facility as you can imagine having to be aged for so long.  We were taken on a truffle hunt.  Olive oil comes out of a ceramic tile wall with what appears to be a gasoline hose and nozzle.  The natives would stick the nozzle into an empty gallon jug and out came olive oil.  Ingenious!  We got to visit farmhouses and made pasta several times.  The yolks on all the eggs were bright orange insted of pasty yellow.  And of course espresso machines in almost every building, even in the convent we stayed at.  It was coin operated but quite good.  The nuns were putting their quarters in.  Too cute!<br /><br />Bon voage!  Hope you get to go.
