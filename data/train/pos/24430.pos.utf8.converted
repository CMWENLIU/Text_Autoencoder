I love coffee, but I also love not having to messing with the coffee maker sometimes. This instant espresso is the best I have tried and I have tried about 7 different brands.  I do not drink it plain, I use it in iced coffee drinks, frappes or mochas.<br /><br />Not overly acidic at all, I find that if I drink it on an empty stomach that I don't get a tummy ache like brewed coffee can sometimes induce.<br /><br />It melts instantly in hot water (no sand dunes left swirling at the top if your cup), is lightweight so it travels wonderfully (a godsend on backpacking trips) and is very versatile to have around for cooking:<br /><br />-- I but a tsp. in a batch of brownies to deepen the dark chocolate flavor<br />-- I put a Tbs in a BIG batch of chili to compliment the spices and add extra richness<br />-- I add a bit to Mexican mole sauce for punch<br />-- I also put it in: chocolate icing, truffles, chai tea with milk for a java chai latte, coffee drink mixes for extra umph, etc.<br /><br />It is over 5 bucks a jar at some supermarkets, when/if you can even find it, so it is nice to know it is cheaper at amazon!
