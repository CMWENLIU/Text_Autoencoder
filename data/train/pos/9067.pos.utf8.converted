These are tasty on their own but i especially like them crushed, tossed into some yogurt with some blueberries or bananas. The only problem with this is that even in bulk Amazon is expensive. When they are on sale it's usually 2 dollars per box so the equivalent quantity to what they offer here is 12 boxes which would be 24 dollars. Amazon is selling it for 33 dollars.
