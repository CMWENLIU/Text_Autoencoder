Adopted a 11 month  scrawny. brown, gold eyed, semi-long haired, himalayan kitty from the pound 3 years ago. Who would give up such a beautiful cat? Within two days we found out why. Two to four inch long brown poop like lines throughout the house on beige carpet. Upon careful examination discovered this poop-like substance was partially digested cat food and hairballs. Once we bought a cat comb and various hairball treatments, that didn't work, we tried Friskies hairball treats. Finally something that works. We played with dosages for awhile and Tasha needs 8 hairball trears every day. Now have a healthy, happy cat.
