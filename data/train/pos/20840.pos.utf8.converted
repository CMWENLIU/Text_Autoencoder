These have to be the very best beans in the world. They are made up with protein and fibre and some carbs for the flavor. They cook in less time than other beans and with ham chips cooked in, there won't be any leftovers. Bob's Red Mill gives you receipes with your order and that is a big plus. Most suppliers want you to sent to them for the the receipes. I will be buying from them as long as they sell beans.
