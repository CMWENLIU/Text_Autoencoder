It's pretty hard to say which brand-name peanut better is butter... er, butter is better! Personally, any difference between Skippy and Jif isn't one I notice, both taste really good, though more people I know seem to like Skippy better. This is a quality peanut butter that spreads nicely and has a good flavor, whether by itself or with bananas, jelly, or crackers.
