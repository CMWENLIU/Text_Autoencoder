I gotta say, this stuff is amazing! I've had acid reflux for a long time and I've tried a ton of different meds to fight it. They all help, but never seem to stop it completely. Within a day of taking this honey, I was already feeling relief. I take a spoonful once a day and my stomach thanks me by not acting up. I usually buy 2 at a time so I'm not without. Highly recommend anyone with stomach issues to give this a try. I also gave some to my girl friend when she was coming down with a sore throat and it stopped it in it's tracks! This stuff rocks!
