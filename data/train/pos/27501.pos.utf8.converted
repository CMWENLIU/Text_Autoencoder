Organic Valley is known as one of the more reputable organic milk companies. I was very happy to find the product here on Amazon as it is very hit or miss finding this in my local grocery stores. The price is also cheaper here than in my local store. There servings are a great size, just right for a children's snack. The chocolate is my favorite as well as one of my little ones. I love that when I need a "chocolate fix" I can grab one of these and not feel guilty. The taste and quality are great. The shelf life is around 4 months in the ones I have received. I love that I can get them delivered regularly through the subscribe and save program. We purchase all 4 flavors and my kids drink them all. The box of 12 does not take up a lot of shelf space, which is really good. While they taste best when cold, they can remain in the pantry, on the shelf, etc. with no problem. Its nice that I can have a healthy drink for my kids when we are on the go (although they should not be kept in the hot sun).<br />Just a really great product that is relatively healthy, taste very good, has good sturdy packaging, and the company is repuatable and honest with their labeling (something that isn't true for many "organic" companies).
