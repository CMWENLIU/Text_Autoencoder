I have been using Nido for several months now.  I wanted a powdered milk that would dissolve nicely in cold water and this one does it perfectly. I bought it originally for baking, but it has become so popular in my household that I don't even bother to buy milk or half and half anymore.  Great to drink alone or in your coffee and makes a tasty hot chocolate mix, better than any of those on the market today.
