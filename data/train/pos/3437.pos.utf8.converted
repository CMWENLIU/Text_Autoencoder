I don't take tea lightly, so I was not prepared to be impressed by pod tea that I couldn't look at before it was brewed. Thankfully, I was wrong! We have a big honking cabinet stuffed to the rafters with loose leaf tea, and are known to wax political on the stuff and nonsense dust they pass off as 'tea bags'. Just shaking the K-cup I knew the tea inside was powdery, not whole leaf, so I had my criticism all lined up.<br /><br />But wow - it really does brew a nice cup. It's a great choice if you don't want to fuss with filling your own tea bags, loading a steeper, timing the steep, etc. Just pop in the pod and you have a surprisingly full of character cup of perfect breakfast tea. It doesn't have the cheap taste of diner lipton or red rose bagged tea, it's a fine cup that I'd be proud to serve to company. It brews up at just the right darkish-brown shade in our B50 unit, not too watery and not too strong.
