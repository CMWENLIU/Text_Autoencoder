Like so many others, we love bacon but must avoid it for health reasons. So when we heard of this product -- and its companion spread, Baconnaise -- we ordered every flavor made, for ourselves and for gifts to family and friends, from Amazon and from the company website.<br /><br />We weren't disappointed. Every flavor is authentically, satisfyingly "bacony". And despite the name, it's not at all salty; low-sodium versions are available, which means bacon lovers (even vegetarians) can satisfy their yearnings without the health risks associated with heavy animal fats.<br /><br />BTW, one thing we especially appreciate about Bacon Salt's makers (two high-tech guys who, over a meal, confessed that they'd always wished everything could taste like bacon, then funded their venture with $10K won on "America's Funniest Home Videos") is their "Operation Bacon Salt," in which orders shipped from the company to APO addresses sell for half-price. It's refreshing to find a firm that will not only ship to APO addresses (not all do), but will actually do something generous for our men and women who serve in the military. It's a cool (and legal) way, too, to get that lovely, bacony flavor to military personnel who serve in countries where bacon and other pork products are not permitted.<br /><br />Try all the flavors. And try the yummy Baconnaise, too; it comes in regular and "lite" versions, and lets you make a low-calorie, low-sodium, zero cholesterol BLT that will just about make any bacon-lover's day. It's also wonderful on a baked potato.<br /><br />We have no commercial interest in the company, and do (and will continue to do) most of our shopping on Amazon. We're just big fans of Bacon Salt products, happy to see their products available here.
