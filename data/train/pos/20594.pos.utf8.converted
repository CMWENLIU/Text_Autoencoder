I'll admit it, I'm a bit of an almond addict.  And Love N' Bake Almond Paste is the best out there, and is simply a must have for baking almond cookies like pignolis and deeply almond flavored cakes.  It's the brand most often mentioned in cookbooks I trust, and for good reason.  If you're making a recipe that calls for almond paste, use this type, which is smooth and creamy (and good enough to be eaten right out of the can!) as opposed to grocery store brands which are drier and more crumbly.  Also, buying in this three pack saves you money over the individual price of one of these cans.
