I've been dieting for so long I can't remember what high calorie/high fat food tastes like and this has become one of my simple pleasures.  Dump a pack over a little brown rice and it really has what grandpa called "stick to you ribs" qualities.  It has enough spice that I've used it layered over black beans topped with onions & cheese & told friends it was a "Mexican dip" & they LOVED it without ever suspecting it was good for them. (ha-ha).  There are other Tasty Bite dishes that are quite good but in my opinion, this is the best and quite versatile.
