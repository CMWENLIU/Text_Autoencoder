Every time I bite into a Nabisco Mallomars Pure Chocolate cookie, I feel like I am eight years old again and back on what was my regular everyday staple diet of Mallomars, Twinkies and Dairy Queen ice cream.<br /><br />(Thank goodness, when I was growing up, we didn't obsess about "health" since we were just carefree, junk-food eating kids. NOTE: It seems, too, that my generation, who grew up in the 70s, died young from drug addiction, and NOT from poor junk food diets!)<br /><br />Anyway, my brain wanted to outweigh my heart intoxicated from nostalgia and say, "Hey, this stuff isn't so good for you ... how can it be? It's loaded with sugar, high fructose corn syrup AND corn syrup and, yes, artificial flavor."<br /><br />Yuk. Three stars or less.<br /><br />But, hey, a Mallomar has that just-right crunch cookie and pillowy soft topping and, oh, that chocolate ... ecstasy for the mouth, and who cares about the toxic ingredients when we're talking a great escape by overdosing on emotional eating. Yummy! Folks have been indulging on this cookie for 90 years and going strong; just wonder why consumers outside the Big Apple region, who are 70 percent of the Mallomar regulars, haven't been more enthusiastic about this ultimate comfort staple? Anyway, I just don't have the heart to rank it any less than five stars -- to me one is never enough `cause a Mallomar is always a Mallo-more, plllllease!<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn Maxwell, Journalist/Teacher/Motivational Speaker<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE
