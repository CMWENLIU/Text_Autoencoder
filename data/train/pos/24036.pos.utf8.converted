Often times you don't get what you hoped for. In the case of my ordering the large TANG containers I got the TANG that doesn't have nutrasweet or aspartame in it, just that citris that gives it that special zing. I love the original TANG and this comes the closest to it. Great for food prepping storage. This is my second order and I love it!
