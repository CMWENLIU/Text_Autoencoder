I wanted to try these peanut noodles because it sounded like they might be easier to make then the other boxed kind we've been using.  Initially I was a bit disappointed because it advised to pour in 1 cup water into noodes and dry mix, microwave 90 seconds, then drain off excess water, then add peanuts and sauce.  I didn't like having to pour off water, too messy and potential for me to burn myself.  But after a couple rounds I am able to improve procedure (for me, anyway) and instead I do this:  place noodes and dry mix into bowl (I cut up the noodles to fit into bowl better, optional!); pour in some water from the hot pot, I'm guessing approximately 1/4 cup, microwave 1 minute, stir, add sauce and peanuts, microwave 30 seconds.  Same or better results as Chun's own directions, but no messy pour-off of boiling water involved.
