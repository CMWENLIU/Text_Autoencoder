Over the course of 6 to 12 months my five year old cat had developed  loose stools and vomiting.  He got to the point that he was throwing up every day and he went from nearly 14 pounds to a low of 10.  The vet found nothing wrong with him so I started looking into his diet.  I had always fed "premium" foods like Nutro and Iams so I thought I was doing the right things.  But after researching online, I learned how misled we all are into thinking that these foods filled with corn, meat by-products and chemicals are actually good for our pets!  So I then tried lots of brands of natural food but I wasn't solving his problems until I landed on the first grain-free, high-protein food.  There was a major difference immediately!  Stools firmed up, no more vomiting at all, and he's now back up to 14+ pounds.  All three of my cats LOVE the taste of this Orijen food.  It is expensive, but they do eat less of it because in has so little filler. They all three also did well on Wellness Core, but it was obvious that they didn't like the taste.  Two out of three liked Evo, but it gave my dairy-sensitive cat loose poo, I think because it contains cottage cheese.  So this food is the all-around winner for everyone.  It has made a huge difference in the health of my cats.  This is a quality product and worth every cent!
