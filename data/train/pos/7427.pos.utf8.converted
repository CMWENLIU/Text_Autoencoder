Rose tea is so delightful, I am amazed it isn't bottled and sold in stores, or at the very least sold at high end coffee shops as a specialty item, as a lot of other teas are. Rose tea is simply that wonderful! It smells like you are standing in a field of roses and the taste is quite delicate.<br /><br />My favorite floral teas are jasmine and rose and, in my humble opinion, mixed together they make the perfect cup of tea. I take 2 jasmine tea bags and 1 rose and place them in a picture of nearly boiling water  and let them steep together for about 4 minutes. The aroma is just wonderful and the taste is so delicious my 13 year old can't get enough of it, and that's saying something for a kid who picks soda over everything else when given a choice. (he does add sugar to his tea, but I enjoy mine plain or with a dash of honey).<br /><br />On a side note, you can make a wonderful spritzer for your face (& body) using this tea.. You can look online for ideas, but the basic concept is you make your floral tea (anyway you like) and mix it with water in a spritzer bottle that you keep in your refrigerator to mist on your face during the summer and/or winter to keep your skin hydrated and it smells awesome! Another great idea that I came across online, that I love doing is a weekly tea steam facial! I take one Numi rose tea bag and one Numi jasmine tea bag, place it in a silver mixing bowl & pour boiling water into it & let it steep for 2 minutes (please be careful not to get burned) and you place a towel over your head and let the steam open your pores. After 5 to 10 minutes rinse your face with cold water to close your pores. Your face feels wonderful and the scent calms your mind.<br /><br />I love the rose tea and would highly recommend it to everyone!
