Disclaimer: My mother-in-law spoiled her sons by making them homemade pasta any time they wanted it.  It was only when my DH went of to college that he had to experience the horror of boxed pasta.  Over the years he has realized that even the best of wives does not make homemade macaroni after a long day at work, and that he needs to eat boxed pasta.  (arrrgh)<br /><br />But there's boxed pasta and some stuff that calls itself boxed pasta that is decidedly inferior.  DeCecco is about as close to homemade as you are going to get without making it yourself.<br /><br />The spaghetti is a nice, mid weight string of pasta, with a good texture, bouncing back a bit when you bite it, and having a firm semolina texture. Little or no starch bleeds off in the water, and the pasta only absorbs enough to be cooked, no mushy macaroni here! Each variety has a preferred cooking time; if you follow that with a timer, you'll always be right.<br /><br />This spaghetti is a little pricey in the grocery store, which has to buy it from an Italian importer in relatively small quantities. Because of its price, it's unlikely that it turns over quickly and you aren't likely to get the best DeCecco around. The DeCecco Spaghetti from Amazon must turn over very quickly, because I always get very fresh product for a much smaller sum than in my market. Having to buy five boxes is no hardship for us -- we could buy three times that and still eat it all up in no time.<br /><br />If you haven't tried imported Italian macaroni, do yourself a favor: buy a case of this spaghetti and treat yourself with the lightest sauce you have.  Put a teaspoon of virgin olive oil in the boiling water to minimize sticking, and cook for the exact length of time suggested on the box.  Add sauce as soon as you finish draining.<br /><br />You won't believe that this is the same kind of food that they sell as macaroni at your local market. Be sure to make plenty for everyone.
