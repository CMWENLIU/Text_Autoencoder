This is great formula, but despite scare tactics of whacko tree huggers who dropped out of school, the Hydrolized protein in this formula is made through enzyme process which does not result in MSG. There are 3 significantly different processes used in USA by mfg to hydrolize protein and just because one results in MSG, does not mean all processes do. These same size and type formulas can also be purchased elsewhere for much cheaper and instantly with no shipping charges. Check your local WallyWorld.
