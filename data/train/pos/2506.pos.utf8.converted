I had tried every remedy for my daughter's colic to no avail.  It is so distressing not to be able to soothe you child when they are obviously hurting.  My last attempt was to add tea to her formula.  I steeped the tea as instructed and added 1/2 ounce of Ginger Aid to every 6 ounces of formula (discolored formula a little).  The results were amazing!  She has gone from screaming for hours and having a look for misery on her face at most times to one of peace!  She eats better, sleeps better and is more alert during her awake hours.  The look she had on her face of discomfort all the time is now replaced with a look of relaxation. The screaming is now just bedtime fussiness.  Thank you Traditional Medicinals for this organic product!
