I had ordered this product some time ago but hadn't used it as I still had a little of the "Just Whites" product left.  I tried it the first time this week and was very pleased at the results.  It blended with the water much better that the other product I had been using, and looked and whipped up just as a fresh egg white would.<br /><br />The only negative I could add is that there was no directions for using for a small batch of whites.  I used the proportions from the "Just Whites" can and it worked perfectly with this.
