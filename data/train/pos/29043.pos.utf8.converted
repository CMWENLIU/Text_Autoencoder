I was hooked on the regular angel hair shirataki noodle pasta and I decided to try this one.  I like it even more than the regular. It has a 'softer' texture or something. It makes a quick filling meal...sometimes I just put pasta sauce over it and put a bit of parm cheese.....and it is 'just like' spaghetti!!!!  Be sure to rinse them well, as they have an odd fishy smell, unless you are making shrimp stir fry with it.....then it doesn't matter at all!<br /><br />I recommend these noodles if you are trying to cut out traditional pasta because of the carb/calorie factor!
