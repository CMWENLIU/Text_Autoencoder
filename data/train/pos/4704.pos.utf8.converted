Not only do I love the ingredients in this coffee, I love the taste. That being said, I can taste the herbs and the orange peel in this coffee so if that bothers you, you may not like it. Personally, I think it tastes great and I love the fact that it's nourishing my adrenals instead of depleting them like all other coffees.
