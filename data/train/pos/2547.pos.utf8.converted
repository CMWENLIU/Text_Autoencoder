French Market is our favorite coffee, discovered on a New Orleans trip.  Local supermarkets don't carry it or carry only small numbers.  We obtained it fast, less expensively and with free shipping through Amazon.  French Market's a robust blend (try putting a sprinkle of cinnamon on the coffee before perking) and a real 16- ounce can (unlike the 11 to 13 ounce of other brands).  It makes twice the amount of popular labels (one rounded scoop per two cups) and is a great bargain and terrific coffee.  We'll be orering again!
