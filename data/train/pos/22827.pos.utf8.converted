To start out, let me say that I simply LOVE this coffee! The local stores simply do not carry this brand any longer, and I have been doing without until I came across this item on the Internet at Amazon.com! Oh, happy days!!! Now if I could only find "pods" made by them too!<br /><br />I may not be a coffee connoisseur or guru, but I know what I like, and this beats all those HIGH PRICED Seattle based coffee houses, hands down. Plus, it's about half the price!!<br /><br />omahamike
