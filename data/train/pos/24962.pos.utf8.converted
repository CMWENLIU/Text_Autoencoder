I stumbled on these in Whole Foods and decided to buy a couple of packages.  I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I have eaten them with.  Maybe it's because I am a heck of a cook! :-) This are not pasta they ARE tofu. If you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about YOU WILL FIND IT.  I could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day!  Go ahead, try them for yourself...If you have an open mind, you will NOT be disappointed!  Also, the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. This stuff is GREAT...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping...
