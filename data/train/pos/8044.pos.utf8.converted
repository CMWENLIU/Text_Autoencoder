We are allergic to GMO corn, and it's very hard to find organic corn starch.  Whole Foods has it, but that's 1/2 hour away from us.  I use a lot of corn starch making my own quiche, sauces and puddings, so this 6 pack was perfect for us!  It's fresh, and it is sealed in an air-tight bag inside the box.
