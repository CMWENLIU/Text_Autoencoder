This is without a doubt one of the best "mac and cheese" products around.  And it is good for you too!  I noticed some negative reviews about the cheese sauce being too thin.  YOU NEED TO DRAIN THE SHELLS REALLY WELL and this will remedy that.  They are like tiny water buckets, so I stirred and shook the water out of them while they were in my collander and it did the trick.  ENJOY!
