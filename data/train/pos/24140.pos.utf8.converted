Transformed Favorite Tree with the Trivedi Blessed Water - After the San Diego Retreat -<br /><br />My story: I came home from the San Diego Trivedi Retreat and I remembered what Guruji said about wanting us to be "the happiest we could be." I had this thought in my head as I was coming out of my car and when I saw "my favorite" tree in the front lawn. I decided to convey this same message to the Japanese Red Maple tree and to the grass I walked on going to the front door as I poured the last of my Trivedi Blessed water around the base of the Japanese Red Maple and on the grass leading to the front door. Well, this year just 1 month later, the Japanese Red Maple tree has the most beautiful colored and healthy looking leaves and the most unusual beautiful arrangement of pink flowers I had not seen before. I asked my friends and family members if they ever remembered the tree producing so many pink flowers in this circle pattern ever and they all said they do not remember the tree having so many of these kind of pink flowers in this full circular pattern and so many all over the tree. Some remembered it had pink flowers here and there always, but this year they are all over the tree abundantly and each outcropping is in a beautiful and full circle pattern. The flowers are EVERYWHERE this year. ALL OVER the whole tree! Usually the flower bunches are just a few places on the tree, but after the Trivedi Blessed water; the flower bunches were so full and everywhere on the tree!!<br /><br />Also, there is a new Circle Pattern of Flowers on ONE Stem!! No one (friends, family) ever remembers seeing this beautiful circle pattern of a lot of flowers on ONE stem. Usually there are 2 to 5 flowers on a stem but here and everywhere on the tree EACH STEM had at least 500% more flowers per stem after the Trivedi Blessed water. In the past the tree never made this beautiful circle pattern of flowers per stem. Before usually there were just 2-5 flowers on a stem in a random pattern! Now there is this beautiful circle pattern of flowers we have never seen before.<br /><br />Aside from the plants, when I drink one bottle of Trivedi Blessed water daily I feel so energized and healthy. Since I have run out I see that my energy level has gone down some and I'm a little "squeaky" in my joints. I can't wait till it is in stock so I can stock up. In my opinion it is the best present you can buy yourself and any of your friends and family. I know what's going under our tree this Christmas! Maybe not the most conventional gift but my family and friends will thank me later once they start drinking it and pouring it on their plants.<br /><br />PS A neighbor asked us to watch her 2 house plants while they were gone and I used a little Trivedi blessed water that I had from my last retreat and before they could come back 3 weeks later BOTH plants are blooming!! When I asked her if she had ever seen them bloom before, she said she's had them around 5 years and had seen them bloom maybe once. Coincidence? Maybe, but I doubt it. I only used regular water and Trivedi Blessed water on her plants while they were gone. I've seen it too many times when I've poured Trivedi Blessed water on my own plants and bushes. They bloom and flower like never before. This year I used it in our flower pots on the porch and it was the first year in over 20 years that the deer actually came up on our porch (up 2 steps to a concrete porch) to eat the flowers we had planted in the flower pot. The same type of flowers we always plant only this year I used the Trivedi Blessed water in the pots. I don't eat the flowers so I don't know but there must have been something good in those flowers this year for the deer to make their way on our porch to eat them. They never did that before and it's not like the deer around here are hungry, they are all big and fat this year so in my opinion only they were going for their dessert! LOL!<br /><br />PS For more of my results with the Trivedi Blessings and water and to see the actual photos of the Red Maple tree go to thebestoftrivediblessings.com The tree story is no. 10.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this.
