The Jolly Ball toss and tug can be played with by one dog, or in my case ,as a tug toy for two.This was a replacement purchase, as the previous ball finally split after over a year of being outside and well used.My dogs are fairly large (60 lbs )and have a blast running and tugging. The ball comes in two sizes, 6" and 8".  The 6" is the size of a softball and the 8" is about as large as a bowling ball. I have both. The larger one is the favorite. The balls are hollow ,squishy, not too heavy, and the rope is the sturdiest I've seen. I highly reccomend this toy for it's durability and versitility, as it can be tossed, rolled, tugged and chewed.
