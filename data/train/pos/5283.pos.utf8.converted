Unlike most pad thai sauces, this one does NOT have fish in it.  It has an  authentic restaurant-style flavor without the animal product.  Great with wide rice noodles and some mixed veggies!<br /><br />Also try their Peanut Bake, great on Quorn brand "chicken" tenders or cutlets, and goes great with Pad Thai!
