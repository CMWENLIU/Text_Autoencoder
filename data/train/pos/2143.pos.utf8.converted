Okay, if you are familiar with and love Old Bay, these are a fantastic Old Bay potato chip.  Easily available in East Coast grocery within the Utz delivery range (Maine to South Carolina), they will always disappear quickly on any picnic table.<br /><br />No offense to the vendor here, but $36.99 (plus shipping!) for a 4-pack of family-sized bags is outrageously overpriced.  Especially when you consider you can order them directly from Utz on their web site.  There, 3 10 oz bags are $12.99, 5 10 oz bags are $20.99, and 10 10 oz bags are $39.99.  Or you could even get 60 snack bags for $17.99!  Not sure about shipping cots from Utz, but the mark-up here is definitely steep.<br /><br />If you live on the East Coast between Maine and South Carolina, just go check out your grocery store for these chips - they are well worth it.  If you're a fan out of the area, just order them from Utz.
