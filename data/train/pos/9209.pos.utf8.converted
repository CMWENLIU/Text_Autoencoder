I agree w/ others that it may be less expensive at a local health food store, but I had already put in my order at Amazon when I discovered this. I do not have access to a Whole Foods store. The flavor is a bit caramel-like and the texture is fine powder to coarse granules. It is 35 on the glycemic index, so I plan to use it on foods that I don't want to use stevia on. I haven't baked w/ it yet, but I can tell it would make wonderful peanut butter cookies and oatmeal raisin ones. I hope as it becomes more popular that it comes down from five bucks a pound to a comparable price of other organic sugars.
