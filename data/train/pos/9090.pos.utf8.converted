I started feeding my two dogs on this food a couple of weeks ago. I have a 4 year old havanese that is an extremely picky eater, and a six year old shepherd mix who has almost always been at least a few pounds overweight. I was giving them Eukanuba Naturals before this, which isn't cheap food. We have tried many different foods over the years for our havanese, and she barely eats any of them, always had to entice her, but she absolutely loves Orijen. For the first time ever she runs to the bowl and just gobbles it down. With our shepherd we have tried many different diet dog foods, and feeding her less and less, but no matter what we did she would never lose those few pounds, but after this short time on Orijen she has already lost 2 pounds. Orijen has much fewer carbs than the other foods out there, less than half the carbs of what we were feeding her, and carbs are empty calories for dogs. This food is great. My dogs absolutely love it, and I love what it is doing for them. And no gas!!
