My review is for the product, not the pricing.<br />I bought several packs for my daughter who recently had a baby. This is not for the day to day feeding but mainly for traveling, emergency bag, and the dreaded middle of the night feeding.<br />The formula seems to satisfy her more than the powdered formula does.<br />I even make sure I have some handy at my house.
