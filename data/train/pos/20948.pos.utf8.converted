Its hard to say any product is the 'best' without valid comparison.<br />Apples are apples - and brisling sardines are the best ! no question.<br /><br />Seasons 2-layer packed in olive oil are in my top 3 sardines. I eat<br />one can ever single day - and no I never tire of them. I see a lot of chatter<br />about sardines in olive oil vs. water. To me, olive oil is the way to go. The ones<br />in water are great - but remember these little guys have all the good fats so the<br />calorie savings over water and oil (assuming you pour off oil and feed the cat/dog) is<br />minimal. Oil packed taste better but have I also like the water types.<br /><br />My top 3 (all brisling) ...<br />- Seasons 2 layer in olive oil<br />- King Oscar Tiny tots in olive oil<br />- Crown Prince 2 layer in olive oil<br /><br />I have tried them all - the spring water brislings are great, as are the mustard ones.<br />You can always add your favorite condiment - mustard, hot sauce, vinegar, lemon.<br />The olive oil 2 layer ones are the best tasting, most versatile I have had.<br /><br />I do not want to pan the single layer brisling varieties - they are just a bit bigger but<br />still very tasty. In general - smaller is better ... and more expensive.<br /><br />On the cost side amazon holds its own. In most major markets in the US - they don't carry the<br />brisling sardines, and if they do they are $3 plus a can. My Walmart here in cali sometimes has<br />2 of my 3 favorites (not seasons variety). When available - walmart charges about $2.60 a can.<br />If you can get any of these varieties at 2.5 - 3.0 bucks a can stock up. They are not always<br />available.<br /><br />Enjoy - I love sardines and they have replaced my old reliable tuna. Let the tuna stock come back !<br />Sardines are ...<br />1. cheap<br />2. healthy<br />3. tasty<br />4. sustainable<br /><br />eat well - and look to the future
