This honey has a very sweet and unique taste to it. It has a thick and creamy composition, and possesses a smooth rich flavor unlike any other honey that I've tried. Interestingly, though much sweeter than other brands, it still has the same calorie values - 60 calories per 20g. The honey is packaged in a sealed container, which is placed inside the decorative metal pail. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves honey.
