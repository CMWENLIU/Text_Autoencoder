I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Lindt Chocolate, especially their Dark varieties. 85% has been my primary indulgence for awhile, with some 99% on occasion.<br /><br />Then I discovered 90%. It is truly a confection masterpiece. I expected it to be like 85% but darker or like 99% but sweeter. It isn't, it has a totally different flavor, rich in cocoa, lighter on the bitterness. I actually find it to be much smoother than 85%.<br /><br />For those that don't like Dark Chocolate, please realize that like wine, coffee and dark beer it takes a little bit of time to acquire the palate to appreciate the complex flavor. But if you go slowly, starting with 65% and going up to 70, 85% and 90% as your palate adjusts, you will discover how wonderful it can be.<br /><br />When you're starting out, don't chew on the chocolate, just let it melt in your mouth.<br /><br />I find that when I eat milk chocolate, it tastes good but it never satisfies me. Dark chocolate is different, it is rich and deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Enjoy your 90%,<br />Nicky<br /><br />p.s. This used to be much cheaper on Amazon! Now it's outright expensive. I can get 12 bars for $24 at my local supermarket.
