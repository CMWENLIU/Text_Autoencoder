Back when I was a destitute college student, I and a fellow student worked together would share canned soup and rice meals to save money. He was from India, and he had these fantastic spicy pickles that would jazz up our otherwise bland meals.<br /><br />I've searched for those pickles for 20 years and I think I've finally found them--hot mango relish!<br /><br />If you like a little spice, then you will love this relish for making your meals have more kick. It has a lot of chile powder, so it is very similar to a Chinese chile sauce, except that it has chunks of mango fruit as well. Yow! My mouth is still burning! I love it!
