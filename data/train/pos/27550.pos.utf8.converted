Dying for something prepared I could eat at work, I bought a can of this yesterday with a bunch of other new items to try, and this was the first can I opened at work. I didn't want to microwave it, so I just started eating it out of the can at room temperature. Yum.<br /><br />It's flavorful, creamy, somewhat chewy, has a variety of different textures in it. (I'd look at it to give you a better description, but I ate it all, and I scarfed it down so fast I wasn't caring too much what it looked like.) It's spicey enough to have some kick, creamy enough to be nurturing, and varied enough to make you feel you've eaten an entree. It's winter now, and this is particularly satisfying. It was so good, I starting surfing for recipes to see if I could make it at home. I don't have most of the ingredients, so back to this stuff. If I had another can, I'd eat it too.
