This product was purchased to help someone who is going though chemo.  He needed something sweet but not overly sweet to help get him though those bad days after his treatments.  I have found this product to meet that very special need.  Everyone in our family enjoyed this candy and if you are looking for something to end that sweet craving without eating a bag of sugar I highly recommend this product.
