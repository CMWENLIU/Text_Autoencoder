This is a warning: A love for good espresso is an expensive habit!!!<br /><br />I've been making my own espresso at home for 20 years. Every morning I would grind the beans, measure and tamp them into the filter, add water, steam my milk, and then wash the entire machine and repeat. I have to wake up early because this is a time consuming process. I've tried other pod machines, and they just don't make a good cup of espresso.<br /><br />I recently began using the illy Francis Francis Y1 with iperEspresso capsules, and the result is better than my manual method, and takes a little over a minute a cup.<br /><br />Generally, I take my cappuccino cup and heat an ounce of milk in the microwave for 30 seconds, use a hand frother for just a few seconds, press the button on the Y1, and in about 20 seconds it brews a 1 or 2 ounce shot of perfect espresso (you have to depress the button when you think it is finished - there is no auto shutoff). Wham, bam, done!<br /><br />As far as I know, the iperEspresso system is the only "pod" that comes close to a real cup of espresso with crema. And this crema is really a thing of beauty. If you don't know what I'm talking about, try it once and you'll understand. As someone who likes strong coffee, the dark roast is almost not strong enough, but the flavor is so well balanced. It's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet with a body worth savoring.<br /><br />This isn't cheap, and it's more wasteful than grinding your own beans. So take that into consideration. But, I've only had espresso this good in Italy. Constant trips to Italy would be very wasteful and expensive, so that's my barely rational justification.<br /><br />I'd also like to share that the Y1 seems to be the most affordable offering in illy's line of iperEspresso systems. It retails for $295, but illy offers a promotion where you can buy the Y1 for $125 when you order a minimum of 2 canisters (21 count) through illy's website (illyusa.com). There are no other requirements to fulfill. So the machine and the coffee adds up to less than the cost of the machine itself. I took advantage of this deal and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />This coffee will put a new spin on your day. Not to sound too cheesy, but I can't wait to wake up each morning and enjoy my first cup.
