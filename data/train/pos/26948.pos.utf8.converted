I originally ordered these for my sister in law, but we found they would be perfect for my mother in law who lives alone, and honey crystalizes so fast when you don't use it enough, but the flavor is really good, I tried some in my tea first day and I Loved it and plan on ordering some more :)This seems to be the only safe one (some of the foreign honey granules have a cancer warning - this one does not) thats why we picked this brand.
