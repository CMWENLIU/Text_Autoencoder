The Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast is by far the best K-Cup I have tried.  I have had my Keurig brewer for about a year now and I have bounced around from brand to brand sampling the different coffees to find one that really speaks to me.  The Black Tiger may be that coffee.  I like a strong cup of coffee, but I don't want it to be bitter or taste burned.  The Black Tiger has no bitterness or over-roasted taste to it.  It is very smooth and full bodied.  I have also tried the Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and this coffee is far superior in texture, body, flavor, and strength.  I keep 3-4 different types of K-Cups near my brewer and ever since I bought the Black Tiger it is the only coffee I have drank!
