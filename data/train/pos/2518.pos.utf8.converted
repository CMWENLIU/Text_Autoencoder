I am so glad Amazon is selling this soup again because it is my favorite soup by Amy's and one of the best soups I have ever tasted! My family always comments on how wonderful it smells when I am cooking it. It's good for a light lunch or for between meals, filling but not too heavy. The light in sodium version is pretty good, too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1EO64">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Lentil Soup , 14.5-Ounce Can (Pack of 12)</a>
