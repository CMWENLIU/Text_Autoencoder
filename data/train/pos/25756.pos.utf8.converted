As a celiac, I've struggled to find good bread products. I can confidently says that Yoki provides the best (and easiest) Brazilian cheese bread mix. Chebe is another great brand for this food, but they require you to grate and mix in your own cheese (which can be good if you're looking to be creative). My one suggestion: The more homogenous your batter is, the smoother and crispier the rolls will be. Mix that dough to death! You'll get a much better end product.<br /><br />Also, if you're new to Gluten Free cooking, make use of flours like yucca and tapioca. They provide an elastic quality similar to gluten. My favorite baking flours include mixes like tapioca, potato starch, and almond or fava bean flour. You don't have to fight with those icky, dry rice flours anymore!
