Got this for my kids.  Halfway through his first box my five year old announced it was better than the stuff with the cows on it.  I agree, it is better.  On top of that, the package contains more cartons than than the organic product for less money.  Of course it's from cows not treated with rbST.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Reduced fat milk, sugar, contains 1% or less of each of the following: cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, carrageenan, salt, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin D3.<br /><br />Chocolate milk is the only dairy product that I think tastes good with carrageenan in it.  Most chocolate milks have it.  It's made from seaweed, has been a food product for centuries, and adds a nice creaminess to the drink.<br /><br />In short, great product, great price, and great for the kids (especially when traveling.)
