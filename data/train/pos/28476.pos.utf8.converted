After reading about the benefits of Indian hair care products I decided to purchase this oil.  Since using it, my hair has become stronger, more shiny, and thicker.  My best friend noticed the difference and asked me what I was using in my hair.  Since there were no Indian grocery stores where she lived I recommend she buy it on Amazon.  Great product, especially for African American or thick/coarse hair (which I have).
