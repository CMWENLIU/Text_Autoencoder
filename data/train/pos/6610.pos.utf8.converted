I live in Minnesota surrounded by people of Scandinavian descent and bland taste buds.  Since I'm of Hungarian descent, finding a good Hungarian paprika is important to me for making some of my family recipes. My mom used it for years and I did too until I ran out of the spice my mom sent to me.  This is the best paprika!
