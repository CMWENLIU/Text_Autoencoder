I purchased this from the 100% pure website directly.  They offer free shipping on orders over $50 and free samples with all orders.  I decided to purchase from this company since many of their products are organically certified (the only certification available in the world of cosmetics), so I trusted their composition.<br /><br />This eye creme is a little thick, as the previous reviewer noted.  However, when you pump it, it comes out in a needle -thin string of creme that is easy to apply!  It blends in very well.  You don't need much at all.  I don't even use a full pump for both eyes!  Any excess, I just rub on my hand since it's silky smooth.  The only thing that I'm not crazy about is the smell.  It's not quite coffee; it reminds me of a cookie.  It smells good, but it's not something that I enjoy smelling every morning.  But it's much better than having fragrances added to the product!  (That's my reason for 5-stars instead of 4-stars.)<br /><br />I don't use the creme at night, so I don't have the same problem as the other reviewer.  However, it is always a good idea to keep ALL cosmetics out of the eye!  Any cosmetic/creme (natural or not) is not healthy for the eye, and the reaction will naturally be adverse since the eye is trying to 'fight the invader.'
