I love Tex-Mex food, but haven't made tacos at home in a while for lack of being able to find "non-chemical" taco mix. This mix has a good taste (I've had my share of organic food that was much too bland for me) and is easy to use.  If you want super spicy, you may have to add a little more cayenne.<br /><br />For those of you like me who always need reminders of things to fix, don't forget yummy taco salads!!! ... or other dishes that might be good with seasoned meat added to it.<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet on tofu - for you non-meat eaters - but, I think I'll try it next! Mmmmmm.
