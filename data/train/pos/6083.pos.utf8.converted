I popped some last night and I love this popcorn. If you like large poofy kernels then this is not for you, but I like small kernel popcorns too, and this one was light and a little crunchy and had good flavor. I think the selling point of this type is that the hulls shatter when it pops ("hullless"), so that you don't get the big painful pieces of hard popcorn hull in your teeth like with larger varieties. I think the popcorn kernels have to be small to be hullless.<br /><br />If you have an air popper and find that small kernel popcorns fly out of it, you could try a different cooking method - I just pop mine in a saucepan on the stove (with a little bit of vegetable oil, and a lid to keep it from flying out), there are also air poppers that don't let the popcorn fly out, or I've seen a microwave bowl that's like air popping but with the microwave as a heat source (but no added oil or anything, like air popping), or some people even just use a paper bag in the microwave (I think with this method they use a little oil too). There are many ways to cook popcorn, and instructions are pretty easy to find on the internet if you need them.
