I'm lovin' my sourdough starter! It worked great and after babying the starter for a few weeks, I made my first loaf of bread and it came out wonderful! We make waffles and sourdough banana bread and everything has been a hit! I had so much fun making sourdough bread, I included a little story for beginners on my blog:<br />[...].<br />Blessings!
