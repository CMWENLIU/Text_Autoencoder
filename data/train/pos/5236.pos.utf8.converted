My Granny was British, a great cook (ahhhh! Granny's comfort food!!!), and just an angel on earth.  When she passed, I wanted things that reminded me of her.  I remembered her making Bird's Custard for me once, after she'd been to the British foods shop and found some.  I found it on Amazon and ordered a couple of the smaller tubs.  I made it one evening and offered some to my hubby, who doesn't care for too many sweets.  He LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this stuff.  My small tub disappeared within a week's time.  I found the double size tubs and stocked up.  My husband will eat this stuff nearly every night.  I have some dollar store salt/pepper shakers that I keep nutmeg in... I just put a few shakes of nutmeg on top (like Granny did) and it's perfect.  When I want to make a richer pudding, I'll make with some half and half or heavy cream.  That's just for special occasions (like PMS!).
