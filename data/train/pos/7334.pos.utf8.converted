This is a fantastic product! The price is great for organic rye flour -- it's at least twice as much in conventional grocery stores, if you can even find it. The packaging is great as well -- no worries about spilled flour or anything. And the flour itself is wonderful -- really delicious and fresh. I hope Amazon continues to carry this product; it's great to know I can buy 25 pounds of wonderful rye flour at a fantastic price and have it on my doorstep the next day.
