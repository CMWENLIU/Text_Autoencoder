Regular bread flour is missing some of the elastic wheat protein that produces a better quality bread.  By adding Vital Wheat Gluten to your home-baked breads, you will produce a better quality of bread--better texture, less crumbly, and more like bakery-quality bread.  Experiment with amounts; I use 1 teaspoon of Vital Wheat Gluten per cup of flour.  However, even just 1 additional tablespoon of Vital Wheat Gluten per 1.5 lb loaf of bread turns out a better loaf.  For the amount of gluten used, this item is certainly worth the cost.  Keep your gluten in the freezer to extend shelf life.
