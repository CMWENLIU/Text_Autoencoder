I ordered this product because I didn't see it locally, and I have a very easy recipe that calls for adding tuna to caponata with some garlic, parsley, lemon juice and crushed red pepper and serving it over pasta. The caponata makes the quick dish very special. The cans are tiny so a case doesn't take up much room and because it keeps so long, it makes sense to have so many on hand. Very pleased with the purchase.
