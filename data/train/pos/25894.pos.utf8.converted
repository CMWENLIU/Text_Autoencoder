I just came upon this amazing coffee holder for keurig coffees. Not only does it fit 30 coffees at a time, My Keurig fits right on top of it so it takes up a lot less space on my counter. It also makes it easier to refill the water because it is elevated. Purchase this and it will help your coffees stay neat, clean , and organized!!!
