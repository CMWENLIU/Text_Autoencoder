We've had dogs that wouldn't have a thing to do with Nylabones, but what works great is early training.  Start the puppy out on the puppy nylabones.  Follow instructions and help the pup's interest level by smearing some peanut butter on it, and so on.<br /><br />The first time we saw a Galileo Bone,  we were mystified,  but the sales clerk said he had one and it lasted years!  And guess what?  It did!  Our dog is over 8 years old now,  and has two Galileo's.  He doesn't chew on them constantly,  but whenever he feels like it.  It helps keep his molars free of tartar and satisfies his craving to chew.<br /><br />One of the bone's 3 tips was getting chewed waaaay close to the stump and finally broke off.  According to instructions,  that's the time to retire it and get a new one.<br /><br />I've paid over $20 each for these and feel they were worth it at that price.  Now they are almost half that.  Good deal.<br /><br />Natural (real) bones are dangerous and rawhide chews can get stuck in the throat,  swell in the stomach and even cause bowel impaction.  Don't use them.  If you insist,  supervise the dog so you can assist if the above problems happen.  It has happened to us.<br /><br />But use Nylabones and don't worry about it!  It may take some training at first,  maybe not.  If it does,  it's worth it.
