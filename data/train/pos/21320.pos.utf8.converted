For years I've enjoyed Swedish pancakes served with lingonberry syrup at The Original Pancake House, and even at a few House of Pancakes (though theirs aren't as good).  I discovered the lingonberry preserves at IKEA, and then found these identical ones on Amazon.  They are absolutely wonderful on toast, waffles, pancakes.<br />The seller packaged them extremely well with lots of air-filled material and each jar separately wrapped in paper.  Great job!
