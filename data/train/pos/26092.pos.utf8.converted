This assortment is a great way to try a bunch of flavors.  I love the variety and I'm ordering it again right now!<br /><br />UPDATE: I ordered this a second time; it's that good.  I've only had my Keurig about a month and am loving the different k-cups, trying to find which brands and flavors I like most.  The second batch was different from the first which was nice!!!
