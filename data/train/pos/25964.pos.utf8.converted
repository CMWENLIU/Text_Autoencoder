This stuff is so good! I don't eat sugar, and this PB is great because it has no sugar in it (unlike Jif, Peter Pan, etc.). It took me awhile to get used to the taste--at first I thought it was a little chalky, but now I love it and would NEVER go back to the cruddy stuff. The worst part about this stuff is that I tend to eat it straight out of the jar....:).<br /><br />Hints:<br />-When you get first get it, store the jar upside-down for awhile. When you're ready to eat it, turn it over and all the oil will be on the bottom. It's much easier to stir it this way than when the oil is on top.<br />-MAKE SURE you store it in the refrigerator after it is opened. Natural peanut butter, being natural, HAS to go in there otherwise it will go bad very quickly.<br /><br />Enjoy!
