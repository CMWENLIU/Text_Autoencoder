This "Bread in a Can" has a heavy texture of more like a pound cake. It's sweetened heavily on the molasses taste. It's great with baked beans or toasted with a good jam. The different sweet taste of this bread just adds to the taste of luncheon meats and cheeses. Stores well and the can protects the contents when loaded in saddle bags...(try that with a loaf bread!). Kids eat the stuff up in quantity, so have several cans on hand. One can dress this stuff up with a lot of imagination. Sometimes the price is a bit lower in local stores. Recommend it highly.
