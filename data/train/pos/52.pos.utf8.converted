I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom's cake at my son's wedding. By using an artist's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust, the result was startlingly beautiful. In contrast to food coloring, the Luster Dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen. The containers are small but the product goes a long way, making it extremely economical to use. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933981350">The Step Dynamic: A Powerful Strategy for Successfully Growing Your Business</a>
