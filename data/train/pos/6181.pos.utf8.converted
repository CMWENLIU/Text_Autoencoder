I've never tried another lemon oil, so I don't know how this compares to other products.  I chose this one based purely on price/quantity.<br /><br />I used this for my brother's wedding cake and it had fantastic flavor!  It was even better than another recipe I tried using about a dozen fresh lemons. (We did a side-by-side taste test.)  Their guests raved over the cake and I plan to continue using this lemon oil in my baked goods.
