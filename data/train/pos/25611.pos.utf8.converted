This stuff tastes really good.  It browns well.  I put it in stirfry a lot.  When my family cooks something, when they're putting the chicken in the vegetables, I'm putting the tender bits in the vegetables.  It can also be breaded and fried or marinated and grilled.  Sometimes I just eat it straight from the can.  Great for vegetarians.
