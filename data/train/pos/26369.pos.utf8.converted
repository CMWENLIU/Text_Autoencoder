I have recently discovered that I can't (scratch that - shouldn't) eat wheat. But I love wheat! Anyway, these nut thins have solved 2 problems for me. One, what is a wheat free person supposed to put cheese on? Two, why can't I find the perfect cheese cracker? They're always too salty, too crumbly, too buttery, too something.<br /><br />These things are fabulous. They are delicious on their own and have added the perfect little something to every cheese I've tried them with. You can bite them in half and not get covered in crumbs or you can spread a soft cheese on them and they won't break or crumble. Yet, as durable as they are, they are no struggle to chew.<br /><br />Yum! Thank you Blue Diamond. You have brought happy, crunchy snacking back to my life. :)
