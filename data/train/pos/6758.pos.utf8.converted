Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha is one of my favorite packaged teas. It has a rich, strong, and full taste. In comparison, Yamatoyama's genmaicha tastes a little burnt, and other genmaichas seem somewhat diluted. If you like the genmaicha served in Japanese restaurants, you really ought to try Ujinotsuyu's version -- you're going to love this stuff. These tea bags are strong enough for two uses (steepings).<br /><br />I've gone out of my way to purchase this tea. In the New York City metropolitan area, one may also find Ujinotsuyu's genmaicha in ethnic Japanese, Korean, and Chinese supermarkets, although searching may be required.
