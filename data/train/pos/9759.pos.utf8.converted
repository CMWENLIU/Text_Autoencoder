These are a very good value for money and very satisfying taste.  A quite sizable container, but it does keep them fresh.  Taste is very good, crispy, only very light salt, very minimal oil.  Though these are labeled as halves and pieces there are a number of whole cashews.  Overall very satisfied and will reorder.
