DeLallo got it right! I tried the recipe on the box, a vegetable lasagna. The no cook noodles came out perfectly. There are 15 sheets in the box. The each sheet is approximately 3 1/2" X 7". It works fine in a 13 x 9 baking dish at 5 sheets per layer, 3 layers.<br /><br />I am not a fan of whole wheat pasta. I find the texture of most whole wheat noodles very unappealing. The texture of the DeLallo noodle was smooth and cooked very well. Not having to prepare the noodles for the pan cut down on prep time, too. I'll be ordering more.
