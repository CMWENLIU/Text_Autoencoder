I ordered these to arrive on my Husbands and my Anniversary. They came on the day, were packaged well and were healthy when the package was opened.  Not one flower or leaf was broken and there wasn't even any petals loose in the bottom of the box.<br />The box was marked "Fresh Flowers on the side with a warning to keep cool and out of direct sunlight.<br />These flowers were shipped on the 2nd of April and 5 days later they look better that when they arrived.  The flowers arrived fresh and healthy but most were in bud, today every single flower is open and still perfectly healthy.  They look as if they could live forever.<br />The bouquet itself is quite large with at least 25-30 blooms, 10 of those being large,single specimens such as lilies, carnations and asters, the rest is made up of smaller roses, asters, lilies and a wonderful mix of greenery.<br />I would most definitely buy again from Falcon Farms, these are among the best cut flowers I have ever bought.
