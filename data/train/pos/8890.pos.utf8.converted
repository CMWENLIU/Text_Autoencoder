I am the proud mom of a 16-year-old rescued Border Collie/Lab mix who just happens to be one of the sweetest beings that has ever lived. :) Well, I want her to live a very long, healthy, and happy life, so I only feed her things that I believe will help achieve that end. These treats have all organic chicken, no meat bi-products, pro-biotics, and lots of other great ingredients.<br /><br />I purchased our first bag of Plato Farmers Market Chicken & Vegetables Treats for Dogs over a year ago, and she absolutely loved them. Many bags later, she still wags happily for them.<br /><br />I also give her the Plato Sweet Potato Treats. She loves to chew the sweet potatoes, and they are easier on her teeth than chewing bones. Plato, thank you for making such great products. You have two very grateful customers.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Chicken, carrot, celery, beet, parsley, lettuce, watercress, spinach, green pea, sweet potato, tomato, parsley, salt, zinc propionate, vitamin E supplement, coated ascorbic acid (source of vitamin C), bacillus subtilis.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS:<br />- Grain-free -no corn, wheat, soy, grain fractions or fillers<br />- Natural ingredients, fortified with antioxidant vitamins, zinc propionate<br />- Contains a source of live (viable) naturally occurring microorganisms<br />- No artificial colors, flavors, synthetic preservatives, GMO's (genetically modified organisms), meat by-products or meals.<br />- Naturally preserved.
