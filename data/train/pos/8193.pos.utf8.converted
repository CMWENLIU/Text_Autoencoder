I discovered Lesser Evil snacks about 6 months ago when I started a serious diet.  Being a salty, crunchy addict, I was eager to try anything to help me avoid temptation.  The Krinkle Sticks are fantabulous.  You get the satisfaction of a crunchy snack, tastiness and, most important for me - size.  The servings are so generous you can't believe the bang for your buck.  Unlike the 100 calorie snack packs popping up all over - which normally are teeny tiny - these snacks last.  When I'm done eating them, I feel like I've had a real treat.  I even have my two teenage sons hooked.  For the price - great value.  In case you are curious - I have lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months and Lesser Evils have been on my diet plan the whole time.  Highly, highly recommend.
