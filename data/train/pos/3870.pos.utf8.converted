Anyways, I use this in raw porridge recipe, it is very nutritious and moves your bowels too (excuse me). It has vitamins, and lots of fiber to control the blood sugar concurring with the other reviews.<br /><br />It best eaten raw, so all the nutrients are intact. I recommended with other raw seeds, and wheat bran, raisins, and milk.
