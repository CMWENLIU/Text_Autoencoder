I ordered this product as a last minute Christmas gift for my brother, and felt a bit nervous about it as I had never purchased from this company before.  I've been a long-time customer of Harry & David for this kind of product, and generally had been happy with them.  However, H&D happened to be out of the product I wanted to order, so I took a chance, and am happy to report that my brother raved about the quality of the fruit.  It so happens that he also received a fruit basket from H&D, and said that their fruit was disappointing in comparison.  It's fair to say I will be a repeat customer.
