I got the blueberry and one other; the puppies love it. Both I and my wife love the smell of it. Wonderful ingredients. Not hard, but does not fall apart or even generate crumbs as the puppies chew it. Makes a gentle but very satisfying crunching noise (I like listening to my puppies crunch things). Easily one of the best puppy biscuits available.
