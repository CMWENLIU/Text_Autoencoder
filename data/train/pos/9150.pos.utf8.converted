I tried this tea because it was on sale at my local grocery store, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I like it much better than some of the other brands of ginger-based teas that I've tried; although I love ginger, some of them really pucker the tongue. Normally I'm not a fan of Bigelow teas as I find they're over-flavored (their Earl Grey has so much bergamot that it makes me and another tea-loving friend nauseated!). But they nailed this one. Glad to find it available on Amazon since my local store had a holiday display and once the boxes were gone, they were out of it.
