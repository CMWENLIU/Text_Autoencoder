This is great coffee, especially for the price.<br /><br />The coffee provides a very aromatic scent in the air when being brewed and fresh out of the bag. It is well packaged, the grounds are sized nicely and it makes a great cup of flavorful coffee. It is a bit on the lighter side so it may not be your favorite if you're into the really dark cups, but for a medium-bodied blend, this is great.
