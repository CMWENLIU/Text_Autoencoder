Settle down, y'alls - the seller had to get these from somewhere, and I'm guessing it was from the Girl Scouts - so the Girl Scouts already have their $4.00 a box, and aren't getting hosed.<br /><br />I live 80 miles from the nearest cookie booth - and if you think I'm going to live without these delicious cookies, you've got another think coming. I'll order them - because I need them, like the desert needs the rain. And because, unless this seller broke into the Girl Scout Cookies warehouse, the Girl Scouts still made a profit - from the seller.<br /><br />Also, seller, if you broke in to the Girl Scout Cookies warehouse, please tell me the location.
