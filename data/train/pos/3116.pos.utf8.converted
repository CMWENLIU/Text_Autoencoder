First things first:this is NOT an espresso roast coffee and the word espresso doesn't appear anywhere on the packaging. It's somewhere between city and full city roast and makes an excellent, full-bodied cup of drip coffee without a hint of any charred/burnt taste. This is Lavazza's premier quality coffee and never fails to elicit admiring inquiries when served to guests.
