If you are a single-malt scotch drinker and you are not using a single-malt whisky glass to enjoy it with, you may as well be pouring it down the drain. It really makes that much of a difference. Sure, brandy glasses come close, but a good single-malt glass and just the right amount of water will completely change how and what you taste.<br /><br />With scotch whisky prices going up and up, spending $40 to greatly enhance your enjoyment of your $70 scotch is a no brainer.
