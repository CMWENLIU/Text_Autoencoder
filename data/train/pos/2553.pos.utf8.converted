I ordered two different brands of shelled pumpkins seeds from amazon ( plus have tried countless others ). The other brand I ordered from here had fancier packaging and a bunch of reviews. This one had no but I deiced to take a chance on it after being disappointed by the others.<br /><br />Focusing on just the other brand I ordered this one had more constant size seeds, none of the brunt small seeds that if you accidentally ate one of left an awful taste in your mouth. None of the flat worthless taste seeds either or hard break your teeth pieces of what I think were steams. These were just great lightly salted no bad after taste pumpkin seeds that I will be ordering again and again.
