This is the best.  I mix it with soy milk and let it soak.  I also add some organic coconut flakes.  A small bowl keeps me from needing lunch for 6 hours.  I love the subscription because it keeps me from spending money on other things at the grocery store when I just really only needed to pick up cereal...plus the subscription price is way cheaper!  When your body is given real nutrients it doesn't beg you to keep feeding it!  I am taking a bag on vacation!  Stop eating garbage like white bread bagels and sugar cereals,and you will change your life.
