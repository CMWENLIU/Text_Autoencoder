Really, Amazon states that in the warmer months you should not buy chocolate. But really, what kind of moron buys chocolate by mail in September or August? Have they never seen a postal truck, or UPS.....they drive with their doors open in the warm weather....because they have no AC. Let alone the same two company's tracker trails, you see on the highways....do they look like refrigerator trails to you???? If you even once got a package in one of the summer months....of anything, lets say Books, and felt how warm it was straight from being handed to you from your carrier, would you even dream or ordering chocolate? Now think if you were not handed the package, and it had too sit out in the sun until you found it and brought it inside. So, why blame being a moron on the chocolate. Now I got a box of theses as a Christmas present last Christmas, They were great. I have seen some one star reviews for the 3 box set of these truffles.I think they are from people who do not know what a French truffle is. It's bittersweet chocolate and cream rolled in unsweetened cocoa powder. They are rich and dark...not sweet. These are not like Lindt Lindor's truffles. These are dark and rich....try them.....but not in the summer.
