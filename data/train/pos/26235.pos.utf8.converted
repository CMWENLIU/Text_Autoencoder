I have been a sushi fan for many years, but have always been shy about making it myself.  After searching online at the dozens of different options, I decided to go with the Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Too many sushi kits out there offer just the rolling mat, or dishes and the rolling mat, but no spoon, or all the dishes but no edible components.<br /><br />With this kit, you have the mat, the spoon, and all the edibles necessary sans the actual fillings (fish, veggies, etc.)  And not only does the kit have edible components, they are top notch.  The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease.  The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere.<br /><br />But, the best part of this kit is the manual.  It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos.  As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend.  I made darned good sushi my very first try.<br /><br />Criticisms?  Hmmm... not many.  The price is right.  Maybe it'd be nice if they had a special "sushi knife" or something enclosed, but whatever.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking to make sushi at home for the first time, you won't be sorry with this purchase.
