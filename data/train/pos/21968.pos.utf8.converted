I bought these bars because of their high content of Cocoa and I have been very pleased with them. I drop a piece in my coffee every morning and makes the coffee tastes great. In the afternoon I use another square and let it melt slowly in my mouth as I drink tea.  These are two delicious ways to use this healthy chocolate.
