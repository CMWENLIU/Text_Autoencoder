This is one of those ingredients that people either love or hate - but most people I have served it to love it.  The scent of the truffle in the honey is amazing.  It is best served with a nutty hard cheese such as parmesan regianno (this is how it is served in Italy) and a mild cracker or bread.<br /><br />I have tried other brands which are also good and sometimes have more truffle flakes, but in side by side comparisons, I prefer this brand.<br /><br />Try this:  Take a plain pizza shell with just a light brush of olive oil and some grated parmesan and a sprinkle of sea salt and bake until crisp and then remove from the oven, drizzle with the truffle honey and serve as a appetizer.
