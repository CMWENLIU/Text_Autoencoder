We tried feeding our baby Enfamil when he first switched to formula, but he hated the taste and refused it. Our friend told us that Similac was the best formula that compared to the taste of breastmilk. She actually bought various formulas and did a taste test. Our baby loves this formula and is thriving on it. Some people have said the powder is hard to mix, but we have not had any problems. We have found that room temp bottled water mixes the best.
