A friend gave me a gift certificate to the spa where she works for my b-day last year. I got to swim, relax, and drink this tea. I swear on anything, that I wanted to steal ALL of the tea from the place. I also had the ML Ginger Twist. If I could live on tea, these would be my sustenance. I can't say enough about this tea, and am obviously not as well-spoken/written as the other reviewers -- but, dang! this tea is goood.
