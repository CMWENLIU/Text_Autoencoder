This is the best white mocha mix I've ever had. It is perfectly smooth once mixed well, and doesn't separate as the drink cools like many other chocolate mixes. The flavor and consistency are both perfect. Ghiradelli gets the job done.<br /><br />Also is really good in milk shakes!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
