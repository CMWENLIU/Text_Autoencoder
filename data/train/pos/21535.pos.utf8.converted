This is a really good product.  While it is only 4 ounces, it is actually about a quart of freeze dried shallots.  I have long used fresh shallots extensively in cooking, and these are an excellent replacementwhen "fresh" is not required (such as salads, etc).  They save all the work of peeling and chopping fresh shallots for cooking.  The product, while fairly costly (as are fresh shallots), is a real time saver, and worth every penny of the cost.  Freeze dried is much better than just plain dried.  I use freeze dried herbs whenever I can find them, as they more exactly replace fresh products.  If you use shallots, you will love this product.
