I'm a fan of Mountain Dew from way back. It and Mello Yello were the only sodas I liked as a kid. I've stopped drinking it regularly for health reasons, but anyone who decides to drink the golden elixir doesn't do it because it's healthy. That's a given.<br /><br />Dietary concerns aside, Mountain Dew (and other sodas) have gotten too sweet for me as I age. I finally found the Throwback at a local drug store and decided to do a side by side comparison between the Throwback formula and the current Mtn Dew. Comparing the ingredients, it seems the primary difference is that the Throwback formula replaces the HFCS with real cane sugar. Also, there are fewer calories and sugar carbs in the Throwback version. The big beverage companies claim there is no taste difference between HFCS and sugar. But when I tasted them side-by-side, the Throwback has a mellower, less sickly-sweet aftertaste. To my taste buds, it's just better.<br /><br />I don't indulge in soda often. But when I do, I'd want it to be the Throwback version. Let's hope Pepsi Co keeps it around for a while.
