The Annie's product compares favorable to Kraft Mac & Cheese.<br /><br />I just can't let stand some mis-information comparing the two.<br /><br />One correction needed is "I love mac and cheese and I know how to make it.  --  The cheese powder doesn't dissolve entirely, and it tends to stick to the pasta in dry little clumps rather than blend into an actual sauce."<br /><br />But if the preparation instructions are followed this is nearly impossible to happen.  On the other hand, if one were to improperly prepare the Annie's product (for example using the Kraft preparation instructions), then this is exactly what you could get - clumps!  The Annie product preparation instruction state to put 2-4 tablespoons of skim milk + the cheese sauce mix into the warm empty pot and wisk well until SMOOTH, and only then to add the cooked pasta into the pot.  Whereas, Kraft tells you to pour the dry cheese powder on top of the cooked pasta.<br /><br />As to the calories: "Now hear this: Annie's has more and fat and calories than KRAFT."<br /><br />This is not true, again, if prepared according to the instructions.  Kraft is 380 calories 23% from fat whereas Annie's is only 290 calories 8% from fat.<br /><br />Note that Annie's obtains this by eliminating the need for butter. If someone were go and add the same amount of butter to the Annie's recommended preparation method, then the calories and fat count would be higher.  But this would be silly, since the Annie's cheese mix is blended to replace the need for the butter.<br /><br />Side note: Annie's does list an alternative higher fat preparation method using
