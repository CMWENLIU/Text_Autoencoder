I ordered a number of different K-cups from Amazon and they were all great... we particularly liked this Italian Blend... especially first thing in the morning!  I did a fair bit of browsing online to figure out where I wanted to order my coffee from... Amazon had the cheapest price, the coffee's we wanted and free SS shipping!
