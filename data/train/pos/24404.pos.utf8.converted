I have tried most of the flavors Except for the new MOCHA and these are great tasting (fiber) Bars.  Every once in a while you will get one that is hard as a rock, I guess the package wasn't sealed all the way.<br /><br />The last thing I will say is that these are $2.59 at Target and will usually have them on sale for less.  So as far as amazon is concerned this is not a fantastic deal.
