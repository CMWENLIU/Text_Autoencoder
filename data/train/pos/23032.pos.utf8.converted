This soda is really delicious.  I was able to try a sample of it at a booth at a local conference in Seattle and was instantly in love with it.  It's a very unique (and yummy) flavored soda because of the blood orange, and because of that it only makes spending the money for it worth it. It's sweet, but not overly so.  The bottles are quite hefty which adds to the authenticity, they really do look like the ones on the show.  Whether you are buying the soda for decoration (we have one of them on a shelf) or for drinking, it's worth the price for this unique soda.  I highly recommend it.
