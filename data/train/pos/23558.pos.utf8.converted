I don't get started in the morning til I've had several cups of strong tea with milk and (fake) sugar.  For years, I drank the T&H English breakfast tea - which is good; but then I tried the Taylors & Harrogate Scottish Breakfast Tea:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MN6Y46">Taylors Scottish Breakfast 50 tea bags</a>.  And drink it regularly now.  It has, to me, a slightly fuller, better flavor than the similar T&H English Breakfast Tea.  I always pack tea bags with me when I go on a trip -- for fear I get stuck in a home or restaurant with only awful Lipton's tea (with its slightly metallic non-taste!!).  JW
