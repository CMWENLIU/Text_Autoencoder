Like most users of GU, I run marathons.  I chose this package because I wanted to find a flavor that I could stomach later in a race and this let me experiment.  This package has eight separate flavors:  orange, vanilla, espresso, berry, lemon-lime, chocolate, banana, and plain.  I won't comment on the taste because that is an individual preference, however, I do prefer GU to Clif Shots, which to me are pastier and harder to get down without a good amount of water.
