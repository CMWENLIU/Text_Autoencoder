Absolutely delicious. My only quibble is that it's a little saltier than I'd prefer so I use sparingly. A little goes a long way. It has no pork in it, which is great for vegetarians. Check out the blog on their website, it's got a lot of tasty uses and recipes. It doesn't seem to be widely available in stores so Amazon's 3 bottle price with free super saver shipping is a good deal.
