I have greyhounds and they have sensitive stomachs.  After speaking with other grey owners, I decided to try this food as it is less expensive than Wellness.  It seems to agree with them just fine!  Whew!<br />Do not, however, buy it from Pet Food Direct!  Where do they get off charging Almost $14.00 for delivery?!?!<br />It is sold at Petco, Petsmart and Pet Supplies Plus.
