We first tried this product at Costco, not expecting much beyond an emergency 'immediate' organic side for other dishes. We were delighted with how tasty this quinoa & brown rice combo can be. My husband sometimes thought the dish alone 'dry' unless he added a dressing or marinade on top: I, however, thought it was perfect directly from the microwave directions (nutty, with a rich quinoa taste without the overall heaviness of brown rice). When we returned to Costco to get more, alas...like Trader Joe's of late....they did not carry it. It's so irritating to be introduced to a new product and then have no access to it when shops discontinue! Until we lost shopping access we used it: alongside grilled foods; as a base for lentil daal; as a quick starch for a veggie dinner; in mixed salads---and have never been disappointed. It really is a tasty, healthy shelf-stable addition for any frazzled organic-oriented home cook. Enjoy!!
