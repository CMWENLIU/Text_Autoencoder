Take it from an Italian, this is the best tuna and so glad I found it at Amazon. Can't find it anywhere in Las Vegas. The family had this shipped from NY to us because it's worth it.<br /><br />Try it with pasta. Put some olive oil in a pan, sliced up garlic, red onions, and some tomato sauce. When the onion and garlic is translucent (don't let it burn), add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, add the whole can of tuna (oil included), mix it all up and put it over your pasta...WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Update: I found out that this tuna comes from Thailand. I used to think it came from Italy. The caution here is mercury. There are no government controlled food inspections in Thailand as there are in the US, so you may be taking a chance with mercury poisoning. I'm very disappointed and will not order again...
