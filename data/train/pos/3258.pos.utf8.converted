Had problems with a different brand because it either wouldn't grow or it would grow bugs.  This stuff grows nice, is very sturdy and long lasting.  Kitty loves her new dental floss (and occasional snack).  It's very tall and thick compared to most grass I've purchased in the past.  Growing it all at once may be more than your cat needs or wants.  I split mine up into quarters.  Great value.
