I love the orange more than the lemon. The lemon is quite strong. But both are good. Got a multi case (2 6pack of orange and 2 6packs of lemon) at Costco this weekend for only $10.49 (with a $3.50 off coupon)<br />Knowing that Costco doesn't always carry products at all times, it's good to know I can find these on Amazon. Too bad they are more than double the price on Amazon though.
