Lower fat granola usually tastes lacking, and are sold generally at organic food stores, which are inconvenient and more costly.  This product tastes great, particularly for a national-brand granola.  You'll have to shop carefully on price, because the current prices I'm seeing on Amazon (4/1/2010) is exceptionally high.  But, if attainable at a good price, it's a great granola.
