I was looking for a good alternative to Soy milk and found this. Tried a couple of different almond milk drinks on Amazon, but this one tasted the best.<br /><br />Great dark chocolate flavour. Makes a great pre/post workout protein drink.<br /><br />Keeps going out of stock at Amazon.com and the price sold by third party sellers are ridiculous. Just have to check often and buy more than one pack at a time.
