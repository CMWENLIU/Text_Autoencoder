These were recommended in the class I took when 1st Dxed with diabetes. They work well whenever you don't want to eat more (dieting), or when you won't eat for hours; that includes overnight to help avoid high sugar levels when you wake. In fact, they're very good at helping me get a full night's sleep, uninterrupted by waking up to eat a snack.
