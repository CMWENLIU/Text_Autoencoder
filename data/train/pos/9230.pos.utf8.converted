We love this all natural, organic apricot.<br /><br />Very sweet and soft. Worth the money. You pay more at a health food store per bag. I,ve been shopping from the health food stores for over 25 years. Let me say that the color is not as bright and cheerful as the non- organic counterpart but keep in mind that this is all natural. It was not treated with chemicals, preservatives or colorings. This is good tasting and good for you. For me, it is good quality and deliscious. I will order this again and other natural fruit products by them. Enjoy!
