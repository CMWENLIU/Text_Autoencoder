I grew up eating homemade stuffed grape leaves.  Of the canned varieties, I have tried Galil, Roland and Sultan.  Roland is rather bland and the leaves are tough, with the veins being too large, I.E. they were allowed to grow for too long and are no longer tender.  Sultan had good flavor but far too much oil, which also affected the texture.  The Galil are the best tasting by flavor and texture and they are also reasonably priced.  The first Galil I bought (case of 12 cans of 14 oz each) were twenty-seven dollars and forty-six cents after the subscription discount in February 2011.  I will type out the money in words, in hopes of escaping the Amazon censors.
