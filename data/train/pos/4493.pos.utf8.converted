This bulgur is of great quality and with some of the specials that Amazon runs on grocery items, it is much cheaper than buying it at specialty stores.  The item description doesn't really help much, but this is in fact a cracked, #3 bulgur.  It makes a great alternative to white rice and it is much healthier.
