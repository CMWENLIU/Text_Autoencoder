First this is Spanish La Mancha Saffron, grown in Spain, by far the majority of the saffron we see here in the US. Although the Blue Crocus flower is native to Iran and not Spain the best saffron is considered to be this from La Mancha. Now as for the grading system the main difference between grades is how many long yellow "styles" are attached to the stigmas which is saffron. Pure stigma saffron (basically no yellow styles) is the best quality.<br /><br />This is deep bright red Spanish saffron indicating very high crocin. The best indication of grade is the "Superior Quality" label which is the translation of the Spanish "Coupe". There are just a few styles. Bottom line you might find a more purebred saffron for a higher price. But this is a very high quality product at an unbeatable price from the best growing region in the world. The flowers here would seem to grow under the natural conditions the best, perhaps avoiding any kind of chemical alteration.
