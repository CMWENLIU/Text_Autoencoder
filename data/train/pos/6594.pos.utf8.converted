I eat Planters Trail Mix Fruit & Nut 2-Ounce Bags twice a day, once at breakfast and then as an afternoon snack.  I find it filling, healthy,and delicious.  I am on the subscription program and receive 72 2 ounce packets once per month.  This is a huge savings over buying it at work for $1.47 a pack and I can get it for $.43 per pack from Amazon.  Amazing savings on something I eat every day anyway. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.
