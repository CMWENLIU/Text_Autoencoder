I just reordered more of these traps. I originally bought them to catch the silverfish, spiders and crickets that had taken residence. Was I surprised to find some little roaches as well as some unidentified bugs in the traps along with the crickets, spiders and silverfish. I will be putting out some Combat gel for the raoches too. Victor and Combat are 2 products that really work. Thanks
