My family loves rice.  I discovered this blend at one of our local groceries, but they are not consistent in stocking it.  It sells out quickly and then may not reappear for weeks.  And it is the only store in town that carries it.  I was thrilled with the opportunity to buy it by the case online.  The price is very competitive with the local grocery, and shipping was fast.  This is easily one of the best rice blends I have found.  And it is NOT seasoned, so you do not have to contend with high sodium content or other problems. You make it the way you want it--cook it in broth, add vegetables & herbs and some diced chicken or leftover beef for a quick skillet meal that is head & shoulders above a boxed skillet dinner. We all really love this rice--the blends of rice give it a nice texture and taste and it is so much healthier than white rice, yet it cooks as quickly.  Try this one--you will like it!
