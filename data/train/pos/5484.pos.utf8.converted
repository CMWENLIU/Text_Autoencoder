I am always concerned about sodium, fat, oil and calories.  These Reese Skinless & Boneless sardines are definitely the answer.  What an excellent value, boneless, not unusual, but boneless and skinless, that is another story.  I was buying canned sardines from the .99 Cent store for years, smaller cans, but excellent value.  Once I found these at Amazon this is where I now buy my sardines.  These are an excellent purchase.  I also like the pull tab top.  No can-opener necessary.  I just put them on a plate and add a little mustard and enjoy them.  I highly recommend these.  Actually, I think I am going to have to open a can right now since my mouth is watering.  Oooops, I just checked the pantry and discovered I already ate my last can of sardines, so I am placing my next order now.  If you like sardines, these are a wonderful purchase.
