I really enjoy the taste of this Simply Organic black pepper; happily I can find this brand on local supermarket shelves. It releases this gorgeous, heady black pepper scent when ground fresh over my recipes - I'd say medium as far as strength, not *too* much bite but definitely makes more of an impression than white or pink peppercorns. Subtle enough not to take over a softly scrambled egg but punchy enough to crust the edge of a filet mignon.<br /><br />I use other brands as well but this is one I definitely would purchase again. Pleased to recommend.
