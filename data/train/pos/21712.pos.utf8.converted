This is nice just to have in your pantry for those times you are out of milk and need some for baking, cooking, etc. It's a fine powdered whole milk not powdered skim milk, so has a good whole milk flavor.  Also good to keep around if you are just one person or even two, who don't drink much milk. If you need it for baking or whatever then you have it.
