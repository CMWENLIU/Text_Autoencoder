I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.
