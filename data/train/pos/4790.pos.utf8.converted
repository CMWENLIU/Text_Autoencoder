I wanted to switch my baby to formula, but it gave her gastrointestinal problems. I then decided to switch back to breastfeeding. I had only stopped for about a week, but my milk supply had significantly decreased. I was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours. (My baby has a cleft palate so I exclusively pump. Because of this I am aware of exactly how much milk I am producing.) I ordered the Fenugreek (which arrived surprisingly fast)and started taking it immediately. The bottle suggests taking 1-2 pills 3x a day with food. I started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions. I did not notice a huge difference at first. I read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day. I increased my dosage. After about a week of Fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings, I noticed a huge difference. I would get approx 6oz every 3 hours. My first pump in the morning around 5am I normally get about 10oz! My freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent. I now pump for 20 min every 4-5 hours, with an 8 hour break at night. My milk supply has not diminished and I am confident it is the Fenugreek.<br /><br />I have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned. I have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to Fenugreek. The only downside is that since I take 9 pills a day the bottle doesn't seem to last very long. However, Fenugreek is super cheap so buying more isn't really an issue for me.
