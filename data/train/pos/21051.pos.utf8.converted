I'm always on the lookout for meals that are palatable to my toddler and me and my husband. This product passed the test. My version involves beef broth, a can of diced tomatoes, and whatever veggies are in my crisper that particular day. Plus, one cup of this soup mix feeds our whole family with leftovers so one package goes a long way.
