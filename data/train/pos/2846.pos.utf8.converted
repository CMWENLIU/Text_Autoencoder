I had this tea for the second time yesterday, at a fine local tea house, and my friend and I drank two pots of this luxurious liquid.  Paris tea is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted.  It is delicious plain, and is decadent with cream and sugar.  I feel like I am sitting at an outdoor cafe in Paris while drinking this.  Very lovely!
