This was my first purchase of Celestial Seasonings tea, but definitely not my last. The Honey Vanilla Chamomile tea tastes superb and I can't wait to try their other flavors. Although they call it "honey vanilla" chamomile, the orange peel dominates the taste, but this is not a bad thing (if you like orange ;-). Good packaging and competitive pricing (especially when compared to Twinings) as well.
