The only real Parmigiano (Reggiano) is one of the great cheeses of the world. The best Reggiano (there are different grades of Reggiano, too) is much more than a grating cheese--it is a cheese that can be eaten by itself, before a meal or after. The best grades of Reggiano are best shaven paper-thin (use a good cheese plane) and will have a slight pineapple taste when savored slowly. This cheese is a real treat!
