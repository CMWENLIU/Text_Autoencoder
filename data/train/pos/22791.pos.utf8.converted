I am very picky about my coffee.  I decided to just start trying a bunch of different coffee roaster's coffee and see if I could find the diamond in the rough.  So far this has been a favorite.  It delivers a darker roast without the bitterness.  I would say it is just a bit lighter than your French roast bean.  For the price it's worth a try!!
