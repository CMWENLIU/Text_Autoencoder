This was a big hit with our company that came to visit this summer.  I had 6 weeks of family and friends and wanted to have tasty, healthy snacks to offer adults and kids alike.<br /><br />The Amazon reviews of this cherry are what tempted me to order.  Along with the health benefits that the packaging mentions, these are really great cherries.  They are large and moist but not wet.  They look appealing to the eye.  They are like no other dried cherry I've had.  They are a little bit tart but still sweet. Very satisfying as a snack.<br /><br />I've never bought other cherry products because it isn't my family's preference but these were a big hit with everyone who tried them.  Even those who didn't like cherries enjoyed these.<br /><br />I find them to be a nice change from the large raisins I normally buy.  They make a great mix-in to hot oatmeal, trail mix, granola, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, and scones.  I set them out with nuts, fruit, and cheese for an appetizer before a family dinner.  Everyone who has tried them has been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I'll be ordering more.
