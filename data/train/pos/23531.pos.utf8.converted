I love this coffee and was disappointed when they discontinued it for the Tassimo brewers.  I have since bought a Keurig brewer, and was pleased to see the Verona K-cups in Costco yesterday for about $32 for this same 54 unit quantity.  The price here is absurd...at this time.  I'll wait until I see it on Amazon in the $30 - $32 dollar range before ordering on Amazon.
