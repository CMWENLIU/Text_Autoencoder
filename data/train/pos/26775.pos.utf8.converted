This oatmeal tastes better than any I have eaten in my life. The texture and flavor is better than other instant oatmeals; it is not mushy and has the perfect amount of sweetness--not too sweet but not bland and boring. The price is great, especially considering it is approximately the same as Quaker but with the added benefits of being yummier and organic!<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer to ask if it is gluten free. They emailed me: "Our light oatmeals that come in the boxes are gluten free. The ones in big cups are not gluten free." However, I do not think they use certified gluten free oats. I have a gluten sensitivity and do not have any symptoms after eating this. However, if you have celiac, this product is probably not for you.
