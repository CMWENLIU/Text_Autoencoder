I have been using this product for about 6 months now. I am fighting Gall Bladder cancer, and was told not to drink coffee. The Dandelion Root Tea is a great alternative to coffee, for many reasons. No caffeine, it stimulates your liver, it really tastes a lot like coffee as well. I even have my boss hooked on it! He had to give up coffee for some health issues, and I let him try a bag, and now he drinks it daily! You have to brew it for 15 minutes to get all the flavor and benefits from it. I highly recommend it, it's good for you, and tastes enough like coffee to satisy your coffee craving.
