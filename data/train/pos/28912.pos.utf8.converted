Purchased this because it was cheaper than the small jars in the supermarket.<br /><br />The bottle is HUGE!!!!  So much so that I have given baggies of these herbs to several friends and still have plenty left for myself.<br /><br />If I were to try to keep it and use it all myself, it would go stale before I had used 1/4 of this container.<br /><br />Great quality, very fragrant and fresh.
