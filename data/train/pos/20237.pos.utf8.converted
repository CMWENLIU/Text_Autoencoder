I've had difficulty falling asleep since my college days.  Once I entered my mid-30's the insomnia became more frequent.  Melatonin and valerian pills did not work unless taken at levels that left me with a morning hangover effect. L-Tryptophan, 5-HTP, and GABA were ineffective. I have also tried numerous prescription (sleep is necessary to get through nursing school) and OTC medications that are used to treat insomnia.  Most left me with a headache or excessive daytime sleepiness (zombie mode).  I first tried Sleepytime Extra (Sleepytime and other chamomile teas do not work for me)about 6 weeks ago, and each time I drink it I become sleepy within 15 minutes.  Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Extra works like a charm!  The 25mg of Valerian root works synergistically with the chamomile and tilia estrella.  I'm stocking up before the FDA comes down on valerian like it did kava kava.  I also recommend 30-60 minutes of sunlight in a.m. hours, because many people are unaware that they have DSPS (Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia).
