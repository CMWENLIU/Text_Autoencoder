THESE BEANS ARE SIMPLY GREAT.  YOU CAN UTILIZE THEM IN MANY WAYS.<br />While dry beans are general soaked for two to four hours prior to cooking, Anasazi beans yield better results when soaked overnight or for at least eight hours. Known to cook much faster than ordinary pinto beans, Anasazi beans are often used to replace pinto beans in a variety of dishes including chili, soup and popular Latin dishes such as chalupas and nachos, or add mopre water and have bean soup.  My favorite is to cook them with a package of Liption Beef Onion Soup.  Wash them through three washings of water, then cover with two or three inches of water and let them soak overnight.  Drain, cover with water, add seasonings of choice, bring them to a boil, reduce the heat and let them simmer ONE HOUR.  They cook faster than most beans and are very tender at this one hour time.<br /><br />Benefits: (according to a web site)<br />In addition to being a good source of fiber, Anasazi beans are also an excellent source of potassium, folic acid and iron. While dry beans are known to contain certain carbohydrates that cause flatulence, the Anasazi bean has been found to contain less than 25 percent of these complex carbohydrates, making them much easier on the digestive system.
