This came and I use it every day mixed with club soda and a touch of tonic water. It tastes good and i know it is good for us. We don't drink sodas in this house and this takes its place. Great stuff I will be reordering when it runs out I even got my husband to take some to work and add it to the tea he drinks thoughout the day!
