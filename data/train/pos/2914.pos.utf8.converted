OG Organic Green Tea is very aromatic and if I still have a photo of the nutrient panel I will upload it for you here: lots more in this green tea than probably any other you've seen.  A few people I asked have said that this brand of green tea has a very calming effect, even with the infusion of 100% certified organic Ganoderma Lucidum.  Like the black, latte, mocha, and hot chocolate, this is VERY flavorful.<br />By the way, even though the packet (this is in tea bag form) reads to steep in one cup of hot water, many of us OG distributors know that one teabag makes 3 to 5 cups of water.  Perfect for a small pot to share with guests.  I would not doubt it if someone loses more weight with this brand because of the Ganoderma, than with all other green teas out there.  What I liked the most was the aroma: to me, I noticed a bit of a lemon scent, and a tiny hint of mint.  Feels like a cozy morning when I drink it.  But, as I said before, I'm a OG girl coffee lover all the way. :) research 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease'' and see for  yourself how this can help you or someone you love.
