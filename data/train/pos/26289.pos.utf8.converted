Well, I thought I'd finally let the cat out of the bag and share with those of you who miss pasta products the way I had. I've discovered a wonderful type of yam-noodle that has been eaten and enjoyed by Japanese families for centuries. It's probably one of the reasons there's so little heart disease in that country. This amazing product is called 'Konjac Shirataki Noodles'. This pasta product comes in many shapes and sizes for all types of pasta-style dishes. I, personally, prefer the Angel-Hair type and the Mini Pearl type pastas. If you're interested in enjoying this wonderful, safe, fiber-rich food source, then look no further than here at Amazon.com.  I hope you enjoy trying this excellent food choice as much as I've enjoyed sharing the gem with all of you. It's a totally guilt-free food. Zero calories, zero carbs, zero sodium, zero fat; just pure soluble fiber. It's a perfect food choice for the Type ll food plan. Due to the fact it's pure fiber, any meal that contains the konjac-pasta will keep one full and satiated for hours. I've been using this pasta daily since October, 2007. I'm certain it's helped with my most recent blood-work panels, too.  Enjoy!
