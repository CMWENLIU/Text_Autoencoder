I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it.
