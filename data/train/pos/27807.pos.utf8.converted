These are seriously the most delicious lo-carb chocolate treats I've EVER had!!! I seriously LOVE them!! It's a deal to get them on Amazon too, as I purchased 1 package (contains 2 chocolate clusters) for $1.59 + tax... in Chicago which is absoultely horrendous... so almost $2/package.  ANyway... it's delicious and 6 grams of FIBER PER PEICE?! SIGN ME UP!!! No terrible taste or texture either... I wouldn't have known it was lo-carb/calorie had I not seen the packaging... and I am a sugar-aholic but need to watch my weight!  BUY THEM!!!
