Just came out an idea about mixing Mio with plain yogurt. I added one squeeze into a 2lb of greek yogurt, stirred for a while. Taste just like the fruit flavor yogurt on the market. Has a creamy texture with less carbs and lots of protein. Yummy!<br /><br />It seems a little too sweet for me, so next time I'd add half squeeze and try.<br /><br />As a water flavorant, as far as I tried, I like this flavor and the fruit punch.<br /><br />The sweet tea and peach tea taste far less satisfactory than snapple or lipton brisk (my favorite brand). But after adding some lemon juice, those two taste better.
