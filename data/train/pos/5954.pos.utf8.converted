My Rottie has food allergies to poultry, beef, and dairy. I've had a very difficult time finding snacks that don't contain these ingredients. I've been trying different salmon snacks. This product costs a little more than the traditional dog snack, but its got none of the bad ingredients that will make your dog sick (note: its a one pound bag so it lasts a long time). Its all salmon and organic brown rice. They don't smell like traditional dog snacks, they Smell So Good that you may want to try them. Best of all your pup will love them and you're doing something good for him. My pup recognizes the bag and knows that a treat is coming. Note: these are also great for training, they are easily broken into smaller pieces.
