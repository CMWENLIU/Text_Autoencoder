I am caucasian with 2a/M/ii hair. I tried several mixed with Conditioners/amla/Dr. Bonners etc. I fould this works best all buy itself mixed as the directions tell you to mix. Otherwise it was hard to rinse and made my hair texture feel funny and kinda dry...when I did the simple mix as recommended on the box, my hair was silky and shiny.
