Unlike the 5mil extracts, the 1mil extract is not prohibited by most states. More importantly, you can "work" with it. The 5mil extract is awesome too, but the fumes area killer, it will make you cry and choke just from smelling it. The 1mil is just not pleasant to smell, but you can still work with it and cook with it.<br /><br />From a torts perspective, if you plan on putting this product on someone's food, (1) put only a small amount, (2) tell them that it's "a bit spicy." That way, your intended target is at least aware of the risk of the food he or she is about to taste being spicy. He or she is assuming the risk of "how" spicy the food will be, and if they can handle how spicy it is. The "choice" is entirely upon the free-will of the target, and not due to misrepresentation or concealment.<br /><br />On the same note, please do NOT put this in food and NOT tell the person that it's spicy. Sure, it might seem like a funny thing to do, but it won't be funny if they file a pretty strong tort claim against you civilly. Also, some people are unable to handle spicy foods, or due to some stomach, heart, or GI condition, are extremely sensitive to spicy foods. Giving them food containing a 1mil extract poses a serious risk to their health and life! That means, what you thought was a joke, could end up putting you in jail for reckless or criminally negligent homicide.<br /><br />As an added warning; please be careful when you use this product. If you don't use gloves, and then rub your eyes later, enjoy the sensation of 1mil SHU on your naked eyes. To enjoy a similar sensation, just allow the sauce to splash into your eyes while washing something or closing the top of the bottle with the cap. If you thought you felt pain from your mouth being on fire, wait till you see what it feels like in your eyes. It's not fun, so please use gloves and glasses, or try to be very careful.<br /><br />No communication herein constitutes legal advice. Please consult with your own attorney that is licensed to practice law within your state.
