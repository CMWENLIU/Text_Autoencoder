If you bake a lot of homemade yeast bread and rolls, this is the best way to buy gluten.  Even bread flour doesn't have enough gluten to make yeast bread light and fluffy, and whole wheat flour is a different story altogether.  I order gluten in these great big cans, and it beats the heck out of trying to find it in little boxes in the stores.  Even my whole wheat bread is light and yummy.
