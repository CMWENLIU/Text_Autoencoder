I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one.
