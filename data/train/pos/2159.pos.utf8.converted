This stuff is fantastic, it tastes great and is full of antioxidants and vitamins.<br />I've used it mainly in drinks, mixed into smoothies and juices, even just a spoonful in a glass of water or iced tea is really tasty, I also used it to flavor/color frosting for my friend's birthday cake, and made a 'jam' using this stuff and chia seeds. This is probably my favorite Navitas Naturals product so far. The only thing I have problems with, and this has nothing to do with the pomegranite powder itself, is the resealable bag it comes in; I've bought a lot of Navitas Naturals products and while I like most of them a lot, the bags they come in tear fairly easilly, especially along the top where the bag seals. Other than that, great product, I absolutely love it and will continue to buy it.
