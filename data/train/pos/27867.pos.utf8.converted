These suckers are delicious! The flavors are so natural, like real fruit, because they are real fruits. I do not eat candy or sweets regularly (the kids and husband do), but I was looking for something to snack on that was gluten free, low in calories, all natural, organic, and relatively healthy. These suckers are perfect for that. I can eat three suckers for only 70 calories, and I only eat maybe two in a day. These would be good for dieters, people looking to quit smoking, and kids. Of course, real fruit is the best, but these make a great occasional treat. Great value for the price.
