Not really much to say.. this is ceylon cinnamon. I don't know how to describe the taste, except to say I'm hooked and although I like the taste of the other stuff too, this stuff tastes better. It's a much finer powder then your traditional cinnamon, more like confectioners sugar in consistency, which is normal.<br /><br />Making 2 batches of jello pudding and putting each type of cinnamon in large amounts in each batch then comparing the taste, they are both very good. The chinese stuff is more in your face tasting, but the ceylon stuff has an additional profile of flavors that are quite attractive. I've heard them described as 'citrus' but I'm not sure what I would describe them as. Since I like to use cinnamon in large amounts, and this cinnamon has very little coumarin compared to store bought chinese stuff, and tastes wonderful,  I'm hooked.<br /><br />This stuff was packaged well and appeared fresh from this seller.
