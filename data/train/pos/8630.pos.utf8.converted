We love this soup.  My kids love it so much and one of the few soups I can find without gluten or meat in it.  We sometimes add sour cream or cheese to  give it a little more kick or even some gluten free rice pasta...makes a great meal for the kids and my kids eat vege's they wouldn't normally eat if they weren't in the soup.
