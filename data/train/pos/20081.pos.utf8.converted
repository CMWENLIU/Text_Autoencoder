I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste. But not these cookies they taste just like the regular cookies. I highly recommend them. You do not have to be a diabetic to eat them. They are made with splenda and I use splenda in a lot of things, I also use the brown sugar splenda in my cooking. These cookies are great.
