This popcorn is truly addictive.  You can smell the lime as soon as it finishes popping but it is not overwhelming when you eat it.  With the salt and lime flavor it almost reminded me of a margarita with salt on the rim.<br /><br />The popcorn pops up well with a few kernels left over at the end -- overall it's a great product and I'm happy I bought it -- even if it is a pack of 12 -- I will definitely be able to eat them all over time.<br /><br />Edit to add nutrition info:<br />Servings per bag -- 1<br />Calories for one bag popped -- 190<br />Calories from fat -- 100<br />Total Fat 15g<br />trans fat 0g<br />polyunsaturated fat 2g<br />monunsaturated fat 5g<br />cholestorol 0<br />sodium 370mg<br />potassium 75mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 21g<br />Dietary Fiber 4g<br />Protein 3g
