Since my furry friend was a pup, she has had a very sensitive stomach.  I tried various dog foods and regardless of the time frame she was on the food, she still had stomach problems.  A friend told me about Blue Buffalo and once I switched her to this food, her stomach problems are few and far between.  The life protection pieces she is not a fan of, but she scarfs the rest of the food down.  The all natural ingredients and no fillers is also really great.  I definitely recommend Blue Buffalo to anyone looking to change their dogs diet.
