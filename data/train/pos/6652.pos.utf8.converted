These are dense, flavorful and a great addition for low carb dieters. They are also very filling. No, they aren't all that cheap but you can freeze a package and use them sparingly. If you're comparing costs, think about how costly it is to buy new clothing when you gain or lose weight.<br /><br />My only quibble? I can't cut them in half for the toaster! They crumble when I try -  but my spouse doesn't seem to have this problem and is the delegated "bagel cutter" of the family. It is a bit frustrating when my spouse isn't around to help out - but a few seconds in the microwave and they are warm enough for me to eat with the usual bagel toppings - cream cheese or butter or jam or lox, etc. I just can't get them to go ON any bagel halves that I cut but it isn't a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />Don't buy these if you're expecting that pure bagel taste that can only come from plenty of carbs added to the dough. These have their own taste which we find delicious. They are also denser than the bagels we used to eat but this is not an issue for us. All of these factors are offset by the variety added to our low-carb diets!
