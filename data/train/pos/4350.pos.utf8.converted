I have been drinking this tea for YEARS and I must say that after drinking so many other different teas (black, green & white and flavored & unflavored), this is still my favorite.  I buy both the regular & the decaf.<br /><br />My favorite green tea flavor that I have tried from Republic of Tea is the Pineapple Ginger flavor.  You should give both a try !! :)
