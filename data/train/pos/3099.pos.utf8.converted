After reading several recipes for homemade brownies, I decided to play it lazy and go with a box. I used to make Betty Crocker like it was my job, but my husband came home with these instead.<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, enriched bleached flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid), bittersweet chocolate chips (chocolate liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, milk fat, soy lecithin, vanilla). cocoa (processed with alkali). canola or soybean oil, salt, artificial flavor, sodium bicarbonate.<br /><br />So, the ingredients aren't the healthiest thing ever, but they're brownies, not organic kale chips.<br /><br />I followed the directions (1/4 cups water, 1/2 cup veg. oil, 1 egg). I added some vegan chocolate mini-chips that I had in the fridge. I poured the mixture into an 8-by-8 square pan that I greased with glorious butter.  I cooked at 325 for about 42 minutes.<br /><br />I could not allow them to cool before eating half the pan. I was guilt-ridden but it didn't stop me from having one for breakfast the next day. They have chocolate chips, for goodness sake! And they are so, so, dreamily chocolatey and rich. Perrrfect. I don't like bleached flour as an ingredient, I just don't get it, but they tasted good, which is ultimately the point of brownies if you ask me. If you're looking for a healthier option, don't stop here.
