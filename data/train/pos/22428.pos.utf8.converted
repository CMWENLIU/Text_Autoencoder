Because it's nutritious, I bought a total of 96 packets to add to breakfast bags for the homeless. I figure it is a form of quick energy that can be tucked into a pocket to consume later, and no worries about peanut allergies -- It's produced in a 100% peanut-free facility. I tried it myself to make sure the flavor was right. I'd never had almond butter before and it tastes somewhat similar to peanut butter (which I love) but a bit milder, as you might expect. Printed on the package are instructions to squeeze, mix and enjoy (or something to that effect). I had no problem with the ones I tried and would buy again. Very good with 100% whole wheat and sesame seed Ak-Mak crackers, also sold by Amazon.com. It easily squirted out of the packet onto crackers once opened.
