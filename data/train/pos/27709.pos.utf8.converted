I tried this product because I am TRYING to eliminate the white stuff from my diet and as a southerner, I love grits (well, hot cereal to the rest of y'all).  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is on it's own merits. It stands up to any bowl of grits I've ever had. Follow the directions though on the proportion of water to cereal and you won't go wrong.
