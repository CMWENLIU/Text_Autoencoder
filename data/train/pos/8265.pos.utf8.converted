I have ordered these beans twice now. I have made my own vanilla extract, vanilla sugar, homemade chocolate sauce, eggnog, cheese cake, white cake, pancakes, and so on and so on. EXCELLENT!!! The beans are supple and very fragrant! YUM! Makes me want to bake something every time I smell them ;) As others have mentioned, vanilla beans in local stores are $5 per bean on up...this is a great value and I intend to order this over and over again...the taste is wonderful and I go through them fast! Using these beans make me feel like a professional chef ;) Please don't have any doubts, order and enjoy!<br /><br />Update: 03/09/11<br />Still buying them and still very pleased! WONDERFUL!
