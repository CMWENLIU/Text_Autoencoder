Sheep, baboons, elephants, horses, rabbits, lions, turtles, owls, hippos, rhinos, penguins, camels, and bears. Wonderful! Amazing! However, the packaging once again demonstrates the failure of large corporations to understand complex ecosystems, as several of the horses and sheep appear to have had their legs bitten off by the lions and bears. One camel's head was completely eaten, and I had to put it out of its misery. (crunch!) In future, one can only hope that herbivores and carnivores will be packed in separate bags.
