Huy Fong band Sriracha Sauce is an outstanding hot sauce, and relatively inexpensive.  Plus it comes in a fun squeeze bottle!<br /><br />Its medium heat, slightly less hot than the original Tobasco Sauce.  There is a strong garlic flavor and a little sweetness.  Its called an Asian sauce and is wildly popular in the American-Asian community but it truly can go on anything.  Its strong flavor and heat tends to overcome other flavors in food but sometimes that is exactly what you want. College students love it to pep up the food they eat.  This brand contains preservatives so it doesnt need to be refrigerated.  If you like some heat in your food but am tired of Tobasco Sauce give this a try.  Highly reommended.
