I was skeptical when I ordered this the very first time. I like a bold coffee for my first cup of the day and my old favorite, Verona, was terrific. I just hoped I would like the Kitamu enough that I wouldn't have to throw it away. I was hooked from the first sip. The Kitamu is much bolder than the Verona and has a great aroma, and the flavor of the roast really comes through. If you favor breakfast blends and other mild coffees, pass on this one. If you're a fan of Verona and have not tried the Kitamu, give it a spin. You might find a new first cup, too.
