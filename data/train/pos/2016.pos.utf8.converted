These oils are great to use instead of zest or extract.  They are packed with flavor and taste fresh, not fake or alcoholic like many extracts tend to do.  I bought a glass eye dropper to dispense the oil, do not use one with a plastic tube as it can damage it and leave the plastic scarred.  Keep this in mind too if you are using the oils to flavor seltzer water, use glass and not a plastic tumbler.  It tastes fresher and more full bodied than any store-bought flavored seltzer and you only need one drop for a 24 oz glass.<br /><br />I use the lime in Thai dishes, the lemon in chicken marinades and a drop of the orange in cookies is very tasty -- there are a million uses for them.  You can even use them for cocktails.<br /><br />Be aware that once opened, you must keep them in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The gift pack contains an ounce of each oil in a cute little bottle with a narrow neck.  The amazon price breaks down to less than $3 a bottle which I think is a great value.  Since I only need a few drops per recipe, they last a long time.  It is also nice to have the smaller bottles so you have fresher oil; a 1 ounce bottle in the fridge is fresher at the end of its use than a 3 ounce bottle sitting in the fridge for three times as long.  I keep the extras in my pantry until they are needed.
