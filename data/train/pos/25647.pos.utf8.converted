I have been an amazon prime member for a few years, a celiac for 5 years and buy ALOT of stuff thru amazon but have never reviewed any of the items I have purchased, until now. I was hopeful when I saw these at a local store, but cautiously optimistic, as I have a small son with celiac too and love the idea he could know what a smore was. We were so excited, we opened the box in the car. My son loved them and couldnt understand why mommy was crying. THEY ARE THAT GOOD! I highly recommend them.
