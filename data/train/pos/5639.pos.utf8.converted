I like hot sauces for the flavor more than for the heat.  This is the best tasting habanero hot sauce I have ever had (to date).  This sauce does come packing heat, but the flavor is still there and does not ever get drowned out in the heat.<br /><br />It has a lovely blend of flavors that result in a sauce that is more about being a useful sauce than about showcasing the flavors of the peppers or attacking you with heat.  While this particular one is the "Fiery Hot" version of the regular sauce (and indeed comes packing heat) this is still a relatively mild Habanero sauce in my opinion but it is still quite a bit hotter than the regular version of this sauce.  For those who just want a sauce that makes people cry, you will do better elsewhere.  For those who want to use it for food, this is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />This sauce has been a staple in my house for the last 3 years since I found it, and seems excellent with absolutely anything.  Top recommended in my book.
