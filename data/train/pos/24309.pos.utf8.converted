Tastes like what's served in Thai restaurants.  Brews up nicely in the coffee pot, especially if you're looking to make larger quantities quickly.  To cut back back on the fat and sugar, I enjoy with unsweetened coconut milk, which is apparently a traditional variation (can find in the Baltimore area in the Asian section of WalMart, Food Lion and Safeway--no luck so far in the local Giant).  Makes it creamy and slightly sweet.  Good value with the free shipping.  Give it a try!
