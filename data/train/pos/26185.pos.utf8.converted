I'll be honest. Originally, I was looking to buy a different brand name of Kipper Snacks, but it was not available at the time. So by purchasing the Polar Kippers instead, ended up being a better choice for me. In fact my Dad enjoys them as well! They have a great texture and natural smoked flavor that I enjoy eating with Saltine Crackers, or just right out of the can!. I will definitely continue buying these!~ :-)
