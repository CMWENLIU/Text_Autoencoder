Good cereal.  It is cereal...not granola bars, if you're wondering.<br /><br />- not too sweet<br />- large chunks of the good stuff (coconut, almonds)<br />- healthy<br />- crunchy<br />- much smaller box than normal cereals, but has same amount<br />- maybe enough for 4 bowls of cereal<br />- in my opinion, not worth $7/box (maybe $3 or 4)<br />- more snackable than museli.  (this Kashi has larger chunks.)<br /><br />Check out my uploaded pictures for evidence :-)
