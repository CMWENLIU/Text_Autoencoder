I think the FDA should classify these things as illegal drugs.  They're so darn good that I can't even have them in the house (I haven't bought them from this vendor (and I won't comment on the price), so I'm just talking about the Golden Double Stuff Oreos, themselves).  While I was binging on them, I'd force myself to eat "only" one "line" of 11 cookies a day (there are 3 convenient "lines" in each pack and that re-sealable flap on the front is great for easy access while keeping them fresh during their short existence in my vicinity).  Even so, as I continued to shovel them in, I'd sit there moaning about how my liver and pancreas were hurting, my teeth and tongue were coated with fur, and my eyes were jiggling around in their sockets.  Sometimes, some crumbs would fall out of my mouth while I was complaining and I'd have to root around for the errant pieces like a pig looking for truffles.<br /><br />Now, given their ingredients:<br /><br />"UNBLEACHED ENRICHED FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, THIAMINE MONONITRATE [VITAMIN B1], RIBOFLAVIN [VITAMIN B2], FOLIC ACID), SUGAR, HIGH OLEIC CANOLA AND/OR PALM OIL, DEXTROSE, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CORNSTARCH, SALT, BAKING SODA, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR, SOY LECITHIN. CONTAINS WHEAT, SOY."<br /><br />You might do as I did and say, "Heck, they're not that bad.  After all, I can pronounce (and even recognize) most of those things."  But, according to the label, the Serving Size is two (hah!) cookies.  Those two cookies contain 150 calories and 7 grams of fat.  Plugging that into the old Weight Watcher's point formula gives 3 points per 2 cookies.  Four cookies is, essentially, a full meal.  The 11 cookie "line" I was eating was the equivalent of 2/3 of my daily point allotment.  Of course, with the pain in my liver and fur on my tongue, I really didn't feel any desire for any actual meals.  So, I guess the points evened out in the end.<br /><br />Anyway, I've banned them from the house (I've been Oreo free for maybe a month, now).  I still have to force myself to not go down the cookie aisle, though.  And, if I do succumb and enter the aisle, I stand there and stare at the package with a mournful, puppy-dog look on my face while I yell at myself (on the inside) to just walk away.  So, I rate these at an absolutely wonderful, perfect, yummy, delicious, etc. 5 stars out of 5 and wish they were illegal.  Darn, they're good.  A 6-pack, hmmm....
