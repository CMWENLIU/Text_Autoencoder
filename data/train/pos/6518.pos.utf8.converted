I originally tried this as a free sample. It was really good especially when I would bake my fish. So I had to buy more of it. It lasted me a pretty good while because I didn't use it for everything so as to not get tired of the flavor. I ran out of that so now I ordered it from amazon. It came nicely packaged and in a glass jar instead of the plastic that I had before. I have yet to use this one but it smells good and looks good so I'm expecting what I had before. It has a healthy fresh taste which makes anything more special like from a restaurant or chef.
