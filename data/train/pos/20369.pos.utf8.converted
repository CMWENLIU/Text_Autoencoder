This product is a staple at our house. My family loves it. If you are a fan of dirty rice and beans or black beans in general, I think you will like it too. Prepare according to package directions. I add a chopped onion and 1/2 pound of Echrich Smoked Beef sausage, diced. If you want to stretch it even further, add a handful of rice. Everything goes in the pot at the same time. In 25 minutes it is ready to eat. It serves as a hearty main dish for three or as a side dish for a larger family. This is a mildly spicy dish. A few dashes of Tabasco will kick it up for those that like it hot.<br /><br />I was thrilled to see Vigo Black Beans and Rice on Amazon's grocery list. Where I live, this product is hard to find. Amazon had a great price too!
