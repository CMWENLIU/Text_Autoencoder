my rescue dog has always thrown up a lot. a few times a week at times.<br />he also likes to eat grass. i switched around to various dog foods looking for the answer. after buying blue buffalo life protection he has only thrown up once in a month. he has also quit eating grass. i didn't have to blend blue buffalo with how old dog food. i just poured it in his bowl and he loved it. this is a PICKY dog as well. some dog foods he just wouldn't eat. i know that blue buffalo has superior ingredients to most grocery stores food. this has made a BIG difference in the way he looks and act as well. not having to clean up dog throw up a few times a week is worth the extra cost between cheap dog food and great dog food. the dogs that died from poisons in their food were from cheap, artificial ingredients. i love my dog so much i would do anything and spend anything to keep him around longer. wouldn't you?
