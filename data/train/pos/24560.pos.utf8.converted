I had bought the Reese artichoke hearts from  Amazon on a couple of occasions and they were uneven quality-wise.<br />These are far better.  No stringy bits, no thick leaves too chewy to be delectable, and no dented cans.<br />The only caveat, if this could be a problem for you, is that these are small, quartered pieces.<br />As I usually cut them,  this saves me a step, but if you want them whole be forewarned.
