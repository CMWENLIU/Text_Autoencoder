Annie's Naturals Mustard is the only mustard I have found without any potential form of Monosodium Glutamate. All of the other mustards I have used contained the word "spices." Since the term "spices" can legally have a very broad meaning, I vowed to stay away from it. Luckily I found Annie's.<br /><br />While the size is awkward at first, it is easy to adjust to. Annie's is thicker than the average mustard, but all it takes is a spoon to dig the rest out.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, it is slightly stronger than other mustards I have tried. It is hard to explain, but it tastes much more like a pure mustard than the tamer ones out there.<br /><br />Combine all of that with the USDA Organic label and I am sold. This is a must buy.
