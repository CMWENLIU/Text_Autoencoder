The Napolitains are wonderful for people who enjoy chocolate on its own.  The pure chocolate pieces are great as an expression of high-quality chocolate.  People who enjoy the pleasant bitterness of pure cocoa will be especially impressed by the Sao Tome.  The flavored pieces stick with classic combinations and provide some nice variety and contrast.  The product descripton's suggestion of offering the assortment after dinner is good, especially with coffee. I find they are very nice to set out at parties or just for everyday guests, too.  It's so nice to just have a taste as I run out the door.  The best part is that none of these disappoint because they're all chocolate with no mystery fillings.<br /><br />Leonidas' packaging for shipping will protect the box and ensure it arrives safely.  You should get them in 3 days and eat them fresh, although the Napolitains store well, too.  They're best if enjoyed at room temperature.
