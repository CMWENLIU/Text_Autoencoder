I happened to find these by chance at my local health-food co-op today (on sale even).  I shared them with people at work and everyone agreed, no RAVED, that they were outrageously good!  And bonus - the company is fair trade, organic, and use permaculture.  If they weren't in Miami, I'd send them a resume'!  So different from the standard destroy-the-planet-and-abuse-your-employees corporate criminals I'm used to.  It's a pleasure to spend a few dollars on these and get a delicious snack.  Trust me - try them (or any of the others, I presume - although organic fair trade vegan dark chocolate covered CACAO nibs?  Chocolate covered chocolate????  hey, I guess..for the true chocolate/cacao addict!)  Thanks, Kopali!!
