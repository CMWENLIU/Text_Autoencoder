Doing research, I found that "crema" is the froth or foam that comes out of some espresso machines. Being thicker, espresso can create more foam or froth when it brews in commercial coffee shop machines, and this foam or froth (called "crema") is enjoyed for it's own qualities in Europe as it floats atop the espresso.<br /><br />The Signature Crema Coffee t-discs from Gevalia creates a slightly smaller sized cup of coffee with a "head" on it. The Tassimo machines are capable of pumping air through the water, creating froth or foam. Creamer discs usually take advantage of this to make cappucino with frothed cream. The crema coffees, like this one, froth the brew, giving a good amount of foam. The roast is relatively smooth and a little stronger than the Signature Blend, and the serving size a little smaller. Most likely, it brews a little less coffee so as not to dilute the froth, and that gives it a slightly stronger flavor.<br /><br />If you like coffee with a head or froth on it, these will yield good results. I keep a few on hand for novelty or a change of pace (or when I forget and run out of the regular coffee). Crema is a different type of coffee though as the air being pumped through the brew does alter it slightly. If you enjoy coffee with cream and sugar, you most likely will not enjoy this. If you enjoy black coffee, then chances are much better you'll appreciate this one.
