I used to enjoy these when I was a child; it brings back fond memories of walking to the corner store with my best friend on a hot summer day and buying one of each flavor (watermelon, blue raspberry and cherry.)  We'd sit by my grandmother's pool and squeeze out the gooey goodness.  These are hard to find, rarely seen in stores and the only ones that I can find around here are the sour versions (which in my opinion, are horrible!)  Thanks for selling these!
