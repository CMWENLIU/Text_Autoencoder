We used to just dump our compostable kitchen stuff straight into the composting crock, and it was always a horrendous mess when we would carry it out to the main compost bin to empty.  Now that I've started using these bags, it's a much less unpleasant task (and we empty the crock more often now, too, because we aren't both trying to put the task off hoping the other will break down and do it instead! :D )<br /><br />A couple of caveats: the bags ARE, as advertised, biodegradable, so if you leave them in the crock full of wet kitchen scraps for too long, they will start to seep liquid out into the crock.  It's more like osmosis - they don't really seem to develop holes at this point, but they kind of ooze liquid through a little bit.  I'd say five days is the maximum time you should leave them in there.  If you forget and they do start to seep, however, the task of taking the bag out to the compost bin and then washing the crock is still much less objectionable, since the inside of the crock is only wet, not stuck full of coffee grounds and bits of eggshell and all that other stuff I used to hate having to clean out of it every time.<br /><br />They are also a bit fragile.  The practice of cramming in as much stuff as you can by shoving down on top of the contents is just not a good idea here - the bags can be easily torn by hard materials such as banana stems, eggshells, grape stems and the like.<br /><br />So basically the upshot of the whole thing is: don't shove too much into the compost crock, remove the bags often, and you will find that these bags make your counter-top compost collecting a much more pleasant task.
