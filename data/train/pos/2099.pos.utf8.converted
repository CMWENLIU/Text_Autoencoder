Upon opening this can of almonds we first noticed the fresh aroma - a very good sign.  They tasted as if they'd been packed yesterday.<br /><br /> We love chocolate covered nuts, but these are the first nuts we have tried that were covered with a chocolate powder rather than the usual chocolate glaze, and we liked the change very much.  The powder coating seemed to enrich the taste of the nuts rather than covering it.<br /><br /> We have found them to be appreciated when served with pre-dinner cocktails or as an after supper treat.  They're a welcome addition to our pantry shelf!
