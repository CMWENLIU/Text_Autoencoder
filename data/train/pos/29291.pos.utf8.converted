Like many people, I grew up eating Oatmeal for breakfast some days, especially during the winter months. My memories of it were not terribly fond though, as it was always soupy and weak. We always had to dump on the brown sugar or maple syrup to give it any flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />I continued to buy instant oatmeal through college and into adulthood, but would always use far less water than called for on the package, mainly just to give it some texture. I thought that was the best oatmeal could get.<br /><br />Then one day someone made me a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, and it was seriously like Oatmeal reinvented! For one it looks nothing like rolled oats--instead of flat little flakes these are like little pellets. When cooked, steel cut oatmeal gets an awesome "al dente" consistency that is both smooth and chewy. But more importantly, steel cut oatmeal has a wonderful rich flavor I've never tasted in rolled oats. I find that with this I only add a very minimal amount of sweetener (usually maple syrup but honey also works). Sometimes I add some cranberries or fresh blueberries if I have them, but it is perfectly delicious sans extras.<br /><br />Yes, it takes preparation, but it's the best use of my rice cooker I've found (ironically I use it more for oatmeal than I do for rice!). I just pour in the oatmeal and water the night before, set the cooker to porridge mode and set the timer for whatever time I want to eat. In the morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of the cooking oats and by the time I'm dressed and ready for breakfast, they're all ready to go.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough. They're really good tasting, yet good for you. Hard to beat that!
