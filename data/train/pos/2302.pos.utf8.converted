Cinnamon Roll (not to be confused with Brown Sugar Cinnamon) is, without a doubt, the most delicious of all Pop-Tart flavors.  These tarts are lightly iced with white squiggles, so they're not overly sweet like some of the other varieties.  The crust is perfect, and the filling tastes just like a cinnamon roll (hence the name).  Unlike a real cinnamon roll, however, there's no sticky syrup to get all over your hands, so you can easily grab one of these pastries as you head off to work or school.  They are, truly, "Crazy Good."<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: Each pastry contains 210 calories; 7 grams of fat; 14 grams of sugar; 34 grams of carbohydrates; 2 grams of protein; and NO cholesterol whatsoever.
