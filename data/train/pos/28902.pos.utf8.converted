It is a rich and smooth cooking bar.<br /><br />I used to buy Ghirardelli broken block from trader joes for about $3-$4/LB before they stop carried it. I usually mixed it with 70% dark pound plus from trader joes and honey for chocolate mousse recipe from Jamie Oliver. It create a extra smooth, rich taste, semi sweet and very chocolaty mousse.
