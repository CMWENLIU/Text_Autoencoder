One of the main draws of this cereal was not only that it was gluten free, but also that it was made with whole grain brown rice.  Whole grains both taste better and are better for you, and with the variety of whole grain products on the market today, there is no reason why anyone should settle for less.  Unless, of course, you are gluten-free, and then your problems take on an entirely different nature.  So it is with an eye for health and not just for Celiacs that I write this review.<br /><br />First of all, as a gluten-free cereal, it does what it sets out to do: recreate the experience of regular Rice Krispies.  And it does!  The familiar snap, crackle, and pop are there, and though the cereal gets soggy a bit more quickly than the original, the diference is negligible.  And of course, since there's no gluten, it won't make those of us who are gluten-sensitive sick.<br /><br />But nutritionally, how does it compare to its gluten-laced counterpart?  Well, first of all, it's heavier.  The serving size is merely one cup compared to the original's 1 1/4 cups per serving.  But one serving of each is still 33 grams.  The gluten free version is very slightly lower in calories (120/serving as opposed to 128), but a little higher in fat (1 gram of fat and 10 calories from fat as opposed to 0.3 grams of fat and 3 calories from fat).  It seems like a lot, but both are still extremely low-fat, and a serving of gluten-free rice krispies has a whopping 2% of the daily recommended amount of fat.  Interestingly enough, the original has 0.1 g of saturated fat, while the gluten-free version has none at all.<br /><br />The gluten-free one is lower in both sodium (190 mg vs. 299 mg) and sugar (&lt;1 g vs. 3.1 g).  It's higher in dietary fiber (1 g vs. 0.3 g) and protein (3 g vs. 2.3 g).  Those last two may seem pretty insignificant, but if you're on a gluten-free diet you have to work hard to get as much fiber as you can (because most of it in a normal diet is found in whole wheat bread).<br /><br />Where am I going with this?  Well, it would seem that the gluten free rice krispies , though having a tiny bit more fat than the original, overall is moderately to significantly healthier.  And not just for people on a gluten-free diet--vegetarians would benefit from knowing that the gluten-free version has more protein in it, and it is a good complement to the other incomplete protein in soy milk or almond milk.<br /><br />On the issue of the ingredients:  Traditional Rice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, Vitamin c, Vitamin E, niacinamide, Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B1, folic acid, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin D.  Gluten Free Rice Krispies contains whole grain brown rice, sugar, and a tiny bit of salt and BHT.  Impressive enough as it is that the gluten-free version can have fewer ingredients, supplements, and coloring agents than its original counterpart, it still contains the preservative BHT.  BHT is there to increase the shelf life of your cereal and to maintain the vitamins naturally found in brown rice.  However, while BHT is marketed in health food stores as a healthy supplement, some people are concerned about it causing adverse health effects.  Regardless, it is approved as a food additive by the FDA, and we consume it in vastly greater quantities in many other types of food, such as soy sauce and potato chips.<br /><br />Unless you are actively avoiding any and all forms of BHT or BHA (and if so, I congratulate you for your determination), I would recommend you give this cereal a try.  It is tasty, healthy, and a great way to start the morning!
