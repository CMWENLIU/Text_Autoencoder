Main reason for buying: weight loss<br /><br />Compelling force: Other reviews and product description influenced my decision to buy. I'd previously tried the lipton original green tea which was terribly bitter, so definitely needed an alternative option.<br /><br />Taste: light blueberry smell and flavour. Not bitter due to the blueberry. However, after trying it without any additives, I decided to add pure honey and low fat milk (1%) and these made it taste a lot better. Drinking it as it was prior to the additives was like drinking hot water with sprinkles of light blueberry.<br /><br />Effect: Tends to fill me up and does not make me feel hungry for hours. Be mindful of the caffeine as well as it may keep you up if taken too late at night. My belly feels less bloated as my metabolic rate increases with the tea. Remember to exercise as well for better results. I suppose that's just common sense if you're attempting to lose weight.<br /><br />Verdict: It does work and I tend to jump around a lot due to the caffeine. I have actually become more impulsive (in a nice way) and energetic. Went on a 10-mile bike ride last weekend and was never hungry or thirsty.<br /><br />Recommendation: Yes, I would recommend it to a friend. However, you need to make some time for it. I drink an average of 3 cups daily. Go figure !!! Good luck
