This is a very good tasting salt especially on freshly popped popcorn.  I use it in everything. I no longer use the regular table salt becuase this just really enhances food without the metallic taste of table salt or the somtimes to salty taste table salt has.  You will think your food was prepared by a fine dine chef.  Buy a non-corrosive grinder to use this salt and you will never use table salt again.
