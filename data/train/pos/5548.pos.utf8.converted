I have purchase this product on 3 different occasions to re-create a French cooking class we attended while in Paris a few years ago. The product has always arrived in top shape, carefully packaged and kept cold with a cold pack. We have found that the shipper has taken care to roll the package rather than fold it which could lead to breakage of the very thin product. We have always been most pleased with the performance of the product and our dining/cooking companions had no difficulty utilizing the dough in spite of it being their first introduction to its use. We would have been at a loss to create one of the class' signature dishes without it. It has always worked well for us.
