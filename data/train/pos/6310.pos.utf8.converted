I have two adult male beagles and have tried quite a few "boutique" level dog foods from Innova and Orijen over the past couple of years since they seem to be perennial favorites.  I monitored my dogs closely from their stools to their coat and immediate response after eating.  I found the Innova lines to make them lick their chops for about 10 minutes after each meal (likely due to the very high protein levels).  They also gained a little bit of weight so I had to cut down their intake (to what seemed like almost nothing).  This food, as I understand, is better suited for high-energy/activity dogs.<br /><br />The original Orijen was better, but the fish-based proteins and Omega 3s ranked high for me, so I ended up switching to the 6 Fish.  They've been enjoying it for a little over a year and the popularity has grown so much that at one point this year, it was almost impossible to find.  It has also received a few awards this past year.  The 29.7 lb bag lasts the two about 2 months.<br /><br />In short, Orijen 6 Fish has drastically improved the coat, stool, energy level, and overall health of my two beagles compared to any store bought brands.
