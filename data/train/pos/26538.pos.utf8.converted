I am not really a big candy person, but I received these white chocolates for Christmas, and let's just say I have a new found love of white chocolate. I have never had something so wonderful. It is truely a heavenly chocolate experience. If you haven't tried them you must, if you have, then welcome to the world of fine chocolates. Amen!!!
