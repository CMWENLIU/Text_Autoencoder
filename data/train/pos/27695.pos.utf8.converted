I have two Havanese boys and the older one is the pickiest eater you will ever meet. My boys did well on Blue Buffalo but used to pick out the lifesource bits, leave them behind, and make a huge mess. As for Castor & Pollux Ultramix, they don't leave a single drop behind. They even clean up anything they dropped on the floor. I am very pleased with the quality of the food and even happier that they are getting nutritional goodies such as dried fruits. It is especially ideal for my older one who used to suffer allergic reactions and has a very sensitive stomach. Thanks Castor & Pollux!
