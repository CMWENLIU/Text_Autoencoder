My husband and I are big fans of powdered coffee creamer and we use a LOT. After realizing that the regular stuff is chock-full of partially hydrogenated oil (and also flammable, apparently) I started looking for an alternative. Nature's First is good stuff. Since there is no corn syrup solids it lacks the subtle sweetness of the regular non-dairy powdered creamer, but if you use sugar you probably won't notice anyway. If you're a fan of powdered coffee creamer and you're looking for a healthier (or at least a non-hydrogenated) way to lighten your java, I highly recommend this stuff.
