I have to start with the fact that I was extremely skeptical on a chocolate coconut water.  I expected a watered down chocolate milk taste.  I was actually resistant to try it the first time for fear of ruining my coconut water experience.  Needless to say with my five star rating I was impressed. This beverage is hands down the healthiest way to get your chocolate fix and hydrate at the same time.  I have converted at least half a dozen people over to this beverage.  Everyone has that "commercial" look of being surprised on how good it is.  I highly recommend this product and think it is a home run for Zico.  I expect some of the other brands to follow soon.
