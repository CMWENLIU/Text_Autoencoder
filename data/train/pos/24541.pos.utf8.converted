I have tried every one of Cafe Britt's coffees and, although all are very good, I like this one the best. To me it has a rich, nutty flavor that I can drink all day. Cafe Britt uses an all-purpose grind which works well as drip or as expresso. I brew it as expresso and find that the flavor remains smooth and is never bitter whether I'm drinking it hot in winter or iced in summer. In the summer, I make a carafe and put it in the fridge to chill. Then, when I want iced coffee, I just put milk, ice and my cold expresso in a large glass for "instant" iced "cafe con leche". Very refreshing on a hot summer morning!
