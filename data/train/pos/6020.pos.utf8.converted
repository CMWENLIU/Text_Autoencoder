I've been buying these "bones" for my two small/medium size pups for a while now and they go banana's for them! Neither has ever had a problem with them and I like that they last a little longer than regular dog treats. I had been trying to find a natural alternative to greenies. With these, I break a medium bone in half each get's one half and it last's them about 15 minutes, pretty decent for a natural chew bone. They are pricey, but I think worth it!
