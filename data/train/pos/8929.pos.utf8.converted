<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VEQUIW">1 Pound - French Gray Sea Salt - Light Grey (Coarse) - Bag -"Sel Gris De Gu&eacute;rande" French Sea Salt</a>  Don't know why, but when using this - there is a something special flavor added.  Never used anything but regular table salt.  But I am hooked!!!
