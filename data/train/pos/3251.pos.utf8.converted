I love granola, so I was thrilled to try this product.  I eat as a snack (i.e., right out of the bag) rather than a cereal.  Before I even tasted it, I checked out the nutritional profile, and I was extremely pleased.  Compared to other granolas, "Love Crunch" (love the name!) is relatively love in fat (6 grams overall, 1 gram saturated) and quite low in sugar (6 grams, just slightly over a teaspoon--most granolas are loaded with added sugar!).  The also are 2 grams of protein (a bit on the low side since this granola doesn't contain nuts), 2 grams of fiber, and 14 grams whole grains per serving.<br /><br />Of course, a serving size is only 1/4 cup, which is quite small--and that's where the problem comes in.  When I first tried the granola, I'm sure I ate WAY more than a serving; I could have easily finished off half the bag if I hadn't stopped myself!  (For reference, the bag actually contains about TEN servings.)  This granola has a GREAT taste: it is surprisingly sweet given the lack of added sugar (it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice), but it is also nicely oat-y, with a bit of a chocolate flavor as well (from the added cocoa).  The granola has little bits of dried berries--these kind of get lost in there, but what you DEFINITELY notice is the tiny little chunks of dark chocolate!  Finally, I also loved the texture of the granola, which included plenty of big clumps.<br /><br />Frankly, I can't imagine anyone who likes granola and chocolate NOT liking this product--highly recommended!
