First time I tried these was when a friend brought them back from shopping in the city's Chinatown. She had bought them mainly because I love octopus and the little character on the bag is so cute. Turned out I ended up loving the chip itself too!<br /><br />These tako chips are rather thick and crunchy (though not hard) and aren't much similar to a potato chip. They are very light and have a pleasant texture. The chips are a rather cute fish shape as well.<br /><br />Of course, the most important thing is the flavor. It's very light and not super "in-your-face." When you eat one, it's not like you're being slapped in the face with seafood. That's not to say someone who hates seafood would like them, but it's not too strong and overpowering. The flavor is very delicious, and they are absolutely my favorite seafood flavored snack food I've had.
