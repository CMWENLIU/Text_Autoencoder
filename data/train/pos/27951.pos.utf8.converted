I'm not from Australia where Vegemite is so popular but I heard the song "Down Under" and always wondered what Vegemite was. I found out that its a yeast product made from the process of beer brewing. What I was intrigued about is that it is vegetarian but with a beef flavor. I ordered it through Amazon's Marketplace and here it came all the way from Britain. I spread some on a piece of bread and decided immediately that it was an acquired taste, but then again after a few days I found myself using it fairly often especially on crackers. Well, my wife started putting it in soups and that really cinched my love for it. It's very good for you and a new taste sensation to try if you like being a little adventuresome.
