We stumbled upon these on Amazon after our local Indian restaurant closed.  They are the same as we used to get when eating out.  They used to call them "papadoms".  This is a big quantity (20 packages of about 12 to 15 or so in each) but we freeze them, so they last a long, long time.  Amazon's price is less than $1.40 a package, which is a bargain.<br /><br />The restaurant would cook them in a hot broiler and occasionally deep-fry them, but I like them best microwaved.  Only about 20 seconds or so on each side, until they bubble and get crispy.  If there are any flat or uncooked areas, microwave them again for another 10 seconds or so.<br /><br />Black pepper style is the best and has a little zip to it, we often eat them with salsa, (like a tortilla-chip).<br />Great with a cold beer.
