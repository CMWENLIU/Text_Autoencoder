It is so difficult to find a decent slice of bread when you have Celiac disease. Well, that all changes now, you can have your bread and eat it too! Just use ORGRAN GLUTEN SUBSTITUTE.<br /><br />Pros:  If you have a good non-gluten bread recipe, this product will enhance the bread, giving you a more pliable slice of bread that will not break apart as you eat your sandwich. Now you can eat pizza, biscuits, scones, muffins and pasta. Yeah!<br /><br />Cons: The directions on how to use the product are not specific.  It says: "Simply add 1 part GfG (product) to 5 parts of gluten free flour..."  It gives examples that put you in the ball park of what you need.  I finally figured out that I needed to add between 1/3 to 1/2 Cup of product to my recipe.  It also doesn't mention that you should add a little more water to the batter. I added about 1/8 Cup more water. The dough was very thick and sticky, but it came out great.<br /><br />All in all, I can recommend this product whole heartedly, without reservation. It does a nice job and the added cost is only about [...] more to the bread, which is still way cheaper than commercial non-gluten bread.<br /><br />For the bread recipe that I used, go to: [...] website and use the "Really Good Sandwich Bread" recipe. Read the comments, they give really good tips to get the best loaf of non-gluten bread ever! I also used Jodi's flour mixture. It is an inexpensive blend of non-gluten flours that are easy to find. Her comments are worth their weight in gold.
