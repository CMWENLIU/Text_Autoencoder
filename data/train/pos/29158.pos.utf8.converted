OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :<br /><br />Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!
