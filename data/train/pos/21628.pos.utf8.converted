I would like to start out by saying that I am picky about salt. Iodized salt has no character and kosher salt can be very overpowering. Sea salt can be a hit or miss. Some sea salts can be intensely salty while others lack any panache.<br /><br />But this salt is beautifully pink and its flavor is mild and balanced with a wonderful finish. It has the character and class expected of a salt in its category.<br /><br />Extra points for packaging..I loove the space-efficient airtight design with screw on lid. It's easy to store in my already full spice cabinet. And the price is perfect.<br /><br />Kudos for affordability, health benefits, design, ease of use, and taste!!!!!
