I found this salt one day in an Italian deli in Half Moon Bay, CA.  I got really hooked on the coarse variety.  After I ran out I tried other coarse salts, but they were not the same!  These crystals are smaller...just the right size, and NOT TOO SALTY.  Its hard to describe, but it makes all foods better.  You get that little crunchy taste which adds so much to fresh tomatoes, pasta, any food which needs a little salt.  I only use this right before eating....not in cooking. (I use the regular iodized salt to get my iodine when cooking!)<br /> The whole idea is that you want that texture and flavor.  I send for this online , and pay shipping (!) because I like it so much!  Highly recommended.
