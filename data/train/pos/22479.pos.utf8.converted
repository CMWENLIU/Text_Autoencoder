I have been drinking this Rooibos from Davidson's, along with their South African Honeybush, for the past six months, and I can't believe I was missing out on these great tea varieties for so long. This Rooibos has a delicious aroma and makes some of the best homemade iced tea I've ever tasted, with a gorgeous deep red color. Just be sure to store it in an airtight container after your tea arrives, because it comes in a paper bag that is not meant for long-term storage and will let the aroma out.
