I never thought I would spend the extra money for instant beans.I've been eating these for 15 or 20 years and they are amazing.No canned taste and they're seasoned but,not hot.With tortillas in the freezer and these beans in the cupboard,I always have comfort food in the house.I don't bother boiling water,I just microwave.Fantastic Foods is awesome.
