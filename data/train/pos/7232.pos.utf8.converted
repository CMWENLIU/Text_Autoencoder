I know this product looks expensive. I was a little hesitant at first to buy it. But OMG it is remarkable. I had tried everything to get my dogs skin to clear up. They live inside and would scratch and scratch. They were on flea medicine so I kept taking them to the vet. It would cost me about 500.00 each time and their skin would only get slightly better. So I switched vets and they asked me what my dogs were eating. I told them Dog Chow. They advised I pay 80.00 for one of there bags. On a budget we couldnt afford it but I did decide to go to Petsmart and look at the back of the bags of food to find one for my dogs. While there I spoke with a very nice woman who told me maybe my dogs are allergic to grains. It all kind of clicked when she said it. I noticed my dogs were getting yeast infections in their ears and could smell the yeasty smell from them. I switched them a little over a year and cant even tell you how amazing they look. Their coats are so shiny when I take them for walks everyone tells me how beautiful they are. They each gained around 10lbs. This food is solid protein so they dont eat as much but they LOVE this food. My advice to people who are looking for something that will help their dogs skin allergies would be this. I know it seems expensive but its a lot cheaper then taking your dog to the vet and definately more healthy. You can also get a 5.00 coupon from their site.
