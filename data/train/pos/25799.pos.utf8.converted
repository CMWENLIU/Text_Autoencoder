Hi Folks, I'm very surprised that no one has tried this sauce and felt moved to write a review.  I'll try and do it justice.  First you will notice the texture, it is lite, with chunks of tomato.  You get the feeling that you are the one making it, reducing the sauce but you stop before it goes too far.  The texture is unlike any other I have ever experienced.  Being use to the industrial blender smooth and heavy feel of typical commercial sauces I knew I was on to something when I first spread this one.  Once you've baked it up with you favorite topping you will absolutely melt when you taste it.  I said to myself, "where have you been all my life"?  Again the taste is lite and zesty, definitely say "hello, how do you like me now"!  I hope you will give it a try.  I plan on hunting down and trying their other sauces.  Good Luck and Enjoy!
