I've tried pretty much all the no calorie and low calorie sugar substitutes available. None of them are perfect. Don't expect anything to taste exactly like sugar except sugar because there is nothing that tastes exactly like sugar except for sugar. That is a fact. The human taste buds, especially in certain individuals, are extremely sensitive to the various flavors each sweetener provides. Often sweeteners are compared to sugar, but in reality high calorie sugar substitutes like fructose even taste different from sugar. So please stop comparing other sweeteners to sugar, because only sugar tastes exactly like sugar, and attempting to find a sweetener with a different molecular structure that tastes exactly like sugar is impossible because the human taste buds can sense even the slightest difference in the molecular structure of the sweetener.<br /><br />Now with that said, there are today available many sweeteners each with their own positive and negative attributes. The number one sweetener in the world is sugar, and most people find sugar to be the best tasting sweetener. That's why it's number one. The low calorie alternatives include both natural sweeteners (erythritol, stevia, xylitol, lo han, etc.) and man-made sweeteners (nutrasweet, saccharine, splenda, etc.).<br /><br />This product is a mix of the three natural sweeteners erythritol, isomaltulose, and reb A (a sweetener extracted from stevia), as well as natural flavors to make the taste more like sugar.<br /><br />Erythritol is a great all natural low calorie sweetener on it's own, but it lacks depth, and imparts sort of a watery sweetness unless mixed with other sweeteners. It goes very well with stevia, and is commonly found mixed with stevia based sweeteners, as is the case in this product. The combination greatly enriches the sweetness of each of the two distinct sweeteners.<br /><br />Stevia normally contains stevioside, reb A (rebaudioside A), reb C (rebaudioside C), and dulcoside A. Of these, reb A is the most desirable, sweetest, and lacks the bitterness of the others. Most high quality stevia products contain mostly reb A. Reb A on it's own has a shallow but pleasant sweetness. It's a sharp sweetness and goes very well with other sweeteners that help broaden it's sweetness such as xylitol, erythritol, sugar, lo han, etc. The fact that PureVia only uses reb A from stevia means that it has none of the bitter aftertaste of some of the other popular stevia products available.<br /><br />Isomaltulose is a full calorie sweetener very similar to sugar but like erythritol and reb A it does not promote tooth decay. It's presence helps to give PureVia a richer full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Ok, so those are the facts, but how does it actually stand up against the other sweeteners available? The taste is excellent. Most of the people I know who've tried it like it a lot. It has a flavor very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners out there, it has its own unique flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste or unnatural chemical taste present. It's sweetness is full bodied, not thin or watery. The manufacturers did a fantastic job of mixing the various sweeteners together to produce a rich full bodied sweetness. It has none of the drawbacks of most common stevia products (a thin flavor, bitter aftertaste), none of the drawbacks of erythritol (watery sweetness), and to top it off its all natural. What natural flavors are added are of course a trade secret, and these are partially responsible for PureVia's flavor being very similar to sugar.<br /><br />PureVia is simply one of the best sugar substitutes you can buy. There are a few others that are as good (such as NuStevia and Truvia), but each one has its own unique flavor. Not everyone is going to agree on which one is the best tasting because each person has their own taste preferences.<br /><br />I really like PureVia's individual tube packets better than those of most other products. They are easier to use. They are tubes rather than flat envelopes. This makes it much easier to dispense.<br /><br />One bit of advice, if you're very picky about a full bodied sweetness, no matter which sweetener you prefer, using more than one sweetener nearly always improves the flavor profile. For example, a mix of splenda, nutrasweet, and saccharine will give a more full bodied flavor than each one can alone. The same is true for the natural sweeteners. Sugar and fructose together give a richer taste when combined together. Stevia and lo han give a richer taste when combined together. In general, the more sweeteners you combine, the richer the taste. You can get a sweetness that is better than sugar alone by mixing different sweeteners together. Also keep in mind that natural low calorie sweeteners like stevia and lo han vary dramatically from one brand to another, with the more refined ones generally being the most expensive and best tasting.<br /><br />A combination I often use is saccharine mixed with a stevia based sweetener (such as PureVia, NuStevia, Sun Crystals, etc.). Saccharin was once thought to cause cancer in humans, but this is no longer believed to be true. Recent tests show it to be one of the safest manmade sugar substitutes available (far better for you than Splenda or Nutrasweet) and it is VERY CHEAP. I use a little bit, just enough to give the other sweetener a richer flavor. Saccharine has an off flavor that's unpleasant if too much is added, so I only add it as a booster. The other low calorie sweetener I'll sometimes add is all natural lo han (such as Lo Han Sweet, Sweet Sensation Natural Luo Han Guo Syrup, etc.). Lo han has a very unique taste, almost like brown sugar or honey. It's rather pricey so I'll use just a little bit. It greatly enhances the sweetness of other sweeteners. I avoid using splenda and nutrasweet because they are obviously very unhealthy. Splenda gives me stomach pains, and nutrasweet makes me feel drugged (driving on a nutrasweet drugged brain is dangerous), so I avoid those like the plague.<br /><br />Give this product a try. Only you will know if YOU like it or not. It is one of the best stevia based products you can buy. Because it uses only reb A from stevia, it doesn't have the infamous bitter taste of many other stevia products. Similar stevia based products with the same quality include NuStevia and Truvia. Sun Crystals is another new stevia based product that I like. It's stevia mixed with sugar, but the stevia extract is not pure reb A and therefore it has a slight aftertaste like Sweetleaf has, but I like it nonetheless.<br /><br />People who like stevia in general are likely going to love this product. People who've tried bad quality stevia in the past and were put off by the bitterness of a poor quality stevia product should give this product a shot. It's not truly a stevia product, because it only contains reb A, and none of the other sweeteners and compounds found in stevia that impart a bitter aftertaste. Reb A is a very decent sweetener, much better than the other sweeteners found in stevia. Most stevia products contain a mix of all the sweeteners found in stevia, plus other compounds present, which impart a bitter taste. Reb A is an isolated sweetener which doesn't taste the same as a full stevia extract. Much like how sugar doesn't taste like sugar cane or brown sugar. Pure reb A is more expensive than a common stevia extract, and so expect to pay a little more for it. The flavor of reb A is a lot better than a normal stevia extract, it's sort of like thin tasting sugar. Because PureVia contains two other sweeteners, and natural flavors, the taste is far better than reb A is alone. I really have to hand it to the manufacturers. They did a great job.
