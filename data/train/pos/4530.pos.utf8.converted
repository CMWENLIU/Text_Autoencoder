I've used Festival lemon juice for several years - ordered right here on Amazon.  In the last year I've seen the price go up and up even in the grocery stores.  I was really happy to find this 4 gallon pack, since we use a lot of lemon juice and this will last us a year or so. I use it in seltzer water as a drink - Lemon juice becomes alkaline when consumed, which is good for our immune system, helps with weight loss and boosts energy levels. I also use lemon juice when canning or dehydrating potatoes, apples, or bananas since the citric acid keeps them from turning brown.<br /><br />I used Subscribe and Save to get free shipping and 15% off the purchase price, bringing it down to $8.40 per gallon.  I've paid that much for a quart of it in the grocery store!<br /><br />Festival brand also tastes good - not bitter like some store brands.  I'll keep the open gallon in our spare fridge with the milk and pickles, and store the rest on the pantry shelves.
