This is probably the very finest bottled vegetable juice I've ever tried. And although it's available locally, the six-pack sold through Amazon seems to offer about the best available price.<br /><br />As my review title suggests, you get not eight, not ten, not twelve, but _fourteen_ kinds of veggie juice in this mix. And you can taste pretty much all of them. Just chill a bottle of it in your fridge, pour a glass, toss it at your tonsils, and wait; aha, there's the tomato, and there's the carrot, and there's the broccoli . . .<br /><br />What I usually do with bottled/canned vegetable juice is to modify it myself with a dash (or six) of hot pepper sauce, some lemon juice, a bit of salt, and a healthy dollop of Worcestershire sauce. Well, I tried that with this juice and found that I liked it _better_ without my own modifications. This is a nice, flavorful, carefully balanced mix, and my tinkering didn't improve it.[*]<br /><br />Which is good for another reason: this stuff is pretty low in salt, and it relies on pepper and garlic to give it a little bite. So if you're watching your sodium, you'll be glad to know that one 8-oz. glass includes just 4% of your RDA and doesn't require supplementation in order to taste good.<br /><br />Good juice.<br /><br />(The product image shown on this page at the time I'm writing is a little weird-looking; it makes the juice look orange, which it isn't. The predominant ingredient is tomato juice, and that's what this stuff looks like.)<br /><br />----<br /><br />[*] However, I've discovered since writing this review that I do like to add a splash of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1DUDU">Lakewood Organic PURE Lemon Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M1IQ3Y">Lakewood Organic PURE Lime Juice, 12.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>. Also, even though it contains celery juice, it's good with a dash of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWNBWI">Simply Organic Celery Salt Certified Organic, 5.54-Ounce Containers  (Pack of 3)</a> as well.
