I had all kind of trouble with my enlarged prostate. Even Mayo clinic Docs advised for surgery. I tried pumpkin seeds and then went to this oil taking one table spoon in the AM, another in the PM. I tangibly improved and have decided not to do the surgery. I do not need it. This oil is like a magic food for the prostate. I was told it is very good for libido, but I am content just to be able to urinate normally :-)<br /><br />The taste is absolutely genius. This is the best discovery for me on Amazon thus far as it changed my health and helped cope.
