The Green Energy Tea Fusion tea powder allows you to make instant ice green tea wherever you happen to be. All it takes is to fill a bottle with a few ounces of cold water and shake. The end product is a green tea that's honey-lemony tasting, low-calorie and, the maker claims, is made of mostly organic ingredients.<br /><br />Each packet has enough powder to make an okay-tasting 8-16 oz. amount of cool green tea. All you need to do is start with a bottle of cold water, take a sip or 2 to make some room for the shaking that's to follow, drop the powder in, then shake the bottle and... here's your cool green tea. It tastes the way you would expect iced green tea to taste when spiked with a little bit of lemon and honey. The taste, when 16 oz. of water are used is comparable to the gallon-size 'green diet ice tea' containers you could buy from some grocery stores only a little more diluted. When used with only 8 oz. it begins to taste like serious tea but than you'd want a second packet. The powder tea packets give you the ability to make instant green ice tea wherever you are and whenever you feel like without having to carry along a gallon-size canister. In addition, the makers claim that the caffeine and the EGCG (100mg) from one packet are sufficient to 'boost' your metabolism if taken three times daily.<br /><br />As far as contents, the main ingredients listed are: organic Japanese green tea extract, organic Yerba Mat&eacute; extract, organic Guava seeds extract, organic Aloe Vera extract, organic honey crystals and some others.<br /><br />The powder has 23 calories but none of them came from saturated fats or trans fats and none of the sweet taste comes from sugar because no sugar was added.<br /><br />I enjoy drinking this when no better options are available - such as the ability to make 'real' brewed green or, better, white tea. I do not see it as a regular substitute to 'real' tea. Since the product does meet my expectations - produce a reasonably decent drink when nothing better can be had, it gets it's 5 stars and my endorsement (for emergencies only) because I can't think of much that could be done to make it better.<br /><br />__________________________________<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />EGCG also known as Epigallocatechin 3-gallate is a powerful anti-oxidant that can be found in green tea but not in black tea.
