Make no mistake about it, you cannot go wrong with this product!  Fair warning, there are no real directions except for a link for recipes on a website.  If you make smoothies or meal replacement shakes, just put a scoop (hidden down in the powder) and get all the greatness with out the earthy taste.  But then again, that is one of the great advantages of this product.
