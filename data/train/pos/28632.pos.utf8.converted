I have been using the San Marzano tomatoes for many, many years; usually purchased from a specialty grocery store.  When I saw them offered on Amazon, I ordered them immediately. They came very quickly, but 3 cans were badly damaged so I notified Amazon.  They sent another box of 6 and again 3 were dented, 1 very badly.  I sent back all 6 damaged cans and kept 6.  Of the 6 that I kept, 4 are dented, slightly.  I complained about the poor packaging, but they when they mailed the replacement package, they used the same flimsy packaging.
