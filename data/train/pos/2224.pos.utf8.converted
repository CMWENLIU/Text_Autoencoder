These are so tasty and just the right amount of cacao powder & chocolate blended with goji, chia, sunflower seeds, etc. I love the fact that it taste like a dessert than a health snack, has all natural & organic ingredients and that its good for you. I recommend trying this if you are looking for healthier snack alternatives.
