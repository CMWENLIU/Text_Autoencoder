I grew up with this wonderful canned bread and have always had trouble finding it in the grocery store.  When I could talk the manager into ordering a case for me, I would get very strange looks and then they wouldd never call me to let me know that it was in ... so I don't really know if they even ordered it.<br />I am so happy that I found it on Amazon.  I had looked elsewhere but should have known to start my search with the best "shopping mall" on the internet.<br />Thank you, Amazon!!!
