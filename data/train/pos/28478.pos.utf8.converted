First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink. It does have a scent but it's nothing to make you upchuck your dinner. Anyway, oil is great for hot oil treatments. It is absolutely not to be left on the hair for days at a time as it makes my scalp itch! It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized. I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time. I definitely recommend for AA ladies with dry damaged hair. You will see results. I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DNUWIY">Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder by Hesh Pharma</a>
