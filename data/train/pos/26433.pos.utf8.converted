OK, it does come in a pretty flimsy string tied box, as other reviewers have said. Forewarned is forearmed.  I just opened the thing inside the Amazon shipping box and transferred the sugar to a bin.  Not a drop spilled.<br /><br />The sugar is EXACTLY what I wanted, a kind of large, variegated sized crystal that I first encountered in England and had a horrid time finding in the US, even at "gourmet" groceries.  It dissolves slowly in hot tea, leaving a treat of sweet for the last couple of sips (like the lovely last bite of a Drumstick Ice Cream Cone) without the tea overall being too sweet.  I had ordered some other "crystal sugar" from Amazon and it was more like granulated on steroids, all one size and dissolving far too quickly for my taste.<br /><br />If the stuff from your trip to England or the Continent is what you want, this is it, quintessentially.  Just be careful opening the box.
