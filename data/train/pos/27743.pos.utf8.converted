We have a 6 lb yorkie that can't get enough of the Flossies. We cut them in two and he spends 30 minutes or so chewing a half piece. Yorkies are nortorious for having dirty teath resulting in the need to have a vet do an annual cleaning. With the<br /><br />Flossies, our little guy hasn't had to suffer this difficult task. We're happy, and he's happy.
