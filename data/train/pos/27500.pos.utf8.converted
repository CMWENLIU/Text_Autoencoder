1% fat.  Low sugar.  REAL sugar instead of corn syrup.  Real cocoa instead of chocolate flavor.  Perfect lunchbox, purse, and briefcase size.<br /><br />and did I mention, Great Flavor!<br /><br />Yes, I love chocolate milk.  And I won't be guilted out of it by the diet police.  This is better than any of the over-sweetened whole milk varieties available at the grocery store, AND it is organic and from cows who have not been slathered with growth hormones and anti-biotics.<br /><br />2 of these for breakfast give me all the calcium I need to help avoid the growing-shorter-grandma syndrom that runs in my family -- plus I'm being treated to something wonderful!
