I'll recommend Grape-Nuts whole-heartedly to anyone who needs a high fiber punch in a low-volume solution. This cereal is dense and probably should not be consumed in large volumes at a sitting. There is a LOT of fiber and iron in it.  Other than that, it would be the perfect breakfast cereal. Unlike other high-fiber solutions, Grape-Nuts is versatile.  You can eat it cold with milk or heat it up in the microwave with said milk and enjoy a tastier alternative to oatmeal. You can sprinkle it on yogurt for a texture explosion in your mouth. I've even made bran muffins with them, and they are delicious.
