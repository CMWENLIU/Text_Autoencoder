I like the Nutiva Hemp protein. A great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber.  Can't beat that!  It won't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can.  I like the taste and texture too.  Mixes great with cranberry juice/cranberries, stevia, ice and water! I add some Berry Green for extra energy and nutrients!  It's my morning breakfast.
