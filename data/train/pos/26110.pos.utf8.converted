I use coconut milk on my low-carb diabetic, dairy-free diet to make whey shakes (sweetened with steveia), cocoa, and coffee as a creamer.  I even make coconut milk yogurt with it.  I have used the usually top-rated brands of both Mae Ploy and Chaokoh but both have preservatives I would like to avoid.<br /><br />This arrived today and I immediately make a shake for lunch, and it is my favorite...very fresh tasting, more "coconutty," thick (not as thick as the two mentioned above, but thick enough).  I use the whole can, add one can of water to make a quart.  I love that it's just coconut milk, water, and guar gum.<br /><br />Since I use so much of it daily and I use Prime Shipping, the savings on the automatic ordering help me out a lot.  Umm...now to make some coconut milk yogurt with this.
