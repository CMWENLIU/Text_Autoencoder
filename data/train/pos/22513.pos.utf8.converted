This is a GREAT product : not only does it make delicious purees, all vitamins preserved and so smooth thanks to the blender, but it also is soooo easy to use, not to mention to clean ! In only 10 to 15 minutes (depending on the ingredients) I can make amazingly tasty vegetables for my six months old, and just the right quantity so it is always extra fresh. You can also make more and freeze it in ice trays, I have to admit sometimes it is convenient. It is so worth the money !!!
