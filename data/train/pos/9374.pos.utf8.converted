My vet told me I had to give my cat anti-biotics for 21 days! I felt crazy at this thought. My calico hates it when I try to shove a pill down her throat. I tried using the pill injectors but still it was high truama for my cat. Then I discovered pill pockets. They are a drean come true for me as my cat LOVES them and doesn't noticew that there's a pill inside. She just very happily gobbles it up and wants more! I was almost sorry that I was through giving her the pills but now I use them are treats and rewards just as they are.
