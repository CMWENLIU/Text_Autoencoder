This Hard White Wheat is a good choice for "preppers" since it comes conveniently packaged in a 5 gallon resealable bucket (however opening the bucket will significantly reduce shelf-life) and has a great many uses. We added this to our emergency food supply (also in 5 gallon buckets) we keep stored in our basement. It is possible to eat this directly, grind it for flour, or even plant it to grow our own.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
