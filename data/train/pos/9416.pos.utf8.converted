I had the extreme pleasure of going to the Ecuadorian Amazon a few years ago. During that time, I stayed in small village named Mariposa outside of Archidona in the province of Napo. I lived with wonderful healers who everyday drank Guayusa. At the time, I had never heard of it. But it became part of our morning ritual. I found that it took my hunger pangs away and gave me alot of energy. The healer I was with was over 80 years old and had tons of energy - more than me at the age of 21.<br /><br />The indigenous people used guayusa to treat body aches and as a mouthwash. I was told it kept their teeth clean. I can attest that during my time in the Amazon, I ate less than usual but had more energy.<br />I was able to bring a small amount of the tea back with me but quickly ran out and was not able to find it anywhere else until last year.<br /><br />I was so extremely thrilled to find it for sale on Amazon. This price cannot be beat! It comes so fresh and pure.<br /><br />Upon reading up on the company how surprised was I to find that Runa, works in Archidona with members of the community that I was able to meet. They work with some members of the family that I lived with as well.<br /><br />How small a world it is.<br /><br />One tip- this tea does not produce any tannins (which create bitterness in other teas when boiled too long) so you can leave it in boiling water for a long time without degradation in flavor - its another way to extract all the goodness in the teas.<br /><br />On to my actual review of this product- I drink it almost everyday. I add a little agave to sweeten it for me. It has replaced any kind of energy drink or coffee for me. I am focused, awake and aware. I love this tea.I actually get to reuse the tea material 2 -3  times before it gets too clear and I have to use a new batch.<br />If you need a pick-me-up, try this out. I don't think you will be disappointed.
