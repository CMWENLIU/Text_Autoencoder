I've been cooking for well over three decades and have tried many different "no salt" seasoning combos. Recently I received a sample of Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning and tried it on chicken I was roasting. It was truly the best seasoning I've ever used, and my husband raved about it, asking me to purchase it. It's not spicy, not sweet, and not one spice in the mixture overpowers the others. I'll be using it in soups, stews, hamburgers....So--here I am, and might purchase the 12-pack. :)
