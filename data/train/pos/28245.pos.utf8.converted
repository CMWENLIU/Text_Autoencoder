Asbach Uralt cherries are the best chocolate cherries I have ever tasted.  The nice quality dark chocolate shell is filled with a single  lightly candied cherry, macerated in Asbach Uralt brandy.  The combination of the rich, slightly bitter chocolate, with the fruity, sweet cherry, and the "bite" of the brandy is divine.  No part of this is sickly sweet.  It's definitely a treat for adult mouths only. I prefer this brand to the Boehme brand of cherries as the Asbach Uralt are slightly less sweet.
