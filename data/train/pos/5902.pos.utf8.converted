I found these at my local organic store and I can't get enough of them.<br /><br />These sunflower seeds are tastier than any other seeds I've tried. They are cruchy and fresh and delicious. The best part is that there's no need to peel them as they are sprouted.<br /><br />Makes a great, healthy snack!
