I recall fondly those days as 10 year old eating Twizzlers black licorice with my grandmother until they changed the recipe, removing molasses. It became too disgusting for words. It was the only time in my tween years that I wrote to a company to complain. Y&S Candies sent me back a letter saying that molasses had become too expensive and was no longer being used in the licorice, but they included coupons for spaghetti sauce as an appeasement. Inexplicable. In any case, my licorice consumption declined. A few years later, I developed a horrid gluten intolerance, and my licorice days were over for good.<br /><br />Or so I thought.<br /><br />After nearly 20 years without licorice (OK! I admit I would steal an occasional nibble...), I was shocked, SHOCKED to find Candy Tree Gluten-free licorice, and best of all, it's pretty darn tasty! I blame Candy Tree for restarting my sugar addiction, but I just can't stop eating it. I highly recommend this product. I like the licorice twists the best, but the ropes are good, too. Give it a shot!! And thank you, Candy Tree, for giving me something I truly missed.
