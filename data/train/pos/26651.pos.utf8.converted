This ginger beer may not be to everyone's taste, but for those who like theirs spicy and not fruity, this is the only one. If you inhale through your nose right after pouring the ginger will sizzle your sinuses. For me, this is the only ginger beer I ever get, and it's kind of hard to find. It makes a *perfect* dark and stormy when mixed with Gosling's or Kraken rum and a squeeze of lime. Without the rum to cut it, it can be a bit biting. Yes, that's right, it's better when you cut it with booze. That's how snappy it is.
