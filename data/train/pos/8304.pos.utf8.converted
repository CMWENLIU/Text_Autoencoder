Pork Ramen is arguably the Holy Grail of Ramen. For reasons that will confound scholars for centuries to come, you cannot find pork flavor in the store. When I found out pork flavor was available through amazon.com, I felt much like Tom Hank's wife must have felt in Castaway when she found out he was still alive. I was thrilled, I was happy to see Pork Ramen, but I had moved on...I had let it go. It arrived in my building lobby, a simple cardboard box full of throwback happiness. I nailed the noodles-to-water ratio on the first try and had a bowl with an icy cold Mountain Dew. It was like being magically transported back to college and for a moment, if I closed my eyes, I felt almost as though I were sitting in my dorm room in the shadow of a loft bed, playing Starcraft online...and in that moment...I was made whole.
