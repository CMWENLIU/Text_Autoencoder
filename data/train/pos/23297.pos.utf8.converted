My husband loves salt. But, he also loves this product. It is the only salt-free product that he likes. Since he has Congestive Heart failure, it is important for him to leave off salt.<br /><br />Also, I use this product as the seasoning when I make cheese substitutes. It makes the cheese have a great flavor. YUM!!!
