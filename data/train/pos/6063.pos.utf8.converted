I was amazed the first time Chef Daniel Taylor served me a dish with Forbidden Black Rice at The Underground in Raleigh. It's a fantastic rice - it has the same texture as black beans. And unlike regular rice, Forbidden reheats nicely. A word of warning - be careful when cooking it cause it drips purple.
