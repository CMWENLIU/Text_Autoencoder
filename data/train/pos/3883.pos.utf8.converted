I was somewhat dubious when I ordered these sour belts as a Christmas gift for my (candy-addicted) younger brother, as I have repeatedly had my heart broken in the past by sour belts that were decidedly... UN-sour.<br /><br />(Nothing is worse than craving the acidic, tangy *pop* of sour candy, only to have your taste buds duped by a too-sweet, sugary let-down of flavor.)<br /><br />Well imagine my delight when these sour belts slapped my tongue with tartness like a cranky old granny at a Church luncheon! Just as sour as the ones you find at the mall candy shops, and incredibly convenient, as they come in large tubs.<br /><br />Totally delicious and totally recommended.<br /><br />Beware, though: Since there are so many belts in a single tub, you may find yourself over-indulging and burning yourself from an excess of the citric acid on these babies... If this happens, you'll be left with a raw, stinging tongue that may take a couple of days to heal. Granted, this only happens if you eat like, thirty-five in a single sitting, but still... it's possible. I speak from (shameful and disgusting) experience.<br /><br />Still, when eaten in moderation, these are a great snack, a great replacement for love, a great way to gain weight, and a great way to spend your time!<br /><br />Grab them by the fistful and shove them in your face!!!
