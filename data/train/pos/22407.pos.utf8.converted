I bought a Toy Poodle last summer and found that he was getting really dry/flaky skin.  I was given some no-name food from the breeder and my vet suggested this may be the problem.  After recommendations and a search for the best dog food--I finally found it!  My boy absolutely loves it and his itchy skin was gone.  His coat is so much softer and shinier now.  I recently switched to Orijen Regional Red and he loves it even MORE!  If you can get a hold of some of that stuff I suggest you do.  It is a little pricier than the other Orijen formulas but I can almost guarantee your dog will love it.  Every time one of his puppy pals are over they're always sniffing and licking his empty bowl.  Worth every penny!
