This is a great tasting alternative for those who are allergic to peanut butter or those who just want to try something new. We have allergies in our family, so we don't keep PB in the house. My entire family loves the flavor and texture. I would highly recommend trying it. We got a free sample from the manufacturer's website first, and then purchased the case on amazon.
