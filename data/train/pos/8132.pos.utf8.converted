There is a light carmel/molassis flavor but it's not too strong for me.  We enjoy it in tea, fruit smoothies, on hot breakfast cereals and everything we'd use sugar for.  I found the best deal price wise at Country Life Natural Foods.  It's good stuff!  I also use pure stevia powder in food items so I need less sugar.  It's sweet and natural with no calories.
