Well everyonyone likes something else when it comes to flavor, but these don't have spices which I dislike such as mint.  These are somewhat 'strong' in the sense of the saltiness/acidity, which I like.  The texture is on the mushy side.  The expiration date was a couple years into the future.  The one problem is that the way they are packaged caused a few of the cans to dent.  Amazon needs to be more careful packing these.
