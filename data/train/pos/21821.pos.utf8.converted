This is all I feed my baby. She is a 12 year old Boston Terrior. She has allergies but this is the only food I have found that does not break her out. It is easy to digest and keeps her wieght under control. She likes the taste and it has the great stuff for her skin in it. If your dog is having skin problems I hightly recommend trying this food. It is the BEST!!!
