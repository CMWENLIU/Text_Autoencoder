I bought a whole case of these things to get my required protein in. They were a bit salty for me on their own, cus I'm not a salt person at all and eat like a old folks home, meaning hardley no salt in anything. But, I boiled them in with my frozen butter beans we put up from the garden and Ohhh My they were delicious. I made a sub sandwich with them and was so impressed, I'm going to order them again. I hear they are delicious fried up and breaded, so I want to try that too, but i'm going to bake mine and i'm sure that will be just as good!
