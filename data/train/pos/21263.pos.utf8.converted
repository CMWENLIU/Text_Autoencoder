I started feeding my over-weight cat Wellness canned and stopped all other foods including any dry.  No more vomiting, no more shedding like crazy, no more begging for food all day long and waking me up in the night.  She's lost a little bit (not much), but she looks great and I have not stepped in a pile of vomit in months.<br />Love this food!!
