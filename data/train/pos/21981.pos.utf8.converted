I have used this honey for MANY medicinal purposes.  Family Member was really getting sick.  HORRIBLE sore throat, and drainage.  Started her on tea with this in it.  Throat was eased within a day.  I (ALWAYS) keep it on hands for any burns, or cuts.  Kinda messy, but a lot healthier for you than the chemical or artificial stuff you don't know is going into your body.  I usually just use a Q-tip and but bandaids over it.
