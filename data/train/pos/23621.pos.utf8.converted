Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!). Amazon's price for a 12 pack shipped free is very competitive, especially if you sign up for a subscription. Whether you get it from Amazon or somewhere else, it's just as good. Get yourself some. Your body will thank you!
