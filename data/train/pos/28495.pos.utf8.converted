Hmmm!<br /><br />I'm a Brit living in the US and, as others will know, decent tea is very hard to find or criminally expensive.  I've had a standing order with Amazon for years for PG Tips which I also love.  Recently, I visited my mum in the UK with my American wife.  She commented on a cup of tea she had at one of my mum's bingo nights(!)  It happened to be Typhoo.  So when we got back I bought some Typhoo and, on a whim, some Yorkshire tea (both from Amazon).  My wife prefers the Typhoo over the PG and, I have to say, I prefer the Yorkshire over the PG.  I'm quite amazed.  I love this stuff.  Very robust but not stringent.  My cups of tea have that orangy colour that I like.  As the name implies, Yorkshire tea is sturdy and uncomplaining.  I live on a rural area with water drawn from a well.  The quality varies and my PG cuppas sometimes suffer but the Yorkshire always tastes right.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still a big fan of PG as well.  But Yorkshire may have knocked it off its pedestal.<br /><br />Hmmm!
