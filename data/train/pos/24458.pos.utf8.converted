I am a southern cook, by nature of where I live, of my heritage, and mostly because southern food is comfort food which I love to cook and eat.<br />The #1 comfort food I know is hand made dumplings, which I mix by hand, roll out by hand, and cut by hand.  My dumplings are a favorite for Sunday meals, food delivies to sick aunts, and pot luck dinners. Making dumplings was always a chore for me.  A labor of love to be sure, but time consuming.<br />Imagine my delight when I found McLib's dumplings while on vacation in Charleston, SC.  Of course, I was a bit skeptical that anything premade could match my hand made dumplings.  Bless your heart McLib's, they were just as delicious and saved me hours of work in the kitchen.  Now I keep McLib's Southern Dumplings in my pantry as a secret ingredient. I only share this secret with my best friends after they are sworn to secrecy.  I don't want my family to know as I can use dumplings as a motivator to get lots of work done around the house.<br />Amazon, please keep these in stock!  McLib's are the ultimate comfort food made easy for the time deprived cooks of the world.  I highly recommend McLib's!!!
