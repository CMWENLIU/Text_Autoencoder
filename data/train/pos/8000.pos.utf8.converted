It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.
