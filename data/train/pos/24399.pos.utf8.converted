I used to buy the unsifted counterpart of this tea and in my opinion this is much better deal. You only get finely cut flower petals without the bulbs, stems and what not which you would get with the slightly less expensive unsifted version of this. Having only the flower petals means you actually have to brew less of the product to get the same result.
