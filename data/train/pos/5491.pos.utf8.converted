I've been using grapeseed oil for more and more cooking and have been very pleased with the results. Mantova Grapeseed oil comes in glass, typical of the higher grade products and we like it very well. I have seen that this oil doesn't smoke as much when frying. I read that grapeseed oil doesn't break down at higher temperatures as does vegetable oils. The flavor is very light and smooth.
