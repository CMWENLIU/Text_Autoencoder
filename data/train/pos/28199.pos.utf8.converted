I'm a coffee snob. I have recently learned the whole bean freshly ground Kona coffee tastes way better than all other coffee... If you agree with this, then I think you will like this moderately priced Kona coffee. I've ordered it several times and been very pleased. Drinkable without any sweeteners or creamers.
