These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically "multigrain" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!
