Blueberry coffee...sounds weird, right?<br /><br />This is the best darn coffee out there.  One try and you are hooked!<br />It tastes like coffee in your mouth with a blueberry muffin aftertaste.  The flavor is not strong, just a hint of bluberry!<br />The smell when it is brewing is delightful!<br />I encourage all people with a Keurig to try it once.  I am the pickiest eater I know and I love it!!!
