I've never purchased this via Amazon, but we used to live in Waco, TX and were able to buy this at the Dr. Pepper Museum there (Dr. Pepper was invented in Waco). The glass bottles are the best, and the smaller size is perfect for a nice treat (they're about 100 calories each). This original recipe is better than what you buy in the store today - it has pure cane sugar as opposed to corn syrup, and you can taste the difference. Nice and crisp; a sharp sweetness that just can't be captured with corn syrup. I miss being able to drive a few miles to get this! We stocked up before we moved, but we've run out and are craving it :)<br /><br />I like how the big beverage companies are going "retro" and re-introducing their original tasty recipes with real sugar, and this is no exception. This is a great gift for yourself or a Dr. Pepper fan, because I don't think you can find it outside of Texas.
