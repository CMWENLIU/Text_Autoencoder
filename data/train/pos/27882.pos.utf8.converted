I have a cat with feline lymphoma that we have needed to switch from dry food to a high quality protein diet. We tried many different (and often expensive) brands before coming across this one. The proteins are ideal for her requirements and the ingredients (according to the label) appear to be of high quality. Our cat is prone to many allergies and has never before eaten wet food but with a 3 day introduction of gradually mixing it in to her dry food she has completely accepted the wet food and solely eats it.<br /><br />Also we are proud to say that within 3 weeks of changing her diet and administering cod liver oil 3 days out of each week our kitty's adrenal tumors are 70% reduced in size and she is well on her way to becoming healthy again.
