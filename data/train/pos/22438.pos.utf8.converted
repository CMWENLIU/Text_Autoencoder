The STACKER 6 HOUR POWER ENERGY SHOT is really great. No energy crash, and no headache or jitters, either.  The grape flavour is especially delicious, with a slight tartness.  Usually Energy shots can taste kind of funky...almost like cough syrup.  Not this one.<br /><br />It can also help you cut back on your coffee consumption.  One bottle, every other day for a week will do it, and you won't have the yips coming down.<br /><br />BTW...I've just purchased my second 12-pack.
