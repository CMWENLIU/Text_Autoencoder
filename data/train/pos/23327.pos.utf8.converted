When I moved to the U.K. about fifteen years ago I came across Yorkshire Tea. There are lots of tea brands available in British supermarkets (far more than you'll find in the U.S.)and I tried several of them. However, I found Yorkshire Tea to be the best. It makes a good strong cup of tea with with a fine aroma. It's also economical-4 level teaspoons make 6 cups of great tea. But, please, brew it the right way. Use fresh cold water and bring it to the boil-not 200 degrees or 205 degrees but boiling at 212. Let it steep for 5 minutes, give it a good stir and pour it into the cup. I drink it with milk-no sugar. Try it your way. You won't be disappointed.
