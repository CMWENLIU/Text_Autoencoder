Hmm, how do I rate this... We have two cats and they like it, each eat half a can in the morning. I can tell they like it because they stand around their bowls waiting for it. Then they eat it. So I guess they like it.  I wouldn't stand around a bowl if I knew I was going to get something I didn't like. Then again, if I only had a choice between dried lame cat food and juicy, smelly (*gag) wet cat food, I would probably look forward to my mornings more often. I wonder if the poultry cans taste like the birds they catch and partially eat while the other half flops around in my house, which always seems to happen when we are on vacation. I guess they like that too.
