Sweet fresh flavor and easy packaging. One teaspoon is more cinnamon than necessary as the packet will garnish several hot beverages. It is a pack of 3 tins, but a single tin with 12 packets makes a respectable token gift.<br /><br />If buying for oneself and especially for home use, the sticks available at the grocery are more practical. They use less packaging and cost less. They can be found in a small plastic bag usually with a Hispanic market label (at least in Texas). Recognize this product by its layers within the stick.
