If you hate fishy tasting fish like I do, but want to try sardines for the health benefits, try these. I had tried but given up on sardines before due to the heavy, fishy taste. Then I read the recommendations on amazon for these and decided to try them. Well, these are indeed very mild, and, with the right seasonings, are even tasty. If you're a sardines newbie who isn't fond of really fishy tasting fish, try these.
