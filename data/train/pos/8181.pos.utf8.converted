This wakame, when hydrated, doesn't look like the long narrow strips I'm used to in restaurant seaweed salad. However the small(half-inch), squarish pieces do just fine as a good-tasting salad.  It's quite salty even after soaking, so would probably benefit from a rinse after soaking, before adding dressing.<br />The price was right, too!
