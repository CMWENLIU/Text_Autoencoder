I've been playing with bread recipes for about a year now, both by hand and in our bread maker. After really getting in to studying the science behind a good loaf, I began buying wheat gluten. Even if a recipe doesn't call for it I add a small amount (amount is listed on box of what to add to a loaf so it's failproof).<br /><br />The real test was when I added this to a sour cream bread I've been making for ages in our bread maker and everyone declared it "the best bread recipe" I'd made...but it was my old recipe.<br /><br />It really does make it more like the gourmet loaves you might scarf down at a favorite restaurant or like those made with fresh yeast when you are just using the dry yeast packets. It rises better, and the texture is better and I swear the taste is better in our opinion.<br /><br />I can't get wheat gluten at my regular grocery store and it was far more costly at specialty groceries around here...it lasts so I just got the box of it here, with no tax it was a better deal for me. I mean, you get a pack of 8 boxes. Cheap.<br /><br />Negatives: I'd love to be able to order less at the same discount but I took the bags out of the boxes and they take up very little space in my cabinet. I have no negatives on how it works: I don't make a loaf without it anymore.
