Start your day off right.  Cook some steel cut oats and amaranth (2:1) in unsweetened almond-flavored soy milk.  When almost finished stir in some dried blueberries.  When finished, sprinkle with truffle salt and pepitas.<br /><br />This is probably the most healthy and addictive breakfast you can eat.  I'm here because I'm almost out of truffle salt and I don't think I could bear to run out.
