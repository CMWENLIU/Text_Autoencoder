I have very hard water and everytime I run the dishwasher I would get a white film on my glasses, and my silverware would tarnish. Along time ago I used to buy citric acid in the drug store but have not been able to buy it there in years.  So, I googled it and found this product on line.  There are two containers to put dishwasher powder in, one for the first wash and one for the second.  I put dishwasher powder in the first and about a tablespoon of Citric acid in the second container and run the dishwasher.  My glasses are now coming out spotless, my silverware is starting to shine, and the wood handles on my cutlery are losing that white film that they had acquired. Little by little the dried on mineral stains are disappearing from all my dishes. Now, I don't have to be embarassed when company comes over and I serve them a beverage. Before I found the Citric acid I tried different brands of rinse aids and they did not work. Try it!  It works great!
