I was looking for a economical high quality dry dog food.  I have an aged German Shepherd who has trouble maintaining his weight as well as two other large dogs adopted from the local shelter.  Within a month of feeding this food I noticed changes in all of the dogs.  The older German Shepherd gained weight and energy. After a year on this food his coat is thick and shiny.  His weight<br />is maintained at a healthy level.  The other two dogs also have nice coats and weight.  They eat the dog food dry with a few fresh chicken scraps added occasionally.  Check the label and compare with not only the premium brands but with the common supermarket brands.<br />I found that with very little compromise this dog food compares favorably with higher-priced premium foods.  I also have seen that<br />the high end supermarket brands are creeping up to the one-dollar-a-pound price and their ingredients contain many fillers.<br />This dog food can also be fed in smaller quantities than the supermarket brand.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKUOY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult  Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCQ6DY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Chicken and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>
