I've tried a few brands of truffle oil and I really haven't been able to tell the difference between qualities.  All are super pungent with that lovely aroma and taste that truffle oil brings.  I used this on salads and also to oven bake/fry potato chips (recipe to follow). The price is great which is why I bought it.  Truffle oil can get pricey quick.  Depending on how often you use it, it is great to find a economical source!  Love this stuff!<br /><br />Potato Chips:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />* 2 baking potatoes thinly sliced on a mandolin<br />* Garlic powder<br />* Salt<br />* Pepper<br />* Olive oil (75% of the mixture)<br />* Truffle oil (25% of the mixture)<br /><br />Directions:<br />1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F<br /><br />2. Pour enough olive oil and truffle oil in baking pan/sheet to thinly cover entire surface area.<br /><br />3. Move pan around to coat evenly.<br /><br />4. Put pan in oven for 2-3 minutes to heat oil.  Remove pan from oven.<br /><br />5. Sprinkle desired seasonings in the oil.<br /><br />6. Place sliced potatoes in oil (will fit about 1 large potato per baking sheet).  Do not overlap!<br /><br />7. Bake for 8 minutes, flip potato slices over.<br /><br />8. Bake until done 5-8 min (continue to check as the outside ones will crisp sooner)<br /><br />9. For round 2: Reapply some oil and seasonings.  Repeat process
