It is just what is says - dried onions. They are not sweet onions. They are flavorful, they have bite -- like a white onion. Rehydrating was simple and fast (10 minutes).<br /><br />Price was OK, not the cheapest, nor was it the highest I've paid. But I didn't buy them because of the price. I bought them because the online info said the country of origin was the US. More and more I'm seeing foods coming in from countries with less stringent safety procedures that we enjoy in the US.  So, when I can, I am buying from US grown foods (I am hoping that the "country of origin: US" means the onions were grown and dehydrated here -- not just packaged and/or distributed from the US.)
