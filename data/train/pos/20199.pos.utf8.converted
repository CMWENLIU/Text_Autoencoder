I'm a big fan of Amy's food and this is another stellar offering.  The flavors are authentic and this really tastes like a restaurant quality soup, not a typical canned soup.  I'm not even a big fan of soup, with the exception of a few but this one really stands out as both flavorful and healthy.  It's high in fiber and iron and is relatively low in fat, especially given the exceptional taste. I've got my partner and my mother hooked on this now. I can't find it at any stores, even co-ops don't seem to offer it, so I'm happy to have discovered this gem here on Amazon. This is the second order I've placed in the past few months! I don't get tired of it.
