Since I'm a student and don't own a car, I couldn't go to a nursery to find a proper pot and soil and all the stuff for my bonsai from IKEA. I ordered this, and my bonsai is doing great! It has everything you need (except for wire) to repot bonsai. I looked online for over 5 hours, and this was the best deal.
