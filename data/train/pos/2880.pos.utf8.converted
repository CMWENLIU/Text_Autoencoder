I have the lazy couch potato dog that the first reviewer described.  An overweight black lab adult female who is quite lazy.  Switching foods from Purina to TOTW Bison, and not measuring daily feedings, and feeding her as she pleases, she has more energy, is more playful, and has already lost 10lbs. and is five pounds away from her ideal weight of 75lbs.  I highly recommend this food to all dog owners.
