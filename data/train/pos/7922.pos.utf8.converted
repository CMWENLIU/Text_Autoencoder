This is the best oatmeal I've tasted. You'll never imagine that it is instant. Easy to make, follow the instructions exactly as written. Adjust time in microwave based on your unit. Unlike most other packaged instant oatmeals, this contains no sodium or potasium, and is low in carbs (I watch this due to diabetes). The price us considerably lower than buying off the shelf.  I gave as Christmas gifts to my good friends!
