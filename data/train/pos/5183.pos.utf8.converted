It's no contest: Red Vines are 100% certified deliciousness, while Twizzlers are essentially your grandmother's melted candles that have been molded into a shape that dishonestly attempts to imitate Red Vines.<br /><br />And like a fine wine, Red Vines only get better with age.  On a tub-size container like this, I like to leave one side cracked open to allow some oxygen to enhancing the aging process.<br />Twizzlers + age?  Let me just say, it's not a pretty sight.
