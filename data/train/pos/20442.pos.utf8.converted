I love the taste of this hemp protein Powder.  I love to mush up bananas with a fork, add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the Nutiva Hemp seeds.  It tastes great and satisfies me on every level.<br /><br />I also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands.  I couldn't believe when I saw that there was 14 grams per serving.  Considering that 90% of Americans are lacking in fiber, this Protein Powder can be a great service to millions.
