I've recently switched to a more natural and organic food for my cats and have been trying different brands and I came across this Orijen cat food in a trial 400 gram bag and put it side to side with some of the other dry food that I bought that is also natural with no by products and everytime they both would go directly to the Orijen bowl and leave the others alone. I ordered a 15 lb bag today.
