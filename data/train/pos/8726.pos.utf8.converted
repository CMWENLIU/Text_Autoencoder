One of the things I missed most when I had to stop eating gluten was oatmeal, since oats grown in the US are generally cross-contaminated with wheat/barley or other gluten-containing grains.  I was so excited to discover Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Rolled Oats at my local Whole Foods a year or so ago, and they taste great, with a wonderful satisfying, chewy texture.  Highly recommended!
