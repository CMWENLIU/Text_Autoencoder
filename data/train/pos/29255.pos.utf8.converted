I have used Eight O'Clock coffee for years.  My grandmother (and I am in my mid 50's) even used Eight O'Clock coffee.  I prefer it over Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks.  I prefer the whole beans vs the gound so my coffee is freshly ground each morning.  Would like to see Eight )'Clock come out with the K-cups.
