This is my favorite Green tea! I have 3 or 4 cups a day. The orange favor is great. You can actually smell the oranges when sniffing the tea bag and it is far fresher than your standard teas like Lipton. Besides the great taste, it has 70% more anti-oxidants than your typical Green tea. Also I should mention I have been drinking this tea as part of my workout and diet regime and have lost 25 pounds! Here is an article on how green tea helps with weight loss: http://www.benefitsofgreentea.info/2007/powerful-super-green-tea-diet.php.
