Siberian Huskies are naturally picky eaters but this food really excited her.  Anya attacked it like my Goldie/Shepherd mix did.  My Goldie/Shepherd mix has problems with dry skin and a diet rich in fish oil was suggested.  It worked for her but gave her 'fish breath', my daughter said.  I recommend this food for any dog that gives you that &#34;what the heck is this again?&#34; look with ordinary foods.  I recommend it for Huskies and for dogs with itchy skin.  Its a real treat &#34;Like stealing the cats food.&#34;
