I sent this product to my son who is currently deployed in Afghanistan.  The troops drink only bottled water, so this jazzes up the water a bit.  This shipped directly to my son's APO address and he received the package about a week after I ordered.  Good deal and my son is happy so I am happy.  Five stars for Propel and for Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
