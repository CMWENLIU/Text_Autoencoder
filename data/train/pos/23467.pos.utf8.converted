I switched my old cat to this food about 4 or 5 years ago. The store I was getting it from stopped selling the Indoor Cat version. So for the past year I have ordered from Amazon. Even though my cat is very old she has NEVER liked wet cat food or even people food for that matter. Past cat food she would eat some of but I think she has a sensitive stomach and would (hope your not eating when you read this) throw up. She likes this food and it has helped her keep on weight too. It does matter that this food (probably all cat food) isn't past the expiration date and is fresh. So I don't order too many bags at once.
