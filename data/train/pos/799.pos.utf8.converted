I have tasted many packages of brownie mix, most of them contain hydrogenated oils, propylene glycol, and lots of other nasty ingredients. These brownies are by far the best tasting, with all pure ingredients. I love to bake a batch, cut them into small squares, and put them in the freezer for a great treat. Anyone sensitive to wheat will absolutely LOVE these brownies. You won't be disappointed! Great with walnuts too.
