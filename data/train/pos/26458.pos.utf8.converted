I first tasted the Asiago cheese in this snack box when I got one of the larger boxes of snacks in the mail. I'm still impressed with the smooth buttery texture of the cheese that goes very well with the crisp crackers. This box also contains delicious slices of salami that you can put on the crackers and cheese for a meal in itself. The best part of this snack box is the Cashew Medley which is a mixture of creamy yogurt chips, dried cranberries, raisins and cashews. Then for dessert there is a dark chocolate sandwich cookie which really finishes the meal off nicely. This is one of my favorite GoPicnic snack boxes. You can easily take these boxes to work, on a picnic, when you hike or if you need a snack in your car. Delicious and convenient!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
