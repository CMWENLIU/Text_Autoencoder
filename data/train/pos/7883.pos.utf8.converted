Some reviewers said this product smelled too much like coffee but I don't find it overwhelming at all. I really like the way this feels and I have noticed my skin looks better around my eyes since I started using it. I also just saw on Dr. Oz that eye cream with caffeine is the way to go so I'm glad I chose this product. I would definitely buy it again and the fact that it is all organic and natural is awesome. Highly recommend.
