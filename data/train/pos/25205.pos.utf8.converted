As a child, we always had halva onhand. Forty years later the brand I was familiar with was not to be found, so I decided to try this manufacture. The first order was for 3. While the taste is not exactly like the old brand, it comes close enough and I ordered 6 more! The chocolate swirl and all the other fancied up halvas never appealed to me. This Koska Plain Halva hits the spot! I love it. The containers are better than the  old round tins, easy to open, and reusable to store small items in my workshop.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Koska Plain Tahini Halva. Halva has a taste all it's own.
