While I love a good and robust Starbucks as much as the next guys, the Eight O'clock Coffee French Roast is my coffee of choice for the daily brew.  It has always arrived fresh and bold in the whole bean variety.  I grind it to a sufficient espresso roast, and then load up the coffee pot.  It makes a consistently good, smooth, and bold cup of Joe every day - at about half the cost of higher end brands.
