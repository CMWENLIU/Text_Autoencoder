Our two dogs love these treats.  They are great to train a puppy because you can hold the treat and the dogs can have a nibble instead of giving them the whole treat. Both of our dogs love the treat and we feel that this is the healthiest product for our dogs.  You can see some of the vegetables and blueberries that are in this treat.  When I reach for the bag of treats both dogs go crazy.
