Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Cornbread mix is excellent. The texture is soft, slightly moist and just the right amount of "dense" as cornbread should be . . . I substitute buttermilk for milk, grapeseed oil for the oil/butter and then I add 1 tsp. of vanilla and a 1/4 cup of honey. It comes out perfect every time. Visiting "gluten-eating" family has not been able to tell this is a gluten-free baked item. We are a household of three and two of us recently discovered we had Celiac disease so, for us, gluten-free is not a choice, it is a must. It is good to know most of our loved "gluten" containing items are available in a gluten-free form.
