As most nutritionists and weight lifters will tell you, peanut butter is a near-perfect food. High in protein, relatively low in saturated fat, and easy to eat in a hurry, it's probably the healthiest quick protein-fix outside of a protein shake. And as far as peanut butter brands go, Jif Natural Creamy Peanut Butter is one of the best.<br /><br />A single 2-table-spoon serving (which, to be honest, is probably a smaller serving than most people eat) contains a good amount of protein (7g), a fair degree of fiber (2g), low sodium (80 mg), and very little carbs (8g). Like all peanut butters it's somewhat high in fat (16g) but relatively low in saturated fat (3g).<br /><br />It should also be noted that though Jif Natural peanut butter contains no artificial flavors or preservatives, it does contain a small amount of added sugar (3g) and is, like Skippy's natural peanut butter, made with palm oil in addition to the natural peanut oil. Die hard natural food-eaters will object to Jif's peanut butter on both of these counts, but from a usability perspective most consumers will probably prefer Jif to "truly" natural peanut butter, which (because peanut oil, unlike palm oil, separates and rises to the top of the jar) is messy and requires frequent stirring before use. Jif's natural peanut butter, on the other hand, looks and tastes exactly the peanut butter most of us have grown up with--only it's better for us!
