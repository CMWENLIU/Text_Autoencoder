God Almighty. That pretty much sums up this sauce.<br /><br />If you're looking for great flavor and usability you've come to the wrong place (although considering the heat its really not THAT bad..)<br /><br />This sauce will humble you to the God's of spice. You will truly know what pain is. I had a small spot on the top of a fork and my tongue was burning for about 20 minutes. I had a spot on a cracker and my entire mouth (not just my tongue, my cheeks, gums, throat, roof and floor of my mouth, and sinuses) were burning, this lasted (even with milk to stop the pain) for about 20 minutes, if I didn't have milk in my mouth it felt like there was 100 white hot knives stabbing every spot in my mouth.<br /><br />In short : SWEET!
