These Chef Boyardee Mini Raviolis from Amazon are the same price I pay at Wal Mart - about 88 cents a can - and its the kids fave, so having a case on hand is excellent! Each ravioli is bite size and just right for little kids who still like to eat with a SPOON. They are a little bigger than "spoon size" shredded wheat, but still small enough to fit a spoon. Not high in fat or calories, they make a nice hot emergency meal for adults, too! FYI: These contain SOY (TVP) if you need to know that. Enjoy!
