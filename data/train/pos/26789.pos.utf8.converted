What can I say? It's roast beef hash. I've loved hash (corned & roast beef) since I was a kid. Comes 6 in a pack. I'm down to 1 can. Always filling, great with a scrambled egg mixed in while frying. 1 can was dented, but no biggie. Cause I'm still alive to write this review.  Long live Mary Kitchen Roast Beef Hash!
