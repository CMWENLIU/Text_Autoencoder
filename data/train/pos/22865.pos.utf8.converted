I am not a cheese expert nor do I claim to be one so this kind of cheese is new to me.  If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.  It was a nice way to taste the way different cheeses from different places vary.  Now that I have the taste for gourmet cheese and its grown on me quite a bit I don't know if I can go back to normal supermarket cheese anymore.
