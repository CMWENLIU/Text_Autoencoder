Hi, I just wanted to put my two cents in regarding maca. I learned awhile back that supplements, superfoods, herbs etc. must be taken consistently in order to experience results.I began taking maca for its<br />nutrition and reputed adaptogenic effects (similar to ginseng). I later learned through research that it is a food and does not need to be taken in small amounts.Since I was a part time softball player after work and trying to increase my fitness, I also increased maca intake. Oatmeal, smoothies, soup, beverages. I had maca at least twice a day in 1-2 ounce portions. I also want to add I was not on caffeine at this time- I valued my sleep. It took about 2 and a half weeks to notice a marked improvement in energy and mood.This experiment 3 years ago convinced me that maca works for me and I haven't been without it for long since.<br />  Do try this in small amounts first. The taste is not bad,but malty and a bittersweet, like dong quai.You will pay quite a bit more for small packaging and/or gelatin capsules, but it will be worth it if you can reap the benefits.Then go for the big bag and never let go of your health.
