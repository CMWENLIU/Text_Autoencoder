Great sampler packet. I have tried other brands of ready to eat Indian foods such as Jyoti and Tasty Bite. This brand compares favorably and I do plan on buying this exact product again. It is not overly hot but is spicey - so while it may be a bit much for some children, adults should do fine.<br /><br />As these types of vegetarian items (or near veggie since some of the sampler includes paneer cheese which is like cubes of tofu but with a cheesy taste), are highly pureed in texture, except when there are beans, they can be used as sauces over rice, shell pasta, quinoa, couscous, polenta, potatoes, etc.  The bean ones could be heated and used in lieu of soup or chili for lunch with a crusty french bread for instance. Would pair great with a fresh salad.<br /><br />Product is excellent for those looking for all those great spices like cumin, curry, tumeric, peppers, and the like. Also qualifies as a whole food.<br /><br />Highly portable since packaged in tear away foil packets which are light weight and could be eaten out of them in a pinch if don't mind your fingers getting a bit messy reaching in and out of the foil to spoon out the food. I don't recommend trying to eat with a fork as even the bean ones are in sauces. Foil packages are not for the microwave but product eats fine at room temperature. Great for camping, picnics, road trips, etc.
