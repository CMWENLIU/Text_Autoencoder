I really like the fact that the peppercorns arrived in a airtight bag. When I opened the bag the arroma was wonderful. This is the same type of black pepper you can buy at any grocery store but if you compare price per ounce; this definately is the better choice! Great product. I will be a return customer for these peppercorns in the future.
