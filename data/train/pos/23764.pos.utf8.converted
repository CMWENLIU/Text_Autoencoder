I read the reviews of this product..so I decided to buy it. I am so glad I did. It is actually a plastic bottle, which is great because I dropped it soon after opening the box. The smell is so strong, it makes the other bottle of vanilla smell funny..like a vanilla want to be. I threw the other bottle away, even though it was almost full. I didn't write this review until it was used. My mom(who lives with me)made her pancakes. She usually has some left over..not that day. They were the most flavorful pancakes I have ever tasted. You can really taste the difference. I usually sneak my dog Porky a piece or two under the table. Not that day...he is still mad at me. My mom had to make another batch because everyone ate more than usual. If you buy this product, make sure you make enough...it really is that good!!!
