I've been eating dark chocolate since Hershey came out with Special Dark in the 70's. I discovered Dove, Ghirardelli, and more recently Scharffen-Berger, etc. A few years ago I tried this stuff and, honestly, I haven't looked back. It has fantastic flavor and, most importantly, it has the perfect melting point - NO waxiness - just starts melting and releasing complex flavor the moment you put it in your mouth. Not too sweet, not too bitter. I've had re-trials of some big-name dark chocolates in recent years (recalling swooning over them in the past), but continue to go back to Green & Black. Haven't tried the 85% but will soon.<br /><br />BTW, WalMart is selling these for 2.97 a bar, and occasionally Walgreen's will run them @ 2 for $5 - last time, I stocked up!
