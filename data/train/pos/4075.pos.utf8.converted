We have tried all kinds of pasta -- quinoa, whole wheat, veggie, etc.  This was the first pasta where my husband and I both liked it and could hardly tell the difference with regular pasta.  We have five kids.  Three out of five can't tell the difference.  One hates all pasta and the other will eat it as long as their is sauce on it.  We make a big batch and reheat in the microwave.  It holds up nicely and doesn't dry out like regular pasta.  Highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to regular noodles.
