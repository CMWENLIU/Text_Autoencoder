These traps are part of a program of integrated pest managemnt...ipm.  They are doused with pheromones from female moths so that they attract male moths and break the breeding cycle.  They work extremely well on that part of the process.  In fact, the minute you open the little package with the trap male moths start fluttering at you like drunken frat boys!  The second part of the program involves repelling the moths from their furry dinners.  Lavender, bay and cedar in a closet help.  Bagging sweaters over the summer will also help.  Being green really is not easy.  It takes extra steps and some research.  This is the way natures works.  We have killed off whatever the predator was for the moths so now we have to figure out how we can manipulate the cycle.  If you think about it, however, the moths are actually kind of a good thing.  If it weren't for these hair/fur eating creatures the earth would be a giant hair ball hanging in space.  Now if safer would only make traps for those annoying people who drive thru my neighborhood with blasting stereos I would be a happy woman!
