First off, I wanted to correct every bullet point in the product listing above.<br /><br />1. This is 4 six packs or 24 cans of soda, for a total of 288 ounces, not 48.  So, currently a little more than .60 a can.  Considering how difficult this product can be to find in certain geographical locations, this is to many people, quite a deal.  Much better than 3.61 a can anyway.<br /><br />2. The flavor has nothing at all to do with iced tea and I wouldn't describe Cel-Ray as "iced tea like" in the least.  It's much more comparable to ginger ale, or ginger beer.  It's less sweet than 7-UP or Sprite and more spicy or peppery with a mild, light vegetable undertone to it from the celery seed extract.<br /><br />3. While it's LESS sweet than most soft drinks on the market it's certainly sweet, as corn syrup is the second listed ingredient after carbonated water.  Granted they must use a lot less than regular soft drinks but it's plenty and Cel-Ray qualifies as "sweet."  It's also fairly strongly carbonated.  If pouring into a glass, you will see a light greenish-yellow color and a big, substantial head at the top of the glass.<br /><br />If you've never tried this before and it sounds iffy to you, you might want to taste test it first.  But for anyone with fond memories of pairing a Cel-Ray with a pastrami on rye, you already know how great they taste.  If you are a regular drinker of ginger beer or "hot" ginger ale then your tongue is ready for Cel-Ray.  This soda also makes a great mixer for Gin or Vodka.  It works pretty well for times when your stomach is upset too.  One of my all time favorites.
