Vegan. Organic. Kosher pareve. Fat free. Low salt. Beautiful homemade flavor. Best vegan baked beans I have ever tried. Wow. Eleven stars. Very high quality. Great side dish, with rice, on crackers, or "on toast" for breakfast (or anytime) as our friends in the U.K. love to do. Approx. 525 calories, 28g protein, 0g fat, and 455mg sodium per can. Made with organic navy beans, organic sorghum, organic tomato puree, organic apple cider vinegar, organic mustard seed, organic onion, organic spices, and sea salt.
