<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056WJGHK">Organic Mountains 100% Pure Honey - Orange Blossom (Raw & Unfiltered)</a><br /><br />This is the best honey I've tasted in a long time...My dad kept bees on our farm when I was just a kid and produced delectable raw honey...It wasn't orange blossom but it was wonderful...The honey on store shelves today can't match this Organic Mountain or the honey I had growing up...This is the real thing produced by USA bees (they have passports!) and not a mish-mash of honey collected from other countries and mixed together...I'm not a honey gourmet but I do know what tastes good and this Orange Blossom honey has a darker mellow taste to it and is very sweet...I also like the fact that it is organic and a purer form than usual store honey and comes in a great drip free container...It's like coming home to the long ago remembered experience of raw honey right out of the comb...I'm looking forward to trying the Wildflower next...
