Last Christmas I left my husband with a batch of sugar cookie dough in the fridge and told him to make Christmas cookies.  So, he cut out and baked dozens of trees.  Palm trees.  Hmmm, I never thought palm trees were particularly Christmas-y, but what do I know?  I then assigned him the task of decorating the cookies and left him with a variety of options and was a bit timid to see what he would do.  What he did was pipe them all in white and then dust them with opal sanding sugar.  They looked gorgeous and very festive.  I think the cookies got more compliments than anything else we prepared for the party!
