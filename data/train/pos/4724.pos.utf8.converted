This product is very popular in France and when I had some foods cooked with it, I had to have some. The only problem I had with this was that apparently it had to ship refrigerated to preserve it which cost me just as much as the product itself. I ended up spending around $50.on a gallon so I'm not so sure I'll be purchasing another one.
