I just happened to stumble upon this product from a fitness blog I had been reading.  So on a whim I ordered it...a week later when it arrived I couldn't wait to taste it....after years of searching for a "go to" health product I have finally found it.  This stuff is AMAZING - it does really taste like chocolate...I made it as a smoothie with almond milk and a banana and it was incredible.  It satisfies that chocolate craving while providing you with a ton of nutrients.  Not sure why some people said this tasted bad, but trust me this is worth ordering!  I am a personal trainer and would recommend this product to my clients, so do try!!!
