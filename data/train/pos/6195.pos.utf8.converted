I'm a recent chai drinker, and tetley masala brand is definitely my favorite brand. I need to have it every afternoon, else the day feels incomplete.<br />Our neighbourhood grocery store(namaste plaza) doesn't have sufficient stock of this flavor, so I'm glad to have found it on Amazon. I've tried other flavors like Elaichi and Ginger, and also masala flavor by other brands(Tea India), but nothing comes close. Having said that, chai tastes are highly personal, so i wouldn't be surprised if others felt differently. But hey, this is my review!
