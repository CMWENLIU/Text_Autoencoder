I ordered 3, 5lb containers of orange blossom honey. Shipping honey can be dicey, there's always a chance you're going to open a box to an exploded plastic container and a huge mess, not to mention useless honey. Not so with these guys. Each jug had the lid taped, and then each was sealed up in its own plastic bag and then they were double boxed. I greatly appreciate the little bit of extra effort. Not only was the shipping fast and well packaged they were also considerably less in cost for a bulk item than anyone else I could find. I'll definitely buy from them again.
