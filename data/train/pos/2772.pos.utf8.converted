I have two Basenjis both of who are under breed weight/size and who have corn allergies. I cannot stress enough how awesome this food has been for them. Their appetites are up, they are putting on weight, they have more energy where their other food (which was also on the Top Ten Dog Foods List) made them sluggish and caused one to lick a hole in herself. This food has given me my girls back and I recommend it highly to anyone who has issues with small breeds with allergies. I could go on and on about the differences but honestly, buy a bag and try it. There is nothing I can say that you won't see for yourself.
