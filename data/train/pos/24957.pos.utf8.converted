The Shirataki Noodles were awesome!!!!  My sister and I purchased 20 bags and they are almost gone, we cook them everyday!!!  Yes, they do have a funny odor when you first open the bag, DUMP THEM IN A STRAINER AND RUN COLD WATER OVER THEM FOR A MINUTE AND THEN BOIL THEM FOR LIKE 5 MINS!!!!  They are totally great!!!  I have made them with spaghetti sauce, stirfried (after being boiled) with veggies and shrimp.  Stirfried with veggies and parm cheese, just some teriyaki sauce and grilled chicken in a skillet!!!!  I can go on and on.... The only bad thing was we waited 3 weeks for our shipment, but we are ordering another big shipment with several friends that love them too!!!!  They are really filling (serving size is half a bag, but we have been eating the whole bag, and who cares, its a total of 40 calories and 2 carbs!!!  (no sugar)  Shirataki Noodles are truly amazing and a great way to feel good about yourself!!!!
