This is the parmigiano I remember from the neighborhood Italian market when I was a girl.<br /><br />The taste is lovely and piquant - a little goes a long way in the flavor department. There are the wonderful little crystals in the cheese.  And it is aged so that it crumbles really nicely when cut.<br /><br />It is absolutely delicious eating out-of-hand, which is the way I prefer it.  Just a little piece is so satisfying. (I am 100% Italian, first generation American, and my parents were real 'foodies', so I like to think I know my cheeses!)<br /><br />The Parmigiano was also packaged really well.  It came extremely cold in a little styrofoam container, with a cold pack and additional padding, inside a cardboard box.<br /><br />(.....)<br /><br />I would order this cheese again and I look forward to ordering with (....) again, too.  Check out their website for fantastical things!
