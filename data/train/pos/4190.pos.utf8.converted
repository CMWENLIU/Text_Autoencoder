While traveling in Nepal, I was introduced to full-cream powdered milk. Not only was it great tasting, but was a safer alternative to local supply. Since returning to the United States, it has been IMPOSSIBLE to find! Yes, plenty of the poor tasting low-fat varieties are in every supermarket - but no full cream anywhere!<br /><br />Some months ago, PEAK Dry Whole Milk became available through internet suppliers. Four cans were ordered and enjoyed. The milk has the fine full taste of European dairy products.<br /><br />BEST USE: put powder directly in tea or coffee. Makes your morning brew rich and creamy!<br /><br />Hope Amazon will also offer the smaller cans which are more convenient for travel.
