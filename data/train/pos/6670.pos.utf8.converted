Let me put it this way: I do not have the most discriminating taste buds in the world.  I dated a woman who would take a bite of butter and say "Num, this is good, the cows ate flowers on the north side of the barn".  This was especially remarkable since we had zero idea where the tasty butter had come from.  I on the other hand would announce, "Good butter.  Very solid.  No mold."  This does save me a lot of money.  Bottles of wine over $20 bucks are all wasted on me because I cannot pick out the toasted essence of pergola or whatever.  If it doesn't have chunks, I'm good to go.  In other words, my palate responds clumsily to food nuance.  Don't get me wrong, this doesn't keep me from loving to eat.  It just makes it a little less flattering when I tell the cook "Gosh that was delicious!"  They look at me like they just got a compliment from a Labrador.<br /><br />Anyway, I preface this review with those personal insights to say "Yes, real Celtic Sea Salt is really good!"  I can taste the difference.  It's that significantly better than standard table salt or even other supposed sea salts (sorry, just because it's big lumps of salt doesn't make it any more authentic).<br /><br />The taste of Celtic Salt is a symphony, compared with table salt, which is like your nephew playing the plastic recorder.  It's just that much richer of an experience.  The first thing I noticed is that it didn't have that sharp one-note taste of table salt that anesthetizes your tongue.<br /><br />So basically I'm saying if I think it's great, you'll probably think it's really great!
