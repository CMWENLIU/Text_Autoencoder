A while back I went on a quest to find the best cocoa powder, and the Cacao Barry Extra Brut won hands-down.  It has a very deep, rich chocolate flavor, without any off-notes or bitterness.  Despite what you may read elsewhere, this dutch-process cocoa actually has a stronger chocolate flavor than the natural cocoa powders I have tried, so it is a good substitute for them.  I recommend it for any baking or cooking recipes.
