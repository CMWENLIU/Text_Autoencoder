I am so Thankful that there are companies out there trying to make products for those of us, who need Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free.  These noodles really take on the taste of whatever you make.  But you must wash in warm water first for 3-5 minutes to get rid of fishy smell.  And it does go completely away.  If it dosn't you should call the company and let them know, because you may have gotten a bad batch or something.<br /><br />Now, the texture is more like Top Ramen noodles, which makes it perfect for soup. But I have also used it for other types of sauces. You just have to get use to the interesting texture like for Spegetti Sauce.<br /><br />These Noodles are a winner for me, and I will continues to use them, although, they are a bit expensive for a big family.  I hope as they become popular for, Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free Eaters, that the price will go down, and be more reasonable to buy.  Keep up the good work Miracle Noodles Company, and may other companies pick up on the idea of making more prodcuts that are Low-Carb, Soy, Wheat, & Gluten Free too.
