I had to write a review for this wonderful brand of dog food when I saw that no one gave it the credit it so richly deserves. Natures Variety Instinct is completely grain free and made from 95% meat and 5% assorted oils (like olive oil and fish oil), vegetables, fruits, and vitamins/minerals. I was a loyal follower of Canadie dog food for years until they decided to change their formula and increase their amounts of grains being used. Then the reports came in stating that so many dogs were getting sick over it. I was at a loss until I came across this line of dog food from a small manufacturing group. The reviews I read online were phenomenal and I decided to try it. I have a baby long-haired Chihuahua that absolutely loves this food. It doesnt give her an upset stomach, nor does it make her stools runny. She only has to eat a very small amount because its so nutrient packed. Her coat looks lustrous and her eyes sparkle. I decided to use the chicken meal formula because it offered a higher protein intake compared to the other instinct dry food options., but all of them offer the same fat intake and omega-3&6. It may not have the fancy commercials and the marketing campaign of more well known dog foods like Purina, but it more then makes up for it by making a product of exceptional quality.
