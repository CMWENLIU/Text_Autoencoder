As background, I have had my Tassimo Coffeemaker for over a year and use it daily. My favorite use is a final cup of coffee in the evening after dinner. Rather than make an entire pot, the T-Disc permit a freshly brewed single cup.<br /><br />Although I am not a total fanatic, when making a full pot, I do grind coffee beans just before brewing coffee, use filtered water, and keep everything quite clean in order to obtain the best taste possible. My preference is strong bold coffee. When it comes to T-Discs I normally stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW">Starbucks Africa Kitamu Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2">Starbucks Caffe Verona Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]. Of course, the difference between what one person thinks is good and another thinks is drek, is, well, a matter of taste.<br /><br />After dinner, I've often reached my caffeine limit for the day. Currently, there are only two decaffeinated T-Discs available -- Maxwell House and Gevalia. Normally I probably would not buy Maxwell House coffee but after plowing through a free sampler pack of Gevalia T-discs that was included with my Tassimo, I found the taste too harshly acidic. Perhaps with cream and sugar it is improved? I don't know, but since I drink my coffee black, it's irrelevant.<br /><br />I find the Maxwell House disc to be smooth and surprisingly good. I realize that different notes in coffee appeal to different palates, so keep that in mind. I certainly hope the future brings other decaffeinated varieties to choose from, but for the time being, I am quite happy.
