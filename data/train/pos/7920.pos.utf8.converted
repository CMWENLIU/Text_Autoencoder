I really appreciated the packaging of this oil because the edge of the bottle opening is slightly curved in such a way that there's no drip (for me at least) after pouring oil out of the bottle, which has been a constant problem for me with other brands of olive oil I've bought from the supermarket because I don't transfer the oil to another container (like you see on cooking shows) - I keep things simple and just pour it out of the original container. Now I don't have to worry about oily surfaces and sticky bottle sides. It's just a little thing, but it makes things so much more worth it in considering whether I want to go for this brand or another.<br /><br />Taste was good as any olive oil I've had. Upon opening the bottle, I had a bit by itself and I was extremely happy with the quality. Better than what's in the grocery aisles. It's not that much more expensive than bigger brands, so I'd definitely recommend trying this brand out at least once. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
