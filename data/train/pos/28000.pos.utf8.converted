This blue corn masa (flour) is exceptional. I bought it to use in a variety of ways: cornbread, stuffing, tortillas and recently, I made gorditas with it.  I'm gluten free so using corn as a grain is nice from time to time.  The blue corn variety is deeper and much richer in taste than it's yellow counterpart. I prefer the richness it has when combined with other food. However, if I was just making cornbread for example (which is all about the corn and nothing much combined in it) I'd probably go for the yellow flour which is less intense. Making corn tortillas from the blue corn and stuffing the tortillas with ground beef, salsa, etc...is a much better experience with the blue corn; it adds an intensity to the whole taste. I love it. I'd like to try making tamales using the blue corn masa. I'll report back.
