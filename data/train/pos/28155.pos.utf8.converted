Amazon and its reviewers saved me again.  With my doctor on vacation and no refills on my diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) I was desperate for something. I am in my 30s but have terrible osteoarthritis in my knees - thank you soccer!  I could no longer see the bones or tendons in my feet because of fluid draining off of my knees and felt sluggish and miserable.  Heard about the tea and was very skeptical until I read reviews here from users.  I purchased immediately from a local store for about $7/box, tried one sachet and was not impressed.  The taste and smell are indeed coffee like and though I'm not a big coffee fan it grew on me.  It didn't work for me until a couple of days of continued drinking and using 2 sachets per 8 oz cup.  With one packet of splenda this tastes like an entirely different drink, kinda buttery and smoky.  I was skeptical about dandelion roots but apparently God put them here for a reason. :-)  I will not be going back on my diuretic, which is thrilling, and may be able to cut back on the prescription anti-inflammatories as well.<br /><br />Also, it could be coincidence but I seem to be experiencing relief with my arthritis and premenstrual cramps.  It's miracle tea!  I will be back to Amazon for my next purchase of this item due to the much better price.  My fiance heard it could have some benefits for diabetes and has started drinking it as well.  We both look forward to our tea time and will report back on any noticed befits with his blood sugar.
