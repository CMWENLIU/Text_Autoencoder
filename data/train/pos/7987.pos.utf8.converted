I have used many chili mixes but this is my families favorite by a landslide. We can't find it in our local stores anymore so thank goodness it can be found here on Amazon. I don't follow the recipie on the box. After experimenting with this mix many times, I have found the following instuctions will result in probably  the best chili we have ever had-  I use the 12 cup mix ( added to 1.5-1.75 pounds ground round, 2 large ( 29 oz)  cans of good tomato sauce or puree , 1 15 ounce can of diced or whole tomatoes and 1 15 ounce can of undrained  kidney beans.) Sometimes I add a can of mexicorn. This makes perfect chili everytime- just the right heat with a hint of sweetness. It is the perfect thickness made as described  above and even better heated up the next day as  the flavors blend overnight.  Everyone raves over this chili and says it is the best they ever had, it really is chili cook off quality.
