I am usually indifferent to potato chips, but these are the exception.  I first tried them when visiting a friend in Colorado and thought they were delicious.<br /><br />Don't order them if you've never tried them, because they are not like other salt & vinegar chips, and if that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed.  The malt vinegar gives the chips a slight sweet taste which goes quite nicely with the salt - for those of us who like these chips, anyway.<br /><br />Incidentally, this is is a good price for these chips.  Assuming you can get free shipping, it works out to about $1.60 per bag, which is cheaper than you'd ever find them in the store.
