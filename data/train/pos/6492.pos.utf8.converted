Purchased for my wife the vegan. She loves this product and uses for shakes or sprinkles on her hot cereal in the morning. She has me order more as soon as she starts getting low. On the flip side if you are a "meat & taters" person like myself it is an acquired taste as I don't like it much. In a nutshell....<br />Vegans & Veggie lovers = GOOD!!<br />Junk food Junkies = You could use some help
