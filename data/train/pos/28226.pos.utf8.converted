I usually make my own curries from scratch, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and prefer not to spend the time required.  At that point, I'd head to one of the several good Indian restaurants to satisfy my curry cravings.<br /><br />I read the reviews here, and decided to give the Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Lamb a try.  All I can say is WOW!  This stuff really IS good.  At just over $2.00 per package, it's a great deal, too.  Each package makes 2-3 servings -- very reasonable indeed.<br /><br />I used lamb shoulder, cut into bite-sized pieces, and browned it a bit (the instructions don't tell you to do that, but I like the flavor), then added the paste and 2 cups of water.  Bring it to a boil, and let it simmer for 45 minutes or so.  I paired it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XIZMQ">Saffron Yellow Rice</a>, and it was very tasty.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more of this.  I also purchased the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken mix at the same time, and can't wait to try it!
