Great service, Great product, just awesome. The shipping really is included in the price though that may be confusing, came overnight as said perfect timing and in actuality a little be earlier than said. Great price per berry couldn't find any better price (located in the U.S. too)and with my shipment there was actually few more berries than I ordered. If you want to buy miracle berries than Ethan's Garden is way to go!
