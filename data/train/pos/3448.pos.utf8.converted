This is one of the BEST inventions for those of us who are gluten free and a good alternative for vegetarians who are health conscious.  These noodles are strictly made from organic black beans and cook up wonderfully in about 6 minutes.  They are very filling and you don't need to eat much to appreciate them.  Each bag contains 4 servings and a serving is all you need. They are just barely a little bit heavier in texture than a "normal" noodle.  But, with the higher protein these contain and the health benefits of eating vegetarian or gluten free, they are a perfect substitute.<br /><br />As with most alternative noodle choices, you cannot cook up too much and store them in a sauce.  They will absorb the moisture and get mushy.  You can cook the entire bag, let them cool and then place them into individual baggies or containers to freeze for later.  They defrost well and maintain their flavor.<br /><br />For people afraid these will taste too much like beans, you don't have to worry; they do not.  I have served these noodles to a couple picky teenagers who loved them and wanted me to give them more.
