The crunchy chocolate squares in this box were a real surprise and I love how delicate the crunch is when encased in a burst of delicious chocolate.<br /><br />You may also enjoy the Mint chocolates. They are delicious after dinner or anytime you want to wake up your taste buds. The mint flavor bursts from these chocolates as if it was encased in little sugar crystals. It is quite perfect and refreshing.<br /><br />I also love the Cinnamon and Orange. If you have been dreaming of the most delicious orange flavored chocolates in the world, you have to try the Orange Napolitains. I love both equally, although the cinnamon flavor has me completely seduced.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own.<br /><br />Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Mint Chocolate Oblivion. The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the best cinnamon you have ever tasted with the silkiest creamiest Belgian chocolate in the world.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
