I didn't start out with any health problems when I began taking Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar several years ago, neither chronic nor acute problems--I almost never get flu or colds--so I can't report on any miracle cures. So why do I take 1 tablespoon every day? Because I consider it tremendous preventive nutrition. It has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is crucial for health, and it aids digestion. As we get older, our body's production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach decreases, and the acidity of Bragg helps with that problem.<br /><br />Personally, I love the taste of this wonderful vinegar in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014ET1S8">V8 low sodium vegetable juice</a>. Previously I had used lemon juice in my V8, but this is even better.<br /><br />Highly recommended1
