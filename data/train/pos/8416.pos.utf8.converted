ACAI Powerscoop Powder 90 Grams<br /><br />According to the product literature, this ACAI powder by Sambazon is organic and USDA stamped.  I wanted a good antioxidant supplement to take in addition to my other supplements.  It is a deep purple color, tastes good, and easily dissolves in liquid.  I take mine every morning mixed into my oat bran cereal or stir it into milk or juice.  I have so far purchased 4 cans, and each can lasts for about one month.  I find it gives me energy, and eliminates bloating and gas which I had before starting this product.  It also seems to help my joints for mobility, which I assume is because it is acting on inflamation such as arthritis.  I feel that my skin is looking better and I have recommended it to my son who has dry, sensitive skin.  I am delighted with this product.
