Ever since I was a child I have loved Slim Jim Meat Sticks.  The slightly spicy juice that comes out each time you snap into one of these bad boys is enough to convert even the hardest heart.  True, they do leave a waxy residue in your mouth, and it helps to drink something with it to wash it down, but you can't deny the flavor.  The smooth, exciting design of the meat stick makes it feel good in your mouth, as there are no jagged or rough edges, as is normal in your run-of-the-mill jerky-type snacks.  Plus, they are fun to eat!  I have never had such a great time as when I'm ramming meat stick after meat stick into my mouth, and sucking the juice out of this tasty meat.  They're so much fun to eat that you can stay home all night just eating these, and still have a better time than if you were to go out on the town.  In fact, I have considered throwing Slim Jim Meat Stick parties, where all we do is gather together and eat meat sticks.  I'm entirely serious about this.  They are that good!  And with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, you don't even have to worry about constantly re-ordering them.  You can have them sent automatically to your house every month!  A great deal for a great snack!
