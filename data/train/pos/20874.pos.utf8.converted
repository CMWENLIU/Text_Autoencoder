First - there are a LOT of gumballs - this will keep my candy bowl filled much longer than I expected :)<br /><br />Second - these came very fresh and that was a pleasant surprise (hoped for but not anticipated :)<br /><br />Third - these are sold by Sam's Club apparently, which I didn't know when I ordered them.
