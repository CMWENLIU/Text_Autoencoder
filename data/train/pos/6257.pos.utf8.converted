This is simply the best ready prepared demi-glace you can buy.  I was disappointed when Amazon stopped selling this for a while, so I'm happy they brought it back.  This is a must-have for amateur chefs since so many classical sauces use it as the base.  There are a multitude of quick sauces you can make from this without the 2-3 days needed to prepare your own demi-glace base.  Worth the money if you want to make classical sauces without investing a lot of time in the kitchen.
