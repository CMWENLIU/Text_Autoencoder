I was surprised to see the "review" written by whoever thought this was like swallowing dirt. Don't listen to the haters. I don't think they could ever have even tasted this. This is the real deal and it's actually good. First of all, it doesn't have any kind of grittiness to it. If you closed your eyes and drank it, it would just be water to you.<br /><br />All I can say is that drinking this has given me more energy than I've had in a long time, and it's hard to describe, but I just feel better. Try it, you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Again, just remember there are plenty of haters out there. I'm a lover NOT a hater!!
