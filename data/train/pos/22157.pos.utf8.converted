This low fat Fudge Brownie mix is truly tasty and delicious! I use this mix for snack purposes. Here's a little treat:<br />I dump the product into a Tupperware container and flatten the box for safekeeping in case I need to refer to it for instructions or nutritional info.<br />I place 4 heaping tablespoons of mix in a small microwave bowl. (A Pyrex bowl seems to work better for this, as there is less sticking.) Then I add 4 heaping spoonfuls of water. (With this snack method, you don't need butter or oil.) Batter will be a bit runny, but mix well until all batter lumps have dissolved. Microwave on high for approximately 1 minute. Microwaves vary so you'll have to rely on trial and error to make the right time choices. Anyhow, the finished product is yummy with a few scoops of fat free frozen yogurt, some spoonfuls of cherry pie filling (or cherry preserves in a pinch,) topped off with a bit of chocolate syrup. The combination of these ingredients make a highly 'naughty' tasting lowfat treat. Enjoy!
