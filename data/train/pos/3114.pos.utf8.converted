*****<br /><br />Dry Desert Lime is an unusual premium Numi tea. It is herbal tea (caffeine-free) containing solely dried lime---that's all---not lime and green/black tea, not artificial lime flavor, but real lime---alone---a truly remarkable feat. It is certified organic, and is kosher. It has the most amazing tart and lovely taste.  If you like lime, you'll love this tea.  If you don't like lime, definitely pass, as it is a very intense "lime experience".  I love it!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer lyrically writes: "From the far reaches of the Arabian Desert, this rare lime has been enjoyed for thousands of years, both as a spice in Middle Eastern cuisine and as a teasan. Traditionally harvested and dried in the hot desert sun, this oasis of Vitamin C has been drunk to soothe just about everything. The first taste brings a distant yet familiar impression, leaving the trace of a fleeting memory on the tip of your tongue. We find that its clean, bracing, and reviving citrus pleasure, nicely balanced with a touch of sugar, lifts the blues. Try it, you'll fall in love with it!"<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas and enjoy lime, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love lime, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. In fact, I have never heard of anyone else making this tea.  I enjoy serving it to company, but even more, just for me.<br /><br />*****
