Quality, taste,versatility & price makes this a great food product to use your imagination with. It's flavorful without being overbearing, the ingredients are fresh-tasting & the very useful size & container make it a 'must-have' in your fridge. I've used it as suggested but also made rice with it (try a little orange juice for liquid), I've marinated pork loin, put it on a beef roast w/ extra tamarind paste, made soup with spinach, noodles & left-over chicken...Versatility is it's middle name. Use your imagination & enjoy this delcious sauce.  Purchased during a 'Grocery sale' & joining Prime for shipping gives this added bonus.
