I first tasted this tea at a very expensive buffet in Hawaii.  I enjoyed it so much I asked the waiter about it and he gave me several bags to take with me.  I'm not too picky about my tea, as I feel even the cheap lipton stuff is fine for day to day hot or cold tea drinking, if used properly.  I've tried dozens of different types of tea as I've been drinking both hot and cold tea all my life.  This tea gives off a sweet smell and has a taste similar to some chinese "flower" teas.  The nearest I can come to describing the flavor is if you've had a Kerns Guava, imagine a much more mild (not as sweet) version of that flavor in a tea.  This is by far the best tea I've ever had.  If you enjoy flavored tea, if you appreciate the difference between Earl Grey and cheap Lipton tea then you'll enjoy this tea also.
