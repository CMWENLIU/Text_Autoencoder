This flour is outstanding. Very fresh, delicious flavor. As the other review noted, it's finely and evenly milled so the texture of breads is much more refined than with normal whole wheat flour. I just topped a cassoulet with some drop biscuits made with half unbleached white flour and half this whole wheat pastry flour--the "is that whole grain again" factor never arose. Using 100% whole wheat is also great in banana bread and other uses. The half and half biscuits were as light as usual and much tastier. I will buy this again, and again and again. Note--whole wheat flour can go rancid quickly and 25 lbs is a lot for most homes, so I freeze what I'm not going to use in a couple of weeks in tightly sealed 1 or 2-gallon ziplock bags.
