Like most Keurig owners, we have had so much fun trying various flavors.  We stumbled across this one at a Target and bought it immediately. When we got home, I couldnt get the k-cup in the machine fast enough. The minute the seal is broken, you can smell the raspberry. As it brews, the aroma that fills your house is divine...just like chocolate and raspberry. I do enjoy the Van Haute Vanilla but I feel it is a weak cup of coffee and I don't think the vanilla flavor is very strong. The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle is the opposite...the flavor tastes as rich as it smells. And man, it is amazing and smooth, not too overpowering.<br /><br />I think this would be the perfect after-dinner coffee or a dessert coffee served with biscotti or some other coffee cookie. It isn't too sweet though and makes a great cup of coffee for anytime of the day as well.<br /><br />I love this coffee so much wrote this review. Other coffees I like (but am not writing a review for) are: Island Coconut, Timothy's Decaf, Sweet Tea (iced), Dunkin' Donuts (any of them), Chocolate Glazed Donut and Sleepytime Tea.
