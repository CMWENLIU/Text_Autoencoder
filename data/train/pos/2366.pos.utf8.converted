I am very pleased to get these beans that are organic and in BPA-free cans. These two things are top priority for me, after that it has to be taste and these are as tasty as canned kidney beans that are organic get. I use them in the crockpot to make chili and they come out just fine. It is a canned food so I think that expectations of having a firm texture and all that are a little too unrealisic, what canned food has that? These weren't mushy just soft as I would expect them to be. If you want the convenience of not having to cook beans for hours at a time and to be able to know that it is of great quality then this is worth buying.
