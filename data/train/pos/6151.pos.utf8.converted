Bought it for a gift.  Arrived in perfect condition and made a great presentation.  There was something in the basket for everyone in the family.  Products were all the favorite snacks like nuts, cookies, taffy, summer sausage but much more intriguing - the basket was opened immediately so everyone could try a Malt Shop Taffy (chocolate shake, rootbeer float and cherry cola!).  The all natural nuts were fresh and crunchy and the sausage was delicious on its own but even better with the mustard that accompanied it.<br /><br />*I ordered this basket when my wife gave me the task of buying a present for a party. In my quick perusal of Amazon, I felt I completed my assignment perfectly.  My wife, of course, checked up on my order and was horrified to see I ordered something that received some 1 star reviews.  The days were looooong until the package showed up and I was accused, more than once, of not being detail oriented enough.  Thankfully I was absolutely vindicated when the basket arrived.  After reading the other reviewers (and reading what "vine" was) clearly there was a mix up with the baskets sent to that program - that seems to happen early so they are the first reviews - which unfortunately caused me agita (why I am even taking the time to write this).  I hope no one else will be confused by this very strange situation.  And no, if I realized I would have been in the dog house for the shipping period, I wouldn't have picked this item -- however, for the record, I was right.
