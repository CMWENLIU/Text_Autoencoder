Everyone here gave the Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice (Apple) a thumbs UP!  It was refreshing, not loaded with carbs!  Not too sweet!  Nice green apple flavor!  Nice size cans too!  If my teens will drink it, hey, I'm happy!  They loved it!  They did like the green apple better than the clementine..the clementine was a bit stronger tasting, but I liked it!
