I was introduced to medium roast 'C&C' (Coffee and Chicory) when<br />we went to breakfast at Stanley's in the French Quarter and I was<br />hooked.  (Most days I am choking down the last of my Maxwell House<br />so it doesn't go to waste but I'm counting the days til it's all gone.)<br />The medium roast C&C is much smoother than regular coffee and I<br />don't taste any bitterness at all.<br /><br />French Market's medium roast Restaurant Blend (white can) is awesome.<br />It says on the plastic lid to use 1/3 to 1/2 as much as regular coffee<br />(so a 1-pound can is the equivalent of a 2-pound can of coffee).  Based<br />on my experience, using only 1/3 wouldn't be enough - a 1/2 is better.<br /><br />One bit of advice I can give to those who add milk or cream to their<br />coffee - don't try adding milk or cream until the color matches what<br />you had with coffee or it'll be weakened too much.  The C&C will be<br />darker with the 'right' amount of milk or cream.<br /><br />As I write this Amazon's page says it's not available but I found it's<br />available directly from French Market [...]<br />for $7 a 1-pound can ($1 less if you order 12 cans or more).  I plan<br />on handing out cans as Christmas gifts.
