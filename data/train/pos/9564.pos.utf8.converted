I absolutely love this product. I've been a faithful customer of Fantastic Foods since 1991, and I have always loved these beans. Like all refried beans, they do need salt. But they are seasoned, have a luscious texture and taste fresh - unlike that awful stuff in a can that always has an odd odor and tastes tinny. If you have never tried anything other than the canned, you owe it to yourself to try these refried beans. Did i mention they are ridicously easy? 1 3/4 cup of boiling water and 5 minutes. Perfection.
