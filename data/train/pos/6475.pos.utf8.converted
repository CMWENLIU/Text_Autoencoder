I was so happy to find this food on Amazon AND with FREE SHIPPING! We recently moved to Alaska and have had SUCH a hard time finding this dog food. My in-laws breed Golden Retrievers, and we brought one of their puppies with us to Alaska. He has grown up on this food, and it is a great quality. He is developing a beautiful coat and strong muscles. My in-laws that breed Golden's use this brand for all their dogs, puppy and adult!
