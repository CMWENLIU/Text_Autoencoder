Osem's Israeli couscous is some of the finest pasta I have ever had.<br /><br />The taste and texture that these little balls of yumminess produce is just amazing. There are some many different ways to prepare it and so many dishes and side-dishes you can make with it. I just can't say enough good things about this pasta.<br /><br />If you take a little bit of extra time to toast these babies before you cook them up, talk about a completely different level of taste.<br /><br />From entr&eacute;es, to side-dishes, I have yet to find a way I couldn't prepare this couscous. Italian style, with chop suey (as a replacement for rice), even mexican style. This is probably one of the most versatile foods on the planet.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
