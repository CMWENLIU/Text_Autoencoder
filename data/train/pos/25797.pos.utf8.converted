I grew up with this stuff. My family is not Japanese, far from it, we're actually from New Hampshire! Anyways my grandmother would buy this stuff from a small grocery store and ship it to family all over New England. (sorry Amazon you were not around yet!) Anyway the store closed and yadda yadda yadda I thought I'd never have it again. Thanks Amazon for bringing me my favorite sauce and reviving many childhood memories!
