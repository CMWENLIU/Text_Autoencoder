I recently bought a water distiller that came with a small jar of Citric acid crystals intended for periodic cleaning of the distiller unit.  I bought this product after I consumed the contents of the small jar.  The cost for this product was about 1/4 per oz and it is the same thing and works identically in cleaning the distiller.
