Hi, I am from the UK and we are used to all the varieties of naan bread.<br />This bread is eaten normally with indian food.  This is the best l have eaten since moving to the US 7yrs ago,my local Target has been supplying these breads for the past few weeks but are ALWAYS out of stock!!<br />The best way to cook your naan is in the frying pan...a little olive oil and coat your naan bread with water turn the naan bread over as soon as it starts to turn brown.. the oven method is OK..but wait til you try it the correct way ;)))<br />I am definately going to order the box.
