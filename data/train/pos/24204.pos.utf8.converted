These bars strike the perfect balance between healthy and filling. They're also both crunchy and soft. A lot of bars don't fill me up, and leave me hungry afterwards, so this one is nice that it's 200 calories and filling. I love bars, but I'm different than most people because I just get them for how good they taste, and how they make me feel. So, these were perfect for me.<br /><br />I only realized after I'd eaten most of them that they're vegan. So, this didn't impact the taste or the experience at all for me like a lot of vegan stuff does for me. I loved them, and they were a perfect breakfast for me that made me feel great all day.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Healthy<br />+Filling<br />+Crunchy<br />+Soft<br />+Tasty<br />+Contains raisins and peanuts<br />+Vegan and vegetarian<br /><br />Cons:<br />-So gooey that the wrapper is left with a bunch of goo
