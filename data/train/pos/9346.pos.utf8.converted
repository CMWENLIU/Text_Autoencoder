This is my fifth chocolate flavored Kcup that I have purchased and tasted. The others being Gloria Jeans Swiss Chocolate Almond (so so flavor) and Mudslide (again it was OK), Van Houtte Chocolate Almond (excellent flavor), Donut House Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut ( smell the brew Kcup and it still smells of chocolate)and now this one.<br /><br />I brewed mine in my B40 @ the 7.25 mug size and added cream and a sugar substitute. What one first experiences is a rich chocolate like aroma that rises as it is being brewed. Thats tempting enough. When first sipped, a sweet yet not to sweet ( the D.H. Chocolate Glazed Donut is the strongest and sweetest) flavor with no bitter after taste prevalent in a lot of darker roasted Kcups I have sampled. A full bodied light roast thats is rich enough to be served as a dinner dessert<br /><br />This great coffee wins a spot in my top ten favorite Kcups
