I am a hypoglycemic and have recently decided to respect my body's need for very low amounts of sugar so that I do not end up as a diabetic. Before beginning this new lifestyle my occosional sweet treat was a piece of chocolate, but because ALL of them are made with sugar / sugar alternative that raise insulin, I thought I had to give it up for life. Xylitol doesn't require insulin to metabolize so this chocolate is a god-sent. I love having it at the office when I want something sweet after lunch. I eat 2 pieces aftr lunch & I'm good to go for the rest of the day! I like having multiple flavors so I can try all of them. My favorite is the coconut.<br /><br />They are a little watery in the mouth BUT when you balance what you're getting (xylitol + herbal ingredients) it's a total win from all other alternatives, which will only raise your insulin and prevent your body from operating at it's best. Garbage in = garbage out. I'm happy I found a product that I can feel good about eating!<br /><br />They are expensive, roughtly $1 for each piece of chocolate, which is about as long as your index finger. If you're willing to pay, this is a fabulous product.
