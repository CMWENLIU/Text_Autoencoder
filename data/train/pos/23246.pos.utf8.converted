I bought this flour 1. because there was free shipping and 2. because organic flour in my area is either bad or very expensive. I was hoping it'd be good but I was thrilled to discover it is excellent. I use it in the famous "no knead bread" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393066304">My Bread: The Revolutionary No-Work, No-Knead Method</a> and for most the recipes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312362919">Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day: The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking</a>. It has a great flavor and a nice rich color. It is heavier than your standard white all purpose but if you like to make these artisan types of bread at home I highly recommend this flour and will be buying it again. I hope it is added to the subscribe and save program!
