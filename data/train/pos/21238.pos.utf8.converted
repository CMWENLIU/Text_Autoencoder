My husband and I thought we'd try going "green" with our litter and after trying natural, flushable, non-clumping litters, we finally got fed up!  They got stuck in our cat's fur, didn't fight the odor, and didn't absorb urine as we'd hoped.  Fresh Step is still the best at clumping, trapping odor, and minimizing the amount of litter tracked all over our house.  In the end, we went back to Fresh Step and decided to be more environmentally conscious by paying more attention to how much we use in the litter box.  Even over other brands of clay litters I prefer this one.
