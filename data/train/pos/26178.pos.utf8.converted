I just ate my first serving of these kipper fillets.  They seem just right with light salt and just enough water, not too much.  Very nice indeed.  The best non-edible part of the deal is the can which opened easier than any other kipper can I have tried.  Oh, and the price per can is amazing.  Just yesterday I checked and the cheapest kippers at Krogers were 2.49 for just 3.25 oz.
