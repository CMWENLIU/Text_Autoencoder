I have tried several types of coconut water since it helps treat my stomach ulcer condition. This stuff is better than all but one product as far as taste but comparable to even that one (VC). However, this is so much cheaper and it takes up less area to store (yes, I use that much)! They recommend adding 1tbsp to 8oz of water but to adjust to desires taste. I highly recommend trying this product!
