We've used Yoder's canned bacon for several years - mainly for the times when company comes and I don't have fresh bacon handy.  We keep a case of it for emergencies too.  There's no reason to do without favorites like bacon just because the power is out.  They're great to toss in a backpack for camping, and people are often amazed to see that bacon comes in cans.<br /><br />There are about 50 slices in each can, cooked and ready to eat(we like our crispy, this is more limp), rolled up in paper.  The cans will last a decade if kept at normal home temperatures.  We pull out the paper and unroll it, then finish crisping up the bacon in a frying pan.  It gives off just enough grease to fry eggs, which is great for camping.  You can also soak the can in hot water to ease the paper/bacon out of the can.<br /><br />There's a lot of arguing in the reviews about the pricing of this bacon, but I consider it a good value.  Each can contains several pounds (pre-cooked) of bacon, and currently bacon is around $4 per pound at the grocery.  Plus being able to store it on a shelf and even eat it right out of the can makes it worth the extra cost.<br /><br />This canned bacon is a really useful product that we don't ever plan to do without.
