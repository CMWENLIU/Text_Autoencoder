Chia seeds (Salvia columbaria) have been a staple food in my vegan kitchen for many, many years, but I had never before tried white chia seeds, so I was quite excited to be able to sample <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> through the Amazon Vine.  I am utterly delighted with this product!<br /><br />Just as an interesting aside, the genus name of "Salvia" for chia is derived from the Latin "salvere,"  meaning "to save."  The Mayan word "chiabaan" from which chia gets its common name means "strengthening."  So you can understand how these tiny seeds get their reputation for packing an astonishing nutritional punch.  Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and have long been considered an energy tonic.  The native peoples of the Americas have used chia since ancient times for endurance and also to treat constipation.<br /><br />There is apparently no difference in nutrition between black or white chia seeds but the lighter colored white chia seeds are preferable in recipes where the food presentation is enhanced by their more neutral coloring.<br /><br />Having gone raw vegan some years back, chia seeds are very popular with me (as are flax seeds) for substituting the grains in my dehydrated raw crackers, breads and sweet treats.  I use chia seeds as I use flax seeds, or in combination with flax seeds, for the same mucilaginous effect of being "sticky" enough to hold together when dehydrated, making a very reasonable and tasty facsimile of  a cracker, bread or sweet treat.<br /><br />Chia seeds, especially these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a>, make a wonderful pudding that reminds me of tapioca pudding.  I also sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chia seeds over my sprouted buckwheat cereal and the thickening effect of the chia when I add liquid transforms my cereal into a very appealing, very nourishing porridge.  For added nutrition in my smoothies I also add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds.<br /><br />I am very pleased with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> and look forward to devising more creative culinary applications for this delicious, certified organic product of Mexico in my raw vegan kitchen.  Of course chia seeds are not confined to the raw or vegetarian kitchens alone.  Every diet should include these mightily nourishing, antioxidant and fiber rich seeds.  The ancient Aztec and Mayan peoples revered these seeds... and perhaps we modern people should too!
