My wife and I recently picked up a 30-ounce bag of Kirkland Signature Wholesome Fruit & Nuts at our local warehouse store. We use things like this as a relatively healthy snack, in contrast to the more common salty or sugar-laden snacks. I also add small baggies of the mixture with my lunch which I carry to work so as to avoid the food court offerings. This stuff is excellent! The nuts include almonds, walnuts and pistachios and they mix surprisingly well together. The dried fruits look a lot like raisons, but they are dried cranberries and cherries. The tastes are excellent in themselves and blend very well with the nut mixture. The total effect is one of the best fruit/nut mixtures I can ever remember having. The mixture had a very fresh taste, I might add. They're good enough that I tend to overindulge, so we have to be careful. Outstanding!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
