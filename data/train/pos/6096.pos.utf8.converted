This is my favorite coffee of all time!  It's just perfect.  Not too strong and not too weak.  I've tried many and this is the one I always grab.  Of course you must buy the whole bean and grind it yourself because it will always taste a million times better.  I don't find the price to be a problem at all compared to other coffee brands.  I do always make sure to get it on sale AND if you happen to have a Kroger nearby you can usually get a bag for around $7.00 which if (like me)  you have a husband who doesn't do coffee, it'll last you at least two weeks! :D
