These do not ATTRACT flying insects. When used near a light source or an area when flying insects are buzzing around, they work great. I have an issue in my area with those TINY no-see-ems that get right through regular windows screens. They buzz around my computer monitors and are generally a PITA. I hang these traps right under my desklamp and under my ceiling light.  The little buggers fly into or land on them. Problem solved!
