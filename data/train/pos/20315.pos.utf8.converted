Just the best maple syrup in the world, period.  1/2 tsp. and  2 cups sugar in 1 cup of boiling water makes a pint, and the 2 oz. bottle makes THREE GALLONS of syrup!<br /><br /> I am dead serious when I say that it makes better maple syrup than any pure maple syrup I've ever had, and it puts the bottled syrups--Aunt Jemima, Mrs. Butterworth, etc. (as well as the other maple flavorings)-- to shame.  Perfect consistency, incomparable flavor.  And the concentrate seems to last indefinitely on the pantry shelf with no change in flavor.
