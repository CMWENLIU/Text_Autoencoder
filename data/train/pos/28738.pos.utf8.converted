I read the other review and I can honestly say that I have not run across anything about turmeric regarding testosterone.  But I do know that it's a very powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.  It's used to treat scabies, digestive disorders, cataracts, arthritis and heart disease (among others).  I fill capsules and take them when I have a headache or if my joints are feeling achy.  It works far better than ibuprofen or Tylenol. It also helps when I've eaten too much salt and feel pressure in my head and sinuses.  It truly is amazing stuff.
