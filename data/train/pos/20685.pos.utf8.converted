A very tasty goji berry: chewy and not too dry. No black spots on like some berries (mold?). Soak a few hours in just enough water to cover (or orange juice), with some dates, put in food processor with some pumpkin pie seasoning, orange zest, a pinch of salt, and it makes a great cranberry sauce substitute (better if put in the dehydrator a few hours to thicken and intensify flavors).  Wish they would sell them in larger bags for a per-pound discount.
