A friend from Scotland brought over a tin of these glorious morsels a couple of months ago.  I've been hoarding them ever since.  They are sweet, like a solid Jack and Ginger highball.  Just opening the tin takes you across the sea to the land of single malt whiskey with its marvelous aroma.  And best of all, the wonderful flavor lingers in your mouth.  I have had other kinds of whiskey fudge but this is the best!
