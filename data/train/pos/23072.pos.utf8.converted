You can't go wrong here.  Nature's Variety is one of the top brands in terms of quality and I've researched this extensively.  If you choose the subscribe and save option the price cannot be beat anywhere.  The beef and lamb formula is the favorite of the Instinct flavors amongst my three dogs.  While not a cheap food, you get what you pay for.  I've been feeding Nature's Variety and admittedly a few other high quality brands for years.  First off, the amount to feed listed on the bag, at least for my adult dogs (10, 6 and 5 years old) is much lower than recommended.  My dogs generally get 3/4 cup twice a day, with the 10 year old getting a bit less.  A nice perk is very, very small stool production (gross I know) but if you have multiple dogs it's nice to have small "packages" to pick up in the yard.  (If you fed supermarket brands you'd be scooping all day- I know as I have a pet related business.) Kibble size will work for any size dog- big or small.  Perhaps most importantly, I truly believe your dogs will be healthier and live longer on Instinct foods.  My 10.5 year old Merlin is just starting to show signs of aging.  I adopted him as a scroungry rescue at age 3, so he didn't have the best start in life.  It's amazing what a great diet can do for a dog.  Definitely a food worth purchasing, and Amazon makes it easy.
