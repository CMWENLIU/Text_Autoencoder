I purchased this shampoo for my Maltese. I have been using an Oatmeal Shampoo and was satisfied with it, but I wanted to try something for Whitening and to see if I could improve on my dogs coat. Several blogs had recommended Bio-Groom and this Super White Dog Shampoo was specifically mentioned for the Maltese.<br /><br />This shampoo is concentrated at a 1 to 4 ratio. So, I put a little in a cup and added some water and stirred it up and used it. It wasn't very "sudsy" but it did lather-up nicely. It is listed as a Conditioning Shampoo, so I bathed him without Conditioning him. I didn't expect much because the Shampoo didn't have hardly any fragrance and it just seemed kinda "ho hum."<br /><br />The results were obvious when I started drying him. His coat became full and and very soft. It was as if I had Conditioned him. His coat was easy to comb and was bright white. I know you're supposed to moisten the coat before you brush your dog, but with this shampoo I haven't needed to. My Maltese has a "Cottony" coat, so it is not a show dog. So all you professionals out there, don't hate on me if I'm not doing things exactly correct. Although he is not a show dog, this product has helped a great deal. I am very happy with this product.
