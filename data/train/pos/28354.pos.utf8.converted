This is really easy to use:  a cup of the falafel mix, a cup of water, mix, wait 30 minutes and then fry or bake.  The directions say to deep fry; however, we haven't done that -- just pan fry in some olive oil and flip like a burger.  We've served it in pita bread with plain yogurt, cucumber and veggies and it is delicious, nutritious and filling.
