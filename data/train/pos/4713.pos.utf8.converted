I'm normally a strictly loose leaf tea snob but I can't get enough of PG Tips. It's the classic British breakfast tea with the faint muscatel notes found in higher end indian teas. A splash of milk and a dash of sugar to top off, this is how I start each day. Be careful with steeping, if left too long this tea becomes extremely bitter and un-drinkable (unless of course that's your thing!).
