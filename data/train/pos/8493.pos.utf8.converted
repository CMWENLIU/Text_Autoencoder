I was excited to see a new line of Sriracha sauce in my grocery store so I scooped this up the first day I saw it.<br /><br />This sauce is packed with flavor, it is tangy and showcases the flavors of the chili and garlic right out front. It is not as hot as the Huy Fong Sriracha sauce in the green lid and also has a tangier flavor.
