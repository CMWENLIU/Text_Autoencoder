We love it!! It is sooo delicious - but even better - it's healing properties are like oral tea tree oil - how cool is that!! Altho we consider it one of the most important medicinal things we can take each day - actually 1/2 to 1 tsp in the morning & at night to not only keep us healthy but also protected from all the "bugs" going around..inside & out - amazing when used under a band-aid!! I like to just hold it in my mouth and swish it around-even gargle a little before swallowing- not only to savor the flavor but again for it to work it's anti-germ/viral magic on mucous membranes - also gets absorbed faster that way, too...A friend of mine mixes this very unique honey with Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar (it's organic, unpasturized, unfiltered with the mother)as part of her ultimate health strategy!!) Thank you Airborne, Amazon, & the person I purchased it from - I will be a repeat customer as long as it's available!! I think it would make an excellent & unique Christmas gift!!
