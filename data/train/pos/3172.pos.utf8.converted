I drank Lipton's regular black tea for years before all these gourmet tea happened and looks like Lipton's has finally come to the gourmet tea party.<br /><br />I bought this mainly to see how the pyramid tea bags performed, and they performed great. The problem with flat tea bags is that it's difficult for the tea leaves to infuse freely due to the constraints of the shape, but these pyramid bags work great! Only problem is that each pyramid is not individually wrapped, therefore you must put them in a tight container to prevent leakage of flavor or drink all 20 bags quickly.<br /><br />As to the tea, it's advertised mainly as Bavarian wild berry flavor, and there is a lot of that, but actually you can taste a lot of hips flavor as well. Not surprising since the ingredients also contain rosehips, chicory root, cinnamon bark and licorice root. Just to let you know that it's not all berry flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I like this a lot and would buy it again.
