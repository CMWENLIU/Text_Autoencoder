This tea is outstanding!! When I first brewed a cup, I was concerned how light in color it was, thinking weak tea. Then I took a sip. Great!! I have other Nilgiri's, one from Tao of Tea and another from a local tea merchant, but this Davidson's Nilgiri is the best of the three, and cost a LOT less. The flavor is complex and I agree with another reviewer about the flavors in the tea. The body is medium to light, as compared to Assam or even Keemun, but very satisfying.
