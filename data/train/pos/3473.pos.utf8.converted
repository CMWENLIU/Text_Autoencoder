I had an "El Cheapo" espresso/coffee combo from Krups that worked well for many years until the pump gave out. I scoured the Internet for a worthy machine that I could depend on and purchased one of the Breville espresso makers. I returned it the next day. It made terrible weak coffee. Then I happened to be wandering through Wal Mart and saw a $70.00 Hamilton Beach machine. It made great coffee with crema and it was strong enough to froth milk. The next morning, I went to make a cup and the machine had leaked all over my countertop! I was lucky to have unplugged it the night before or else there could have been an electrical fire. Back to Wal Mart it went.<br /><br />Neither of these machines were automatic and I had to grind my own coffee beans (which I prefer, even with my regular coffee). I saw the Saeco, read the reviews and said, "If this doesn't perform, I'm not making espresso ever again." When it arrived, I followed the "Quick Start" instructions and filled the hopper with my French roast beans. I crossed my fingers and pressed the "On" button. When all the lights were ready, I pressed the "Coffee" button. In about 15 seconds I had one of the most beautiful cups of espresso complete with a heady froth of crema!<br /><br />I was so impressed, I made another cup. Ahhh, heavenly. Of course, I couldn't sleep that night - the caffeine replaced the blood in my veins.<br /><br />The milk steamer wand is also mighty powerful. It froths milk just like a commercial machine. Something my Krups didn't do very well.<br /><br />In summation, this is a wonderful machine in its price range. I highly recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the clown who gave it a 1-star review? That's a hoax. There is no such wording on the box or in the manual.
