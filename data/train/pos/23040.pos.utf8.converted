We eat a lot of rice, usually brown rice or red rice or the darker grains and most times use an electric rice cooker unless I'm preparing risotto.  There are instances, however, when I simply don't have the time to prepare rice and until now, I didn't consider options other than freezing leftover rice in small packages for emergencies.  I never cared for Uncle Ben's Minute Rice and assumed that any prepared and packaged rice would be similar to that rice which one of my sisters adores.  Annie Chun's Rice Express Multi-Grain Sticky Rice has proven my aversion was unwarranted because this product has turned out to be a lifesaver when having only a minute's time.  Now if you don't have a microwave or pot with water and source of heat, I don't think this would be very good, but if prepared as directed, it's quite delicious and I'll buy it again.  The texture is like sticky rice, the flavor is like multi-grains, the color is speckled and appealing, and it's great to have at work with leftovers.  Sprouted brown rice is a definite winner.  Since no refrigeration is needed, it's safe in a drawer and is a relief even when you have forgotten to bring in something else.  In my opinion, since it's rice, you can add practically anything and have an enjoyable meal full of good carbs.  With no oil or salt added, you cannot go wrong with this rice!  Finalize those details according to your own tastes and dietary restrictions.  Because of the cost, I'll continue preparing rice in the electric rice cooker, but for appropriate times, this will be a household staple.
