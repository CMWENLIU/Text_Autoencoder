Annie Chun's Classic Pad Thai Meal Kit provides the basic ingredients (rice noodles and sauce) for stir-fried pad thai. You need to add vegetable oil, tofu, chicken or shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts,  green onions, and (not essential) lime, peanuts, and fresh cilantro from your own kitchen. Choose tofu for a vegetarian pad thai or combine with shrimp or chicken as you like. Of course, it would be less expensive to make pad thai from scratch. But the pre-packaged sauce is convenient, and this ranks high among the pad thais that I've tasted. The box says that preparation takes 10 minutes, but 20 minutes is more realistic. No MSG or preservatives. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />There are 2 sets of instructions on the box, which is confusing. On the side panel, there are instructions for boiling the noodles. Those are for people who want to eat the noodles with sauce only. The instructions for stir-fried pad thai "with all the trimmings" are on the back of the box. This recipe instructs you to soak the rice noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. It helps if the water is boiling hot, and you will probably need to soak them longer to get the noodles soft enough. The noodles will soften a little after they are added to the other ingredients, but not much. Apart from the problem of undercooked noodles, the recipe on the box works well and tastes great.<br /><br />Ingredients: Noodles: rice flour, water.
