I have never had such delicious bean soup. I wish I had known about Bob's Red Mill's bean soup seasoning years ago, I would have had many more delicious bean meals.<br /><br />The mixture is complex, balanced, and delightful but be aware that the red pepper grows very spicy as the soup ages. I use half-packets now instead of whole packets, but those who love spice will probably want the entire packet.<br /><br />I can imagine other uses for this spice: Texas-style chili (no beans, no tomatoes, only meat and the spice); cornbread; meatloaf; spicy potato soup; spicy corn spoonbread, fried spicy potato patties, breading for fish and chicken, in beef and pork mardinade, in biscuits and other small breads, and for the adventurous, even in chocolate cake!
