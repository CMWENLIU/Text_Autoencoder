After months of trying, my wife finally developed a potato soup from scratch last year that was pretty tasty. My wife agrees that this soup base is as good or better than her recipe and it is VERY easy to make. Before simmering the soup per the instructions, we added two bunches of raw broccoli, 5 small potatoes (diced and boiled for 8 minutes), added some fresh ground pepper and a small amount of salt and served it with crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese over the top. It was fantastic. We highly recommend this soup, it is now a regular part of our meal rotation.
