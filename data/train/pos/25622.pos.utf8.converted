I'm not sure how many grocery stores carry Waffle Crisp anymore - all I know is that I can't find any stores in Los Angeles that do.  I used to be able to go to my local Ralphs and find it amongst the inferior cereals.  But over the past year, it started disappearing.  I was worried that Post had discontinued it.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue!  I can now enjoy the greatest cereal ever invented anytime I choose.  For those of you who have never had Waffle Crisp, you are missing out.  Think of the most delicious waffle swimming in maple syrup and butter...and imagine it in a bowl.  That is exactly what it is like eating Waffle Crisp.  I brought a box to my office and now everyone is addicted.<br /><br />Sure, it isn't healthy.  But that's not why you're eating Waffle Crisp or any other sweetened cereal.  You are eating it for the unparalleled delicious taste experience.  Try Waffle Crisp - you will not regret it.
