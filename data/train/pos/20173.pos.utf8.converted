Finally, after years of searching, I've found a dependable source of the best candy on Earth! I first had a Violet Crumble while visiting Austin, TX. (They have the best groceries there.) Here in Nashville, the closest thing I've found is the Cadbury Crunchie bar, which is similar and good, but I felt I was missing something. I am not Australian, and do not have an Australia obsession, I just really like this candy bar.<br /><br />The center is a matrix of crunchy honeycomb-like stuff, and is covered with really good milk chocolate. Many popular American chocolate candies are made with Hershey milk chocolate, which uses sour milk as their 'secret ingredient.' The Violet Crumble does not, which I think is an improvement (definatly a change) over the local stuff. The chocolate of the VC is really good in quality, not waxy, and not too thin. This is a really great candy bar. You should try it.
