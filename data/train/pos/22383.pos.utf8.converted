My wife and I are both long time coffee drinkers, and espresso is one of our favorites. We decided to try this coffee after reading the great reviews it was getting. We hoped it would be half as decent as people reported, but I must say we were happily surprised at how good these beans actually are. The espresso we brew (using an old-fashioned stove-top espresso maker) has a rich, flavorful aroma and taste. I will not attempt to describe it - you have to try it yourself - other than by saying that this has become our espresso coffee for as long as the beans are available. Oh, and it is a fair trade coffee, which seems to me like be a wonderful way to explain why it is so good!
