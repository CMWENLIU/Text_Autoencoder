I am a Starbucks fan.  I like the taste of there Hot Chocolate, it is not to sweet.  I like the bitter taste of the chocolate.  I have made my own syrup, trying to get the right taste.....Well, I searched and found TORANI'S ORIGINAL MOCHA SAUCE.  I buy it by the case now.  Needless to say, I make my own and hardly ever stop a Starbuck's.
