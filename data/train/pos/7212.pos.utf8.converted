my baby has one of these in her fist most of her waking hours. and i think it's GREAT that she can't take a bite out of them -- that's the POINT of teething biscuits! you're not supposed to chew 'em up, your supposed to rub your baby gums and teeth against them, to sooth the teething irritation. (a teething biscuit that breaks easily is a totally dangerous teething biscuit, a choking hazard! so, please, ignore the negative review on this page, where someone complains the baby can't chomp 'em to bits. that's exactly why these are excellent!)
