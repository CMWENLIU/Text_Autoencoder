The Blue Diamond Dark Chocolate almonds are ridiculously good. The taste is heads above the emerald chocolate nuts. Although they are around the 7 dollar range I think they are worth it. They use stevia to sweeten the almonds which is a plant based sweetener. Not only are they  much better for you, they taste better than Emerald's splenda sweetened (eww). If they would lower the price a bit I would be ecstatic. Enjoy!
