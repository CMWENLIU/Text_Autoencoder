My Cat loves this food, and I love it too because since she has been eating it, she has lost a bit of weight, has plenty of energy, and her COAT looks amazing! It is much thicker and shinier than before and she seems very happy. I don't think it is too expensive - one bag lasts our cat almost 3 months! That means you are spending less than $15 per month on food, and honestly what good Cat-Parent wouldn't spend only $0.50 per day to make sure his/her little one is getting excellent nutrition?
