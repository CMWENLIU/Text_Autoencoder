We recently switched from the original formula to this no sugar added formula. It tastes great, has plenty of fiber and protein to stave off hunger for a few hours and is convenient to mix up. Tastes as good as the original to me, and I usually don't enjoy sugar-substitutes. One scoop of this with a cup or so of Soy Milk and I am good to go for the morning.
