I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.
