Jack Link's "X-Stick Original" snack sticks are very good tasting and far less greasy than other "meat sticks" (like Slim Jim). These are great snacks for diabetics (like me) since they have a negligible amount of Net Carbs.<br /><br />The Amazon "Product Features" incorrectly lists these as 160 Calories each, and neither the box or individual packaging list the Nutrition Facts, so I visited the Jack Links web site and found the following:<br /><br />Serving Size: .5 Oz (1 stick)<br />Calories: 60 (45 from Fat)<br />Total Fat: 5g (2g Saturated Fat)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg<br />Sodium: 220mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 0g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />These do contain MSG, which can cause "gastric distress" in some people (like my dad).<br /><br />Overall, these are great as a snacks between meals and they are so much better than the competition.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
