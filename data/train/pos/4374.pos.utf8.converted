I love St. Dalfour's.  It is lighter than some other morning black teas, but the doesn't detract from the complex flavor.  As an organic black tea, it doesn't turn acid in the stomach, nor does it get bitter when you leave the tea bag in the cup.  I also like the fact that they do not use metal staples in the bag, tag or string.  No tainting of flavor, better for my compost and no sparks if I (gasp) microwave it.
