A friend  with diabetes  had a growth removed from her leg. Because diabetics have very thin skin, two months had passed and the wound had still not healed.  She was also in pain.<br /><br />On hearing this, I over-nighted  two bottles of Trivedi Water to her and suggested that every time she changed the bandages--twice a day--she put some Trivedi Water on the wound and let it dry before she put on a fresh bandage.<br /><br />In TWO DAYS she saw such a difference in her leg she could hardly contain her enthusiasim. She went to the doctor two days later for a scheduled appointment and on seeing the progress, her doctor said that instead of going every week to have the wound checked, she didn't have to go back for another three weeks.<br /><br />My friend kept using the Trivedi Water and when she did go back to the doctor three weeks later her leg had completely cleared up and the wound completely healed! She cannot stop thanking me for sending the water to her. She is now also drinking it.<br /><br />Anyone who is familiar with  diabetes knows that it takes quite long for incisions and open wounds to heal, not to mention that it is especially painful.<br /><br />This water is truly God sent!  Thank you, Mr. Trivedi, for making it available to everyone through Amazon.  Much love to you. Albina
