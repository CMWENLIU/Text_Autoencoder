Truffle salt is heaven on earth.  Imagining what to put it on is my favorite thing.  This is the best one I've tried so far.  The size of the jar makes this one easier to grab a pinch out of too as opposed to some others I've seen.  Luckily, I was introduced to this salt by a friend who made me taste it.  AFTER I was already hooked, she told me the price.  There was no way I could question the worth or the necessity at that point...needed truffle salt immediately!
