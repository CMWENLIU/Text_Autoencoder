The reconstituted product is a pretty convincing substitute for fresh scrambled eggs, especially if you use it recipes such as pancakes.  I used it with Panni Bavarian potato pancake mix and it worked fine.  If you are taking it camping you might also bring along some dried onion for flavor.  If you need eggs without refrigeration, this is the way to go.  Much better than other powdered egg products I've tried.  My only complaint is that while every recipe uses numbers measured in whole eggs, the scoop provided using a 3:2 egg to water ratio ends up giving you 1 and 1/2 eggs equivalent.  It makes it a little difficult to measure, but that is a minor complaint.  If you are stocking for emergency supplies, this (claims) a very long shelf life, which I have little reason to doubt, since freeze drying is a very reliable method of preservation.  They specifically remove glucose from the eggs to avoid retardation of flavor, but I doubt most people could taste the difference.  There are individual bags in the can if you don't need the full 6 dozen eggs.  Once opened they still can be resealed for a few months (but I would use them quickly in any case).
