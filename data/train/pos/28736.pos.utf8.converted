This is basically a salad in a bag. I pour about half of it into a medium sized ceramic bowl and add distilled or filtered water to about 1" above the dried greens. Then I wait for about 15 mins. I will taste one ribbon of seaweed to make sure it has absorbed enough water. If it hasn't, I mix it and wait another minute.  Then I pour off the extra water. I then add some soy sauce and rice vinegar (to taste) and mix. Serve. Makes about 2-3 servings.<br />It is really tasty! My friends who wouldn't dream of eating just seaweed are amazed at how good it is. The first time I ever ate this was at a high end sushi place in Tokyo, since I live in the States, I was really glad when I found this!
