I am a Lapsang Souchong fan.  This variety has a good, strong smokey flavor.  This tea is not for the faint of heart but if you truly enjoy Lapsang Souchong taste this one.  If you prefer a tea with less smoke, try Taylors of Harrogate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DXYU">Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong Leaf Tea, Loose Leaf, 4.41-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>.
