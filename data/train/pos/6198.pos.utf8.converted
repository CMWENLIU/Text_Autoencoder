I am thoroughly pleased with Blue Buffalo dog food (specifically, the chicken & brown rice recipe for large breed, and large breed senior dogs).<br /><br />I have a 72 pound Black Labrador Retriever (very small for this breed, but still "large") - He is 8 years old, and EVERYONE thinks he's under 4 years of age.. . .. He runs around like a puppy. . .. Full of puppy-like energy and has has the nicest sheen on his coat; he actually looks purple when the sun shines on his fur. All of these great things have happened since switching him from other "premium" dog food brands.<br /><br />At roughly $50.00 a bag, one might be tempted to go with a less expensive brand, but here's my particular take on this - My dog, again at 72 pounds, only goes through 5 bags a year (that's only $250.00 a YEAR!) . . . . Here's why:<br /><br />The conversion rate of this this food is amazing!  With cheaper foods (which contain fillers and binders), a lot of stool is produced.  On Blue Buffalo, I've noticed that my dog's stools are MUCH smaller (better conversion in the digestive tract), and his portions are super small, since his body is actually USING more of the food, not just passing it through. The stool isn't mushy and large. (A lot can be judged about overall health with monitoring your canine's poop)<br /><br />Bottom line:  At $50.00 a bag, I'm saving A LOT over the course of my best friend's life, while giving him what I feel is the best food out there. Portions are so small, that I actually feel guilty when I give him so little at meal time (that's from being conditioned to seeing larger portions when feeding a lesser quality food).  His body and mind are years younger than what the calendar shows. Money saved, since I'm not buying a "cheap" $25.00 bag of dog food every month.
