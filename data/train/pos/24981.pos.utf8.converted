I have a huge palate for curry dishes, from Chicken Tikka Masala (India) to Katsu Kare (Japan) to Kang Panang (Thailand). This one is more of your traditional curry taste, where the majority of flavor is coming from the cumin spices in it, but it tastes so savory and flavorful! When you first open the bag the intensely fresh aroma just hits you, and your room starts to smell like you've been cooking for hours. I use this curry powder as an alternative spice for a lot of my home-cooked meals. Its healthy and a little goes a long way for adding flavor.<br /><br />One pound is a lot of spice. It comes in an aluminum sealed bag but it is not resealable. Make sure you have a proper container ready prior to your purchase if you want to maintain its freshness. For me, I use those wide-mouth Ball mason jars and a Foodsaver vacuum sealer to pump out the air. It took about 2 of those pint-size jars to seal most of it. The rest I put in empty spice jars for the spice rack for quick use.<br /><br />Oh for those interested, I found the ingredient list on the Frontier's website. Everything is organic, which would entail no loss of flavor from commercial sanitizing processes. Per their description it is:<br />Organic coriander, organic turmeric, organic mustard, organic cumin, organic fenugreek, organic paprika, organic cayenne, organic cardamom, organic nutmeg, organic cinnamon, organic cloves.<br /><br />I for one like to make curries, but they also have some suggested uses for their curry powder as a flavor add-on:<br />* Add to meat and vegetable stews.<br />- Use to flavor steamed or saut&eacute;ed vegetables.<br />* Use to flavor stir-fries.<br />* Rub in or sprinkle on chicken, lamb or seafood before grilling or broiling.<br />- Add to rice or any grain dish.<br />- Use in raitas or dipping sauces.<br />* Add to meatloaf or bean or nut loaf recipes, hamburgers or veggie burgers.<br />- Add to potato and pasta salads.<br />- Use to create marinades for fish, meat, poultry, seafood, and tofu.<br />- Stir a pinch or two of Curry Powder into your tuna or tofu salad.<br /><br />The ones with asterisks are the ones I've tried (or experimented) and recommend personally. And guessing from my family's reaction, I think they would recommend it too =)
