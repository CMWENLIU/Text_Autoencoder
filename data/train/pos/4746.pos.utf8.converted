This is my new favorite Larabar. My only gripe is that it's hard finding the new flavor in stores. I love Larabars in general because of their amazing ability to weave a few simple ingredients into great-tasting, portable snacks. There's no strange chemicals added, just fruit and nuts. They're my go-to snack to keep in my bag for those times when gluten-free food is hard to find. And they're the most reasonably priced of their class.<br /><br />The PB&J flavor is great because it combines the tart bite of their Cherry Pie flavor with the richness of peanut butter. If you can get used to the idea of a PB&J sandwich in bar form, it really will remind you of the original.<br /><br />This flavor has only 4 ingredients, no added sugar (sweetened with dates) and a respectable 6g of protein (they range from 3-6g, I believe).
