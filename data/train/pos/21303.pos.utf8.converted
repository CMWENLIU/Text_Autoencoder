OK, I can't stand this stuff -- but my husband absolutely loves it.  Brings back memories of his distressed childhood in the '50s, when no one in his community had much meat and a can of SPAM was a treasure to be shared breathtakingly with a lot of people.<br /><br />OK, so what do we do?  I hate having an open whole can in the fridge -- for one, it's unpleasant for me, and two, it just means that to try to finish it he'll eat more as soon as possible, which is hardly good for him (or he'll eat the whole can right from the start --ditto!).<br /><br />But these single serving packs are a godsend.<br /><br />Yes, one is exactly the right size for a sandwich.  So what if I hate it that he takes 2 to work?  That's better than a whole can's worth, right?  And it IS great emergency food (for him, I mean -- I can't imagine how hungry I'd have to be to eat this, even if the power were out, but then again he can't stand my emergency pouches of white meat tuna in water, so we're even!).<br /><br />I don't care that the packaging is wasteful, I don't care that it costs more -- this product is terrific, solving different problems for both of us!  We're happy to have a case in the house, now almost empty, and we'll be ordering more.  For the SPAM lover in your life, this is a good solution for both of you!
