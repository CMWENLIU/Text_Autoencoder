My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and egg and legumes, so we have a hard time finding foods that have the nutrition he needs. I gave him this vegan mac and "chreese" tonight and he LOVED it. And, as a vegan, I thought it was good too. It is not super flavorful, but satisfying none-the-less. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to buy it.
