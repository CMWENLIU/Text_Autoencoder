Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix is a nutritional powerhouse and a big money-saver. Add the chopped veggies of your choice, tomato paste, some extra brown rice or whole-grain pasta and you have a satisfying meal that you'll especially enjoy on a cold day.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, without the overpowering saltiness of other soup mixes. You can make it extra-hearty by tossing in chopped chicken and using chicken stock instead of plain water.<br /><br />Unless you're serving a crowd, you'll have lots left over. I like to freeze the rest and have a home-made meal in reserve for those nights when you're too tired to cook. (So much better than wasting money on take-out in a tough economy!)<br /><br />Love it!
