I love rice, especially brown rice, but cooking on the stove top takes time. I have neither the skill or inclination to take that time, so Go-Go is a boon for me. I often use only half a bowl to supplement a Going Native curry or Tasty Bite Entree and refrigerate the remaining half for the next day's use.
