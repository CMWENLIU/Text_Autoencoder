I bought the Wilton edible markers first and returned them immediately because they just didn't work.  I was trying to put details on cake pop (candy melt surface) and the Wilton pens just poked holes and didn't leave any ink behind unless you pushed really hard.  The Americolor pens worked with just a small amount of pressure and created very small marks or larger if you tilted the pen.
