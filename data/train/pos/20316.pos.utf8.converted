I love this product, although it is getting hard to find.<br /><br />It makes great maple syrup, hot and fresh in only a few minutes (2 c. sugar, 1 c. boiling water and 1 t. Mapleine) Much better than lukewarm, stale bottled syrup.<br /><br />My most recent purchase was because I have started a diet. When I get a craving for sweets, I make a cup of hot tea, one artificial sweetner and add a 1/8 t. of mapleine. It smells soooo good and tastes better. My husband usually comes over and swipes a few sips.<br /><br />So, great product, but I couldn't find it locally. I had to get it from the internet. I hope they don't quit making it.
