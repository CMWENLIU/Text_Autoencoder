Made this soup last night. It was sooo easy and yummy! I was not sure how much doctoring would be necessary to make it tasty for everyone and was surprised to find that it needed little help. I followed the directions on the bag and mixed with vegie stock/water (I had to add a lot more than listed!) and some of the basic vegies on hand - onions, garlic, carrot, celery - that was it! I tasted and it was delicious the way it was.(with salt and pepper to tase). I did not add milk to make the creamed version as I really liked the clean simple flavors of the mix. It was so easy, required no special ingredients or trip to the grocery store. Love it!
