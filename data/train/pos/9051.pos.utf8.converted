Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems.  Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing.  My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated.  For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result.  I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep.  I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle!<br />  I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help.  I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable.  I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Amazon Prime benefits.<br />  To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes.  Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit.  When I tried my first cup, I hated it.  It tasted like musty, minty licorice.  I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it.  Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay.  My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it!  I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it!<br />  The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes.  When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference.  I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst.  And the next morning?  I woke up practically engorged!<br />I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful.  Nursing is peaceful once again!
