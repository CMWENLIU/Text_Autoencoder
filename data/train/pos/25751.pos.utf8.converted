It's hard to describe this to people who have never sampled it, but basically it's a powder to which you mix milk and sugar to get a sweetened malted drink. It is supposed to promote sleep.<br /><br />Quite simply it's a comfort drink when plain milk just won't do. You can also call it malted milk or a hot sweet malt drink.<br /><br />In the great British trifecta of British powdered drinks to be mixed with milk and sugar, Horlicks is the most malty, Milo is the medium chocolatey and malty, and Ovaltine seems to be the most chocolatey. It's actually named after the inventor, William Horlick.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, you can make it as malty or sweet as you like depending on how much of each you add to the milk. But to those who love and grew up on Horlicks, it's just a great comfort drink.<br /><br />This is supposed to be 2lbs worth of Horlicks, so just make sure you like it before you buy this one!
