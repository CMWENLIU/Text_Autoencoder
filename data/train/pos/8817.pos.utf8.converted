My family really enjoys the dried Mulberries in a trail mix I make at the begining of each week.  I use dried Goji berries, Walnuts, Pecans, Almonds, dried Cherries and Cranberries.  We eat about a good handful each morning with a small bowl of oatmeal for a healthful meal to start the day.<br />I searched around for a better price and keep coming back to Amazon to stock up on the 5 Lb bag.  Can't beat the price or the quality of the berries.
