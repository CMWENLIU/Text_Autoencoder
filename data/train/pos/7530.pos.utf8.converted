My Yellow Lab prefers these cookies over several other well known brands.  Yes, they are hard as several reviewers have noted - all the better for helping to reduce tarter thru chewing hard cookies or biscuits which in turn helps to promote healthier gums.  I find the hardness of these cookies no different from say Milk Bone Dog Biscuits which my Lab also loves.  I spoke to my Vet about these dry, hard cookies and, based upon the ingredients listed on the cookie box, he saw nothing wrong with giving them as a treat BUT as with any other treat, only in moderation.  He also surmised that the hardness of the cookies could help in reducing tarter buildup.  I give my Lab either one of the larger sized or two of the smaller sized cookies per day.  They make a nice treat after his evening walk.  (He gets a Milk Bone after his morning stroll).  I've purchased both the peanut butter & molasses as well as these assorted flavors cookies and my Lab loves them all.  He gives these Blue Dog Bakery cookies a "Four Paws" rating.
