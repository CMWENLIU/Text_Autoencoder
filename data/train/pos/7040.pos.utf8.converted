If you love REAL grapefruit juice you must try this brand!  There truly is nothing that compares!  I ran out of my first case and decided to buy the Tropicana 100% fresh squeezed "not from concentrate" at my grocery store and neither my husband or I could even drink it!  It tasted terrible after having the Lakewood Organic. I will never again let myself run out of this amazing juice!
