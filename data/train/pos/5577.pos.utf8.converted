I do not use this spice to cook. I use it to make a face mask due to the antioxidants, along with chick pea flour and almond oil and bit of milk. It does wonders for the skin. I have combination skin and this helps with breakouts and oil control. I use it weekly and since i've began using it gives my skin a youthful glow and elasticity. I recommend you try it.
