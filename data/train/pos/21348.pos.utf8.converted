Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too.
