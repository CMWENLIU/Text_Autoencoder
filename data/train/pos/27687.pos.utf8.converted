Who better than a diabetic to vouch for this product? Unlike most low-carbohydrate dieters, I test my blood sugar at least four times a day. I know how foods affect me. I have very tight control on my blood sugar; my readings are very predictable. Because of that, I know when foods have hidden carbohydrates in them.<br /><br />I experimented last year with Dreamfields. I paired one serving size of the spaghetti with an olive oil and garlic sauce and topped the dish with some Parmesan cheese. Because some diabetics complain of delayed spikes, I tested every hour for four hours just to make sure. Pre-meal: 69; 1 Hour: 62; 2 Hour: 73; 3 Hour: 82; 4 Hour: 69. As you can see, I returned to pre-meal levels by four hours and my third-hour reading was the highest, but the number wasn't high in itself. I have since eaten Dreamfields on two other occasions with similar results.<br /><br />I think the key is restricting your portion size to that listed on the box. Cook al dente, as overcooking can weaken the protective coating that blocks the carbohydrates. Be mindful of the sauces you're using. Jarred tomato sauce is just full of sugar. I buy a jarred Alfredo that only has 1 gram of carbohydrates per serving. Pesto and olive-oil sauces are good options, too. Add a protein to your dish; that helps.<br /><br />As far as taste goes: amazing. Tastes exactly like real pasta. No one in my family knew that it wasn't the 'real' stuff. I love that Dreamfields makes more than just spaghetti. I actually got to enjoy macaroni salad at my last family gathering thanks to Dreamfields.
