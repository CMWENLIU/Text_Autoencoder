Ok, so I've been a fan of salts lately. Citrus infused sea salts, Chardonnay Oak Smoked Sea Salt, Alele Hawaiian Sea Salt, etc. But I have to say, my favorite of them all is the truffle salt. I was skeptical of the 'fusion brand' sea salt. It looked mass produced and cheap. I was expecting an inferior reproduction of the specialty boutique brands that specialize in making it the old fashioned way...but I was very surprised with what I found. Rich, Flavorful, and at a bargin.<br /><br />To get to the point, fusion sea salt has great truffle flavor at half the price of the other brands. It is great for anyone who is new to truffles, and doesn't want to spend $30 for something they may OR may not like...but I'm pretty sure you'll be back, and you may even find yourself spending that little extra, for a little more of that special ingredient.
