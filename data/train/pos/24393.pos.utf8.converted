I can't stress how much this really tastes like melon (either cantaloupe or honeydew, they're both similar, but recently I've eaten lots of honeydew, so that's what this stuff tastes like to me;  however, it could pass for cantaloupe, too).  It's so amazing that if I were to eat only one candy for the rest of my life, this would be it.  Mango used to be my favorite but this one just surpasses mango by more than a mile in terms of accuracy and pleasant aftertaste.  In fact, I just ate the last one out of a pack (and belched melon, LOL) and am about to crack open the next pack....
