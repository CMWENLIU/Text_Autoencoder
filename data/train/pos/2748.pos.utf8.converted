I LOOOOOOVE Skyline Chili.  There are none where I live so anytime we pass through somewhere with a Skyline we stop by.  We were introduced to these packets by a friend who said they tasted exactly like the real thing.  His only suggestion was to add 1/4 cup of hersheys chocolate syrup (the kind you use to make chocolate milk) about 30 minutes into the cooking process.  I thought he was insane.  He said that's the "secret ingredient".  Sure, whatever.  We followed his advice though and I have to tell you this stuff turned out PERFECT.  I would definitely recommend it!!
