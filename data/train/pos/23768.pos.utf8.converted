I'm a green tea fanatic, and have tried over 150 bagged/loose leaf varieties. I have a crazy job, and used to rely on coffee for the energy boost while sleep deprived. Coffee works, but at the cost of digestive issues, acidity and a dehydrated "run-down", stressed out feeling. Enter green tea, which energizes and rejuvenates in a completely different way form coffee. Green tea's antioxidants, small amounts of caffeine and theanines promote a feeling of relaxation as well as stamina, and you can drink several cups without  feeling stressed out and jittery (ie the over-caffeinated syndrome from coffee).  While bagged tea will never equate the taste and freshness standard of looseleaf, if you are looking for a convenient tea offering a true energy boost to take at work, this tea is fantastic. The triphala extract (an Ayurvedic herb blend known for promoting regularity, energy and well-being) really does seem to rev up your metabolism and digestion while sustaining a level of peaceful energy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of this tea - it's got a faint blueberry 'zing' to it and doesn't taste medicinal at all. In fact, I subscribed to have this item delivered to me regularly as I went through so many boxes quickly. It's a great price and the little peaceful sayings on each green tea bag help remind you to stay centered and happy with each sip!
