Great taste! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma, does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste.<br /><br />The reason why your(to the previous reviewer) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine.<br /><br /> If you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer.<br /><br />These are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees.
