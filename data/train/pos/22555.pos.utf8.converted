These bottles are great because they completely eliminate the need to measure and mix formula, and you never have to wash another bottle. (I use them with disposable nipples). My baby likes them too; he actually seems to prefer the ready-to-feed Similac over the Similac I mixed myself. Bottles are also especially useful for travel. I'm serious when I say they are almost as convenient as breastfeeding. Extra time is always golden when you have small children, so if you need to bottle-feed, these are definitely worth the price!
