This instant sauce is so good that I have even been willing to pay the ridiculous shipping costs. Nine dollars shipping for a couple of ounces of dried gravy mix is insane but I have been so desperate to find this sauce again since my local supermarkets stopped stocking it that I have actually paid it. I eagerly await Amazon Prime stocking it. Easy to make and chock full of flavour, reflecting its German origins this sauce is versatile and an easy way to add some kick to your cooking.
