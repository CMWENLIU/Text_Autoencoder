I eat at least one of these each day, sometimes for breakfast, sometimes for lunch. Imagine taking all of the best parts of one of those slim-jim type snacks, but then removing the grease, the gristle, the animal products, the chemicals and the aftertaste. You would be left with these.<br /><br />I prefer these smoked sticks to the Pepperoni, they have a nicer taste to me, but both are excellent. The size, 1.5 ounce is perfect as well, not too big, not too small.
