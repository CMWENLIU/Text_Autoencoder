Saw this as I was perusing a local pharmacy for a decent light lunch. I was about to settle for one of those cold cut and crackers deals when I saw this and snatched it up. It was perfect. A nice light healthy lunch power packed with protein. It came with sesame crackers (very tasty), humus, a very tasty fruit and nut mix, roasted edamame and a small square of dark chocolate. The great thing about this product is there is not alot of sugar (the chocolate is sweetened with beet sugar), NO MSG (which is a big reason I love this product!), and the fruit and edamame really is tastier than you will find in other mixes. My only complaint is that there should be more crackers...:  Still, I am loading up on these and they're gonna be my main lunch for the next few months :)<br /><br />I would like to add that there have been a few negative comments about how hot and spicy the nut mix is. I eat alot of hot spicy foods. I like the spicy nut mix and didn't think it was all that hot and spicy. Perhaps, at first there's like a burst of spice flavor... but any heat dissipates quickly. If you have never eaten jalapenos, chile, or turmeric, you might find it has too much bite for you. The kind of heat that is in the mix may bother some... in this case, eat just a few at a time along with your humus crackers. If you gobble the whole bag down at once, this may be a problem if you can't handle heat. The humus will help dampen the heat ;)
