These treats are great as a special treat to give sometimes.  Amazon is usually the cheapest place to buy them.  The dogs seem to digest them well. I was hoping it would take my dogs longer to chew up, but they like them so well they just crunch them up quickly.  I don't really care for the other smokehouse products I've tried, but this one's a winner.
