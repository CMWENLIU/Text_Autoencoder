I buy a good deal of liquid egg whites and just recently discovered the powdered form, which would save all kinds of time/money/energy. I went ahead and purchased the 2.25lb jar, but not from here. Honeyville's company website lists the exact same 2.25lb egg white can for 23.99 and 4.49 flat shipping for any order. Amazon's price as of this writing is 32.49.<br /><br />Amazon.com shopping tip: if there is only one price shown for the product, as opposed to a 'list price' with a line crossed through it and a cheaper, generic 'price' underneath, then there are likely better options available elsewhere.
