A fine masala dubba: sturdy construction, decent size(small enough to fit on a shelf), and has an inner cover. This is my first dubba, so I can't confirm the "Superior Quality", but it does what I need it to do and I don't imagine any reason you might be disappointed with it. I've heard that some cheaper ones arrive dented or the lids are warped, so maybe the superior quality is in the slightly thicker metal.
