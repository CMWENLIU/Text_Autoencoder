Love this ketchup.  A few years ago, I decided there was too much high fructose corn syrup in our lives and have been gradually eliminating it from our diet.  Well, ketchup is loaded with HFCS and finding one without it that tasted good was tough.  Annie's is our winner and I'm thrilled I can get it here.
