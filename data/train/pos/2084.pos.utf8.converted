Goat milk is my primary source of dairy and Meyenberg provides a good healthy product that's free of additives (hormones-antibiotics)... Meyenberg dry milk in pouches is more convenient for me & it's environmentally friendly because it's packaging is totally paper (no plastic)... I have a Meyenberg tin canister with resealable lid and a pre-measured scoop that I have been using for a while now that I refill for those times when I only need to use a lesser quantity of milk powder.
