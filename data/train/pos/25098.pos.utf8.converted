I drink a LOT of coffee, and I use a lot of sugar in my coffee.  I switched from sugar to Truvia over a year ago.  Between that starting to play some recreational soccer once a week I've lost 40 lbs.<br /><br />I also stopped drinking soda and switched to the Sobe Lifewater 10 Cal and Vitamin Water ZERO.  This coincidentally also use either Purvia, or Truvia.  Both of these are just branded versions of the stevia extract.<br /><br />The taste of Truvia is very close to sugar.  There is a very very slight aftertaste.  The significant difference I have noticed is I don't have the lingering sweetness in my mouth that makes me want another, often unnecessary, cup of coffee or can of soda.
