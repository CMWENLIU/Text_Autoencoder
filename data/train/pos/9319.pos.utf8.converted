I have used the Wheat Free Bread Mix and then found this in the larger packages.  I purchased it despite the different ingredients list (which isn't correct on Amazon - go to Pamela's Website for the real one).  It was very close to the Wheat Free version.  I love having the bulk bags so that I can take as much as I need.  I used the flour blend to make Apple Crisp this weekend and it was wonderful.  It makes a great bread too.  Another winner from Pamela's Products.
