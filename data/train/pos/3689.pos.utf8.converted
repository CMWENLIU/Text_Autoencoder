CatSure....This is a miracle product...I have almost lost my senior cat (18yrs) twice in the last 3 months and this product brings her back...she has end stage feline chronic renal failure.  This product has all the right amino acids and the potassium chloride and potassium iodide that she needs right now.  She loves it - it is a life saver....I have made a decision to give her the recommended daily amount from here on out and not stop when she gets better as I feel this is how we once again got into a crisis stage of her illness.
