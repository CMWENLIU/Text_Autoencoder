I'd given up any hopes of finding star anise in the local supermarkets, and was beginning to fear that I'd never be able to make the Frugal Gourmet's "Slow-Cooked Pork in Wine Sauce" (an invariable crowd-pleasing favorite) again, since whole star anise is an essential ingredient in that recipe.  However, for very little money I've been able to replenish my supply of this fragrant and essential spice.  The star anise I received was of excellent quality, and in far greater quantity than I'd hoped to be able to get for that price.
