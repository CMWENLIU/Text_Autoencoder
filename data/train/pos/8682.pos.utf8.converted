If you are accustomed to store bought clover honey that is clear to the eye and completely processed (meaning heated mostly), then this honey is going to be a shocker to your eyes and tastebuds.<br /><br />I am a honey lover (I love it straight off the honey comb, off the spoon, on my bagel and in my tea) and am pretty particular about the honey I choose.  I think that many of us are so accustomed to those cute little honey bears in the market with clover honey in them that we forget that there is an entire other world of "raw" organic and unprocessed honey.  This honey however takes raw honey another step further.<br /><br />If you are accustomed to spun honey (thicker and cloudier in color) than you are closer to this honey.  Typically honey bees go for the clovers or orange blossoms and you can taste the floral essence in the honey.  This honey is produced by the Mayans in Southern Mexico and has a complex taste filled with multi-floral essences.<br /><br />The review says that it has a "butterscotch" taste and I would say that descriptor is pretty good.  Like a wine, we use many different words (fruits, woods, etc) to describe it's nose and finish.  This honey is THAT complex that it really needs to be enjoyed that way and described like wine.  It is definitely gourmet.<br /><br />If you enjoy more mild honey, this honey might be just a tad too much for your taste and you might not find it as enjoyable.  The honey taste might overshadow whatever you are using it on (toast, etc).  However, if you really thrive after a complex taste and enjoy tasting the floral essences, you are in for a SWEET and delightful surprise.  This is not your average supermarket honey.  It's the champagne of honey that can be enjoyed by connoisseurs who appreciate the floral tones that are so complex.  I've never tasted anything like it!<br /><br />Delicious but anything but mild.  This honey is not for everyone, but those who love it will certainly love it.  I sense that dislike will go in the same direction.<br /><br />When using this honey, think smaller portions because of the pungency.  It is anything but mild!<br /><br />I definitely appreciated the fair trade part of purchasing this honey knowing that the Mayans are receiving a fair wage.  That makes me feel really good. :)<br /><br />Enjoy.
