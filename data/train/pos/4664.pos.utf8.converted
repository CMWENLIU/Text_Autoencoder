Let me say being a Chicago native I was skeptical of this popcorn as the only popcorn I know as being the best is Garrett's Popcorn...Ever since I moved away from Chicago I have been desperately trying to find a substitute that can somewhat compare to the awesomeness that is Garrett's. Well let me say I am now a believer! This popcorn is great and is the closest comparable popcorn to Garrett's that I've ever tasted. I'm not sure what the 3-star reviewer was talking about as I noticed NO hulls in any of the two bags I ate (so far). It's not sweet heavy I actually find myself grabbing more cheese than caramel but in the end if you aren't sure about getting this popcorn because of the price trust me because it's worth it.
