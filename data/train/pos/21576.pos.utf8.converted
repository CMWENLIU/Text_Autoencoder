This stuff is cheap, delicious, and healthy calories.  It's my diesel.  I put it on almost everything.  Load up some vegetables, cooked squash, scrambled eggs, or mashed potatoes with it and you can run all day without hunger.  It doesn't have a strong flavor like butter, so you can use a lot of it without overwhelming the taste of the food you're putting it on.<br /><br />It keeps fine without refrigeration, so you can keep a few tubs around.  I plan to survive on my stash of this stuff when the zombie hordes come and the grocery store is closed.
