I love this stuff!  It has a very light coconut taste.  I have it on english muffins, toast, pancakes and oatmeal in the morning. I've used instead of oil or butter in desserts.  With toast it tastes great with a little peanut butter.  I also use it on my whole body as a moisterizer and as a conditioner for my hair.  It goes on your skin a little greasy but soaks in within 5 minutes.  I no longer break out and my skin looks much clearer, much like when I was a kid.  I put it on before we went to a water park last week, and I the only place I sunburned was by my bathing suit straps where I didn't apply very well.  I will never go without this stuff on my shelves again.
