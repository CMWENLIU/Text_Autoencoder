Fantastic, fresh and flavorful...this is a morning staple in my household and always at an affordable price.<br /><br />Update: Unfortunately, in a move similar to gas prices, the price of the 4-pack original whole bean blend has increased more than $10.00 from a few months ago (it is now $26.78 with subscribe and save). This excellent coffee is no longer affordable. Why the substantial increase when other Eight O'Clock beans are still at the $15.53 subscribe and save price?
