The first time I tried this mix, I prepared it exactly according to the directions on the package.  The result was a gritty, dry cornbread with a slightly bitter taste.  Not great.<br /><br />I decided to give it another go recently.  This time I used a whole stick of organic pasture butter, added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a little extra salt.  These tweaks made a HUGE difference!  The cornbread turned out rich, moist, and slightly sweet -- more of a traditional southern cornbread with zero bitterness.<br /><br />Now that I've figured out how to make it work, I'm thrilled with this mix and will use it again!
