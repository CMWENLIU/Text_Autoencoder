Though Kirkland's is not as good as some other Vietnamese cinnamon I've had, it's by far the best compared to anything from McCormick or any other spice company that sells cinnamon from other countries in terms of price.  And I totally disagree with the review that it's not good for baking, it's superlative.  The best you can use.<br /><br />Vietnamese cinnamon is literally dreamy.  I use it for my homemade home grown apple chutney and it's absolutely the best cinnamon ever for pies, cinnamon rolls, etc.  Kirkland has a great price on a very pricey spice.  For the money, it's totally worth it.  There are a few companies that have even better Vietnamese cinnamon, but they are a lot pricier.  For the price, Kirkland is the best.
