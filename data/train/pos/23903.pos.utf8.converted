Manitoba Harvest's Hemp Seed is a delicious topping for pastas, salads, and desserts. It's full of Omega 3s and proteins. They're easier to handle than sunflower seeds or pistachios that require some work to enjoy. These hemp seeds blend in well with recipes. The Blossoming Lotus Cafe (in Portland,Oregon) and Cafe Gratitude (San Francisco,Berkeley,San Rafael,Healdsburg) use hemp seed as part of their entrees and sweets. Enjoy!
