these are so delicious.  I was so excited that I could find these at amazon.com, however, the price is crazy.  There is no way I am paying $56 for 48 of these.  amazon.com, can't you do better?  Maybe offer smaller quantities or lower the price!  I want the convenience of amazon.com but not this price!  The Fruit & Veggie bars are so delicious too....
