Anyone who has ever visited New Orleans will most likely have a tale to tell of a late-night or early morning visit to the world-famous Cafe Du Monde (cafe of the world) for a snack of Beignets and Chicory coffee.<br /><br />This simple little square fritter with powdered sugar is often imitated but somehow never quite the same as the cafe Du Monde version.  The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.
