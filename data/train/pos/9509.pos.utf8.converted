My daughter told me about all the benefits of coconut oil and I decided to order this one from Amazon and try it out. So far, I have used it for (1) extremely dry skin on my face and around my hairline. I could see an improvement after just one day and it's continued until I no longer have patches of dry skin and the skin on my face is glowing. (2) I severely burnt my tongue tasting some soup and the next day it was so painful I could not eat. I coated my tongue several tiimes that day in the coconut oil and it was completely well on the third day. (3) On my grand daughters diaper rash and on her dry flaky feet. Her feet were peeling they were so dry and we cleared it up in a week with the coconut oil. (4) I coated my dry hair in the coconut oil and left it on all day and then shampooed it out before going to bed. My hair was soft and shiny the next day to the point that several people asked me what I had done to my hair. Now I regularly soak my hair in the oil and my hair is beautiful. (5) I made a face scrub with the oil and sugar and it works wonderfully for getting the dead skin off my face and feet at a fraction of the cost of the expensive scrubs and works better and smells good too.<br /><br />The oil does not stay on your skin, it is absorbed quickly and does not stain your clothes or bedding. I ordered two tubs with Subscribe and Save and the price was a real bargain except my sister begged me out of one of my tubs, so now I have to re-order quickly. I don't want to be out. I keep a small jar of the oil on my desk and use it several times a day on my hands and elbows. Those rough ugly elbows will dissappear in a week and you will have smooth white elbows if you just rub some oil in once a day.<br /><br />I have not used the oil for any kind of cooking because that is not the reason I wanted it, but I have read that it is great for use as a cooking oil. I know my grand daughter loves to stick her finger in the jar and lick the oil off. She loves it and I know it will not hurt her.<br /><br />Would I order this again? Yes and yes. I would and have it on permanent order with Subscribe and Save. I don't want to ever be without it again.
