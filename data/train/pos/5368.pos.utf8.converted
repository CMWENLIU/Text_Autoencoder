Having become tired of the High Fructose Corn Syrup laden soft drinks and "fruit" drinks that permeate the drink market in the US, not to mention the "energy" drinks that are full of chemical substitutes for all the badness you can find in junk food, I started a search for the perfect alternative.<br /><br />I have found that perfect alternative: IZZE Sparkling Juice! Each flavor of IZZE (Blackberry is by far my favorite, but they also offer Pomegranate, Apple, Grapefruit, and Clementine) is nothing more than 70% real fruit juice and 30% sparkling water - the perfect combination! And each can or bottle equals a serving of fruit.<br /><br />On a hot day, I have found an IZZE to be a more refreshing salvation than any other drink out there.<br /><br />One "negative comment": I have been drinking IZZE out of a glass bottle for a few years now, and they seem to be disappearing in favor of the canned version - though the canned version is fine, it lacks the experience that only an ice-cold GLASS bottle can brink to any drink.
