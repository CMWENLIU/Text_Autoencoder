I have kids with peanut allergies and I found the perfect substitute for peanut butter.  It is easy to spread and tastes great.  The only thing you need to watch out is that there is some separation of the paste and the oil.  To avoid this problem just stir the almond butter before you spread it.  This product is really the best out there.  I'm very happy that Amazon is selling it online too.
