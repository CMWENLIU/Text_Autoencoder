Okay, maybe not "healthy" but they are an excellent replacement when you read the ingredients! These are not loaded with words only a scientist could love (i.e. those starting with "poly" or ending with "ose", etc.). They are free of artificial preservatives, colors, and flavorings (natural Raspberry and Cranberry used) and are prepared in a nut free bakery for those with allergies and are suitable for vegans. They are lightly sweetened and crunchy and perfect with a cup of tea or glass of milk. I am not a health food junkie, but do like to have alternatives to some of the `junk' I at times crave. They are a tad more expensive than what can be found in the grocery but definitely worth that little extra cost.
