Two health articles I read recently recommended eating steel cut oats. After some research I came across the John McCann brand at Amazon which turned out to be a stroke of luck. It is truly delicious and I'm delighted that I signed up for a regular supply.<br />After cooking the recommended way for a few days I tried the suggestion made by another reviewer of boiling the four cups of water (I use two cups of water and two of low-fat milk - wonderful!) the night before, stirring the cup of oats in, putting a lid on and placing it in the refrigerator to 'cook' overnight. IT WORKS (thanks Amazon for reviews!) - though I prefer to leave it sitting out for an hour or so to cook in its own heat and then place it in the fridge before going to bed. Next morning all you have to do is heat on the stove or in the microwave (takes seconds!)and you've got a delicious, healthful breakfast with minimal effort.
