I have purchased the Mexican, Tahitian & Madagascar varieties from the Arizona Vanilla Bean Company. All arrived in a timely manner, in beautiful condition. I can't believe how reasonable the prices are for the quality of bean! ... and no, I don't work for the company! It's just so rare these days to get good quality & service for a reasonalble price, that I felt compleed to take the time to let people know.<br /><br />If you've only ever gotten the dried-up husk of vanilla bean from your local grocery store, you must try these to see what REAL vanilla beans are like. If you have encountered good quality vanilla, you won't be dissappointed by these products. My vanilla sugar was a hit last Christmas using this vanilla.
