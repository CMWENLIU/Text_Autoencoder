Our family has decided that it would be wise to store a year's supply of food as a hedge against inflation as well as preparation for food supply disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters. Rather than just toss a bunch of mysterious items in the basement that would get thrown away in 20-30 years, I've been buying bulk grains from my local natural food store and cooking with powdered milk and eggs and such.<br /><br />The local big-chain natural foods store sells this product in this size package, and I've been buying it there. Organic Valley's website says they make a 25 lb bag, but I've never seen that offered for sale. Amazon's regular price is a tad higher than my local store, but the Subscribe & Save price will save me about 10% off, so I'm signing up.<br /><br />We are not drinking powdered milk or using it on cereal, but we've had zero taste issues incorporating it into all of our cooking. If anything, the meals I'm making have improved dramatically since I'm making so much from scratch using freshly ground flour, etc.
