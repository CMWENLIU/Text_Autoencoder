This is the second time I have now ordered from this company (JR Mushrooms) and I am very pleased with their items. All the different peppercorns I have ordered have been nothing but outstanding. For Christmas this year I ordered 6 packages of peppercorns for my husband and mom. The taste of these peppercorns are great for salads and just about anything you want to add great flavor to. I highly recommend these to everyone who wants to spice up their foods. You will definitely not be disappointed. This company has excellent customer service to deal with and the items always arrive ahead of schedule. I will definitely be ordering from you for my future purchases. I am a very satisfied customer.
