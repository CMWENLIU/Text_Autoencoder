These muffins are great!  I bought the mixes to make for my lunches and was pleasantly surprised.  They're moist, have a hearty flavor, the flax and berries are well balanced, and they freeze well, too!  These taste healthful without tasting bland.  I bake these muffins on the weekends, freeze them and bring one out of the freezer each morning to add to my lunch.  They thaw out in no time.  Excellent!
