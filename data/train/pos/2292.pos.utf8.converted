My local grocer doesn't carry the Melitta brand unbleached coffee filters.  When I have asked him if he could, he says the demand isn't great enough to give them shelf space.  Yes, the Melitta unbleached coffee filters do cost a little more, but then if the end result is a much better cup of coffee why wouldn't someone pay the extra 1/2 cent or less for a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have used the unbleached coffee filters from Albertsons Or Krogers and they do not make as good a cup of coffee.  The competition's filters are thinner allowing the water to run through more quickly resulting in a weaker cup of coffee.  I think Melitta has this figured out and has gone the extra mile to produce the best cup of coffee available.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it.  Using the cone system and the unbleached coffee filters allows an individual to make the best cup of coffee allowable with the coffee beans of your choice.  I am not going to waste  my time explaining why the other systems for producing a cup of coffee are less desirable.  I bought two orders containing a total of 1200 coffee filters to get the free shipping.  Since I only drink one or two cups a day, that should last me almost three years.  The big saving for me is that I will not have to chase all over town trying to find filters every time I run out.  If the locals don't want to carry the Melitta brand, they are going to lose out to anyone and everyone who is internet savy and knows that Amazon carrys the Melitta brand.  This is just another example of our changing times and should be a lesson to the local merchants.  Get your act together or your going to be out of business.  Every sale you lose to the internet is dollars taken out of the community that will never be spent in your store.
