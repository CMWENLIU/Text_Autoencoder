I've been using this product on my African Violet for 2 months.  My friend bought me the plant and got herself one also.  My plant has so many blooms that hers.  She only has one flower.  I am buying her some, the price here is awesome.  I've even been feeding my other plants this vitamin with great results.  see my picture, I have to cut off the dead flowers, but see how abundant....
