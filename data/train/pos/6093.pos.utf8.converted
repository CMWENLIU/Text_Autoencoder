I bought Tully's Decaf House Blend Coffee K-Cups in bulk, originally on E-Bay, because of a really good deal. I hadn't tried it before, and was worried that I had made a big mistake, buying it. I was supprised after my first cup, at it's strength, and full bodied flavor. It is now my most favorite k-cup coffee. I was never into "Decaf" before, and I feel that this coffee will make, both Decaf and Regular coffee drinkers alike, very happy. Don't hessitate to try this blend, you will not be sorry.
