I used a couple of Zym tablets for the first time.  I like them because they have a gentle taste - not too sweet with a pleasant lemon lime flavor.  They dissolved well too and weren't grainy.<br /><br />The tube is not totally full because the top takes up some of the room - but that means the tablets are packed so they don't break up.
