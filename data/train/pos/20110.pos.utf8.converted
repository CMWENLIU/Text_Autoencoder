Titanium Dioxide is a very common food additive which is used as a white pigment. It's naturally occurring and about 4 million tons are consumed per year worldwide. The only research on it as a possible carcinogen deal with it being INHALED (breathed in), not ingested (swallowed) in plants which manufacture it, where workers are exposed to hundreds of thousands of times more material than what exists in food. I guess someone was too busy oiling their skin up to visit Wikipedia. :)<br /><br />As far as the pill itself, cut one open and you'll find exactly what you paid for - a little coconut meat and a lot of oil. I'm not real crazy about coconut, so being able to swallow a softgel pill is a lot easier for me.<br /><br />I've been using this product for years, and I highly recommend it!
