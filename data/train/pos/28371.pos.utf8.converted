This was my first time buying an edible cake art. It was a perfect decoration for my son's 2nd birthday cake. He loves Elmo and when he saw the cake (which I  made myself) he was very excited and couldn't wait to bite into the cake. The picture itself was very easy to remove and place on the cake. It blended so well with the cake that nobody believed that it was a place-on picture. I am very happy and recommend it highly! Thank you!
