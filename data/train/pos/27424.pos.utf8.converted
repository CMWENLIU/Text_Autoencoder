Not knowing this was a Kraft Foods brand, we bought this in Paris and brought it home to the US. It is one of the best whole bean coffees we have ever had. I just wish our local stores sold it.<br /><br />Not too bitter, with a very complete taste. I like more flavorful, and he likes bitter - we both loved this coffee. Highly recommended.
