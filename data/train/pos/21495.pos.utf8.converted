I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.  It's smooth, uniform, and though delicate the peach flavor was definitely at the forefront.  I don't know if the pot I tried had been sweetened or not, but I was floored.  It's easily the best tasting tea I've ever tried (though admittedly that isn't saying much; I'm not a frequent tea drinker).<br /><br />The economic part comes in with the multiple infusions.  This isn't a makes-one-pot product; you can refill the pot and brew again with the same blossom and get multiple pots out of each 'ball.'
