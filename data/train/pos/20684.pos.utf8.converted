When I choose coffee I usually go directly to a dark French Roast but I thought I'd like a little change of pace so I selected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OP72O0">The Bean Coffee Company Mocha Java, Organic Whole Bean, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> the last time I needed to buy coffee.  I'm so glad I did!  I now have a new favorite!  This mocha java coffee is so wonderful!<br /><br />First of all I love that it is organic.  Secondly, it is whole bean because I prefer to grind my own. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, its flavor is divine ~ it is a medium roast that has a full bodied depth; it is smooth and low acidic; and the chocolate "notes" are subtle.  All of this simply translates into a very satisfying and delicious cup of coffee.<br /><br />I should also say that the Amazon pricing is extraordinary and as soon as I post this review I am going to order some more!
