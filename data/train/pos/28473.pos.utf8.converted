Finding these on Amazon was truly a treasure. My wife and I used to roam the streets of Manhattan searching bodegas and corner stores selling the coveted Haribo Roulettes.  We'd often leave home empty handed, but when luck struck and we found a seller, we would buy the remaining candies in the case for upward of $1.50 per roll.<br /><br />Amazon's deal works out to $0.27 per roll. What a deal! The candy came lighting quick and were very fresh. We are extremely satisfied with this product and Amazon.
