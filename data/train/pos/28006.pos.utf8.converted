I've tried almost every coffee in the box and found that, in my extended family, every flavor is liked by someone.  I don't know why they call it extra bold, though, because some are clearly mild.<br /><br />Who cares what the box looks like?  You take them out of the box and put them in the carousel anyway.<br /><br />Anyway, here's my ordering of flavors as best I can remember:<br /><br />Extra Strong<br /># Black Tiger<br /># Jet Fuel<br /># Midnight Magic<br /># Wake Up Call<br /># Dark Magic<br /># Big Easy Bold<br /># Black Gold<br /># Double Black Diamond<br /># Donut House Extra Bold<br /># French Roast (Diedrich)<br /># French Roast (Coffee People)<br /># French Roast (Wolfgang Puck)<br /># French Roast (Tully's)<br /># Italian Roast<br /><br />Strong Coffee (but not bitter)<br /># Rainforest Espresso - My favorite<br /># Sumatran Reserve - My second favorite<br /><br />Moderate Strenth<br /># Kenyan AA<br /># Tree Hugger<br /># Colombia (Diedrich)<br /># Newman's Own Special Blend<br /># Donut Shop<br /># Sumatra Kopi Raya<br /># Evergreen Blend<br /># Full City<br /><br />Mild Coffee<br /># Morning Edition - My brother's favorite<br /># Sumatra Tully's<br /># Sumatra (Diedrich)<br /># Breakfast Blend (Tully's)<br /># Kona Blend Island Style<br /># 10% Kona Blend<br /># Kona Blend (Tully's)<br /><br />Can't Remember<br /># Organic (Coffee People)<br /># Hazelnut Dark Roast<br /># Nicaraguan<br /># Parisian Nights<br /># Sorrento<br /># Vienna Coffee House
