I know you are thinking $10 for mayo!!!It is crazy ,but the mayo is soooo good and made with the best fats around. I am a low carber so I eat alot of mayo so I need it be quality. It would cost about the same to make it homemade, if you bought the ingredients used in this mayo individually. Give it a try it won't dissapoint.
