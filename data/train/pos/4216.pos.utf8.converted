I grew up on the Western Slope of Colorado and know exactly where this honey comes from since my mom used to take me to the fields to get honey comb when I was a kid. For me, it not only brings back fond memories, but I am so happy to have great honey again! I live in AZ now and the honey not only tastes funky but it sugars very quickly. Since the only sweetener I use is honey I am particular about the flavor; not only that, but this even smells like the flowers from whose nectar it is made. I've got it on subscription which makes it ridiculously inexpensive.
