I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended; so I went to whole foods the next day hoping that they carried the product "stevia plus".  Although, the label did not specify that it was the "plus" version - I took a chance to purchase it.  Now, I'm so glad that I did.  I'm very impressed by it's flavor.  I had tried a few other stevia products but the taste was unbearable.  This is my first review, so I hope someone can appreciate this recommendation.
