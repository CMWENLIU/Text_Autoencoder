Go Raw Sprouted Pumpkins seeds are perfect for a snack, to put on your salad, to add to recipes that call for nuts, etc.  These are lightly salted with celtic salt and fresh and crunchy tasting.  I've ordered four bags in three months and Amazon gets them to me on time every time.  You will love these sprouted pumpkin seeds.  None better anywhere!<br /><br />Gary
