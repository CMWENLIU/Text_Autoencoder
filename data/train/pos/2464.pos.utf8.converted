It's very easy to make a hot sauce and almost everyone does. (There's a store in New Orleans that offers over 200 brands.) What's hard is to make a sauce that has some flavor and some sensation other than pure heat.<br />Sriracha is a medium hot sauce with a fine fruity aftertaste and the substantial undertone of red pepper itself.<br />You'll find yourself adding small quanities of it to unlikely things like consomme, pancake batter and chocolate pudding where its very diluted heat will still carry the other flavor notes through and add a touch of complexity to dishes that are otherwise dominated by a single flavor or squished by an overwhelming texture.<br />By the way, the trick to using hot sauce as an undertone is it add it to half of the product until you can taste it, then add the reserved half of the product back to the pot.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman author of New Short Course in Wine,Theand the very spicy bang BANG: A Novel
