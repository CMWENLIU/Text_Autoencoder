The Tully French Roast is the strongest, richest, most flavorful k-cup I have found (better than Timothy's Espresso, which is weaker).  This k-cup of coffee gets big compliments from all my guests- it's even strong enough to pour over ice for iced coffees.<br /><br />The price on this 108 ct when I bought it was the best I've seen by far.
