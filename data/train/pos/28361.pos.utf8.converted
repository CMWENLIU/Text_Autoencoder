Tried the berry blend after seeing it on display in the grocery store. After trying it I went back and bought the remainder of them (10), and keep checking back for more. I LOVE them. they are sweet, but naturally tasting sweet from the berries - real whole blueberries, and pieces of raspberries and strawberries. I will continue to get these, I make them part of my healthy, low sodium diet - try and you will probably like!!
