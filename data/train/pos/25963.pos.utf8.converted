Flaxseed's latin species name, Linum usitatissimum, means "most useful." Couldn't have picked a better name myself. Flaxseed is a really useful addition to your diet. It contains alpha linolenic acid (ALA) which is an omega-3 fatty acid that helps with heath health, bone health and is an anti-inflammatory.<br /><br />Plus it is great for cholesterol. A study compared people with high cholesterol who added 20 grams of ground flaxseed to their diet. These people were compared to people taking a statin drug. After two months, there were significant reductions of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in both groups.<br /><br />So, clearly it's good for you, but lots of things are good for you. Question is, how difficult is it to add flaxseed to one's diet? This is where flaxseed distinguishes itself. Flaxseed can be sprinkled on all kinds of food. I put it on my cereal, in my smoothies, on my sandwiches, in cake and baked goods. I don't really notice it. This is where flaxseed shines, it is an invisible ingredient.<br /><br />Alright, so I don't notice it. How about other people? I put flaxseed to the test by sprinkling it on the cereal of a very picky 7 year old I babysit for. He ate the cereal and drank the milk without a word. Passes the test.<br /><br />Adding flaxseed to your diet is a no-brainer. Hope this review was helpful - enjoy.
