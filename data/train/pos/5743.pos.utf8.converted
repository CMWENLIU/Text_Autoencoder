I bought this at my local "Sprouts" supermarket this week, NOT based on the various negative reviews of the product on here.  I ALMOST passed on it but basing my purchase on the nutrition facts, I decided to take a chance.  I paid $35 plus tax for it.<br />I plan to use this as part of a lunch time meal replacement.<br />Each serving contains:<br />90  Calories<br />9 g Carbohydrates<br />10g Protein<br />6 g Fiber<br />1 g Sugar (less than)<br />Those are the basic nutrition facts.  I didn't include the ample vitamins and chlorophyll info.<br /><br />Thank the heavens, I decided to take a chance and not follow the rest of these reviews because this shake is superb.  Does it dissolve perfectly? No but who cares?  I'm not sipping or nursing on it. Its not a martini. I mix it up and gulp it down.  Simple.  Also, I feel better knowing that it doesn't dissolve completely.  It gives me the impression that there are more substantial quality ingredients.  I'm not basing this on any scientific fact, just a feeling.<br />Next, the flavor is EXCELLENT.  What are these people talking about? It tastes like its trying to be a "chai" drink but of course I know that it is not and I wouldn't expect it to because I chose this item acknowledging that there was practically no "sugar."  I wouldn't go into this shake expecting a jamba juice (do you know how much sugar is in a jamba juice).  Anyone who is thinking about giving this a shot, I say take the plunge.<br /><br />For my next purchase, I'm going with one of the other flavors from this line (the sugar content in some of the other flavors ranged between 6-10g) that happens to be on sale for $25.  15 meals (per container) that comes to a cost of around $2 a pop AND nutritionally good for me, definitely my kind of lunch.
