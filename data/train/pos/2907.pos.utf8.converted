I love Iced Tea & always have two half-gallon bottles of tea in the fridge. I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a>. My favorites are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELZLK">Newman's Own Organic Tea, 4.95-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAPXGS">Davidson's Tea Bulk, Moroccan Green with Mint, 16-Ounce Bag</a> which I brew in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQ7KLG">Swissgold TF 200 Tea Ball</a>. So yes, I am a Major Tea Lover.  I ordered the Passion Tea, based on the reviews. It seemed expensive, but after using it for the past ten days, I am very impressed. It is refreshing & easy to brew. Be prepared for a packaging surprise; it arrived in a plain brown commercial box, the same one they send to the stores. Easy to prepare after the first batch.<br /><br />I like to have tea ready to go, so I fill my<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XPISEO">6-pack of Aquasana 18 Oz. Glass Bottles</a>and season my tea with<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00181YL7I">Nellie & Joe's Famous Key LEMON Juice, The Original- 16 oz</a> and sip through a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YJMDCM">Zak Reusable Polycarbonate Stripe Straws - Set of 12</a>  which I keep clean with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QD5GAA">Brushtech Sports Bottle Straw Washing Brush  B23C</a>. And YES, I am a PRIME shopper and love Amazon.  At 70, I am a mainly home bound caretaker for my mom, who is 96, so shopping at Amazon is efficient and economical.
