This crunchy version of Sunbutter is so very delicious.  It really does taste like peanut butter too.  Amazon has it priced way too high though.  I get it in the health food section at my local Kroger store for over $1 cheaper per jar and I don't have to buy more than one jar at a time.  Amazon makes you buy 6 jars at a time AND charges significantly more per jar.<br /><br />Quick tip, the ladies at my local health food store told me to store this upside down so that the oil would be absorbed back into the sunflower butter rather than separate and sit on top.  I have found that this method works pretty well but you will need to do some stirring.  This seed butter is soft though, not stiff like natural peanut butter and stirs fairly easily so no worries.
