Bob's Red Mill Red Lentils are delicious.  They are very different from regular brown lentils, with a lighter, less earthy flavor.  Red lentils do not require any soaking, just rinse.  High in fiber, they are superb in soups and appealing to children as well as adults.  I highly recommend an easy Moroccan type red lentil soup with lots of fresh lemon.  Google for recipes.  Or  Simply chop one onion and saute quickly in olive oil,  add plenty of chicken or vegetable broth, a can of diced tomatoes (or chopped fresh), perhaps some chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and juice from several lemons (I make the entire lentil bag at once because the soup goes fast in my house).  The soup cooks on the stovetop in only an hour or so.  Warm and tasty in winter, light and citrusy  enough for summer.  Red lentils freeze well.  Fabulous healthy vegetarian meal served with whole grain crusty bread.  Comfort food at its best.  Try them!
