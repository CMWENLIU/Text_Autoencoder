First of all, the puree was fabulous, and it was wonderful to be able to find something like this which is very difficult to find even in the specialty grocery stores. That was amazing.<br /><br />However, that being said, it took forever to get the product. It was shipped by way of the moon and came into Illinois and then left Illinois (where it was supposed to be delivered). It even changed shipping carriers. It was (finally) supposed to be delivered by UPS and on their web site it showed one failed attempt. The problem was that people were home, no one tried to ring the door bell, no note on the door, nothing. Called the post office, they said they would try to re-deliver it the following day. Ok. Stayed home the next day. Nothing. No note, no one ringing the door bell, nothing. Looked on line and the UPS site said 2nd attempted delivery. Called the post office again, complained, they said they were sending the package back because no one was home to sign for it. They finally agreed to a third attempt, and I stayed home from work for a third day (ugh!). Still no one bothered to ring the door bell - they just left the package on the door step.<br /><br />What a nightmare.
