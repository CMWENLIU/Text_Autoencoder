I'd been trying to get pregnant for 17 months, after two rounds of Clomid I decided to add this tea and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OVFAA4">Restoring Fertility by Drs. Brandon Horn, PhD, LAc (FABORM) and Wendy Yu PhD(c), LAc (FABORM)</a> into the mix to try to tame my PCOS and Clomid aches for cycle #3. I ovulated early and thought I'd missed out but I got a "Pregnant" on a digital test last night and this morning! Just waiting for my doctor to confirm!
