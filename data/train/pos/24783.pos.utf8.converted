I don't buy this particular item, but I do like the brand.  I regularly eat two cans of Crown Prince sardines a day and have been doing so for years.  I have eaten them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  In fact, I remember when I ate nothing but sardines for three consecutive days due to financial hardships.<br /><br />I definately wouldn't spend $14.00 or more on sardines, even if it's a twelve pack.  I take advantage of Crown Prince's coupon deal where they send me coupons after I send them proof of purchase labels.  The sardines only cost me 1 or 2 cents a can after using the coupons.<br /><br />Indeed Sardines are among the healthiest of foods.  Sardines contain more Omega-3 fatty acids than any other fish.  Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatories and inflammation is the root cause of many diseases (if not all).  One of the things I've noticed over the years after eating sardines regularly is a drammatic reduction in headaches.  Before I ate sardines regularly, I used to get tension headaches quite often.  Since I began eating sardines regularly, it has been years since I've had a single headache.<br /><br />Whenever I buy the varieties which have salt added, I put the sardines in a colender to wash away the excessive salt before eating them.  From time to time I also like to put a few cans of sardines in a blender, add water to improve the consistency and then drink it or just scoop it up with a spoon.  It's an excellent energy booster.
