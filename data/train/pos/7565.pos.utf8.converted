Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as "mild" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS. When this coffee arrived, the K-Cups were in a thin Timothy's cardboard box, which Amazon had put inside one of their standard corrugated cardboard boxes. The upshot is that these Timothy's 50 packs are mailed double-boxed, unlike the Coffee People 50 packs, and so it seems less likely that the Timothy's 50 packs will get damaged in the mail.
