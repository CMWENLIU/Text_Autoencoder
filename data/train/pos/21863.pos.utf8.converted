First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.
