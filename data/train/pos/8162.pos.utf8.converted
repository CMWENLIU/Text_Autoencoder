And I was drinking good coffee too. This is my absolute favorite tea. It's great with milk and a splash of honey. I tried other chais, but the spices were often overpowering. This one is so good I bring some with me when I travel, since restaurants rarely have it. If you like this flavor, ordering in bulk is the way to go. The cost per box is almost half that in grocery stores.
