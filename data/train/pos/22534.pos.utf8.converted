This coffee is infinitely better than the Douwe Egberts coffee that comes with the Senseo. I like my coffee black - no cream, sugar, or anything else, so I like to really taste my coffee and can spot bad coffee right away.<br /><br />No bitterness, much smoother, and stronger than Douwe Egberts coffee. Also, each pod makes an 8 ounce cup versus 4 ounce per Douwe Egberts pod. The pods are individually wrapped, and you can smell the freshness when you tear open a pod packet; when I opened a Douwe Egberts packet - there was only a faint smell versus the strong, fresh smell from these packets.<br /><br />I have even - accidently - made 2-8oz cups of coffee with ONE of these pods - and the second cup wasn't bad (a little weak, but not bad - some folks that prefer weaker coffee would have thought it was great).<br /><br />I have tried four of BetterPods' varieties, Kona, French Roast, Columbian, and Sumatra Mandheling - with the French Roast being my favorite due to my preference for a darker roasted coffee - but all being equally great otherwise. I think I am going to throw away the Douwe Egberts pods that came with my Senseo, or find some other non-beverage use for them.<br /><br />I have also made espresso using Ecopads and the Senseo's 1-cup mode with some Starbuck's Espresso Roast... not quite as strong as a true coffee house espresso, but very good nonetheless, and much easier to setup than my old home-brew espresso machine... Now if BetterPods would only come out with an espresso roast (hint-hint)!
