I own 6 of these and they perform flawlessly. Plenty of shocking power and perfect for protecting your precious garden from marauding critters looking for a meal. There are a lot of cheaper fence chargers/energizers on the market; don't waste your money on ones that short out when one blade of grass lands on it! You pay for what you get.<br /><br />If you need one with plenty of punch that delivers a good jolt, the SS-1000X does just that. My pet goat and sheep respect my electric fences when I have one of these operating them, too.<br /><br />Key features: low impedance, solid-state, imtermittent current and a joule rating of 1 or higher.
