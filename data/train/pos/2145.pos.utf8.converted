I've been doing a ridiculous amount of research on cat food. I want to ensure my Josie has food that is good for her, but I can't afford to spend more feeding my cat than I spend on MY food! I stumbled across this food at an excellent price on Amazon. I've checked the reviews on this brand on pet food review sites, and didn't find a single bad review. My cat LOVES it and she appears to be doing well on it. I'll update if anything changes! (I also posted a couple of pictures of the product, since the picture on Amazon is of the dog food, not the cat food.)
