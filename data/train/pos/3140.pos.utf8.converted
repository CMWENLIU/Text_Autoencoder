Of all the Lundberg rice blends, this is by far my flavorite.  It has a rich nutty flavor and is a good source of fiber.  I sometimes blend in a little more wild rice  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5OMA">Lundberg Organic Wild Rice, 8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>  You can also make your own custom blends with various Lundberg rices.<br />Ca $20 for 6 bags, w free shipping on orders >$25 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal.<br /><br />The only problem is that it can be hard to cook it just right.  Oddly, most published rice cooking instructions produce wet undercooked rice for me.  The following is my formula which works just right for any brown rice.  It produces firm dry, but fully cooked, rice, which is particularly ideal for mixing with cooked meat and/or vegetables (e.g., stir fry) or adding to soups immediately before serving.  To cook white rice, just alter the time to 15--20 minutes.<br /><br />COOKING INSTRUCTIONS<br />1) add 1 1/2 cups of water to an uncovered 2 1/2 quart sausepan<br />2) on HIGH bring the water to a boil, in the meantime measure 1 cup of rice.<br />3) as soon as the water begins to boil, turn the stove OFF (or take the pot off the burner), add the rice, and stir*<br />4) set the stove burner to LOW, set a timer for 30-40 minutes, and cover<br />5) when the timer goes off, immediately remove from the stove, uncover, stir and "fluff up" the rice with a plastic spatula, and leave uncovered for 1/2 hour.<br />6) after a half-hour, cover the rice until time to eat it.<br /><br />*If you simply dump rice into a pot of boiling water, and slap a lid on it, it will boil over and make a mess---you need to let the burner (particularly if ceramic) and pot (particular if heavy) cool down a little before you put the lid on.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply turn the burner off for the few seconds it takes to stir in the rice.<br /><br />DO NOT SUBSTITUTE BROTH FOR THE WATER; DO NOT ADD BUTTER OR OIL---you'll almost certainly get wet, undercooked, rice.  If you want to add flavor, add olive oil or butter, and Braggs Aminos or bullion AFTER the rice is fully cooked.<br /><br />CAUTION<br />On my glass-top (Kitchen Aide) range, I've found that I cannot cook ANYTHING simultaneously with the rice.  If the oven or ANY other burner is in use (or if the stove is merely warm from recent use), the temperature sensing circuitry of the range turns off the burner with the rice, with the result that the rice is undercooked.<br /><br />SALVAGING UNDERCOOKED RICE<br />You can't just put the rice back on the burner---you'll get glop.  Assuming that you started with 1 cup of dry rice:  Pack the rice into a 24oz covered casserole, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a> and microwave for 5 minutes.  The result will be PERFECT rice.  Really!!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!!<br /><br />COOKING IN A MICROWAVE<br />Add 1 cup dry rice and 1/2 cup water to a 24oz covered casserole, microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).  Add another 1/2 water, microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).  Add the third 1/2 cup water and microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).<br /><br />General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.<br /><br />To see my, "How to Cook Rice" for more details<br />click on "See all my reviews" above, then click on "So you'd like to know" guides on the left side of the page
