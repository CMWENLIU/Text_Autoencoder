Like another reviewer (Purple Cloud); I've been purchasing this oil for at least 2 years or longer. I cook quite extenisvely and frequently utilize high end products and equipment to complete my recipes. Many of these items I either purchase online or in specialty food markets. I happened to be reading a cooking magazine or some such material that listed the health and cooking benefits of rice bran oil (helps to reduce cholesterol and it has none, has no trans fats, and has vitamin E among other benefits). This oil also has a very light, almost non-flavor which is great when you lightly sautee delicate vegetables, such as asparagus. I don't want my oil competing with the flavor of my food in some cases. Because of the light flavor, I actually bake with this oil and have absolutely no residual oil taste. I don't even think I own any canola or vegetable oil. I also love the fact that this has a high smoke point (490 degrees) higher than peanut oil as a matter of fact, which is absolutely great when I want to sear meat in a pan. As does everyone else, I also want to save as much money as I can, especially when I am purchasing high end products. To save money purchasing this oil, I actually order this directly from Honest Foods.com, which is cheaper than the listed Amazon price, although this oil is being sold here by Honest Foods. I also look for coupon codes when ordering from Honest Foods to save even more money. I typically also purchase two or more at a time and Honest Foods reduces the price to $8 per 1/2 gallon. I have never had my oil "go bad" and simply store it in a cupboard, and I do not deep fry anything, so it's not as if I use mass quantities in short duration. This is a great product and everyone should try it. Also, this product is made and processed right here in the United States.
