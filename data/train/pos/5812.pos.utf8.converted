I keep this yeast in my freezer and it always performs for me (I've had SAF yeast last years in the freezer with no problems). I usually re-vacuum-seal and freeze half of a pound of SAF and then keep the other half also in the freezer in an airtight, stainless steel container. This yeast can last about 9 years sealed in the freezer without losing much oomph at all (and probably STILL more active than most store-shelf yeasts sold at the supermarket).<br /><br />This yeast rises FAST if you put your covered bowl or pan of dough in the sink with some warm water (or placed in a slightly warmed oven) and it works far better than expensive "bread-machine yeast" if you use a bread-machine.<br /><br />If you make a lot of sweet dough which requires more sugar, then add some citric acid and powdered milk to help aid the yeast to rise (about 1/2 teaspoon citric acid and 1 teaspoon powdered milk per batch of bread dough) or you can buy Saf's 'special' yeast (gold package) for doughs that use more sugar.<br /><br />If you've been disappointed with your baking endeavors in the past, it was probably the crappy yeast and not your baking skills, so get thee some quality baking yeast and you'll have success at long last.<br /><br />Happy baking!
