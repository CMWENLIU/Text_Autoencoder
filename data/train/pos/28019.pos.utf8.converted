My search for a non-bitter (stevia), non-artificial, non-refined sugar sweetner is over at last!  I hesitated to buy this because of the requirement to buy 12.  Boy, am I glad I did buy the whole box!  We use this in everything, including baking, and find that it has a really good taste.  Most sweetners ruin the taste of our fine coffees, but the agave simply supplies sweetness.  We'll be trying the amber agave next in hopes of a heartier sweetness for winter baked goods.
