I had read several articles proclaiming the wonders of Acia juice... Skeptical?..of course.  The price was somewhat prohibitive but I found it on the shelf of a local health food store and decided to give it a try.  At first the taste was quite strange...fermented like wine(but I got used to it and actually enjoy it..).  The juice is not a smooth drink it includes some pulp( not like you're drinking oatmeal)so there is definitely texture. My interest lay in the fact that it promoted weight loss ... result...it has increased my weight loss slightly BUT it has resolved bloating and bouts of constipation and fatigue.  Although I am not losing weight by leaps and bounds the resolution of the other 3 issues gave me more than enough positive evidence to continue using Zola.  I do have hope that someone out there will have a generous sale on this product =)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015VVS2M">Zola Original Acai Superfruit Juice, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>
