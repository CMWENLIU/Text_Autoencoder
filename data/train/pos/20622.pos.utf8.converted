The product is great, and is truly helpful. HOWEVER<br /><br />According to Kellogs webpage - they PROMISED that the pricing of the gluten free rice krispies would be the same as the regular rice krispies - well, the regular rice krisipies for the same size packaging is selling for 11.16 and the gluten free is 15.90 - shame on amazon and boycott the purchase here until they address/fix the pricing.
