I've been eating this brand of granola since it first appeared at my Whole Foods. I particulary love the Vanilla Almond Crunch "Cereal" which I use like granola over my fruit and yogurt. I love that it is sweetened naturally and is low in fat. If you want a traditional granola, I also really like the Peak Protein. It is great for snacking right out of the bag and since I don't eat meat, the extra protein is needed. It kind of tastes a little like an oatmeal cookie to me. I've tried all their flavors and these are the only two I like, although I will say my husband is partial to the fruit and nut. There is a flavor for everyone!
