I prefer this resealable package over the 11oz..and by the way, the other reviewers are mad!<br />Perhaps they have never had fresh BRAZILIAN coco water before and are used to asian coco water which is sugary and watered down and completely industralized. I am from north of Brazil and can tell you this is what fresh young brazilian coconut water should taste like.<br />And how can anyone complain about the packaging? Makes no sense. Who could dislike a resealable, environmental friendly package!?<br />Overall, I am very satisfied and will continue to order this brand on subscribe and save. 3 boxes a month.
