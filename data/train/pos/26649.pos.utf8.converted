We have friends and family that bring back vanilla from Mexico for us. This is by far the best we've ever had. My wife saved this brand for only special recipes because we couldn't find it anywhere until now. She absolutely loves it. Thanks Mexnilla for putting it on Amazon to make it available to us. Totonac's is the best!
