I am just hoping after doing my Iraqi dish and its recipe is First you put 3 spoon of Date Molasses in pot then 1 spoon of THIS Al-Wadi TAHINA on the top to cover the molasses, then bring bread and mix with your bread the Tahina and molasses and EAT ... But I am not responsible for any high sugar intake !!!! lol<br />It is so delicious, as Iraqis we love Tahina and Date Molasses very much and specially during winter time !!! I can not say more, but the products came in time, very fast shipping and very careful packaging and great great taste ... very good company !!!
