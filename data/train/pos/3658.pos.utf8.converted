Though I'm hesitant to call this kid-safe, since anything that scares away bugs seems that it would inherantly be dangerous to little ones, everything that I seem to find leads me to believe that it won't harm my little ones. I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction.<br /><br />I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks.<br /><br />I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work.<br /><br />Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase.<br /><br />I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays.
