My fianc&eacute; is gluten intolerant, so I've been doing a lot of research and experimenting to try to produce something that resembles her favorite foods, from breads to cupcakes, pancakes, pizza, and cookies. Of all of the all-purpose gluten-free flours we've tried, this one is definitely the best. She literally referred to it as "magic". The key thing that makes this flour so much better than the bob's stuff is that they have a good balance of various types of flours and emulsifiers. Your average wheat flour contains flour from various types of wheat with different protein contents, but its all wheat, because wheat contains the key elements of sugar, starches and proteins necessary in making great breads/cakes/whatever.<br /><br />So, when you are trying to mimic the textures and tastes of the things you get when using regular wheat flour, you have to combine various other types of flours to get a result that tastes like the real thing (or better, if you really work at it!). This flour has a very nice balance of starches, sugars, and proteins (from the various different flours), that produces foods with good texture and body, without making things too dry or spongy.<br /><br />Buying this flour online is significantly cheaper than buying it at our local grocery store, and though its still expensive, I don't think any of the competitors have a product that produces foods that taste nearly as good, so I think its worth it.
