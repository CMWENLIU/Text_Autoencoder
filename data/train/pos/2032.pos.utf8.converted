These lights have exceptionally good light output.  I bought the 30 Watt version and they were too bright when I used them in a light fixture with 5 lamp sockets.  These are still rather bright in the same 5 socket light fixture, but acceptable.  The light output will become a little less with time. When compared to an incandescent bulb, these appear to be pure white and the standard bulb a weak yellow glow by comparison.  Once you adapt to these full spectrum bulbs, you cannot go back to standard incandescent bulbs. Now I am replacing incandescent bulbs in all areas of my new house except in areas of low usage or places the bulbs will not fit. These bulbs will fit in most fixtures, however. I am replacing the fixture in my garage to put some 45 Watt full spectrum bulbs into a cluster light fixture. I live in the Houston, Texas area so cold weather is not normally a problem.  Fluorescent bulbs often are weak in light output in cold weather until they warm up after a few minutes.  When warm, they work fine. I have not tried this particular bulb series in a cold soak environment yet.  The payoff should come this summer when electric bills are at their peak.  These bulbs are very efficient and produce a lot less heat than incandescent bulbs.  I look forward to the day that LED bulbs become affordable and brighter, but for now, this is the way to go. Definitely avoid the so called warm white fluorescent bulbs in the stores.  Order only full spectrum CFL bulbs or those rated 51K or 55K or anything in the 5000 to 6000 Kelvin light spectrum. I would avoid the bulbs in the 6000 Kelvin range.  They probably have too much of a blue shift.  The 51K or 5100 Kelvin bulbs are perfect. Then it is just a matter of selecting the wattage you want.  For multiple bulb fixtures, these 23 Watt bulbs are perfect.  For single bulb fixtures, you probably want a higher power bulb than these. I am using a 45 Watt 51K fluorescent bulb over my breakfast nook and it is just right. These full spectrum bulbs are great for SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) people like me.  I get winter depression when it is cloudy and bleak for a long time. Normally Houston has plenty of sunshine, but this winter has been unusually cold. Well, at least I am not in the frozen north. This is quite a switch for me because I just moved from the San Francisco area.
