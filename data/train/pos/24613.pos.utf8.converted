With a taste that is as smooth as an Eric Clapton guitar solo, this energy beverage is great for athletes, executive-chair warriors or those of the arm-chair variety during the week or weekends. The American flag is prominently featured on each can; the company is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. This is one of the best energy drinks on the market...and you don't need a backstage pass to find it.
