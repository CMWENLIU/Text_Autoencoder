My vet had recommended Royal Canin for my older cat because he had slight tartar buildup and because I was told it would lower the p.H. of his urine. Unfortunately, it was over $30.00 for an eight-pound bag, it smelled awful, and it contained by-products. Next, I tried Nutro, but I was shocked at some of the things I read about the product (such information can be found via a Google search). Finally, I picked up some Wellness, which was much less expensive than the vet's stinky stuff, having read multiple raves about the product.<br /><br />As soon as I opened up the bag of Wellness, my two fellas darted towards me. They scarfed down the Wellness, ignoring the Nutro in their bowls.  The cats did not have any digestive problems, and they continued to ignore the other food, so after a few days, I simply gave them Wellness. Needless to say, they absolutely love it. One time, I left the bag open on the counter while I went to refill their water bowls. I heard a strange chomping sound intermingled with rustling, and turned around-- I could only see the behind of my older cat, as he was shamelessly snacking from the bag of Wellness!<br /><br />And my two boys look absolutely amazing. Their soft fur is so shiny that it sparkles under the light! They have not had any issues with this food at all. Every time I come home or wake up, their bowls are always empty; my younger cat has even tried to lick his empty bowl in vain for any crumbs.<br /><br />I won't be using any other products. Wellness is a little pricey, but our furry friends deserve nothing but the best.
