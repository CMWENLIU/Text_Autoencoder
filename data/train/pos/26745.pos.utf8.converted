I buy all my herbs and spices from Frontier, knowing they're the best and that they're coming from an environmentally conscious co-op run company.  However, the last time I ordered these from Amazon, I was shipped a competitor's product instead, and sent it back at Amazon's expense.  So make sure you get what you're buying and they don't ship you an inferior substitute product.
