If I could give seven stars I would. I ordered these for my mother in the hospital 1500 miles away, when I found the online offerings from local flower shops cheesy, substandard and WAY overpriced. A bouquet of daisies and carnations and filler in a cheap vase starting at $45? And you want $20 to deliver it under three miles? Puhlease.<br /><br />Although I was given an estimated delivery date of two or three days, they arrived the next day, just as I specified. And they are GORGEOUS, according to Mom. They arrived just in time to awe my stepsister and stepfather, who had brought a generic bouquet that probably cost just as much as my fabulous orchids. I wish I could've seen their faces.<br /><br />Mom says there are at least a dozen stems. She is just loving telling all the nurses and her visitors that her daughter sent the spectacular orchids.<br /><br />Little-known fact: orchids last longer than any other cut flower. They will still be beautiful when Mom goes home next week, and probably for at least a week after that. They are elegant and exquisite.<br /><br />When you care enough to send the very best, send orchids.
