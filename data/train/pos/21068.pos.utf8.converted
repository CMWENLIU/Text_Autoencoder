I like their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZW5OS">Eden Organic Black Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> too!<br /><br />Adzuki beans are a good source of magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc copper, manganese and B vitamins. As a high-potassium, low-sodium food they can help reduce blood pressure and act as a natural diuretic. When combined with grains, beans supply high quality protein, which provides a healthy alternative to meat or other animal protein.<br /><br />Like most beans, adzuki beans are rich in soluble fiber. This type of fiber provides bulk to the stool and binds to toxins and cholesterol aiding in their elimination from the body.<br /><br />In Japan adzuki beans are known for their healing properties and are used to support kidney and bladder function.<br /><br />Gillian McKeith is a huge fan of the adzuki bean and refers to it as the 'weight loss' bean as it low in calories and fat but high in nutrients.  The high-protein content makes you feel full longer, and the low-fat content helps limit calorie intake.<br /><br />While adzuki beans are a great part of a healthy, weight-loss diet, they also contain protease inhibitors, which are known to disrupt the development of cancerous cells. This is important, because often when people try to lose weight they cut out many foods that deliver necessary vitamins and nutrients, which can be dangerous. That's why adzuki beans, with their nutritious, low-fat qualities, are an important part of a health approach to eating.
