They have sprouted in 10 hours! I have soaked them in room temperature filtered water for two hours yesterday night. After that I have rinsed them and scattered on bottom of a large pyrex glass container with a lid a little ajar. This morning 10 hours later most of the groats have already 1-2 mm shoots. This product is real!
