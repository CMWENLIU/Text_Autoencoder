I absolutely loved corn bread and thought that I would have to stop eating it when I went gluten free. Then Pamela's came out with this super easy and versitile corn bread mix. I immmediately ordered a case having never tried it before because it was a Pamelas product and I have yet to find something I don't like of hers. Anyway, I would definate recommend that if you love corn bread because you will not be disappointed.
