I was searching online for sardines in olive oil with a reasonable amount of salt (my rule of thumb is mg = kcal) - I could find only soybean oil at the grocery store. Received my first shipment today - beautiful! Delicious! And no bread needed to 'kill' the salt. And you know how sometimes, when you eat something like sprouts, that are just so alive and so good for you, that your stomach and liver immediately feel so... happy? (Or is it just me?!) I never expected to get that feeling from a canned food.
