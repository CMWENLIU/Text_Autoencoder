This Keebler Cookie & Cracker variety pack has 36 small pouches inside. 9 mini Fudge Shoppe Fudge Strips cookies, 9 Cheez-It, 6 Animal Crackers, 6 Scooby-Doo cinnamon Graham Cracker Sticks, and 6 mini Chips Deluxe Rainbow cookies. I like all of them and think they all taste great. Each pouch has just the right amount to give a little snack - not too much. Just one note about the name is this item. It's called a Cookie & Cracker Assortment on the box. But because of the sugar content of both the animal crackers and the graham crackers those are more cookies than crackers making the box mostly cookies - with the Cheez-It the only true cracker.
