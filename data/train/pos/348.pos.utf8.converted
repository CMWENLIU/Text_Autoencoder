Our little baby girl battled colic and reflux for nearly 6 weeks. She was unable to sleep because her little belly hurt - she would be 90% asleep when she would arch her back ad then scream in pain. Baby, mommy, and daddy were all miserable. After going through all the brands of formula (including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>) the doctor finally put her on goat's milk and Prilosec. I am not sure which was the bigger influence, but the quality of our lives is now significantly better.<br /><br />  The nice thing about the Meyenberg Goat Milk is that is easy to prepare just like regular formula. Liquid goat's milk must be kept in the refrigerator and must be warmed ... not too big of a deal except for those 3am feedings! Another nice thing about the Meyenberg powdered milk is that folic acid is added. Remember that if you choose to give goat's milk to your baby that you will need to give some supplemental vitamins. Our daughter seems to enjoy the taste - and as a bonus it does not have the nasty smell of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ARPKE4">Similac Alimentum Hypoallergenic Formula, Powder, Case of 6 Cans- each 1 lb (454 g)</a>.<br /><br />Final Verdict - So far... great... let's hope it continues!<br /><br />5 Stars
