I found the JCS curry in a store in Orlando, Florida in 1994, over the years I've tried many different brands of curry, but this is by far the best ever.  I gave two friends from Jamaica a few ounces to try and they were calling me after they used it for more or to know where they could get it.  I would stock up whenever I was Orlando, but I wasn't getting back there anytime soon so I decided in April 2010 to check online and there it was; I immediately purchased (4) 22oz bottles. My friends were quite surprised when I gave each of them a 22oz bottle. They are now calling me for their mothers and friends, I'm now the curry pusher. I finally gave up my pusher status and told them to check on Amazon. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D71GSC">JCS Hot Jamaican Curry Powder, 22oz</a> has certainly spiced up my life; it's helped me win friends and influence people.
