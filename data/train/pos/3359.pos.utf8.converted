An Amazon Friend reviewed the Texmati White Rice recently. Today when I took this out of its spot, I thought: People should know how good this Royal Blend white, brown, wild, and red rice really is.<br /><br />Here I am on a two-fold mission: one, to explain this lovely blend and two, to suggest other uses for the empty container. How I found this rice is maybe unusual. When I am normal, I zip through the grocery store, attending business, then I'm out of there. When I am depressed, I spend two hours in the store. I look at everything. I imagine my life another way. With this rice, I thought, how exotic could I make a meal for a small dinner party? I thought of Royal Blend served in little white ceramic Chinese rice bowls I bought in San Francisco. Set the bowl right on the plate. I have colorful plates that I mix-match for fun and variety. Serve with grilled salmon fillets. Get out a vegetable cookbook for ideas there.Everything has to be fun and cheerful. This rice certainly is colorful and fun to eat. Its slightly nutty taste and hint of crunchiness would wow the taste buds and complement the salmon.<br /><br />Cooking this rice also saves time. Mix the water, rice, butter, and seasonings all together, then cook 15 minutes as opposed to 20 for white. Besides, Royal Blend contains no fat, just a touch of sodium, 30 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of protein, and one gram of fiber, making this hands down a superior product of rice.<br /><br />The second point is the availability of the containers. Once the rice is gone, I wash the container then use it to hold my various varieties of dried beans. The plastic jars look identical and neat all lining the counter top. Add attractiveness to the look.<br /><br />Royal Blend costs a little more, but aren't you worth it?
