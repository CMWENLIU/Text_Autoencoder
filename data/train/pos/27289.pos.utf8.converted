Before I tasted PG Tips I was drinking Twinings Irish Breakfast (IB) tea which is quite good. However, PG Tips  is as good as Twinings IB and costs just half the price. It is a blend of Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan tea. I have no clue what IB tea is, it does not say anything on the box.<br /><br />I am switching to PG Tips from now.
