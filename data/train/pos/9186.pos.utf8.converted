I was anxious to try making my own ijera at home after living in Ethiopia for 15 months and have had fairly good success with this tef flour.  It is the dark variety but I enjoy the great almost mocha flavor.  I can tell it is fresh because it develops a good sour starter on its own without needing to add any additional sourdough starter  or yeast.
