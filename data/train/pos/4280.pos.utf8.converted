Yes, it's packaged ramen, not a health food. However, for those who want a fast and inexpensive snack or meal, Maruchan ramen is a classic.  This Chili flavor can be hard to come by in some markets; I haven't found a reliable source locally for the past year or so.<br /><br />Some may mistakenly think that "chili" means Mexican-style, like the dish with tomatoes, beans, and beef. Here, "chili" means chili pepper, as in spicy broth. Don't pay extra for those bowl noodles with the additional spicy seasoning packet. Maruchan chili-flavored ramen gives you the same flavor and heat for less money and less wasteful packaging.<br /><br />This Chili flavor makes a great, spicy ramen with flavor and a little kick. You can enjoy it as a simple ramen soup or add meat and vegetables for a more nutritious and tasty meal. Give it a try!
