This pickle is quite hot; sharing with friends tells me it is too hot for people who aren't used to spicy food. For people who enjoy/are used to spicy food, it is delicious and very flavorful. The mangoes are unripe, so they are tart and with a green-olive-like texture; *nothing* like a sweet ripe mango. This relish nicely balances salty, sour, bitter, and chile flavors with a good blend of accompanying spices. If you like Indian pickles, try this. I put it on eggs, quesadillas, rice, Indian style flatbreads, vegetables, fish, etc. Basically, everything but dessert. I will warn that it is addictive!
