The only negative to this product is that they are very expensive when compared to most other snack options but it's definitely a case of get what you pay for.  We certainly eat other snacks and treats but the cost of these comes from the fact that not only are they organic but dye free as well.<br /><br />If you have a child that is sensitive to artificial dye you know how hard it can be to find things without making everything from scratch and who had time for that :).<br /><br />These have an incredible taste, love the consistency and the fact that I can feel good about feeding them to my little ones.  A word of caution, since they are so "healthy" I made the initial mistake of treating them like a snack instead of treat.  In reality these are a lot like giving your kids gummy bears, just healthier, but still they are full of sugar and it's easy to eat multiple packages as they are pretty little.
