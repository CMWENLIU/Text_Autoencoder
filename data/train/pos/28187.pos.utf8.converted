I bought this for some people who helped me move. The shipping was easy to track and it arrived well before the estimated shipping time frame. The packaging was nice and the recipients loved it. I was cautious about ordering this after reading some of the reviews here. However, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this as a "Thank You" gift.
