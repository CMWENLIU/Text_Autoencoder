Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. It took me years to get up the courage to buy a vanilla bean.<br /><br />When I did, I found the flavor was truly superior to vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean.<br /><br />Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />I've been using pieces of vanilla beans, but on Food TV<br /><br />they always split these down the middle and also scrape<br /><br />out the vanilla for superior vanilla flavor.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
