Agree with the first reviewer, these are quality peaches.<br /><br />So many uses for these peaches, such as on cereal, as dessert, in blender drinks, and in salads, or just out of the can.<br /><br />The price , delivered to the doorstep by Amazon, is very helpful.<br />  Finding 12 cans of peaches in pear juice locally would be a challenge, and fresh peaches are  only here in summertime.<br /> So these peaches are really great, and very welcome.<br /><br /> /I tried mixing these into protein powder, like a smoothie.  You get helpful emergency food with a taste very close to the fruit pies your grandmother knew how to make.<br /><br /> 15-ounce can has 3 1/2 servings of:  peaches, water, pear juice concentrate,  only 5 milligrams sodium per half-cup serving.  So, plan to keep on hand for emergency and daily enjoyment, we plan to get a case to back us up in power outages,  Enjoy.
