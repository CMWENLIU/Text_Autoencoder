I adore this stuff. Sure, if you just chug it by itself you're going to know that this isn't a French chocolate ganache; it's saltier than actual chocolate syrup, with a slightly different flavor. HOWEVER, this stuff is A-MAZ-ING when mixed into smoothies. I imagine it would also work really well on ice cream or in a glass of chocolate milk. Tonight I drank a protein shake with a few squirts of this in it, and I couldn't tell that it wasn't real chocolate.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong here. If you love chocolate but not the calories in chocolate, GET THIS.
