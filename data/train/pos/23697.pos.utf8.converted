I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.<br /><br />I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.<br /><br />The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.  Good luck!
