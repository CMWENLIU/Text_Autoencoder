These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them "Purple Flurp" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too).
