I really enjoy this product and have been buying at my local supermarket for about a year and a half.  Amazon saves me only a few dollars on a case, but the convenience of having it shipped to my house is what really makes the difference.  It tastes good, but the little seeds can make it seem gritty.  I don't personally mind, but I know a few that do.  The real reason why I drink it is the way it makes me feel.  I can really tell a difference and it's almost tingly.
