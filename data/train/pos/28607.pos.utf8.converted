I love gnocchi, but I am terrible at making them.  I have been spoiled growing up with my mother (from Italy) and aunts (from Italy) all making the most amazing gnocchi.  That being said, I have to say that the DeCecco gnocchi, although not tasting "homemade," are the best purchased gnocchi I've tasted.  I've already ordered 2 packs of 12!  Its great for a last minute meal if you have sauce in the fridge as they cook in a few minutes.  Great with bechamel or white sauce too.
