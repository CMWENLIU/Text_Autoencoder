When you've tried the rest get the best! Tons of info is available on the internet about this miracle root. I've been in the health and fitness all my life and believe that the all natural route is the best. I've been taking Maca Root for years and I'm convinced this company is the best source of the best quality product available. And no, I don't work for or represent the company; I just believe it is best to channel your energy in praising great products rather than crushing the bad ones who no one cares about anyway. There seems to be a misconception on what is healthy in the nutritional supplement realm, so I would like to help enlightened those in search of truly natural ways of health. For example, L-Arginine HCL, Acetyl L-Carnitine HCL and other branch chain aminos, synthetic hormones enhancers, etc... are widely sold as supplements by the most well-known commercial nutritional brands (won't mention names here), and are believed to be excellent nutritional sources. These are synthetically made in labs and are substances your body naturally produces. If you consume these regularly, your body gets lazy and will eventually stop reproducing them. Maca Root on the other end, is a natural source of whole food, which contains essential amino-acids, fatty acids and other great nutrients necessary for optimum health. I would also recommend throwing away all those weight gainers in your vitamin cabinet too. Raw Organic Hemp Protein is the best, with nothing added. For my sex drive, I'd say Maca Root gives a gentle boost, but I'd recommend alternating it or taking it with Tribulus Raw Power , 200 pills, 200,000 mg. High Potency, concentrated, Tribulus Terrestris muscle volumizer, male enhancement, for long term results and for immediate all natural results, I'd recommend Red Sex Dragon - Male Enhancement Pills - Male Performance. Those who expect an immediate and drastic sexual boost from Maca Root Raw Powder have an unrealistic approach. You may eventually see results with long term use and an overall healthy lifestyle, if want to feel the bang, get it at 100:1 Extract Ratio or higher, but it can get pretty costly.
