It is awesome to find a dental chew that is safe for a teething puppy AND nutritious.  I also love that it has cranberries in it to help my little girl's urinary health; and DHA to help her developing brain.  My 4 month old Lhasa Apso puppy, Alexi, goes crazy for these! She polishes a small one off in about 15 minutes.  I've considered getting the large ones to keep her chewing longer, but I worry that they might be a bit too big.  These are a fantastic value and are much cheaper than similar brands.  I tried the CET dental chews, and they made her terribly sick (and I won't consider Greenies at any age due to the ingredients).  Alexi eats a corn-free, gluten-free, wheat-free, soy-free diet, and these fit the bill perfectly.  She eats Canidae Lamb and Rice as her food and gets these and Zuke's for treats and chews.  I'm happy to have a puppy in great health, and I am relieved to find something that she loves to chew on while her mouth hurts from teething.  Also, these don't leave a mess on my carpet, and they sit perfectly on her little tummy.  Really, I am addicted to this product.  Also, the price is great for 18 of them!  I got the antioxidant ones for my Mom to give to her older dogs.
