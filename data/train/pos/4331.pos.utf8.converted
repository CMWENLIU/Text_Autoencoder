I grew up in southern India where water from tender coconut is sold by street vendors and it is drunk straight from the coconut. It is the most refreshing drink, containing electrolytes for very hot weathers over there. Gatorade and other artificial drinks are very poor substitutes.<br /><br />After having tried the canned coconut waters available in Asian stores, I had given up on coconut water for a decade until I chanced upon these. They are expensive, but it is amazing that one could bottle "authenticity"! No artificial additives, no sugars, no pulps, nothing!<br /><br />It is so good that I don't want to try the mixed varieties that they have. Nothing but pure coconut water for me.
