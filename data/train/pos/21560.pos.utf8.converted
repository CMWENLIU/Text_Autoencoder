We started buying Muesli for breakfast during a trip to France last month - and when we returned to our home in Columbia SC, couldn't find a product similar to what we enjoyed in France.  I looked around on line, and the product description of Bob's Red Mill Muesli sounded like what we liked.  Turned out to be the same - we love it - and have just re-ordered.
