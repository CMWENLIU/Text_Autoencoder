I never dreamed I would purchase cereal on line! However I had been purchasing this brand at a local market until it became so expensive the store dropped the line. Since I had been eating it mixed with yogurt almost daily for the past 6 months, I wanted to find a new source to continue purchasing it. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. We were also VERY pleased that the cereal from this supplier seems to be fresher than the store where I use to purchase it. The shipping time was excellent and cost reasonable. The cereal is flavorful, low calorie for my diet, and full of nutrition.  I also enjoy it as a healthy snack. I have tried most of the other flavors in this line and find this one to be the best.
