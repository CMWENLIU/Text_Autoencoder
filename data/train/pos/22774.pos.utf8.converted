Ever since my wife bought some whole-bean Raven's Brew Deadman's Reach a few years ago from a specialty shop in NYC I've been hooked on all their roasts and varieties.  I've been buying Raven's Brew coffees through their website for years now, and although it's not cheap (especially with shipping from the west coast) it's well worth the price.  Leave your Starblech's behind: Deadman's Reach is easily the best coffee I've ever had - smooth, silky, and full-bodied.  A French-pressed cup (or two) in the morning starts any day off right.  Thirsty now...off to grind some beans and make some Deadman's Reach!
