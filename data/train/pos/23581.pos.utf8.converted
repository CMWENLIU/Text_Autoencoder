Tried these for the first time the other day and had to get a box of them.  They come in three flavors, rosemary and olive oil, sea salt, and lightly salted.  Sure the major ingredient is potato (like a potato chip) but they taste so much better!  And healthier!  It looks like it has potato, tomato and spinach in it as the veggies. Really delicious chips and each bag is 1 ounce which is a very good size!  I think I'm addicted.  Try them at your own risk.
