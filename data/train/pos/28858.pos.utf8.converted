Love Peychaud's Bitters (running neck-and-neck with Fee Brothers Aromatic Bitters - which are also sublime!) They add to the PERFECT Manhattan! Much better than Angostura Bitters and Angostura isn't bad, is it? It is just that Peychaud's and Fee Brothers are so much more complex and flavorful. Yum. Thrilling for the tongue.
