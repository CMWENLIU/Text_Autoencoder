This critter serves several purposes. First, as my cats will point out if you sit on the box you own it (cat rules). Second, when the box is empty, and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it.<br /><br />This tasty meal in a pop-top can, reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice.<br /><br />Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can. Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards. Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors.
