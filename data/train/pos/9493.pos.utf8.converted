I am new to gluten free foods.  I was diagnosed with celiac disease in March.  I have been searching for a "normal tasting" saltine cracker.  This is as close as it comes.  These crackers are delicious<br />with almost all my new gluten free diet foods.  I am so glad I found them.  I will continue my orders as long as these crackers are available.  Thanks Amazon!
