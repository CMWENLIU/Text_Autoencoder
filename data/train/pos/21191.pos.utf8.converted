I've been buying little disposable cat grass kits for a few years now and this one is far superior to the others.  What I love most is that when the kitties eat the grass, they can't pull the container around or tip it over because of the wooden base.  It's nice and sturdy.  Kitties love the grasses.  I paid between $1.99 and $3.99 for the disposable grass kits and they only lasted a few weeks at best.  I bought this over a month ago and the grass is still growing strong, so it is a great value.  I also bought some refills to save on shipping, and I'm glad I did.  Out of 3 cats, only 1 doesn't eat the grass (at least not when I'm looking).<br /><br />Some people have mentioned that the seeds didn't sprout and it got moldy.  I had no problems at all.  You need to be sure to keep the seeds moist (a spray bottle works great) yet also be sure to empty any water left in the bottom so it doesn't sit in water.  If you're dilligent the first few days, I think you will increase your chances of success.  But I wonder if maybe the people who experienced mold might have started their kits during cooler weather...that could increase the chances of mold rather than germination.  Be sure to put in a sunny or very bright window (warmer temps) right after planting.<br /><br />No doubt that I will be buying the refills for this for years.  If you're worried that your kitty may not eat the grass, just buy a cheapie disposable one to test it out first...if he/she eats it, you will surely have a hit with the 4 grasses that come with this one!
