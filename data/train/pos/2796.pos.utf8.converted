This coffee is amazing, smooth, and just a little sweet. Not acidic and a great aftertaste.<br /><br /> I was really surprised it was so good even though it was pre ground. I usually always get whole bean and grind just before i brew, but a whole bean wasnt available on Amazon so I got this instead. It is amazing coffee, and i will be ordering it again. I love coffee bean and tea leaf coffees and prefer it to Starbucks or any other brand, and I have tested out hundreds of coffees.
