celsius is not for the faint of heart. It has 200 mgs of caffeine...I believe red bull has about 80. The wildberry is I think the best flavor, its vaguely like the taste of blueberry with other berry flavors mixed in to me, if you've had the berry flavored enviga I think the celsius is slightly better and more berry flavored than enviga's is. I can't comment on its calorie burning, but I know if I drink one of these I have enough energy to do a full workout that day.
