Bob's Red Mill Amaranth. It works well in anything you want to have a nutty or fruity flavor. It goes great with things like apples or peaches, cinnamon, walnuts, etc. It works best mixed with other GF flours. It can be a little strong on its own. I like the 6-month subscription plan. It almost makes it affordable.
