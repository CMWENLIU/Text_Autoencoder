This new taste sensation is a wonderful addition to one's spice arsenal.  IMHO, it should be used as a dusting (like paprika might be used) just before serving for greatest flavor impact. It is subtle, ethereal, haunting.  I want to use it on everything!!! It tastes, to me, a little like fennel fronds, a little like curry, a little like flowers, but better than all three!  BTW, the supplier sent free samples of some of their other blends.  They were wonderful too.
