I've been a loyal fan/user of Sequel's MacaSure (powder form) in the past but it's fairly expensive, so when I stumbled across this Maca at this amazing price I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Well, I was ever pleasantly surprised! I liked using MacaSure like a spice/condiment, sprinkling it over omelettes and salads; I found Navita's Maca powder a little granier but every bit as pleasant tasting. In fact at this price I can afford to 'splurge' a little more with it! I'm so glad I got 2 bags! I'll definitely be back for more in the future! Thank You Navitas!!
