Boylan's Root Beer is the finest drink of it's kind. The pure cane sugar really makes an enormous difference in the taste, unlike most others who use corn syrup. This is exactly what happened to Coke products when they changed to corn sweeteners. It really lost something! Try a Coke bottled in Mexico or Central America and you will see what I mean. This fact, along with Boylan's excellent blend of flavorings, makes their root beer the absolute best! I give it a hearty two thumbs up!
