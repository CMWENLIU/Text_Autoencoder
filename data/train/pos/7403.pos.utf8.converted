OMG, I was given seaweed as a kid by my father as a snack and when I saw these at Trader Joe's for 99 cents a package, I figured I would give it a try. It is like heaven in a package. Sooooo good. Run, don't walk, it's the best. Beats chips, pretzels and I even chose this over my beloved popcorn. FABULOUS!!!
