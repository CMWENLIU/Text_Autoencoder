Love this espresso!  I was camping and forgot our coffee and had to go into the local market and get some instant coffee(which I hate), and we stumbled on Megaglia D'Oro.  Everyone helped themselves to the Medaglia and they liked it.  The next day my brother came to the campsite with a coffee kettle and brewed some coffee for everyone, and after a cup of the brewed coffee, they said they preffered the Medaglia.  Good stuff!  My only complaint is that it comes in a tiny jar.
