This is Swedish but also a delight in Denmark. They come in bite size pieces as well as bars (I prefer the pieces not available here). It is a mod-sweet chocolate wrapped around a barely crunchy-caramelly tasting inside...literally  melts in your mouth. When I go to DK, I buy bags for friends...like a dozen as this is the preferred souvenir! They are quite satisfying and make a great 'guest' chocolate as they are very, very fancy tasting candy even though the wrapper is playful. Enjoy!
