These chocolate covered coffee beans are an unbeatable treat with rich, dark chocolate and a crunchy, perfectly roasted coffee bean in the center.  If you've never tried this treat before, or have and want to again, I highly reccommend these beans.  They are rich and delicious, yet it's also the type of snack that you can have enough of and set them down.  I plan to get more.
