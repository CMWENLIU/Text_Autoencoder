My daughter and I recently made jam and we LOVED this pectin. I hadn't made jam in over ten years, so I was thrilled to find a new pectin that you didn't have to use sugar or very little sugar. Plus, we loved that you could use other sweeteners like honey or agave nectar and still have the jam set up perfectly. Another great bonus was that we only had to use one box of pectin for 24 jars of jam. Very easy to use product and we will be jammin' again soon!
