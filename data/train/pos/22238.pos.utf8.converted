I'm reviewing the sprats not the seller: these are great. The aroma is wonderful, the texture is pleasant, and I have YET to find anything that might be considered a defect! Just a few of these tender morsels make a slice of bread go down so it's a great alternative to peanut-butter, jam, etc.<br /><br />Simply: if you grew up with a taste of smoked fish, you will be very satisfied with these Latvian sprats.<br /><br />As for the seller: overpriced; you can find these identical items on ebay for under a buck per can with a flat shipping often under 10 bucks for the whole load. That is, if you're serious about your sprats :-)
