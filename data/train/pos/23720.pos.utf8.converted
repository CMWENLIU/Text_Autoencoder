This Folgers SimplySmooth Decaff is great coffee, but increasingly difficult to find in stores, so it's easier for me to just buy it online. I mix this Simply Smooth decaff, with Folgers Black Silk (bold yet smooth), for a good half-caf blend that is easy on my stomache yet has a really full nice flavor.
