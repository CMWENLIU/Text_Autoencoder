I like this coffee as well.  I keep it and Nabob on hand.  Read my review for Nabob and get more details.  Kenco has the international smoothness that I can only get with Nabob and Kenco.  The Kenco cup is a small cupper, though.  It's not a full cup like Nabob.  It is lighter than Nabob and makes a creamier coffee than Nabob.  I like them both.  I now reach for Kenco more than Nabob, because I am a small cup drinker and the flavor is great for those days when you want less caffeine in the morning and more taste.  Nabob and Kenco (and Gevalia Hazelnut for a strong falvored coffee that guests will enjoy).
