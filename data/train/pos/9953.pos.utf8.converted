First ...I ordered this tree and saw that it was shipping from a warm place to where I am with 6 inches of snow on the ground.  It arrived within a few days, packed very securely, in great shape ready to go.<br /><br />Secondly ... It was an early Christmas present, by a few weeks. There was concer with the 'WILL IT SURVIVE UNTIL CHRISTMAS' factor ... WOW ... this little tree with a few leaves on it, is going gang-busters.  There's a ton of new branches, not just leaves.  It looks incredible.<br /><br />Third ... This is a gift that my whole family is enjoying.  It's a little 'miracle' that we are monitoring closely everyday.<br /><br />Thank you ... We'll be ordering more.  You have created a bonsai aficionado.<br /><br />Bonzai with the bonsai!<br /><br />Merry Christmas.
