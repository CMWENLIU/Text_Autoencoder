Several years ago, I stumbled across a newspaper article about how Knox Gelatine helped ease the pain of arthritis in the feet of the writer's large breed dog.  Well, my wife has been struggling with arthritis in her back for over 30 years.  So, I showed her the article and she couldn't wait to try it.  It has worked wonders for her.  She is able to get right up in the morning now.  Before, she used to lay on a heating pad for 30 minutes and do all kinds of stretching exercises until she thought it was safe to get up.  Her back pain has gone away.  She no longer gets those "catches" in her back that would put her out of commission for days.  She started off by taking two envelopes a day, one in the morning and one in the evening.  Now, she takes one in the evening.  We have been buying this through Subscribe and Save for about a year now.  The price is comparable to other stores and ships for free.
