Finally a flavored sugar!  Splenda is awesome (does not create sugar imbalance in your body, which is the #1 weight gainer)!  The mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered, and I am a French Vanilla fan, usually.  The French Vanilla is a close second and the Hazelnut is a distant third.  One packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz. mug (14oz).  No need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch, which is good since they are a little pricey.  The only "con" is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start-tear on the top.  You have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets Vs. regular sugar size paper ones.  A stupid "con", I know, but nothing can be perfect, can it?!
