Tasty Bite Punjab Eggplant is delicious and spicy.  Try adding a bit of plain yogurt.  Serve with rice or bread (nan or pita work well) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars.  This is true of all of the Tasty Bite Indian Entrees.  I wish the Tasty Bite Thai Meals came as Entrees (i.e. without the rice or noodles) so I could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles.<br /><br />Tasty Bite Entrees are really easy to keep on hand, since they don't have to be refrigerated.  Buying in bulk works well for these.
