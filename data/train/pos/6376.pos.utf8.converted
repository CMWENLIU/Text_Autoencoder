I have tried all the other pectin products available in My local stores with virtually no success. The jam always came out more like syrup tasty but runny. I read about Pamonas and decided to give it a try. I don't like to use a lot of sugar and all other pectins require that You use 55% -85% sugar in order for the pectin to do its job. Pamonas Pectin allows You to sweeten Your jam to Your own taste You can even make jam with No Sugar. I made raspberry Jam using 20 cups of berries 4 cups of sugar and one package of Pamonas Pectin. The jam set up perfectly after 3 seasons of canning I finally found the secret "Pamonas"
