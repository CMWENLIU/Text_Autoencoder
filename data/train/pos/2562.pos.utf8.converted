I've been making wine from kits for almost 10 years now and these kits are very nice. With the discount for "Subscribe and Save" you can't beat them.  I've purchased several of them now and have had no problems at all.  They come complete with real corks, labels, and foil caps packed into a plastic bucket. Note: The bucket is not a food grade container and can't be used as a fermenter so don't make that assumption.  I'm sure they only ship in a bucket because if they shipped in a box they would get destroyed due to the weight.  Great kits and a great deal.
