I take these snack packs with me everywhere!  I travel a lot and I never get on a plane without a few in my purse.  Just knead for a few seconds and tear the pack open, you can squeeze straight into your mouth from the pack, or spread on a bagel or apple (or in yogurt and granola - delicious).  The perfect snack.
