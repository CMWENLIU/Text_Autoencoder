I make these and non-vegetarians beg for more.  I'm forbidden from bringing anything else to potlucks.<br /><br />I first ate these in a stir fry and they were terrible.<br /><br />Then, after re-reading the reviews, I drained them, patted them dry, and dredged them in a flour/paprika mixture and fried them til dark golden.  They're amazing dipped in BBQ sauce, honey mustard, a hot sauce/butter mixture, general tso's sauce - you name it.  DELICIOUS!  My friend's love them and none of them are vegetarians.  Even my extremely picky vegetarian husband will eat them.
