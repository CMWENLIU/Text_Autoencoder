These sweetened carob chips are simply sensational. You wouldn't even be able to tell that they weren't chocolate. We use them in all sorts of cookies and candy making too. Contrary to popular belief, carob can be melted just like chocolate. The trick is to use a double boiler and do it as slowly as possible. If your mixture gets too grainier lumpy, you're doing it too quickly. Slow down!<br /><br />You might also try cooler water. Not cool water, just cooler than you're already using (and getting the lumpy mixture). This might mean, you need to use warm water instead of hot water. Or, it might mean you need to use hot water instead of boiling hot water. After all, if they can turn carob into chips, you can turn carob chips into something else, right?<br /><br />These babies go great with the Barry Farm's PB chips:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH64VM?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br />...as well as the yogurt coatings also from Barry Farm:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVTE0?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8<br /><br />Do note: the more you order, the better the shipping (compared to all items) but larger orders can take a little longer to ship. Don't fret though, you'll get it!
