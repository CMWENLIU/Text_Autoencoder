This bread is excellent. I love the taste and texture of this bread. It is a very dense bread but I like that. I went from 100% whole wheat to double fiber whole wheat and finally to this bread. And I found that I liked each one better than the last. If your preference is white bread you probably won't like this bread. But if you like real, hearty whole grain breads you will love this bread. I would eat this bread even if it weren't for the low-carb factor. I prefer it to regular bread and it's a lot healthier, even if you don't need a low-carb bread.
