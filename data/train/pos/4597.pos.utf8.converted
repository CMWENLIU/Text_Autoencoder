When local stores stopped carrying these, all the other neighborhood noshers and I almost starved during the Packers games (the package even has Packers colors!), but even fans of the B**rs and V**ings forget the colors when they take the first bite.<br /><br />Allegedly, olive oil actually helps with blood cholesterol.<br /><br />The main problem is trying to keep from eating the whole bag after the first bite.<br /><br />Tip to Luker and others who complain instead of using an obvious simple solution to their problem:  Open the BOTTOM of the bag (Hint: It's very similar to the top, except on the other end of the bag).  Eat from that end to get rosemary more evenly distributed with every chip.
