As stated in another review, I've been an Amazon shopper for years yet never bought groceries online until recently. The cost for specialty foods in stores (if you can find them at all) is outrageous these days. Only one chain store in my town sells julienne-cut sun dried tomatoes; the packages are the same size as these from Bella Sun, but they sell for about $4 per package. This year to cut costs, I'm making gifts from my kitchen as well as homemade "Gourmet Gift Baskets/Bags".<br /><br />The Bella Sun brand of Sun Dried Tomatoes Julienne-Cut is far superior to the $4 per package brand in the store. These are tender enough to toss onto salads or pizza, are great in homemade bread and cook up beautifully! The flavor is superb!<br /><br />I made 6 half-pint jars of homemade sun dried tomato marinara using 1 cup each diced onion & celery sauteed in olive oil, 3 cloves minced garlic, one 3.5 ounce package of these sun dried tomatoes, 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 cup water, 2 cups tomato sauce and herbs. Simmered it all until the tomato strips were mushy, pureed in the blender, returned to the pot, stirred in some tomato juice and brought it back to a boil before canning. The resulting marinara is amazing! We're talking serious tomato taste with excellent color and texture... perfect tossed with cooked pasta or as a pizza sauce.<br /><br />In fact, you can assemble your own "Gourmet Gift Baskets" by pairing one 3.5 ounce bag of Bella Sun brand Sun Dried Tomatoes Julienne-Cut with pizza dough mix, dried mushrooms, fresh cheese of your choice, herbs and perhaps a tiny bottle of olive oil.
