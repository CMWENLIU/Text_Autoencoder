I love- prefer- my coffee with chicory which adds a mellowness and lowers the caffeine without hurting the taste.  However not all chicory root available is roasted and granulated.  This chicory is and can simply be added to a drip coffee maker along with the coffee.  I match it with a rich dark roast, and use a quarter to a third of chicory.
