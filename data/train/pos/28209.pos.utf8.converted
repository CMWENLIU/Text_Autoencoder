I'm grateful to Lakewood for their Noni Juice. But I'm mystified as to why the change in serving size. First, let me tell you why I like the product.<br /><br />In the fall of last year I was, inadvertently, causing heart palpitations due to the fact that I was doing shoulder stands as part of my Yoga routine. I stopped the shoulder stands, and my heart returned to normal in about a week. But I was rundown and tired from two months of heart palpitations. So I picked up a bottle of Noni. I took the recommended serving, 1 tsp. per day. I felt nothing for two weeks. And then the Noni kicked in. I felt noticeably better every single day. Today (and for months now) I feel great. Now, here's where things get interesting.<br /><br />The bottle I bought six months ago says Serving Size is 1 tsp. (5 mL); Servings Per Container is listed as 190. Obviously, shelling out $25 every six months or so is no big deal for most of us.<br /><br />Now, if you look at the label on the newer shipment of Noni, you'll see a change in the Serving Size - 2 fl oz (4 TBSP); Servings Per Container 16.<br /><br />Yikes! Twenty-five dollars for a 16-day supply.<br /><br />So I contacted the  company on June 9 with my question - why the change in serving size?<br /><br />I'm still waiting for a reply.
