I first tried this tea at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC because they were out of the African Amber which I'd just finished drinking.  Not wanting caffeine, my choices were limited and I am so glad I gave this a whirl.  In the past, although I drink chamomile, I've recently relegated my chamomile teas to use in the bath tub for a soak.  My taste buds had confused the steeped tea with the aroma of dirty socks.  Drinking the Mighty Leaf Tea Chamomile Citrus exposed me to a combination of flavors which are much better consumed and I had to buy some for my household.  I only add milk to my Irish or English breakfast teas and I seldom add lemon.  On occasion, I may add a Splenda.  I add nothing at all to this tea other than just boiled water and I do not discard the teabag after brewing the first cup if I've brewed it directly into a cup.  I use the single bag for two mugs worth of tea and enjoy the second cup as much as the first.  The "silken" bags have a white cotton string attached to a little paper tag and they are machine stitched for security.  The fabric allows for full steepage and easy cleanup.  Although the fabric will not biodegrade as quickly as paper, it is lovely to touch and look at, so I try to not feel too guilty by using these bags.  I really like the combination of ingredients with the chamomile, particularly the nana (mint) and am impressed by all the Mighty Leaf Teas I've tried.
