Vegan. Natural. Raw. Kosher. Wonderful whole raw macadamias. Great on everything. Delightfully tender nuts. Not dry roasted or cooked in oil. No added salt or any other ingredients. Just macs. Value size can be divided for many treats. Great for baking. Melt your favorite vegan dark chocolate and dip and cool for chocolate mac love. Large 2 lb. (907g) package. Portion control highly recommended. Repackage in smaller or snack sized bags. 1/4 cup (34g/1.2 oz) is about 12-14 whole mac nuts. Highly caloric. Each of these full servings is 270 calories. A half serving of 6-7 whole pieces would be only 135 calories. About 27 whole servings or 53 half servings per bag. Great value. Also available dry roasted for those who don't prefer raw, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV9QMI">Azar Nut Company Macadamia Nuts, Whole, Dry Roasted, 32-Ounce Resealable Bag</a>.
