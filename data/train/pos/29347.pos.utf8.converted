After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.<br /><br />A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine:  Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee.  The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.<br /><br />I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price.<br /><br />If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy.
