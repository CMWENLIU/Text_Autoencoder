Let's be clear about one thing, I likes my cake mixes.  You've heard the rhetorical phrase "Does a fat kid like cake?"  The original phrase was: "Does Tim like cake?" but it was changed due to some confusion that it caused for folks who knew other people named Tim... apparently some of whom did not care for cake, but I digress.  I knew when I saw the $34.00 price tag, this was gonna be a special cake mix.  Sure, the temptation was there to go with the "Buy it Used" option to save a few bucks... but since my intention was to wash this cake down with some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032G1S0">Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz</a>, I thought why cheap out on the cake mix?  It did not disappoint.  Moist and delicious.  10 times better than the $4.00 cake mixes you find at your local store, so there's your value right there.
