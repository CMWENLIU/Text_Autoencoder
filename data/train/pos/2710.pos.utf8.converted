I have only recently discovered dill weed, but have so fell in love with it that I've gone through 3 of the $5 bottles (which are about $5 for less than an ounce).  When I found this Frontier 16oz bag, I was willing to pay the price for the try.  Slam Dunk!  Fresh, aromatic, delicious dill weed at such a profound savings from the grocery, it's almost obscene...good thing I don't find obscenity in the least bit offensive!
