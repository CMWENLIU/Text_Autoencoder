Flaked Fish and Shrimp most likely has the best ingredients in Fancy brand.  As another review pointed out, it's 15% more protein.  Not only that, if you look at the ingredients list, you can see "Ocean Fish, Fish Broth, Shrimp" at the top of the list.  The rule is that higher percentage component in the food goes first.  Having ocean fish and shrimp is great, as opposed to "liver or meat-by-product".  In fact, there is no meat-by-product in the list.<br /><br />Of course, it's also that my cat likes to eat this. Therefore, I subscribe to this on Amazon as my cat's regular meal.
