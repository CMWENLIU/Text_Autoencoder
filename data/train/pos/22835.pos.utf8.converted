The Biscoff Spread is unbelievable! The spread is made up of 57% Biscoff cookies. It totally captures the flavor of the cookies yet in the creamy consistency of peanut butter - but of course it's not peanut butter. It's amazing on toast, as a frosting for chocolate cupcakes, and for dipping fruit. It's available in the USA (finally!).<br /><br />In 2007, a Belgium reality show featured two inventors who created a spread (think Nuttella or peanut butter) out of Biscoff Cookies (they are called Speculoos in Europe). Lotus purchased one, patented it, and began producing the spread in 2008. Other companies followed. Lotus brought a lawsuit and lost the first round. There's nothing like cookie drama! I've tried 3 different brands, Lotus brand stands out as the most "cookie-like" and creamy.<br /><br />In Europe? Look for Speculoos Crunchy Spread. This one has 66% Biscoff cookies in a courser consistency (think: crunchy peanut butter). Not available yet in the USA. Worth an airplane ticket to Belgium to buy!<br /><br />Biscoff Spread, a fantastic turn toward the delicious!<br /><br />From: Best Anywhere Reviews
