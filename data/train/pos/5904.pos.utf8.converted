I've started buying Go Raw products. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I don't eat most commercially processed foods because they're no longer natural. However Go Raw produces what I consider properly processed foods and for that I'm very grateful. I'm not fond of the two types of chips I've bought but I love, and will continue buying, their seeds. I use the Go Raw seeds for traveling, hiking, and work since I won't eat in restaurants or eat what most grocery stores carry. I follow a Weston A. Price (WAPF) diet and it's great to find properly soaked and sprouted seeds (to combat the enzyme inhibitors and make the nutrients available) that have been dehydrated at a low temperature -- the enzymes are still viable and yet the seeds are crispy and lightly salted with sea salt. I've offered them to co-workers who aren't picky about commercially produced foods like I am and they, too, find them more delicious than the seeds they can get at a regular supermarket.
