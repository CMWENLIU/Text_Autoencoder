i love the aerogarden.  sure it's expensive and it takes up a lot of room in my kitchen ... but it's all so worth it.  however, my herbs aren't quite as lush and prolific as the picture on the box might indicate.  nonetheless, i love this product.  so far, all i've tried are the herbs that my aerogarden came with.  also, i should mention that the herbs have a relatively short shelf life of only 4 mos. or so.
