We first tasted this yummy sauce in Boston at the Boylston street burrito place.  We dumped it into our burritos and it made a delicious burrito even better.  It is not too too hot like a jalapeno pepper w/ seeds, but has lots of flavor.  I can purchase this in a small size at one of my local grocery stores, but they don't carry this larger size.  We go thru a small bottle in about a week.  We put it on BBQ, chili, tacos, soups, and sometimes I add it to whatever is in the slo cooker!  Highly recommend this sauce for people who like to spice things up!
