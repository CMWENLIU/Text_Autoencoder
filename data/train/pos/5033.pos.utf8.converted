This variety pack is a wonderful sampling of Indian cuisine. First off, the brand: I have tried many Tasty Bite Indian ready-packed meals and they are not in the same league as Kitchens of India. The Kitchens of India flavours and spices are much more tantalizing in equivalent entr&eacute;es.<br /><br />The only problem I previously had with Kitchens of India is we'd order one variety at a time and before the family finished them we'd be ready to move onto another. Not a problem now! We order these variety packs for quick meals on the go and never get sick of them (although the wife doesn't like the spinach one and says it looks like a poopy diaper... but more for me!).
