I've lived in apartments with no outdoor space for years-- but can always get nicely smoked foods by using these bags.  True, your entire home will smell like wood smoke, but not such a bad thing (you can always undercook a bit, take the meat out and finish it outside the bag if you don't want a strong smell to linger).  The times for cooking and the recipes included on the inside are right on target every time, you really can't go wrong.  Makes wonderful brisket-- I let it cool after cooking, slice it, and then add sauce and reheat.  My friends and I agree that the poultry/fish bags aren't quite as good.<br /><br />The first I tried was a similar import from William's Foods, but they no longer carry these.  Wish I could get them locally, but this works!
