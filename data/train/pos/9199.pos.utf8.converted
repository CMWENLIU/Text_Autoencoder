These sardines are delicious...no bones or scales, and usually 3 or 4 large sardines per can. The olive oil within the can is also great and I love to put these on salads along with the oil (saves you from using salad dressing). These sardines are also great on crackers, sandwiches, etc. They do not have that typical "fishy" smell at all and they're one of the healthiest fishes one can eat (very low in mercury, lot of protein (26g) and good for you oils). The ingredients are listed as "sardines, pure olive oil, and salt" and the sodium content is rather low (280mg or 12% of your daily intake!). I had no issues with the packaging either and I will be sure to order these again.
