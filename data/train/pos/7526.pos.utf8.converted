I ordered these crackers about two weeks ago, not knowing how they would be. Turns out they are delicious! A little plain tasting, which was expected, with just the right amount of salt for my tastes and a subtle but pleasant hint of olive oil. They seem to go very well with several cheeses, soup and on their own, too. I recommend them to anyone who likes Saltines or other plain, salted crackers - however I find these to be significantly less salty than Saltines. Enjoy.
