I fell in love with coca tea while doing research in highland Peru, and I love that it's available in the US.  The other reviewer is right, it really does have a distinctive, delicate taste and I also prefer it piping hot with a little sugar, although my husband wants to try it iced.  This is a must-have for tea drinkers, and it's quite lovely in that it gives a nice pick-me-up with no aftereffects like caffeine.
