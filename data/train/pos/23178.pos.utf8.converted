After trying all the flavored coffee Variety packs sold on the Keurig site, this probably rates #1.<br /><br />I'll be the first to say that Southern Pecan did not sound like it was soon to become a daily staple, but the richness and flavor of this coffee is one of the best in the k-cup selection.  The flavor of the coffee is reminiscent of a pecan pie, the coffee is quite flavorful and is even sweet on it's own.<br /><br />I generally probably over-sweeten and cream my coffees, but with the Southern Pecan I find just a little sweetener is great and often take it without any cream.  This coffee smells great as well, easily filling the entire office with it's rich scent.<br /><br />I've been purchasing an assortment of k-cups for the office and find this is one I have to constantly re-order.<br /><br />I do recommend shopping around a bit as k-cup prices tend to be constantly fluctuating on Amazon.
