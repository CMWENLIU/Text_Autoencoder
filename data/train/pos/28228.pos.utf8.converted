I've used it three times so far and it was great all three times and it makes outstanding leftovers (I used 3 packets at once last time!).  I added the spice packet two times but I wasn't all that thrilled with bitting into bits and pieces of the various parts while I ate.  So the last time I made it I first started with the butter and added the spice packet (simmer according to instructions).  Next I added 1.5 cups of water then I let this simmer.<br /><br />Next I prepared the veggies.  The first time I didn't use the lemon curd as instructed.  The second time I did.  The third time I used plain yogurt (6oz per packet).  The lemon was my least favorite and the yogurt was my most favorite.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes of simmering the spice packet (when the veggie prep was done) I strained the water/spice mix into the veggies.  Then I followed the recipe to the end.
