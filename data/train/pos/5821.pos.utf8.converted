In my younger days, I tried a dozen times to make authentic Cevapcici (pronounced: Che-VAP-chi-chi) and never succeeded until I learned that the 'best' recipes used this vegetable stock powder, 'Vegeta', as well as a fair bit of WHITE pepper, as important flavouring ingredients. I had 'Vegeta' in my pantry, but didn't have the good sense to add it to my failed attempts. [The name 'Cevapcici' is southern Slavic and is related to the word "kebab" which means, in simplest terms, a dish made from meat--but to most of the people who prepare and eat this dish, especially nowadays, it also implies generally that the meat is grilled.] Cevapcici are small, skinless sausages, usually made from a mixture of different minced meats. Mine are 75% pork and 25% beef, but there are 40-50 popular recipes out there, to cater to local customs and dietary observances.<br /><br />'Vegeta' is a multi-purpose seasoning made from dehydrated vegetables with a bit of sugar, salt, riboflavin, herbs and spices, plus MSG. It makes an excellent vegetable stock, which may be enriched with whatever meat, poultry or seafood that you might want to use for soups, sauces or gravy. It's also a very good addition to any stews, soups, pot roasts, meat pies and casseroles.<br /><br />The manufacturers suggest adding it to 'liquid' dishes about 5 minutes before the end of cooking. However, it may be added directly to meat dishes such as meatballs, stuffed cabbage, rissoles, hamburgers, stuffed peppers and so on. It works really well in almost every European, American or Asian cuisine, particularly in dishes where marinating or mixing meats, the day before cooking, is involved. 'Vegeta' could be just the 'magic touch' that everyone who makes their own sausages has been looking for. 'Vegeta' is not that well-known among my acquaintances, even the ones who do a lot of cooking. However it is, along with 'cajun seasoning', among my "special, secret ingredients"--or at least it WAS, until I wrote this review...<br /><br />Caveats: Recipes that demand 'Vegeta' usually don't specify any extra salt, as the 'Vegeta' is (usually) salty enough. The ingredients are all vegetarian and vegan friendly (as far as I can tell) but the manufacturers do not make a point of mentioning this on the package or accompanying recipes/literature. [Riboflavin? There are many sources...just so you know!]<br /><br />Happy cooking!
