This broth tastes just like roast beef; rich, delicious and full of flavor. Some may think it's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt. I'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks. Excellent product.
