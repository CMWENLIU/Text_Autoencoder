I have a short, intense 25 minute lunch each day. When I eat one of these, it keeps me full for about 5 hours. I think it must also keep my blood sugar at an even keel, because I don't seem to need a shot of something sweet a few hours later, the way I do if  I eat other rice-bowl type instant lunches. I am gluten-free now, and this is very digestible. So, now to answer the question, Does it taste good? Yes, it is good, but not delicious. It has a mildly cinnamon component to it and is not salty. It is not exactly bland, but I have found myself rummaging around in the staff kitchen, searching for something to add to this. Successful additions have included chopped apple; curry; chopped up ham;  a handful of cashews. It is a good item to keep stashed in your desk drawer, work locker or emergency food stash for a time when you have to eat and need it to keep you satisfied for awhile.
