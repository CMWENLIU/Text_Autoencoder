I am a big fan of coconut water. I have tried just about every brand available and to me this is clearly the #1 product on the market. This is the one that tastes exactly like what you get when you stick a straw into a green young coconut. Very clean, perfectly sweet, slightly nutty and good (raw) coconut flavor. Ice cold, it doesn't get any better than this. I highly recommend Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water. Enjoy!
