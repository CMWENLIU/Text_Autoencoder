I have used the individual bags of Pamela's Amazing GF Bread mix for some time, but I recently purchased the 3-pack of 4-pound bags.  I am very happy to report that the resulting bread is just as consistently wonderful as always.  Many of my non-GF friends have tasted this loaf, and they are amazed at how good it is! I use the stand-mixer-and-oven-baking method (rather than a bread machine), as I often make round loaves or rolls from the mix.  The bread is delicious, the preparation is easy, and now the cost is much more economical for me.  Just so you know (and you can do the math for yourself to see which is the better purchase for your family), there is (almost) enough flour in each bulk bag for 4 loaves, as prepared according to the directions on the back of the bag. Remember that with this product, yeast will be needed to add to the mix, along with eggs, oil, and water.  Using milk (rice, cow, soy) for all or part of the water will result in an even more tender and moist loaf.<br /><br />I have two loaves in the oven right now.  They smell fantastic!
