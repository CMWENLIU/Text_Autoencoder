This is a special type of brown rice that adds pizazz to any meal.  It's almost as special as wild rice: dark, very aromatic and has a dense, crunchy texture.  Use about 2 cups water for each cup of rinsed dry rice (you can add a bit of butter for true luxury).  Cook over a low flame; it may take a bit longer, but it's worth it. I don't use salt because I find the flavor satisfactory without it. If you find the rice is too crunchy for your taste, you can add a bit more water at the end of the cooking and heat gently.<br />PS Amazon's price for this rice is excellent.
