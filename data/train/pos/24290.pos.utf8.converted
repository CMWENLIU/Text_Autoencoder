Makes a reproducibly excellent cup of coffee day after day. I have strayed on occasion to' gourmet' brands, only to return to Eight o clock bean coffee.<br />Way better cup of coffee than Starbucks at a much cheaper price.<br />I use only this brand in our Jura Capresso F 7 coffee maker and wholeheartedly give it five stars!
