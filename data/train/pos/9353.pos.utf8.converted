I am a very active person and have to keep moving. That's not always possible, though - especially when I'm at work and stuck behind a desk. As a kid, I would buy licorice root at the fair and chew it. I haven't seen it in years, though. I thought I would be able to find some on the Internet and I did! It works like a charm. I just break a stick and chew on it until the end becomes fuzzy. Then I clip off the fuzz and go back to chewing. It is naturally sweet, with just a light licorice flavor and it certainly helps by keeping my mouth busy! I can also dunk a stick in hot water and make a tea.
