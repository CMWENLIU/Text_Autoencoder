I have used this item about three times since I purchased it and used them to write on fondant that has been dried a day or more.  This product is excellent so far.  It has a medium tip and writes well.  I would definitely purchase again.<br /><br />Update...have been using these markers for 2-years and still going strong. LOVE them!! The tip is still as precise as the first day and enable me to do amazing detail work.<br /><br />Originally I stated that I waited for the fondant to dry a day or more, which is still true. However, if you are decorating fondant that has been rolled fairly thin, you can decorate within 10-15 minutes with the marker on a normal (not humid) day.
