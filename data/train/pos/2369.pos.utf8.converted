This Rose Petal preserve is absolutely delicious.  It is packed with rose petals exuding a beautiful and delicate fragrance reminiscent of a famous "Damask Rose".  The consistency is mellow, smooth and buttery, yet not too thick.  The sweetness is just right. With its refined aroma and delectable taste, this Rose Petal Preserve is a perfect choice to enjoy on toast or on scones, with coffee or tea.
