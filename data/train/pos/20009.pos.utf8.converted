Sun Maid yellow golden raisins are the best brand of yellow raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.<br /><br />These golden raisins are better than regular raisins if you wish to use a recipe that calls for cooking with raisins. These can come in handy!<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the bottom of the container. Eat or use these raisins before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Raisins provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!
