I bought a case of these before Christmas on a 20% off promotion.  I gave away a few cans as "stocking stuffers" but mostly we just ate them!  WONDERFUL.  This is a very reliable brand, perfectly tender and fresh.  The "very large" size is the perfect size for my escargot dishes and would also fit perfectly in smaller white mushroom caps.  I've kept my leftover "snail butter" (butter, shallots, garlic, parsely and cognac!) in the frig and we'll enjoy another can of these for Valentines Day with a fresh baguette.  Try them...you won't be disappointed and your guests will be blown away.  A whole CASE of these could be less than you'd pay for the same old/same old cheese,cold cuts, and chips for a single party.  Plan on six snails per person -- very rich.
