I bought this tea mainly to have something soothing to drink when I'm not feeling well. However, on several different occasions, I made some for my husband just as he was starting to show signs of getting sick, and he is convinced that the tea prevented him from getting a full-blown cold. Now he SWEARS by the stuff and asks me to make him some of that &quot;tea with china in it&quot; (for e-CHINA-cea) whenever he starts to get symptoms.<br /><br /> The tea has a pleasant herbal taste that is perfectly enhanced with a little honey but fine without as well. As an added bonus, the box describes simple yoga stretches to provide relaxation and stress relief, and the tag of each tea bag offers a brief meditation. Highly recommended!
