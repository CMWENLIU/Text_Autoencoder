I got this tea because I am pumping for an adoptive couple in addition to feeding my own 3 month old.  Originally, I was pumping 10 oz extra a day.  I started drinking one cup of this in the morning and I usually am pumping 15 to 20 extra ounces a day (in additional to my own son being at the 92% on the growth chart).  So, it's worked well for me.  I can tell when I've forgotten to drink it for a day.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes, I don't think it's bad at all. I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I do something drink blueberry tea or other fruity things.  This is fine for me.  I don't add sugar or anything and I drink it just fine.<br /><br />It's certainly worth a try if you're trying to boost your supply a bit.  I know with my first, my supply dwindled a bit when she was around 6 months, and this might have been the perfect solution!<br /><br />Also, my friend drank this tea right after she gave birth because she was worried about her supply taking too long to come in (jaundice and all that) -- and her milk came in within 24 hours.  Now, she said she was drinking cup after cup, but still -- to not have to wait for the milk to come in, it would be worth it!
