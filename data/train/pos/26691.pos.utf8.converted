Having remembered Red Velvet cake from the south as a child, I found this cake mix to be excellent and it has received rave reviews from adults and kids alike.  Rich like chocolate, but lighter - this is a solid favorite of all who try it for the first time. The color is enticing to some, scary to others, but once tasted - with a cream cheese frosting - all are fans.  Easy to make, perfect every time!
