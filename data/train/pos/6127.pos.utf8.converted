I am a big chocolate lover, and must say German chocolate is generally the best, especially if you consider the price-quality ratio .. Ritter Sport's Nugat (not to be confused with Nougat) has a wonderful hazelnut-cacao (sort of Nutella-type) taste, melding on your tongue, and is not too sweet (I find US or UK chocolates really too sweet); it goes perfectly with black tea or coffee ..
