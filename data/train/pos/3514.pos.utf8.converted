I bake a great deal, and crystallized ginger is a favorite ingredient.  It's a pain to chop it yourself, as the insides are sticky.  These bags are cheap and the PERFECT size for cookies, cakes, breads, you name it.  And they taste fabulous, sweet with a bit of a bite.  I often use this instead of raisins.
