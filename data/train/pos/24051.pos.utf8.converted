OK, for those of you having kittens about the four bags per foil packet, let me clear this up for you.  This is packaged for making *POTS* of tea.  I know my Mother-in-Law would find it excessive, but four teabags for a pot of tea is what it is expected to take for 4-6 cups of tea.  I, personally, like it for individual cups too because there is less waste, and bending over the top of the foil packet is very easy and keeps my tea perfectly fresh for three more days as I use up all the bags.<br />Now, for the actual review:<br />This had been my Morning Tea, every morning, for over a decade.  High-quality, expensive, tea companies (who really do know good tea) tend to not want to hide the wonderful flavor and aroma of their tea leaves with the bergamot flavoring Earl Grey is loved for.  They hardly add any bergamot, and while the tea is delicious, it is not really Earl Grey.  Cheap tea companies tend to overload their tea with flavorings to hide the fact that it is very poor quality tea.  Their Earl Grey is aromatic, but all you taste is bergamot (if you're lucky).<br />Bigelow has found a wonderful middle ground.  The bergamot is fragrant and flavorful but you still get to taste the tea, which is great for the grocery-store-friendly price.<br />If you want to sit by the fire and sip Earl Grey enjoying every bit of the moment, and you're willing to pay for that moment, then treat yourself to Rishi Tea Earl Grey Supreme (it's even organic).  If you want to guzzle it down for the caffeine fix then keep your budget happy and go for Stash.
