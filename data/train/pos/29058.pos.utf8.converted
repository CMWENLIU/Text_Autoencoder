We originally got 2 cats from our shelter, and one seemed to be healthy as a rock from day 1 (Zachy), but the other (Doc) had problems with soft bowel movements and really stinky odors.<br /><br />After a lot of vet visits and treatments, and many months of steroids, he got a bit better....at least well enough for us to not be worried about it.<br /><br />We added a 3rd cat (Sully) 4-5 months later, and he had worms at first....we treated the poor guy for worms, got those cleared up...but his bowel issues persisted. We ran hundreds of dollars of tests and half a dozen vet visits to 2 different vets with the poor guy.<br /><br />He was bloated with bad gas, farted all the time (and could clean out a room), and his poop was just absolute liquid..and would squirt fiercely all over the side of the litter box because he had so much gas.<br /><br />We were finally at a loss what to do, we had him on Prescription Diet (WD) and he got a little better, but not much.<br /><br />Finally one day, I saw a Blue Buffalo rep at Petco, and I was just chatting with him about my cats having issues throwing up food after eating. The guy really knew his stuff, and immediately asked if their food bowl was on the ground. It was, and he suggested I elevate it about 4-5 inches. Immediately, it stopped all problems they were having throwing up.<br /><br />Next time I was in the store we were talking about my cat's stomach problems and I was buying some Science Diet for sensitive stomachs (which did as much (or little) as the WD, so we were using it) and he asked if I had tried any of Blue Buffalo's products. He wasn't pushy at all, but said it might be worth a shot trying the wilderness line and getting rid of the grains.<br /><br />After doing some quick research online on my mobile phone, I was really skeptical...I saw some reviews where people said their cats didn't like it or threw up with it, and I was a little concerned.<br /><br />However, I finally decided to try it, and I bought a bag.<br /><br />Even mixed in with the old food, I saw almost an immediate difference the day after starting. Sully's gas started getting better and his poo got a little firmer.<br /><br />By the time I had them on 100% of the Wilderness Chicken, his poo stink was gone, his stomach swelling was gone, and he didn't have his gas anymore....and his poo was looking normal!<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and 4x 12 lb bags later, these guys are doing absolutely great. One of my first cats, Doc, no longer has his bowel stink or soft poop issues...and I don't have to feed him steroid pills. Zachy is still just Zachy, I swear he could eat anything and be fine lol...and Sully has gained weight (we gained no weight when we first got him because of the bowel issues) and Doc's coat looks VERY healthy...we always called him crunchers because his coat just looked like crap all the time.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is a life saver....I only wish I had discovered Grain Free cat foods about 500-600 dollars in vet bills before!
