This preserve is really delicious -- aromatic and not too sweet nor too piquant. And it's cut in just the right size pieces for spreading: not too lumpy or too 'jammy.'<br /><br />I've wasted so money on so many different preserves. I eat a few teaspoon-fulls, usually find them too sweet, then they sit in the 'frige until I finally throw them away. This brand, I ate all of in just about 2 months which is really fast, for me. It stayed in edible condition in the fridge up to the last spoonful.<br /><br />Amazon is listing four bottles, each containing 1 pound of preserve, so each bottle costs about $5.50 plus shipping.
