This is my favorite greek yogurt. It's thick, creamy, and of course, delicious!<br />I usually add fresh blueberries only. As the other reviewers said, add whatever your favorite things on it.<br />The only thing I don't like here is it's too expensive!! I got this $4.29 at a local store!<br />Come on, $6? seriously?
