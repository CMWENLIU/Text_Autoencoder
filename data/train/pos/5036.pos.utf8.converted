It is a fact that I am a dehydrating fan. My vegetable garden products are not only eaten fresh but I conserve them by canning and dehydrating on a regular basis. I was a bit hesitant to try food that someone else had dried until a friend introduced me to Harmony House dried foods. She is an avid backpacker and hiker and practically lives off dried food on her rambles. Once I had tried the dried tomato dices I was sold. This product is wonderful and has a rich very satisfying tomato taste without the aftertaste that some products have. It is pure nature in all its splendor. Since then I have added a number of Harmony House dried foods to my emergency stash and use them on a regular basis in soups, stews, breads, dips, etc. Take my word for it, you won't go wrong with this product. It makes you smile!
