Here in North Texas we drink iced tea almost every day throughout the year.  I first tried Ahmad Strawberry Tea when it was enclosed with a tea set I purchased for our daughter.  My whole family loved it.  The mango and peach/passion fruit teas are also good, but strawberry ranks as our favorite flavor.  After our local market stopped carrying the Ahmad line, we have been half-heartedly trying other fruit teas, but they don't compare; many of them seem more like Kool-aid with a slight tea flavor.  I look forward to trying other flavors that we weren't able to find in our area.
