Other reviewers have mention the fine particles in Guayaki Loose Yerba Mate, but all the Yerba Mate I've tried had some fine particles, and this does not bother me. Yerba Mate is actually made from the leaves and stems of the South American rainforest holly tree, so some dusty particles are bound to end up in the tea.<br /><br />Admittedly, I don't love the taste of Yerba Mate without sweetener and a bit of milk.  It does not taste like traditional tea, it has more of a green tea taste, but much earthier.  I do not find this tea to be bitter, but then I brew it appropriately: stir the tea in a small amount of cold water, then add 185 degree water.  I steep for 5 or more minutes, and if I steep for just 5 minutes, I find I can brew a second cup using the same tea by skipping the cold water and steeping for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />In my opinion, Guayaki Traditional Mate brews up nicely to a full-bodied tea that perks up my brain during afternoon energy slumps, without the upset stomach and "on edge" feeling that I get from coffee.  In addition to caffeine, Yerba Mate contains antioxidants.  I am on my second bag of this Yerba Mate, and I'm very happy with it.  This same tea is available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028QDMY">Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag</a>, so if the fine particles bother you, the bags may be a better choice.
