I've found this chocolate to be a great solution for my low carbohydrate diet.  This chocolate only has 5g net carbs per serving, but I find half a serving to be plenty satisfying for a chocolate fix.  Also, this has no artificial sweeteners, so I don't have to worry about digestive problems.<br /><br />If you don't like dark chocolate, you won't like this.  But if you're willing to savor the cocoa flavor, this is a great way to eat a small amount of chocolate without a lot of sugar.
