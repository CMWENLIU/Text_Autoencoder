I grew to love muesli while spending a lot of growing-up years in Europe. This version is even better than the one I grew up on, in my opinion, because it's not just oats, but a combination of several rolled grains. It also has a great combination of fruit and nuts added to the mix. In summer, it's great with blueberries, added pumpkin seeds, and milk. When the weather gets colder, it's delicious cooked, and only takes a couple of minutes. I add either maple syrup or stevia for sweetening. In short, this is a wonderful, healthy cereal mix that I never want to be out of!
