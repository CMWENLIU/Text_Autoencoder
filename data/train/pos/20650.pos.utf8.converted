I didn't think that this Butter Chicken Curry paste would hold up to a traditional, home cooked Indian meal...but I was gratefully wrong. My mom is a fantastic cook and this paste does a great job emulating that authentic, home made taste. At roughly $2 (or less on sale), this is far cheaper than going out to eat at an Indian restaurant.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I make this but we first cook down some sweet onion and brown the chicken a bit before adding the curry paste and water. The instructions tell you to add raw chicken but that sounds a little odd to us. We also like to add some extra heat via red chili powder. If you brown the chicken first, cut it into large enough pieces so that they don't dry out during cooking. We've also used this paste to make butter shrimp & it's a great alternative. All of our friends (Indian + non-Indian) LOVE this stuff. Indian approved!
