These chips are really good.  I expected them to be thick and heavy but they are just the opposite.  One of my kids likes to eat them instead of potato chips..plain out of the bag.  The other likes to eat them in place of tortilla chips...with salsa or guacamole.  With the natural ingredients and high fiber, these are a great replacement to all types of chips.
