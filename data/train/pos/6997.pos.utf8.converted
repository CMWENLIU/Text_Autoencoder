I've been canning veggies and fruits from our garden for more years than I care to admit - lol. Whenever possible, I use this low-sugar variety of pectin for jam as our family prefers the taste of less sugar. IMHO, jam tastes much better and has a much nicer fresh-fruit taste using this low-sugar pectin. Example: 4-1/2 cups prepared peaches takes only 3 cups sugar. I've never had a problem with jams not setting up properly using the canning hot-bath method when using this product. I've also used this product to make freezer jams with good results - the set is just a tad softer.<br /><br />The instruction sheet is easy to read even for beginners, includes jam and jelly recipes for several fruits and berries and also has instructions for sugarless jam -- which I have never actually tried.<br /><br />The problem I DO have is finding this pectin in the stores in our area when I need it as it never seems to be available except at the end of the summer, and what's on the shelves after that can be getting near the expiration date for the product. Apparently, this product is considered seasonal; however, store managers apparently don't realize that canning goes on all year long. As an example, today (March 22) I just finished doing three batches of peach jam using peaches we froze last summer. I had to hunt around for the pectin, and what I found was almost near the expiration date and obviously left over from last year. (I'm trying to use up the peaches we had to freeze in 2007 as our trees are already budding for this year's crop).  The jam came out great and set properly even using frozen fruit.<br /><br />I've been using this brand of pectin for years and have been very happy with it. Plus, buying it here is so easy, and I don't have to spend time hunting around for it in the stores and being told, "We won't carry that stuff until the end of the summer." This is an excellent price as I've seen it as high as 4.75/package in one of our local screw-you grocery stores.<br /><br />There's a lot of satisfaction from making something like jam from scratch and a good feeling when you look in your cupboard and see the jars of home made goodies, plus you know exactly what went in to the jam as you're the one who put it in there. And it's easy to do - the trick is just follow the instructions and measure carefully. The kids really enjoy making the freezer jams as there's no cooking.
