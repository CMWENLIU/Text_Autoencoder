I ordered these for my two Boston terriers, both of whom chew and tearup most soft toys. Now I only get them powerful chewing toys, but the chew product must have a flavor or they lose interest fast. These are bacon flavor which they like. The dogs have not lost interest, but I have to get them out of the toy bin, so they remember them
