I got sick of buying Mexican vanilla that wasn't real vanilla, and the blue cattle co. vanilla that just tasted watered down, so you had to use double or triple quantities in everything to get the right taste. If you didn't know, Mexico does not have label standards, or an FDA, and people can sell that non-conforming vanilla online because online purchases are not regulated since they can be cross boarder. It is a classic case of federal government not being able to respond fast enough in a globalizing food market and technology. Coumarin is a toxic substance found in Mexican vanilla (even if it is labeled "organic") that can cause irreversible liver damage from studies I read.<br /><br />I have decided that true madagascar burbon vanilla is the only way to go, and this McCormicks is the best price I've found on that variety of vanilla bean extract. I cannot tell the difference between other more expensive madagascar burbon brands such as spice islands, and safeways O-organics label. McCormicks has a reputation to maintain, they can't afford expensive lawsuits, and it is of course passed through standard American FDA standards, which basically protects the consumer from some of the stuff Mexico makes.<br /><br />The following is an excerpt you can find by googling "Mexican vanilla danger"<br /><br />2008 FRIDAY, Oct. 31 (HealthDay News) -- So-called Mexican "vanilla" is often made with a toxic substance called coumarin and shouldn't be bought by consumers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned this week.<br /><br />Coumarin is related to warfarin, which is found in some blood thinners. Eating foods with coumarin may be dangerous for people taking blood thinners, because the combination could increase their risk of bleeding.<br /><br />Mexican vanilla -- which may smell and taste like real vanilla and is cheaper than the real thing -- is sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries and has started appearing in some U.S. stores and restaurants, the FDA said.<br /><br />Pure vanilla is made with the extract of beans from the vanilla plant. Mexican vanilla is frequently made with the extract of beans from the tonka tree, an entirely different plant that belongs to the pea family. Tonka bean extract contains coumarin. Since 1954, coumarin has been banned from all food products sold in the United States.<br /><br />Consumers should be cautious when buying vanilla in Mexico and other Latin American countries, the FDA advised. Look for "vanilla bean" on the label's ingredient list. Don't buy the product if it says "tonka bean" or has a vague ingredient list or no list.
