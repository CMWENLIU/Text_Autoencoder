This is probably one of my favorite curries, even compared to restaurants I've eaten at.  I would recommend cooking it in whole pieces for the first 20 minutes and then cutting it into smaller pieces before cooking it the remaining 5 minutes.  It's been my experience that the chicken will be overcooked if you cube it first.
