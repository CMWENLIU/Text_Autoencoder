Just started using Lakanto Sweetener, and it was total success with my baked goods on Thanksgiving and with my Sweet Potatoes Casserole.  No one knew it was not sugar, and NO ONE Complained of Stomach or Intestinal problems.  So, I am sold on this sugar even know it's a bit pricy.  It has a nice brown sugar taste and works in most cookie recipes. The only thing I don't like is the price, but if more of us like it and more stores will start to carry it then perhaps the price will go down.  That would be wonderful.  Anyway, I prefer this over "Truvia" and other stevia like products that I have tried.  And I think it's healther than "Truvia" because there are no Unknown fillers in Lakanto. It's just pure Erythitol and Guo Han Guo.  So, I'm sold and will continue to buy this product.  There two other places where this can be bought. Saraya health  [...]
