This is my all-time favorite tea. It is soothing, yet hearty. My daughter uses Silk in it but I just drink it with agave nectar or a little stevia. Even though it doesn't indicate that it's good for the kidneys, I have NEVER had a kidney stone since I've been drinking this. I had several before. Very highly recommended for everyone who wants to quit coffee and caffeine.
