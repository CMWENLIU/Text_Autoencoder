I have been using agave for 2-3 years now and find it can easily sub for any other sweetener.  I can't use any artificial sweeteners and sugar (including honey, molasses, brown sugar, malt sugar,etc.) causes me an array of physical problems.  Agave is the only sweetener that my body accepts.  I have used it to bake cookies, brownies and breads with no difficulty and it tastes great.  I recently made hot fudge sauce for my ice cream with it.  Because it is sweeter than sugar, I use less of it than I would sugar:  2/3 c. agave = 1 c. sugar.  I am really grateful for this natural and organic sugar alternative that lets me have my sweets and eat them too!
