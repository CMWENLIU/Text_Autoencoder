If you make your own tomato sauce, you shouldn't use canned tomatoes since they are lined w/BPA. These are already strained (they save you the work) are organic and bpa free.  You can't get any better.  I also like the Pomi strained tomatoes in the cartons but they aren't organic.<br /><br />I just wish Amazon would offer these at a better price with free shipping on Amazon prime since they are currently way too expensive to buy from Amazon.com
