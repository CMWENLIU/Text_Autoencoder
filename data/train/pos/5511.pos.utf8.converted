This Vitacost coconut oil tastes and works just as good as the Nutiva brand and costs a lot less. My local store sells the 54oz Nutiva for about $36. To save some money I thought I'd buy the 54oz Nutiva 2 pack here on Amazon. Then I stumbled across this Vitacost brand and thought I'd give it a try. Since it tastes the same and has the same properties (organic extra virgin), why spend more money on other brands.<br /><br />Updated 7/30/2012 >> WOW! My local Costco now has the 78 ounce Nutiva coconut oil for $21.49. Which works out to just under $0.28 cents per ounce.
