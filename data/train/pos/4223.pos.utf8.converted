I first learned about maqui berries in a health food magazine, and couldn't wait to try it out. Not only is it jam packed with great vitamins and minerals, but it also has the highest antioxident value of any discovered fruit. The taste is very similar to the Acai berry, but in powder form, the maqui is quite bitter. I recommend mixing it with some other fruit. The way I use this powder is in a morning smoothie---it gives me a full day's worth of fruits and 1 serving of veggies all jam packed into my breakfast...I love this because it's always so hard to fit in fruits and veggies otherwise.<br /><br />My smoothie:<br />2 tsp maqui powder<br />1 tbsp chia seeds (also a super food)<br />1 tbsp wheatgrass powder (another superfood)<br />1/2 cup fresh or frozen fruit (I normally use strawberries, blueberries, or mango)<br />6 or 7 ice cubes<br />1/2 to 3/4 cup water<br /><br />Makes me feel full all morning long. Hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
