This was such a good deal that I figured I'd take a chance on this much product. It shipped without a problem (which I was a little nervous about since it's a LOT of food in a plastic container) and you get over 12 pounds of Korean style fermented soybean paste (this has little chunks of fermented soybeans and is not smooth all the way through like miso).<br /><br />The expiration dates on mine were well over a year (and will last much longer if kept in cold storage both before and after opening).<br /><br />The ingredients as stated on the package are:<br />Soybeans, water, salt<br /><br />I'm going to enjoy making soups, stir-fries and salads with this delicious soybean paste!<br /><br />A+++
