Our little dog had really bad skin allergies and was on California Naturals for quite a while with no relief. We decided to switch her to the Innova and a week later she is not scratching anymore and her hair is growing back. Hopefully this is the last time we will be switching dog foods because she had a very sensitive stomache as well. Im not saying this will cure your dogs, but it had worked for us. It might seem a little expensive but all in all it will last you longer so its really not very much more in the long run and is nutritionally better for them than store brands. We are so glad we decided to give Innova a chance and she is too!
