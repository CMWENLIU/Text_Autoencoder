I could not find unsweetened coconut at any store in our area and wound up having to buy the case of Bob's brand from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for having what people need!<br /><br />No surprises with the product.  It is dried, finely shredded coconut just as advertised.  Because it is so fine it tends to scatter around if you are using it to coat nut balls or truffles, and the kitchen looks like the recipe directions said:  "First take one teaspoon of coconut and sprinkle it evenly over counter and floor"............  :)<br /><br />I also use it to make coconut milk and that sure beats the heck out of buying a fresh coconut and going through the whole long process that I used to do years ago. It is great to be able to have just the amount of coconut milk I need at any given time without the unhealthy vegetable gums that come in all of the canned coconut milk I've seen.
