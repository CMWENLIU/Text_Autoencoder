Why would I spend five bucks per latte (and take my chances with the barista's skills) when I can make my own cup of foamy happiness in less than a minute, and for so much less? Answer: I wouldn't. At least not any longer. The Medium Roast coffee pods will satisfy you whether you drink it black or take it &quot;regular&quot; (with milk &amp; perhaps sugar). I like to use one Medium pod and one Dark Roast pod for my first cup in the morning...it makes a nice, fragrant cup that packs a jolt. I'd highly recommend buying a few bags of the Medium Roast and the Dark Roast at the same time. If you're like me, you won't want to run out-your mornings just wouldn't be the same without your Senseo.
