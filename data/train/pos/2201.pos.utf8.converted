As with other reviewers, this cereal was part of my childhood, and it ruined any other dry cereal for me forever.<br /><br />The chewy raisins are infinitely better than the soft gummy ones in other raisin brans (and there is the PERFECT amount of raisins! It is cereal with raisins in it, not half raisins and half cereal like some I've eaten), and the wonderfully tasty flakes (whole kernel, double-toasted REAL wheat flakes; not a paste molded into the shape of flakes) stay crunchy-to-al dente until it's eaten.<br /><br />I can only find it locally at my health food store under the name Erewhon Raisin Bran, but it's the same thing.<br /><br />[And re: the couple of "Yuck" reviews. They remind me of the time I was visiting a daughter in Florida and decided to make my 10 year-old grandson some chocolate pudding, his favorite thing in the world.<br /><br />I made it from scratch with whole milk, fresh eggs, excellent chocolate, Madagascar Bourbon vanilla, a knob of butter.  I had it cooled in little individual custard cups when he got home from school and proudly sat one of them on the table for him.<br /><br />He took a spoonful and his face fell.  Stunned, I said, "What's the matter?  Don't you like it?"<br /><br />He said as politely as he knew how, "It just doesn't taste like  REAL pudding...."  ("Real" pudding being the little Jello cups in the 6-pack: only kind of chocolate pudding he'd ever had.)  Enough said.]<br /><br />The muffins you can make with this cereal are w/o doubt the best bran muffins I've ever eaten and everyone who tries them says the very same thing.  Here's the original recipe my mother made for us kids with back in the 1940s and I make for my grandchildren today. I'm never without the batter in the fridge. (The recipe given on the Erewhon website is the chic low-fat kind of thing that tastes like dry lawnmower clippings.)<br /><br />1 15 oz. box Skinner's/Uncle Sam/Erewhon Raisin Bran<br />3 C. sugar<br />5 C. all-purpose flour<br />5 tsp. baking soda<br />2 tsp. salt<br />1 qt. buttermilk<br />4 eggs, beaten<br />1 C. veg. oil<br /><br />In BIG bowl, dump all together in the order given (Oil last, at any rate). Stir well. Batter will keep tightly covered in fridge for up to 6 weeks, so you can bake up just what you need. (Makes about 3 1/2 qts. of batter, 50-60 muffins with a slightly rounded 1/4 cup ice cream scoop. I wouldn't try to make giant muffins with this heavy batter. They might overbrown before the middle cooks.)<br /><br />Bake in buttered muffin tin in pre-heated 400 degree oven for 12-14 minutes, lower the temp to 375 for another 5-6 minutes till light golden brown. Run a knife around each muffin and flip on the side so the bottoms don't get soggy.<br /><br />(Don't try to gussie up with vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc.  You won't believe the richness of the flavor, esp. if you'll make it a day ahead and let the malty bran flavor permeate the batter.)
