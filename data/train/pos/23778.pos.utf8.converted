The first thing I noticed with this tea was the very dark color once it was made, then I took a sip and it really wasn't what I was expecting. But the more I drank it the more I liked it. It has a strong, slightly sweet, but very nice taste. No cream or sugar necessary.<br /><br />I don't know about the weight loss or appetite suppressant claims. I do find it helps me eat less, but the same is true of most liquids. In any case, I drink 3 or 4 cups of this a day (package says one cup is about 1/3 the caffeine in coffee) and it does help me reduce eating.
