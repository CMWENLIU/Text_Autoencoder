What our grocery store has available as a maple flavoring has eroded to the point that it's pathetic; and while the quality has gone down the price has gone up.  (Eight dollars for a one ounce bottle of stuff with no flavor?  No thank you.)<br /><br />So I started looking around for an alternative and found that Mapleine is still available.  I didn't know they still made this stuff.  My parents used to use this in the 50s; I grew up on it.<br /><br />Use the recipe on the box to make your own maple flavored syrup.  The end result, you wind up with something that tastes at least as good as store bought (I'd say a lot better) and you actually know what's in it.  Want your syrup a little thicker; add some corn syrup to the mix.  I like a little stronger maple flavor so I use a little more flavoring than the recipe calls for.<br /><br />You have to buy a box of six bottles, that's a lot, but the stuff has a long shelf life and it doesn't take up too much storage room.  I can do that.<br /><br />Bottom line: great stuff, I'm glad they still make it.
