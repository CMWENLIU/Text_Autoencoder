Ricochet Peppermints, 6pk of 100 pieces/1.48oz tins<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol, Natural Peppermint Oil, Natural Hibiscus Powder (no Gum Arabic as incorrectly stated in above description)<br /><br />This was my first time trying xylitol mints and I was not disappointed.  They are very sweet & refreshing.  They have a different sweetness than sugar, but it's not phony or sick tasting like some alternative sweeteners.  I was surprised that the mints are light purple, but it's a natural coloring from hibiscus flowers.  I do wish these mints were a little bigger.  They are .42grams/each and the size and shape remind me of Smarties candies.  They dissolve quickly, but that's probably because they're almost pure xylitol and have no added chemicals.  They also make a lot of dust, but I can put up with that for the great ingredients.  I was debating between these and Spry xylitol mints, but the Spry ones have calcium lactate and gum arabic.  Plus they're made in China and Ricochet are made in the USA.  The tins are convenient and have quotes on the inside lid, but some of the tins have loose latches.  Not a common problem, but one of the six didn't close as securely.  So if you have one that closes securely, you might want to save it.  Overall these are great mints and would be even better if they were bigger and available in more stores.<br /><br />If you're looking for a tasty xylitol gum try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00124VRPU">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 100 Count</a><br /><br />***2012 UPDATE: I just bought another 6-pack & the mints have changed a bit, mostly improvements.  They are now bigger (increased from .42g to .5g) & they make less dust.  They are also more minty.  They are still purple, but the hibiscus powder ingredient has been replaced with "natural coloring."  Packaging looks different & they have given them the new name Xyla. The price was still the same, which is nice since the mints have increased in size. Still 100 mints/tin, but weight is 1.76oz rather than 1.48oz. Nutrition facts have remained the same (1 calorie/mint with .4g xylitol & .4g carbs).  Overall the mints are even better than before.  Taste even better & last a little bit longer.
