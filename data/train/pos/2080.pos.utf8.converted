PG Tips is the best tea in all of Britain. I love it because it is top quality tea, possessing a smooth, satisfying flavour that is consistent with every cup. It's not fancy tea - it's real tea for real people. I drink it all day long from sunup to sundown and it makes a perfect cup of tea everytime. It can be hard to find here in the United States and tends to be expensive so I like to purchase it in bulk here on Amazon. I highly recommend this brand of tea.
