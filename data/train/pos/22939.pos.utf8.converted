Bought this for my sister and her family for Christmas and they loved it.  My sister loved the chocolate bing covered cherries (said they were the best ever) and my brother in law loved the biscotti. They were giving word by word detail as they tasted everything.  Also said it was beautifully packaged.  They were very happy with it which says a lot as they are not easy to please.  (Ha Ha)
