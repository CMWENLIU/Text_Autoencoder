I am very pleased that I have found a source for this product(CP Brisling Sardines).  The quality is as I remember, very good.  The unhappiness was<br />with the condition of the cans, four(4) of the twelve(12) were damaged and unusable.  The young lady at the post office where I received the package turned up her nose at the smell of the box.  I would reorder this item if it could be delivered in an undamaged condition. Brisling Sardines in Olive Oil, 2 Layers, 3.75 oz.
