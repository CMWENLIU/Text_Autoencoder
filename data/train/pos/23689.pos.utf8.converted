Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves--much less actually try it. The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.<br /><br />It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.<br /><br />And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.<br /><br />My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.<br /><br />If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).<br /><br />I hope some of this proves helpful.
