Well it's a bag of Grits.  So from the standpoint of was the item as described, yes it was.<br /><br />I bought the item to try to answer the question 'What are Grits'?  Some cookbook authors, and on-line chefs, say grits and cornmeal are the same.  But, other sources say the two are different.  I was searching for natural, slow-cooking grits and couldn't find them locally.  In grocery stores I could only find Instant or Quick-cooking grits and one of the recipes I wanted to try warned me away from those products.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought these even though the 10lb bag is going to last me a long time.  I have enjoyed the cooking process, the versatility and, eating them.
