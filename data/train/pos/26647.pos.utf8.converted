I first found this vanilla while on vacation in Cozumel, Mexico.  We brought it home and it was by far the best vanilla that we have ever used. I was upset when I found myself getting low.  I couldn't believe it when I found it on Amazon!  I was hesitant to buy it since the last reviewer said it was not the same as what was purchased in Mexico.  That statement is simply false.  My husband and I did a side-by-side comparison with taste, smell and colour.  They are exactly the same.<br /><br />To sum it up.  Simply the best vanilla that we've found to date!
