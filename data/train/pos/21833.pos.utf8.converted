Absolutly GREAT tea. I love fruit teas to beging with but this is a whole new level - nice, strong flavours and different variety. They are good by themself or with little lemon and honey.<br />I did not try it as an ice tea yet, but I am sure it will be just as good. I will be ordering more soon, I strongly recommend this tea.
