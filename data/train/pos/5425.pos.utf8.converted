I just received the product, did not expect much from it but was very suprised at the coffee it produced.<br /><br />The Senseo HD7820/65 Deluxe that I purchased was great at first but the coffee pods available together with the expense soon led to it gathering dust.<br /><br />I tried the MyPod unit which did not fit my HD7820/65 model at all.<br /><br />The Melitta Padfilter makes a perfect fit and a wonderful brew of coffee as long as you follow the instruction of how much coffee per cup to use.<br /><br />Over all I am very pleased and would recommend this to other buyers.<br /><br />Sheldon
