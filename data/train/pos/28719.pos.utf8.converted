When I first started trying to eat healthy, I loved Progresso canned lentil soup. When I started looking for organic alternatives, I found this.<br /><br />Eden sometimes misses the mark on its prepared bean products, skewing more to the vegan-commune-TVP crowd than the typical western diet. But these lentils are rich and flavorful. You can dilute them to make a lentil soup (add some soy sauce or Braggs liquid aminos), or eat them as is.<br /><br />Excellent with sharp cheddar cheese and whole grain bread.
