I first purchased this product to replenish my "Kalamata Gold" Greek olive oil supply, which suddenly became unavailable. I use this particular olive oil exclusively for stove-top cooking. I haven't used it in salad dressings, or any other cold dishes; though it is probably an excellent choice for salad dressing.<br /><br />I have at least four different kinds of olive oil in my pantry at any given time. Some are floral, some are fruity, some (now discarded) are overpoweringly oily. Iliada Kalamata Greek EVOO is neither floral nor fruity and certainly not oily on the palette, so it is an excellent choice when one doesn't want the oil to impart much flavor of its own. Again, I use this oil for cooking, but it is likely an excellent choice for dressings.
