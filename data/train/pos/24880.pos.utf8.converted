I bought these after trying several other toys to keep my cat happy while I am at work, and he loves them!  He wraps them around his paws to chew on, loops them on door stops for the 'twang' fun, tosses them in the air and brings them to me to throw for him (the only thing he fetches--self taught by the way).  They are quiet and don't hurt your feet at o'dark hundred when wandering around the house.  My cat even plays with them in bed next to me and I never wake up! Petsmart still carries them for around $2-3 (saw them today) and I have passed them on to other family members with cats.
