Amy's new gluten free shortbread cookies are Amazing! They have a rich, buttery taste that reminds me of the Pecan Sandies I used to eat when I was growing up, But without all the bad ingredients. Even my friends who are not on a gluten free diet LOVE them. Amy's products are all great, but they really out did themselves with their shortbread cookies, they are worth every penny!
