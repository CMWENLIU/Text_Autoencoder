I decided to give ZOE brand olive oil a try since I was running out of my previous batch (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WHLZW8">Bertolli Classico</a>). I'm really glad that I did because it tastes excellent and is a better deal than the Bertolli. The first thing I noticed was its darker color (a true olive green, not nearly yellow like cheaper olive oils). I used some to prepare a pasta sauce, and was very impressed with the aroma when I fried the garlic, and even more impressed when I tasted the end result. I'm not an expert on olive oils by any means, but I generally know what I like and what I don't like, and ZOE really does deliver. This is a premium first cold press olive oil (the highest grade of olive oil) and it is very delicious!
