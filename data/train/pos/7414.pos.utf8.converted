These are really exciting.  I got the ginger chews at the local market, and love them, but when I saw the mango-ginger combo, I knew I had to try them.  There's quite a bit of heat in these, and the taste lingers long after the candy is gone.  For the guy who wrote he only eats one or two a day--HOW?  These are delicious.  The 5 lb box will be gone in no time.<br />Thank you Amazon for carrying them.  Thank you Chimes people for a great candy.
