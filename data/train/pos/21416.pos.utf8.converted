Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />There are 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) which are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags (for those who are concerned about their will power) that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific alternative.  This particular selection is for a six pack of the 3.5 ounce bags which I have been purchasing at my local natural food stores.<br /><br />Note: The White Cheddar is my personal favorite of the lightly salted, barbeque and white cheddar LOW FAT selections.  Although all are crunchy and good tasting.  MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE WHITE CHEDDAR VARIETY THAT STATES LOW FAT ON THE BAG COVER (THIS SELECTION IS 70 CALORIES PER SERVING VERSUS 110!)..GLENNY'S HAS TWO DIFFERENT WHITE CHEDDAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS..ALWAYS CHECK THE CALORIES AND THE PER SERVING NUTRITIONAL VALUES.<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007
