I am an old timer from Europa, and we used chamomile tea (strong) to clean eyes, bring down inflamation, cover up grey hair, etc.  My dog and persian cat both have eye problems and before getting their medicines, I wash their eyes with chamomille tea. Just make it sure it is properly drained, no flowers in the tea.<br />I wish it would come in smaller portions. 16 ounce will outlive me.
