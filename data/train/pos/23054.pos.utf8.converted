I was addicted  to the KAL Pure Stevia Extract in powdered form, until they changed the formula.  (Why mess with a winning formula?)  So I dropped that company's product fast.<br /><br />For some reason, I like the liquid from NuNaturals better than their powder.<br />Anyway, really glad I found this. It's just sweet, with no bitter aftertaste at all, unlike some of the other products out there.<br /><br />I have it delivered on the recurring order deal that they have going.  Very happy so far.
