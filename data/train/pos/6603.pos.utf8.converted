Amazon's photo and main heading both describe TOTW Wetlands (duck quail, turkey), but the written description further down the page is for a different TOTW canned food - High Prairie (bison, lamb, venison).<br /><br />Since the 1-star reviewer said they received the High Prairie bison/lamb/venison instead of the Wetlands duck/quail/turkey, I wasn't sure which 'flavor' Amazon would ship.  They shipped Wetlands as shown in the photo and main heading at the top of the page.<br /><br />The Wetlands formula is crammed with nicely sized meaty chunks from bottom to top of can with a tiny amount of gravy coating the chunks. I mix 1/4 can of this with TOTW dry dog food and feed to my 5 month old puppy.  She loves this food and scarfs down all 3 of her daily feedings.<br /><br />Highly recommend this quality dog food.
