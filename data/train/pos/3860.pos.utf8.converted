I love this food. It actually is the only food I have found that my dog is not allergic to. (except for an extremely expensive prescription diet) I have a boxer on this food. He is allergic to almost everything. However, he is not allergic to salmon or sweet potatoes making this food the perfect choice for him. All food related allergies have disappeared and his coat has improved tremendously. He still deals with outdoor allergies, but this food has shown a big improvement in him. The only issue I have had is that he packed on a few extra pounds, which he has now lost. I cut down his dry food amount and mix canned green beans and carrots in with the dry food so he has enough to eat without the extra weight. He loves it and eats every bite!
