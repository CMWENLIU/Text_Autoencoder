Another great British Heinz product. No additives, but only the simple ingredients. It's nothing special Potato & Leek Soup, but home made taste, which I value most. What I usually do is to use a can of this and add broth and milk to make it in double the amount. I'll add freshly cut potatoes and green onions to the soup for more volume. As a matter of fact, you can add pretty much anything you want to make it a bigger batch!
