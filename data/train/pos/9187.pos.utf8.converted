I'll confess that Bob's Red Mill Teff Flour is the ONLY teff flour I have ever purchased -- but I've been pleased with it from the start, so why try anything else?  The flour I have received from Amazon has always arrived in good, fresh condition.<br /><br />Teff can be used to make tasty gluten-free breads, cookies, waffles, and more, and it is one of the most nutritious gluten-free flours available.  For longest shelf life, slip unopened bags of the flour into zippered freezer bags and put them in the freezer or refrigerator until needed.
