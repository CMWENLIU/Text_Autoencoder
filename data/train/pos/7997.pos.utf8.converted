When I first heard about Coconut oil I laughed but I researched it and figured it wouldn't hurt me to try it out.  I've only been using for a week and swear by it.<br /><br />Excellent for cooking, is a very good appetite suppressant, great for skin and hair also.  I'm a nibbler and from the first day of trying this, I don't nibble all day.  I eat a healthy breakfast, cooking with the coconut oil, add a bit to the coffee I take with me.  I eat half what I normally would have for lunch and I'm not hungry again until I get off work and it's time for dinner. Then I only have a lite dinner.  I also don't experience that 3:00pm slump.
