I have used this baking cocoa powder for five years. It is amazing how it changed a family brownie recipe.  It makes them taste deeper, richer and somehow more moist.  When we opened a bakery, the Snickers Brownies and the Death by Chocolate Brownies sell out with in fifteen minutes of opening every time. We will never go back to the other stuff.
