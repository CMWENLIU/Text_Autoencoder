As someone who's most awake between the hours of 7 at night and 3 in the morning, I've always used tea instead of coffee to wake up. I've tried a variety of european & asian teas, both black and green, but I must say that this is the best.<br /><br />  In terms of taste, this one can't be beaten. In addition to the cocoa flavoring,there are also hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, stevia, and clove. Above all, I am unable to taste any hint of bitterness, so this tea slides right down the hatch.<br /><br />  Psychopharmacologically, Yerba Mate is superior to regular teas. I'm a caffein sensitive person, so a single cup of tea can carry me for about six hours. There are tons of xanthines and other psychoactive chemicals in Yerba Mate, and the 'high' obtained is significantly different from any other caffeinated beverages I've had.<br /><br />  One cup of the stuff makes me feel really focused, but very clear and free of the extra thoughts that are usually bouncing around my mind. I've also noticed that it elevates my mood slightly, though that could just be a placebo effect.<br /><br />  Essentially, this tea tastes good & will make you feel great.
