i am a fan of power crunch, i work in a gym, so i am constantly overlooking protein bar nutrition, i picked power crunch because its not high on sugars and carbs, and all the junk protein bars may contain. i usually take a bar to school or work as a snack and i also have one after a work out, as well as a protein drink.  I LOVE, LOVE LOVE, this bar.
