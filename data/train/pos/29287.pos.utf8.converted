I use a small crockpot (about a quart size) and fill it with water within an inch and a half of the top, then add about 3/4 cup of the oats and a dash of salt, a handful of raisins, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I cook it about 5-6 hours. (Overnight is a little too long.) So I cook it during the day, put it in a container, and reheat a serving in a bowl in the microwave in the morning. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to watch or stir while the oats are cooking since they don't stick to the bottom of the crockpot.
