These 44 ounces of Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are perhaps the finest thing I could have bought with the eleven dollars and fifty-two cents that I spent on them.  They taste just like the classic, not-Easter themed Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, but their festive blue-and-pink wrappers are so pretty.  Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are definitely my favorite way to celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
