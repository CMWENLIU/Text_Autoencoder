I found this same brand at my local health food store for less than half the online price.  It IS a solid, but a temperate solid at that. I'm able to easily spread it onto hot flax seed muffins and it has an amazing true coconut taste. There are instructions about tempering the product (jar in hot water) and mixing the whole mess together if yours has a little oil separation in it; you can google the instructions.<br />Very pleased with this product and am in total love with the flavor! Some folks claim the 'coconut butter' and coconut oil are the same product, and they are not. I use Nutiva coconut oil which is a full flavored, aromatic coconut oil, but I'd sure not slather it on muffins. The 'butter' from this brand is truly like a delicious coconut spread and isn't just coconut oil, it has a high fiber/coconut particulate content. I've used spoonfuls of the coconut butter in curries to give a nice flavor and I bet this would add flavor and richness to a smoothie.
