This long grain,American Basmati brown rice is sensational.<br /><br />I have switched from my old brand of rice to this one for nutritional reasons being that brown rice contains nutrients like zinc, magnesium and manganese. It has more fiber<br /><br />It's so flavorful, I added some garlic,onion and celery as I boiled it. The aroma was captivating, without exageration.<br /><br />It tasted delicious and I just wish I had more time to cook. It takes a little longer to cook than white rice but it's worth it.
