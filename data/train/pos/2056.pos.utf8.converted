I use potatoes a lot and by the time I have to cook and peel and slice them--I'm almost too tired to eat them. I also live by myself and if I buy the bags--they usually spoil before I can eat them all.<br /><br />I love these sliced canned potatoes, I use them in soups and fry them for breakfast and they are so good with ketchip on them.<br /><br />Libbys seems to be the best I have found, in quality and flavor.<br />Everything I have purchased from Libbys at Amazon.com has been really great.
