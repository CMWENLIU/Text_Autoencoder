This barbecue sauce is the best I've had so far. It truly is very tasty. Full of flavor but not overwhelming. Right amount of spicy and just a slight touch of sweetness. Very refined taste. Great quality. I can't wait to try the other flavors. A big difference from lower quality brands. It tastes exactly the way barbecue is suppose to taste.
