I have been using Babys Only Organic Formula (dairy) for my daughter for 2 months now (she was 4 months old when we started) and I am absolutely thrilled with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very complete formula, superior nutritional value (more calcium!) than leading brands and YES, IT DOES CONTAIN DHA & ARA!!! (not like another reviewer says. Check out Nature's One website for more info).<br /><br />It is less expensive than the leading brands!!<br /><br />My daughter never had any problem digesting the formula, and is absolutely thriving on it :)<br /><br />I tried Enfamil (what I used with my first child) and other brands of formulas, but she would not drink them. This is the only formula she has liked. It DOES taste (and smell!) better than the leading brands.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It becomes foamy when you first shake the bottle to dissolve the powder, but the foam disappears if you let the bottle sit for a few minutes.<br /><br />The powder dissolves better if you mix it in warm water.<br /><br />Overall, a great formula that I have been recommending to many of my friends. :)
