I've had nutritional yeast once before in the form of a "Mac and Chreese"-in-a-box product and loved it. While it wasn't as much cheesy as it was garlicky, I had high hopes that "nooch" could satisfy the instinctual human need for Velveeta-style "cheeze". I could never find it at a grocery store OR a health store so I finally ordered this on Amazon.<br /><br />Wow. Yeah, I said wow. I used this in a recipe for "Cheeze Sauce" that was fat-free and it was amazing. Plus it had tons of protein, fiber, and of course the illustrious vitamin B-12! There are other similar recipes that call for LOTS of margarine that sound even cheesier and richer.<br /><br />This bottle lasted me about 2 recipes with a little leftover for sprinkling, so if you're new to cooking with nutritional yeast this is a good size to start with. I've since bought a 22-oz container of a different brand, but this brand is just as good.<br /><br />In conclusion...buy this, make lots of cheeze/chreese or any intentional misspelling of "cheese" you desire, be nice to animals and get 150% of your daily value of B-12.
