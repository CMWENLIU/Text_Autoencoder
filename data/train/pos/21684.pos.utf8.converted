We have been using Sunbutter for a couple of years and really enjoy it.  While some members of the family have allergies, everyone likes sunbutter.  We have tried a couple of brands and enjoy this one the most.  It spreads easily and makes a great sandwich -- or just a dip with apples.  Manufactured in a nut free enviroment. Glad to see it on Amazon.
