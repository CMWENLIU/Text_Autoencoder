Imagine this....two cats living the life of noblesse oblige. Six different bowls of dry food surround these felines on a daily basis. Thus, the cats are never close to being near the realm of famine.<br /><br />Then, I realize that Creampuff the Nasty is urinating more and generally being lazy. Elfie the Toothless vomits all the dry food after she eats, not unusual given her lack of teeth. Thus, I resolved to free my kitties of the tyranny of commercial, supermarket, dry food. It was an experiment that would have scared Dr. Frankenstein. Would my beloved brethren of puttygatos take their revenge in ways I had not yet considered after I took away their much loved food?<br /><br />Bowl by bowl, I stealthily switched to expensive, specially formulated cat kibbles. You name it. Every brand ever created. I was proud, I was broke.<br /><br />Alas, the Spoiled Ones disdained the new food ever so loudly. Nay Nay, they meowed, we shall not eat this expensive food! We are above it all, we are Felines.<br /><br />Then, EVO Dry Cat Food appeared in my vision. It was like stumbling out of Death valley and looking at the Pacific for the first time. I tried the standard version. The cats went wild. They sang and purred with joy, they slept next to the food. IT'S ALIVE!!!!<br /><br />Then, EVO's Herring Dry Cat Food was released. Yes, Yes, now there would be TWO versions. The cats sang and purred with joy again.<br /><br />Now Creampuff the Nasty is Creampuff the Contented and Elfie the Toothless is...well, still toothless, but she has gained 6 much needed pounds and her day now revolves around the dry food rather than her canned food.<br /><br />So, EVO is the greatest dried cat food ever created. Period. Check the ingredients, these cats eat better than we do.
