Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors, but my kids really didn't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring.  Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us.  I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water, let it sit a minute, then strain through cheesecloth.  I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color--prettier than standard food coloring IMO, and a perfect color for little girls' birthdays.  I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting, which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder.<br /><br />I also use beet powder to make colored sugar, pouring a tiny amount of liquid on sugar, mixing well, letting it dry, and breaking up any clumps.  I then use that sugar to make homemade peeps that the whole family can eat (recipe at http://www.marthastewart.com/article/homemade-easter-treats).  Mine don't look nearly as good as Martha's, but they tase wonderful.<br /><br />I have even used beet powder to make candy canes (recipe at http://candy.about.com/od/hardcandyrecipes/r/candy_canes.htm).  Instead of adding food coloring, just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly. I have also used it in other hard candies, the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it  you can't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn, turn brown, and taste nasty.  That only happens at very high temperatures, however. You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it.<br /><br />This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring.  One small package has lasted us a year and a half, using it a couple of times a month, and I am just now nearly done with it.  No one has ever noticed a beet flavor in the finished products because you only need a tiny amount.
