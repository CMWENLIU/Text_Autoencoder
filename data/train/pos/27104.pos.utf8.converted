I love this stuff!!<br /><br />A little black truffle oil goes a long way.  You can use from one teaspoon to one tablespoon mixed with regular olive oil or even plain old canola oil for the most amazing je ne sais quois.<br /><br />I add about a teaspoon to my Italian salad dressing and it adds a rich depth of flavor.<br /><br />Just tonight we used it on grilled salmon and it was fantastic.<br /><br />I store it in the refrigerator because I use it so slowly that I don't want it to go rancid.  If you do store it in the refrigerator you need to pull it out enough ahead that the oil can liquefy.
