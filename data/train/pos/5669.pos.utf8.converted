Yogi's Cocoa Spice is a VERY good tea.  I was really hooked on Thai Sweet until I tried this one.  Now I alternate between the two. The Cocoa Spice has a great but subtle cocoa flavor and not too heavy on the spice. I like a tea that is smooth and not too spicy.  This one does have a little caffeine.
