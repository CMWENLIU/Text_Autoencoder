My dermatologist diagnosed me with psoriasis several years ago.  I tried prescription and non-prescription treatments, and nothing would completely clear my skin.  At that time, I had the psoriasis on the bottoms of my feet only.  I finally decided to give Mona Vie a try, figuring I had nothing to lose but a few dollars.  Within a few weeks of drinking one to two ounces per day, my skin cleared completely up.  I had heard stories like that, but I didn't really believe the hype, so I was pretty surprised and pleased.  When I stopped drinking Mona Vie, the psoriasis came back.  Mona Vie is very expensive, so I gave it up for a while and just suffered with the skin condition until the patches on my lower leg showed up.  After suffering for several months (while the patches got larger), I finally decided to order some Mona Vie.  I found the Acai100 while searching on Amazon, and I decided to give it a shot since (1) It is pure acai berry (Mona Vie is mixed with other fruits/juices), and (2) It's a bit cheaper.  I've only been drinking this stuff for FOUR DAYS, and the psoriasis is almost completely gone from the bottoms of my feet, and it's about 50 percent cleared up on my lower leg (and the itching is completely gone).  I am completely shocked and couldn't be happier.  I know I sound like a commercial, but I can't help it.  I am really amazed.  As others have said, this stuff tastes terrible, but I just hold my breath and chug an ounce or two.  For me, it is well worth the bad taste.
