We are breeders of sphynx (hairless) cats. Prior to Natural Balance, the only way we could get our cats to eat dry food was to mix it with warm water and a half can of canned cat food, usually Iams or Friskies when money was low. Our local feed store recommended Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance as a healthy and tasty alternative. Our adult cats love it...no more "hunger strikes" holding out for canned food. Even our kittens started eating it at only 8 weeks, when mixed with a bit of warm water. Since there are no 'fillers', the cats are eating less to become full, which to me justifies the higher price. EDIT NOVEMBER 2011: Six years later, this is the only food we buy for our cats and they still love it.
