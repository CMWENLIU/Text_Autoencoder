If you require Gluten-Free food, and you love Italian food, you have GOT to get these!!  OMG, they are fantastic!  You must provide your own sauce - a good thing in my opinion as I make great sauce :o)<br /><br />If you recollect, prior to your Celiac diagnosis, the taste of fantastic Italian food as I do having grown up in New York City, which has some of the greatest Italian food this side of the pond, then you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. Full of cheesy goodness, perfect pasta, I can find absolutely no fault with this product - and I am picky.<br /><br />Yes, they're a bit pricey, but one pack is enough two adults.  Served with some nice GF breadsticks, and a salad, and if you occasionally imbibe, a glass of good red wine, this is heaven.  And let's face it, life is tough enough for a Celiac - aren't you worth it?  (The response ought to be a resounding YES!)<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure to place your order on Sunday night through Tuesday night to ensure that the package, which is shipped frozen, doesn't thaw too quickly while it languishes in some depot over a week-end.  Mine arrived cold, but thawed.  Froze the other 2 packs and ate the third that same night.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
