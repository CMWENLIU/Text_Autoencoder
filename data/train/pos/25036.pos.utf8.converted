A year ago my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac's disease.  I have tried everything there is out there to give her the closest thing there is to "normal" food.  Pamels'a baking mix by far is the BEST!  My husbands Mom also has celiac's disease and agree's this is a great product, she came to visit for Christmas and we made pancakes out of it while she was here and she went home and bought some right away.  My son who is the pickest eater ever and is not allergic to Gluten LOVES the pancakes and waffles from the mix he eates more that my daughter who is allergic to gluten.  I recomend this product to anyone who is allergic to gluten, it lets you enjoy the taste of breads again without cheating.
