this stuff looks like fine grits but it works, it totally smoothes out when the water, egg, ex.  is added to make pasta. each bag has about 2 and 3/4's cup of the flour.  prepared with the one egg one cup and splash of water, it works great and makes a smooth pasta that is exactuly like store bought plain pasta; it is indistinguishable to me, aside from the slightly ill regular shaped noodles  b/c i rolled it out with a rolling pin and hand cut.<br />advantages; the cheapest stuff i could find.  1.50 off+ free shipping for sighing up for auto send.<br />disadvantages; you need to order a lot even to "play" just a little, because the bags are small.  there is not a recipe for pasta on the package. The price it still higher then if you bought already made pasta. currently you have to buy 4 bags at a time.<br /><br /> one cup recipe makes about three large hand fulls of flat cut pasta. so one bag makes a little more the say 8 large "side servings".
