My cats love this food! They are maintaining healthy weights and look wonderful with soft shiny coats and clear eyes. I highly recommend this food. This food may cost more than grocery store brands but you are getting real food into your cats and you will actually feed them less and they will be healthier.. also feeding them less means less poops! Important when you have multiple indoor cats ;)
