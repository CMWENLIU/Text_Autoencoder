Of all the different brands of turkish deligh I've tried, this is the ONLY one that stands out.  Haci Bekir was also the first brand I'd tried, and I've not found anything that measured up.  This has a lovely texture, not goopy or chewy at all.  Truly melts in your mouth.  It's not cloying or oversweet.  This is the confection that dreams are made of.
