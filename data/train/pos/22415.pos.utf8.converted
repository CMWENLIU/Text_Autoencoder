At just over $1 per pound, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul is the least costly brand of truly premium dog food.  There are no fillers (despite what another reviewer claimed) and the only possible improvement is to not use "meal" but "organic meats".  However, such foods cost at least $2 per pound i.e. double the cost, or even over $3 per pound.<br /><br />Nonetheless, those very critical reviewers should turn their attention to human food.  What is called "meat" in processed food such as sausages (skin, offals, a lot of chemicals, cereals...), frozen meals should be given perhaps more criticism than dog food.
