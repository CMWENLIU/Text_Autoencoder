Efa Gold is indeed a superlative.  The taste is yummy; not at all like putting a spoonful of regular oil, even Olive, in your mouth.  The taste is slightly sweet and definitely coconut.  I use it for my skin and hair and it's just amazing what it does, even to an 80 year old.  I had to go for a 2nd haircut this month, my hair grew in so fast.  I also cook with it.  The only down side is that I use so much I needed to buy another 1/2 gallon inside of one month.  Good coconut oil is expensive but it beats buying meds!!
