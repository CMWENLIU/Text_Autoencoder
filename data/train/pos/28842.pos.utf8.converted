Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.
