GREEN & BLACK'S ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE, ESPRESSO IS SOME OF THE FINEST CHOCOLATE THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED. THE ESPRESSO BEANS HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLY FINE GROUND THAT THERE IS NO GRAINY TEXTURE AT ALL. THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOUR IS VERY INTENSE WITH A PLEASANT BITTER FINISH THAT IS WELL COMPLEMENTED BY THE ESPRESSO. THIS IS A FINE CHOCOLATE FOR SAMPLING ALONE AND USED IN COOKING AND BAKING. MY HUSBAND AND I ALSO TRIED "GREEN & BLACK'S" WHITE CHOCOLATE WHICH WE FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY TERRIFIC ALSO. THIS IS A "GROWN-UP" CHOCOLATE FOR A MORE REFINED EXPERIENCE. ENJOY!
