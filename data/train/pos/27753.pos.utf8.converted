Quite honestly I did not believe you could get quality "instant" Indian fare.  Amazon's special pricing me decide to try three cases, the Chana Masala, Paneer and Taka Dal.  There are two plastic bags, one rice, the other the sauce. I had no trouble heating them to boiling hot in my small microwave.  Truly delicious, spicy which should appeal to those with leanings towards Mexican or Sezchaun Chinese.  The only negative and diabetics beware, a single serving of any these three may provide 100 grams of carbs or more!
