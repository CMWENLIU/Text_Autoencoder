Okay, maybe not a "must own" unless you are a die hard fan of the series but I am so I just had to have this!!! I first saw them at Hot Topic and was a little sad that they were $25 for only four bottles, but in all honesty these are pretty big bottles and very, idk how to describe it properly, "Solid"?? Very durable product. I mostly wanted them just for fanboy sake, I didn't really care what it tasted like. But I did open one bottle, gave two away to my friends who are big fans. And I kept one unopened bottle for display. The flavor of the drink to me is a little odd, I am very surprised that they picked an Orange flavor instead of Strawberry or Cherry since the drink is supposed to be red like blood. All in all its decent, I couldn't drink it as if it was soda or anything but I will take an occasional sip from time to time. But like I said I mostly wanted these just to have since Im such a huge fan of the show so anyone else who is the same should definitely pick these up!!!
