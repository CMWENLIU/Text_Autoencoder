I love this company! Their products are always fresh and delicious. The hemp seeds are wonderful and versatile, and I make all kinds of recipes with them. I like buying the big bucket of their hemp seeds because I use them in shakes, smoothies, eaten plain, added to trail mix, sprinkled on salad, and I even make many Raw vegan desserts, soups, and pates with them. I keep them stored in the freezer for extra freshness. This super food's nutrient profile is awesome... highly digestible complete protein, essential fatty acids in a great ratio, iron, calcium, vitamin E, zinc, chlorophyll, and other nutrients.<br /><br />Just the other day I created a Raw Vegan Frozen Banana Protein Shake by blending 1 cup water, 3 sm-med frozen bananas (chopped), 1 Tablespoon raw carob (optional), 2 Tablespoons Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seeds, and 4 Tablespoons Manitoba Harvest Protein Powder. It was so yummy that I made a second one in the same day and I'm getting ready to make another right now.
