This REALLY is great coffee!  It's an instant, (so it's easy to make),<br />and freeze-dried, (superiour instant coffee).  But it TASTES so much<br />better than other freeze-dried coffees I've tried....even 100% Colum-<br />bian bean instant freeze-dried coffees!<br /><br />By mistake, I left a jar out on the counter all night.  I've been told that one must put ALL coffee in the refrigerator, or it will turn<br />rancid.  Well --even without additives or preservatives of any kind -- my jar of Taster's Choice was still good in the morning!<br /><br />It used to come in a glass jar....which I preferred.  However, the new<br />plastic jar has been improved since its introduction, and now is MUCH<br />easier to open and close!  (Thanks, Nestle....I was almost beginning to toy with the idea of getting a sledge hammer to open the first plastic<br />jar opening you introduced....thank goodness you've changed it!)<br /><br />Now, with an easy-open, easy-close jar, and wonderful, just-right coffee<br />within, (not too strong, not too weak)...you can get a perfect cup of<br />coffee in an instant -- with Taster's Choice instant!  It sure is MY choice!
