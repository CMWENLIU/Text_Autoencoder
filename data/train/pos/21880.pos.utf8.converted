Not all coconut oil is created equal in my eyes. I've tried several brands, and for whatever reason, some smell better than others. This one smells outstanding--a mild sweet coconut scent (as opposed to some that almost have a more savory, toasted coconut flake scent). And at less than $13, the price point is very decent. This is the second time I've tried this brand of coconut oil, and I continue to be satisfied with it. I don't keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I use coconut oil for my skin on a daily basis, I also take a spoon of it each morning, and I use it to cook certain dishes.<br /><br />For those of you who have never used coconut oil, keep in mind that it's liquid when it's warm, and it solidifies when the temperature dips below 76 degrees Fahrenheit. So don't tilt your jar sideways on a warm day, because the liquidy oil will spill out; and don't be surprised when you open your jar on a slightly cooler day and see a solid white mass!<br /><br />Because it is in a jar as opposed to a bottle, I recommend using a clean spoon to take out what you need (as opposed to your hands) so that you keep the contents of your jar as clean and bacteria-free as possible. If you do put your hands in the jar to scoop out oil, make sure you wash them with soap first, and dry them thoroughly before putting your fingers inside so that you don't contaminate the oil.
