When I used to see the TV ad for Kashi Golean cereal,I thought the name was strange & that I would never eat it 'cause maybe it would be filled with twigs & other birdseed-like ingredients. Boy,was I ever wrong. I love it! It's crunchy & flavorful, but not too sweet. I also like the little almond slivers included. The taste & texture of this cereal reminds me a little of grapenuts. I eat it as a snack mostly without milk. I've even got my Mom turned on to it as she likes crunchy stuff too. I think what I will do next is soak it in a little soymilk just to soften it some & then top plain vanilla ice cream with it (without the soymilk). That's one way I use grapenuts too. Anyway, try Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! Cereal,Honey Almond Flax, you will enjoy it!
