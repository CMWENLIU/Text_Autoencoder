I first purchased Colavita oil a few years ago out of pure desperation and lucky.  Ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?  Well my wife and I were having one of those at the time.  We had guests coming over for dinner, things were running late and as is our luck, we found we were completely out of olive oil.  We use olive oil a lot, but it was an odd occurrence.  Anyway, I rushed to a local grocery story...we were living in Virginia at the time, and being in a bit of a hurry, I grabbed the first can I came to.  This happened to be Colavita.  This was a very lucky break on my part.<br /><br />Now I cannot look you in the eye and tell you that this oil in anyway is as good as some of the premium oils we have used in the past and still use.  But what I can tell you is that for oil that is classified as a "grocery store oil," this is very nice stuff.  We still use it.  Now there are certain considerations to be noted here.  I have looked over some of the reviews and feel a need to have my little say.<br /><br />First, any olive oil that is old will taste rancid and simply will not cook well.  The same hold true for an oil that is not stored correctly.  If you use a lot of olive oil in your cooking, then you should buy a lot.  If you use it less often, then buying in bulk, or in a large amount is a sheer waste of money. This stuff will go bad on you quicker than you think.  And for goodness sakes don't store it in a clear container...that is not a good idea!<br /><br />Secondly, I noted that Cook's Illustrated recently proclaimed that "all supermarket brands" of olive oil where horrid.  While there may be some truth to this on some level, I must admit when I saw this, the first thing that flashed through my mind was "Aaaah, snob patrol in action again, slamming it to the unwashed masses."  Personally I put about as much validity in this type of report as I did in the old Play B*y magazine article from back in the early 70s that proclaimed your kidneys and liver would drop out of place if you were a runner, and that you should stop running as it was bad for your health...yeah, like I trust my health to an article like that.  Folks, you have to consider the source. Your top cooking publications are good, don't take me wrong, but a big part of their appeal is to appeal to the bit of snob that is in all of us...they write stuff like this to sell their publication and the products featured there and to make  you feel good about yourself when you make an outlandish purchase.<br /><br />Anyway, we have found this Colavita oil to be quite adequate for most use.  We do use it for cooking and it gives off a very nice nutty/earthy aroma.  It is light enough to use on most of the salad dressings we make, and we do use it extensively in the various vinaigrette and herb soaks we concoct.  I will say that we do not buy this in large quantities as you can purchase it in a very nice attractive little bottle of 17 ounces...Actually we buy it two bottles at a time, always using the older bottle first and then rotating.<br /><br />This certainly in not the only oil we use, but for everyday use we find that the quality you are getting for the price simply cannot be beat.  Not that I would ever do it, but I dare say that you could prepare a nice salad dressing with this product and tell your guests that you used some of the "really good and really expensive stuff," and that 9 out of ten would buy off on that statement.  Now don't do this because if your luck is like mine, the first one you told that to would the that one in ten I am talking about...embarrassing!<br /><br />This is good oil that will not take your last dollar to purchase.  I recommend it highly. I am comparing it to like oils in this price range, so I am giving it five stars.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
