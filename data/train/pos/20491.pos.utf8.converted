I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing.<br />I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc.<br />Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference.<br />To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea.  I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way.  I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do.
