Made it without the oil, only cuz there was none in the house...used one extra tbsp of water with the 1/4 cup mix one egg and 1/4 cup water...pancakes came out fluffy and delish...not heavy like usual pancakes.  Used Natures Hollow sf syrup and Smart Balance butter...gosh, it was a great breakfast.  Looking forward to tomorrow and making waffles.  How fun is this...and you call it a diet?  Wow!
