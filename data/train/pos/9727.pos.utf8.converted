This is the best price anywhere, unless you're buying it in 25- or 50-pound bags. I parted ways with refined sugar a long time ago, and since raw honey doesn't suit every recipe for which sweetness is called, Sucanat fills the gap beautifully. I've been testing ice cream recipes and it really does contribute a rich, caramel flavour to every blend. None of us has noticed the typical sugar highs and lows with this product, but perhaps that is due at least in part to always accompanying it with plenty of good fats.<br /><br />One caveat, though, and it is absolutely not a strike against this product:  it won't make traditional caramel! Be forewarned. When heated and melted, it becomes molasses. I happen to like the bitter, smoky taste, but it didn't really suit the recipe. I'll just stick with its natural caramel qualities from now on.<br /><br />This small issue aside, it is a delicious, rich-tasting and high-quality product that will contribute a deep, full, warm taste and not just direct sweetness, to whatever you're cooking.
