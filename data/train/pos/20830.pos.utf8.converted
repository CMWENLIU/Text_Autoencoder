As a life-long pet caregiver, I have preached and practiced one of four rules for having and protecting animals: always feed animals the very best in nutrition that you can afford. The other three rules are: annual veterinary check-ups (semi-annual for senior pets), regular grooming, and frequent personal affection.<br /><br />After extensive researching of available high-end treats for my senior Cavalier King Charles spaniel Rennea, we (my dog and I) have selected Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance all-natural wheat-free/gluten-free Healthy Bones For Small Dogs as her exclusive dog treat. This very affordable exceptional product is now available in several flavors, though Rennea's favorite is the Turkey Oatmeal Cranberry treat. I unconditionally recommend this product for any dog who prefers (and demands) the very best treat for nutritional value from all natural limited ingredients and for taste that will keep any dog begging for more. Thanks to Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance and to Amazon.com for making this product available.
