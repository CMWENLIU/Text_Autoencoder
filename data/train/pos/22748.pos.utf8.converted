I love meat. All kinds. From sushi to chicken gizzards, I love it. I tried haggis sausage at a RenFair and wanted to try more. Unfortunately, it's difficult to come by in Seattle. (I know about the British Pantry in Redmond, but that's an hour drive for me). I found this stuff and tried a can. I now know I LOVE haggis. For those who aren't familiar with it... it's kind of like corned beef hash, only with oats instead of potatoes and lamb liver/heart instead of corned beef. It's got a strong taste, but I like that. My girlfriend even liked it on crackers. If you don't have the ability to get traditional haggis where you live, Stahley's Scottish Haggis is a worthy substitute.
