Both our cats absolutely love Evolution kibble. We mix it up with Red Star nutritional yeast and water and they love it even more. They've actually torn open the bag to get to it, and when they hear me getting it ready they come running. It's vegan, so it contains no slaughterhouse by-products, euthanasia solution, carcinogens, or dead animals. Yay!
