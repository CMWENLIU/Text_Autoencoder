This is the first protien powder I found.  I thought it was OK.  I tried others, they did not dissolve as well, had more gunk in them I didn't need, and tasted bad.  Really, you can drink it with just water.  It tastes like milk, mostly.  Easy to get used to.  I usually put it in milk.<br /><br />Another thing, this is not just for bodybuilding.  I had a nagging shoulder injury for months, after I started taking extra protien, it healed rapidly.  It really does make a difference for soft tissue injuries.<br /><br />I also find that it kills my appetite.  It's 100 calories (180 with milk), but I don't feel like eating anything else for hours.<br /><br />Check the nutrition info, and how well it dissolves; this is the only choice.
