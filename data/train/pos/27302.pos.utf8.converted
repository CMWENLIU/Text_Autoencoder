This is the best shredded wheat I have ever eaten.  It has no additives, which makes it important to eat prior to the date impressed on the top of the box.  This also makes ordering this product through Amazon's subscription service ideal, because on each order I have received, the imprint date is at least 4 months in advance.<br /><br />The bisquits are round like little hay bales and kind of crinkly. This is especially good because they provide a crunchy oral satisfaction--if you don't let them sit in the skim milk too long. This is a personal preference. For those who like soft cereal, the flavor is just as good, if the bisquits sit a little longer in the milk. And by the way, I use no sugar and the flavor is excellent. They are especially filling for the low calories involved.  In fact, they give satisfaction on many levels.<br /><br />I have given boxes of them to my cardiologist, because they are so wonderful.  They are perfect, for eating a healthy diet;no additives as well as providing that satisfying crunch.  I hope I have made clear, they are not like any shredded wheat I have previously eaten.  My daughter introduced them to me, and I pray Barbara's continued production. The company also makes bite size bisquits, which I am sure are just as good.  I happen to much prefer the crinkly little bales.Yummy!
