I have a large family with seven people and 4 of us are unable to eat gluten. This bread mix is wonderful. I recently bought a used bread maker for $15.00 and have been making our bread. The bread is a breeze to make in the machine. I make bread twice a day and it only takes a couple of minutes to add the ingredients. It is delicious - tastes very much like regular bread. It is also convenient, since I start a loaf an night before I go to bed and one first thing in the morning we always have fresh, yummy bread.
