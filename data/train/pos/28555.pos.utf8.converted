I'm a pretty serious tea drinker, and I've had all sorts of tea balls, strainers, teapots, etc. and been frustrated with most of them.  So many are cute but not really functional.  I bought a few of these "Ultimates" in a gift shop in England because they looked ideal, and brought them home for gifts.  Soon I was down to my last one, and having used and loved it, I was loathe to part with it, even for a very good friend.  =)  I tried to get more through a friend in England but she couldn't find them.<br /><br />Then, while visiting another friend in Illinois, we went to a tea shop that had great selection, and there was my infuser, along with many others!  I had forgotten what it was called, which is what made it hard to find more, but now I've kept the box and made a special note of the name.<br /><br />The long rambling story is just to convince you I'm not a casual user; I really believe in this infuser!  The wide "handles" on top allow it to fit all cups except a really gigantic mug, the tea leaves are able to circulate freely within the roomy interior, the cover keeps your tea molecules contained as the tea steeps (just like a teapot) and instantly turns into a drip tray when you lift the infuser out of the cup (give it a quick swirl first), and it's a breeze to clean: just bang the leaves out into the wastebasket, turn it upside down under the faucet, and give it a quick rinse.<br /><br />I've never had the problem of tea leaves sticking to the mesh folds, so I respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer's 3-star rating.  I've wasted far more time trying to get tea leaves out of various other designs.  My one remaining Ultimate does gradually get stained, but a short soak in a light bleach solution takes care of that (as I do when my teapots get stained).<br /><br />This is the best infuser so far...after at least 20 years of tea drinking!
