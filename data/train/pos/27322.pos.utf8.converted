I grew up on grits, they were easy to find in Colorado but after moving to California they got harder to find. What a wonderful breakfast  with added cheese,crumbled bacon or sausage, very hardy meal. also good when you are sick and just need something warm and calm in your tummy. thank goodness I checked Amazon, please continue to carry this product, its the best.
