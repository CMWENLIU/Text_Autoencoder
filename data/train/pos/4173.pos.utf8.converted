To everyone crying about the salt content:<br /><br />If you look at the nutrition facts and do the math you'll find the salt content of pappy's seasoning is only about 24% (290 mg of salt per 1.2 g serving size). one of the most common dry rub methods called the 8-3-1-1 formula uses 3 parts salt. that is equivalent to about 23% salt in the rub mix. Based on those numbers it is apparent that pappy's is right in line with traditional dry seasoning recipes.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite seasonings for chicken and beef and I suggest that the lower scoring reviews be disregarded when considering purchasing this product.
