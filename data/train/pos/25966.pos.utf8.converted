My kids eat LOTS of peanut butter! After finding out how much hydrogenized fat is ADDED to regular peanut butter, I quickly switched to Smuckers. We eat it so fast, that we only need to stir it after the jar is opened for the first time (I buy 2 jars a week). My whole family loves the taste of it, and it makes the BEST peanut butter cookies EVER!!!!!!!!
