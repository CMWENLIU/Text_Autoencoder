I'm not an expert on prunes, in fact I can't remember the last time I bought or ate any.  But this product made a prune lover out of me.  They are moist and sweet but not overly.  A word of caution, beware of small bits of pit, so far it hasn't been common place, but boy does it ever put a halt to your chewing when you do bite down on a piece.  So far no lost fillings but sure gave me a fright, chewing more slowing now.
