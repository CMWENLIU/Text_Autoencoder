Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Not overly spicy for chili, but still some bite. Comparable to medium hot salsa. Lower sodium means more prominent bean flavor. Fantastic over rice or with tortilla chips. Wonderful vegan taco filling. If you like spicy try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1EO78">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Spicy Chili, 14.7-Ounce Can (Pack of 12)</a>. Six star company. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.
