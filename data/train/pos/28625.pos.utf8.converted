We were turned on to this product by my husband's cousin and we just love it!!!  It is a great substitute (1 to 1) for regular white sugar, although it does have a bit of a different taste...but nothing that is noticable in recipes.  After using this for just a week or so we can hardly stand to eat things made with white sugar!  Its amazing how fast that happens!  I would say buy this!!!
