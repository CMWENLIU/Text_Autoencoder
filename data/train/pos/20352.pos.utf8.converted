Every year, we do a gift exchange for the holidays and I knew this was perfect for the person I drew. Really. It's a 4.5lb gummy bear going to a 14yo guy. What could be better? He can eat it, massacre it, share it with friends, or find a way to preserve it and turn it into a lamp or something.<br /><br />I only wish that I had chosen the 3 pack of large gummy bears (smaller than this; 3 for same price) off the company site so that he could eat one, massacre one, and keep the other. Or whatever he wanted to do. :]
