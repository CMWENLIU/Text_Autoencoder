These were exactly what I have come to expect from Starburst. The only thing I'd critique is that it seems that they come with a lot more strawberry flavor than anything else (I am sure this intentional by the makers.) and it's my least favorite. Each one is individually wrapped and the bag itself is a zip-close bag for double freshness. If you eat a handful a day, one bag will last you for quite a while! And, you get two bags with this deal so you could even share some with your nieces and nephews. :)
