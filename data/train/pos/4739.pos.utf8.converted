I'm new to Larabars.  I'm a bit of a junk-food junkie, and figured I should start trying to clean up my act by making healthier choices when snacking.  These are just fantastic!  They taste so good -- and not just good for health-food, but good, period -- and are really energizing.  I plan on trying out all the different varieties of Larabar.
