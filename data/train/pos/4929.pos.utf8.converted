The Spicy Thai Tuna is fantastic.  It packs just enough heat to get your attention.  I like it in pasta based salads.  It adds a bit of heat.  Mixed with chopped cooked eggs, its great in sandwiches and added to your favorite garden salad,it is quite tasty.  Add a can into your tuna casserole, and see how it kicks up your dish!  The other two flavors are OK; nothing wrong, but if you like a touch of Thai, you will like this tuna.
