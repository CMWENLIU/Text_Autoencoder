Tamarind paste has not been a staple in my pantry -- until I discovered what a difference it can make in my cooking.  I created a marvelous Pad Thai sauce, simply by using this paste (and a few other ingredients).<br /><br />For all its goodness, I have to say that you've got to have a little faith in order to put something like this in a sauce.  It resembles nothing so much as road tar, black, gooey, utterly yucky-looking.  But do give it a shot -- its worth your time and effort.<br /><br />By the way, I bought the 6-pack.  That's a lot of tamarind paste, more, in fact, that I can use in this lifetime.  I'm sharing bottles with friends and relatives.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy oriental cooking.
