We have been producing our own family sausages and weiners for many years.  There is nothing like stuffing your own sausages with a special family recipe even when the recipe isn't that good to begin with.  These sheep casings are very handy and easy to use.  Just follow the directions and take your time.  Your family too can enjoy delectable homemade sausage and weiners.
