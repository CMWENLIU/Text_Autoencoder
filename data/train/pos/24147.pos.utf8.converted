I love this water.  It's liquid gold.<br /><br />I bought ten cases a year ago and have been giving bottles of Trivedi Water as gifts to family and friends since then.  It makes a wonderful gift.<br />Each person has had their unique experience with it.<br /><br />I'm thrilled it's available on Amazon-now I can use it and share it more freely.<br /><br />I've used Trivedi Water on plants with great success.<br /><br />Most recently I started using it on my skin.  Wow.  It's clearing up acne and revitalizing my skin in a way I couldn't have imagined.<br />Truly amazing.<br /><br />And in terms of drinking Trivedi Water--the taste is indescribable. The closest I could say is that it tastes like pure water from a mountain stream--fresh, clear, and vital with a quality of softness to it.  It quenches some taste or thirst that is deeply satisfying.<br /><br />Try it.
