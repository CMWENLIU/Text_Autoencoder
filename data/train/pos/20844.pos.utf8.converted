I found the Anasazi beans to be very tasty and easy to work with. They can be cooked by boiling, on the stove top, or in a slow cooker. They are delicious by themselves or in a beef stew. They require very little salt (to my taste), are smooth in texture, have soft skins, good color and they do not generate the bloated feeling that many other legumes do.
