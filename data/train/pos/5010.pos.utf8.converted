I just got back from Thailand, and  I think I drank at least one coconut per day.  Upon my return I wanted to find something that compared to the original (it's hard to keep coconuts in the fridge!)  I thought Zico was ok, but it tasted watered down and nothing like the Thai Coconuts I was used to.  I tried Amy and Brian's on a whim at whole foods and fell in love.  It's naturally sweet, so flavorful, and I love the pulp's texture.  I was hooked.  Finding it here at an amazing price was the kicker.  I saved SO much money, which is good because I didn't think I could afford my new addiction.  Thanks for the fast, free shipping!!
