I lead a busy life & find that eating a healthy diet is not always possible, I did some research about superfoods and stumbled upon Amazing Grass Green SuperFood and thought I'd give it a try. It appealed to me because of the vitamins & minerals it contains that are good for my immune system, I mix the powder with fruit juices & use recipes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/145656790X">Superfruit Smoothies: 50 Healthy Smoothie Recipes for Weight Loss, Energy & Optimum Health</a>, a great resource for superfruits. If I don't have much time I'll just drink the powder mixed with coconut water and find that it tastes delicious, I've already tried several of the other flavors but prefer this one the best.
