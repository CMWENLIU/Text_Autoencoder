Even though I make wicked-good homemade cashew creams in my blender, I really wanted to give this a try because my homemade creams are not "whippable." I also liked the white color, which is perfect for showing off vanilla flecks or using as a canvas for natural food colorings.<br /><br />This cream tastes decadent, although it is actually fairly low in sugar. It whips nicely, and it can even make a lovely icing or cream filling for vegan treats because it sets nicely in the fridge.  I have flavored the cream with maple, vanilla, and cinnamon so far (not at the same time!), and I plan to try strawberry or other fruit flavors. Maybe even mint.<br /><br />I also love that it contains sunflower lecithin instead of soy lecithin (which quite often is genetically modified).<br /><br />Leftovers also keep well in the fridge, which is great for those of us with small households.
