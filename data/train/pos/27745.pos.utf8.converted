I was looking for a product to replace Greenies for my three year old Chinese Crested. Although Bonnie never had any serious problems with Greenies I read about dogs choking on them and I know a few dogs even died. I realize dogs can choke on any product but I began to get very nervous.<br /><br />Flossies are great! Each Flossie lasts a lot longer than an individual Greenie did and they appear to be digested better by my<br />dog.  The crude protein in Greenies states "not less than 52 per cent" and in Flossies it states Crude Protein, minimum 89.73 per cent!" It is a low fat treat that my precious "baby" loves.<br /><br />By the way, in fairness to Greenies, they have come out with a wonderful "SMART BISCUIT" that is very digestible for dogs, as well as a treat called BARX, which is a very healthy soft snack stick.<br /><br />But Flossies will last your dog a long time and Bonnie guards her's ferociously!
