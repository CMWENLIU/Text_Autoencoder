If you compare this w/ the conventional plastic juice lemons found in your grocery store or even the green bottled lemon juices, you will taste a major difference. I think it is due to the added lemon oil. My incentive to purchase this item was mainly for an economical organic lemon juice that I would enjoy and this juice exceeds my expectations. Of course I'd prefer a container such as a small glass bottle like Lakewood organic lemon juice uses but for the price difference I'll keep my fingers crossed that the plastic containers are BPA free. Another plus is Italy is highly regarded for their quality lemons and this product certainly supports that claim. Lemonade anyone?
