First of all this is a natural product that is collected from healthy food grade livestock.  So your eating a small quanity when ever you eat meat.  Secondly this enzym is very delicate and it will be broken down by the digestive system long before it could enter the blood stream intact.  Thirdly this is not used by evil meat packing companies to make franken meat. It's around $100 dollars a pound so recovering the cost would make the Franken meat cost more so what's the advantage.  Forth is it banned in Europe?  I thought some said this product is made in France.  Not to mention Europe will ban anything if enough people complain about it regaurdless of the science and if the Europeans are as misinformed and reactionary as some of the commentors on here I wouldn't be surprised if it was banned.  And finnaly wearing a dust mask when using a podwer that binds protiens together is just good sense.  A lung full of any kind of glue would be a bad thing wouldn't it?  Super glue was developed for use in surgery to close wounds where they didn't want to use stitchs.  I'm not going to breath in a fog of super glue for the same reason as I wouldn't breath this in.  My lungs work better when their not glued shut.<br /><br />Now this product is for the cook that wants to try new things, experiment, have fun.  I'm going to try it after I perfect making foams in my new N2O charger.  Eat to live don't live to eat
