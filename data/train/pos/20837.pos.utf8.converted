These beans were very tasty -- not too strong in flavor, and the skins were not overly noticeable in cooked dishes.  I made a delicious chili following a recipe from Bob's Red Mill with them.  They're also fantastic for sprouting -- even after a brief 24+ hours of soaking, just as they start to think about sprouting, they're sweet and crunchy.<br /><br />I had no problems with debris in my bag, and am very happy with the beans!
