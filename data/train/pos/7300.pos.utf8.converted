Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.
