I've had sleeping problems for years now and nothings really worked.  I refuse to try Ambien or any prescription drugs for fear of side effects.  I use to use Tylenol PM but I found myself feeling a hangover effect in the morning.  I was recommended "Dream Water" by a pharmacist in a Duane Read by my job a few months ago and I've been using it ever since.  It both relaxes me and helps me fall asleep on the nights I am laying awake counting sheep.  It tastes great unlike some of the other products I've tried, I prefer the Snoozeberry flavor myself, but the Lullaby Lemon is just as good.  Finally something that works for me!!!
