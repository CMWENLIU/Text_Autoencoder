I first heard about Lapsang Souchong while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580087450">The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide</a>, where they described the history and manufacturing process for the unique tea, as well as saying that it's strong smoky flavor had a "love it or hate it" reputation amongst tea drinkers. Well, my favorite beverage in the world is the Islay whisky Laphroaig, and I have heard those exact same terms used to describe its flavor many, many times.  I knew I had to give Lapsang Souchong a try.<br /><br />Of course, there are many Lapsang Souchong's available, and it was really just a gamble to decide which one to chose.  I wanted a loose-leaf tea, since they tend to be of superior quality to tea bags.  I had heard the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JP6H2O">Taylors of Harrogate Lapsang Souchong Loose Leaf</a> described as a "beginner's Lapsang Souchong," with a less-intense smokiness and I knew I didn't want that.  If "less-intense" was what my palette demanded I wouldn't reach for a bottle of Laphroaig!  Another reviewer recommended this China Mist product (sold under the name of their imprint company "Leaves Pure Tea") as being a good example of Lapsang Souchong.  The price and quantity were just right so this is what I picked.<br /><br />I am extraordinarily pleased with this purchase, and now am a dedicated fan of Lapsang Souchong.  The aroma is an intense smokiness, although the flavor is much more delicate.  I went with the recommended steeping time of five minutes in under-boiled water, and that seemed just about right.  If this tea is "love it or hate it," I definitely fall into the "love it" category.<br /><br />The tea comes packed in an air-tight package with an oxygen-eater insert so it is as fresh as modern technology can make it.  The zip-lock bag is re-sealable, which is nice. I can't find any details on the grade of the tea, or where is was processed but I assume for the price we are not dealing with a  top-quality first-flush product, but for something that has been smoked over pinewood for so long you don't really need the most delicate leaves!<br /><br />Aside from enjoying a glass of Lapsang Souchong, it is really wonderful for cooking.  "The Story of Tea" has a Lapsang Souchong ice cream recipe that I want to try out, and I recently used some in a soup I was making as a replacement for liquid smoke.  It turned out fantastic, with the tea lending a complex smokiness to the dish.
