Had a raccoon that would visit our deck, and rob the bird feeder.  Not that big of deal to us, in fact we liked it, but often would muddy up the deck, make a mess, and then started taking a big dump right in front of our deck door as big thank you before he/she left for the night.  (Raccoon droppings are very dangerous, and we were afraid our dog would eat it.)  Hooked the unit up to the bird feeder, and the second night we heard for the first time in our life an authentic scream of a raccoon.  (they really can scream)  So far has not returned, and we have not had any more presents left by the bandit!  (Tested it myself after I set up, and gives you a jolt, but no pain or damage.)  Would recommend for raccoons or other pests.  Very affordable, and easy to install.  I may take a picture of my setup and post later.
