These sprouting trays are simply the best. With little effort I grow a wide variety of delicious and fresh sprouts in my kitchen. The trays stack up nicely and I have six of them, one on top of the other. They require little space. Believe it or not, it's like having a small farm in the house that produces an impressive amount and array of "fresh vegatables", albeit in sprout form. The sprouts grown in these trays stay fresh and never develop an unpleasant smell. They taste crisp, are pleasant to eat and have become the mainstay in my daily intake of vegetables in my diet. I clean my trays outside with a spray nozzle attached to my garden hose. This makes cleaning quick and easy, then I rinse them in the sink with some bleach in the water to sterilize them before growing a fresh crop. The trays are foolproof and have changed the way I eat. With the price of vegetables rising in the supermarkets, I've found these trays to be a great money saver - to say nothing of the superior nutrition that eating sprouts provide. I would highly recommend them to anyone!<br /> - Chris Morton
