I am a "spicy noodles and soup" person.  If you're like me, you'll like this product.  I like to boil the noodles with high heat in more water than suggested for about 5 minutes, then add an egg (to poach in the soup) for another minute and a half.  The egg will continue to cook after you take it off from the heat.  Finish it off with some chopped scallions and/or cilantro, and you've got yourself a delicious meal for about a $1!  Sometimes I'll add a few shrimps right before I add the egg to make the soup more hearty.  You can make this your own by adding other ingredients to jazz it up, like tofu, veggies, etc.  Have fun with it.  Bon appetite!
