I am from Hawaii and crave passion fruit Lilokoi, try getting it in Kansas though :(, it's no where to be found most products that I can have shipped from Hawaii are pretty much tourist strength i.e. weak. My only other option was from another seller on Amazon for a concentrate but  it is ridiculously overpriced and then they are asking 70 dollars S/H....LOLOLOLOL that wasn't happening.  I took a gamble but being a junkie and all I am not at all disappointed it tastes great.  They shipped far sooner then they predicted the cost for S/H on 3 bottles was still the same price as it was for 1 so I ordered 3, I am going to make a wedding cake for my daughter and with the leftovers I am going to make ice shave and juice drinks. Thanks for a great transaction and product.
