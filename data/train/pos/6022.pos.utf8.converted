All of your yeast breads will be improved by using gluten.  I add two teaspoons for a one pound loaf.  Even if you use bread flour add the gluten.  I keep mine in the freezer because it will go rancid.  But it seems to stay good in freezer -- never had any go bad since I've been freezing it.  Caution:  if you spill some in the sink or wipe up with a wet rag you have a huge sticky mess.  Try not to spill it.
