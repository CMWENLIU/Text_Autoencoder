We just received this the other day and we had no issues with any packing or anything.  None of the cans were dented, and since my cats CAN'T talk they were not able to tell me if they liked this or not but since they scarfed the food down I am assuming so.<br /><br />For those people who say their cats didn't like the food, try switching the variety up on them, we order 3 different variety boxes, so that is 24 different flavors of food.  Cats do get bored of the same food over and over just like people.
