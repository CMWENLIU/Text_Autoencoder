OK. I don't write many reviews but just had to on this one. I ordered the Choc and Choc PB because I just HAD to try it. I LOVE ice cream but I'm also trying to lose weight and a serving of regular ice cream just doesn't get it. I will admit, the first time I tried it, I wasn't thrilled. It was icy and the flavor didn't do much for me. Then I read a review that said you should let it sit at room temp for a while so that it softens some. OMG!!! What a difference!!! Creamy, creamy, creamy. All of the icyness goes away and it's so smooth and creamy I was amazed. I've gone through 3 of the pints now and I like it more each time I eat it. Maybe it's an acquired taste or maybe it's that going in I KNEW it wasn't going to taste like real ice cream (really, how could it?) but I was looking more for the texture and coldness of ice cream, not necessarily the flavor. One thing I do if I want it a little sweeter is I sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of PB2 (powdered peanut butter - GREAT STUFF!!!! and it's sold on Amazon) on the top and mix it in. It sweetens it just enough and it only adds about 20 calories and lots of PB flavor so it's worth it. I could also never eat a whole pint of this at one time. After eating about a 1/3 of the pint I feel stuffed. I'll definitely be buying this again!!!
