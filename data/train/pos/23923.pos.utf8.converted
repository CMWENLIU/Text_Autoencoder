I'm on a low-carb diet where, once a week, there's a binge day where I'm allowed to overeat from dusk till dawn.  The morning after I binge, I don't feel lousy, but not the best, either.  Anyway, I picked this black water in a health food store on a whim, as the label states that the fulvic acid and added minerals will help to normalize the body's PH level.  Zero calories, so why not give it a try?<br /><br />It really made me feel better, like I didn't even binge the day before.  Good stuff!  As for the taste, it's very much like plain water.  A very faint taste, much like very weak coffee.  Imagine a cup of water, and you put a couple tiny pinches of instant coffee.  Something like that.  I'm buying more of this today and having a bottle a day!<br /><br />When you drink the water, the words "WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF WATER" appear on the bottle (the words are black so you can't see it when it's still full).  Nice touch!<br /><br />Anyway, if you try a bottle of this, give it a try when you have a bout of indigestion, heartburn, etc.  You should feel better.
