So there are now probably over 100 products out there with Acai in it.  There are people that use it that can't even pronounce it but just want you to know they use it.  Crazy, I've been using this stuff for about 3 years now.  I think the best way to have Acai is straight up on its own.  I combine it with juice or smoothies.  I'd recommend keeping away from the multilevel marketing side to get Acai, you can benefit from it in a more pure form on its own.
