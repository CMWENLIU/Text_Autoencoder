[Corazonas Banana Walnut Oatmeal Squares -- reviewed a few weeks after buying them.]<br /><br />For years I've carried food-bars to eat when my blood sugar gets low, and for years I've had to deal with two kinds of bars:  the kind that are gooey with frosting or with chocolate chips that have melted in the heat; or the kind which are crunchy and crumbly.  In either case I'd have a mess on my fingers, or on my shirt, or on the furniture.<br /><br />These oatmeal squares are neither gooey or crumbly.  Instead they have a soft firm texture that's just what I want for travel.  (I can't say the same for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EXI9OO">CORAZONAS Oatmeal Squares, Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce bags (pack of 12)</a>, since the chocolate chips can get messy.)  They're also the right size to slip into a pocket.<br /><br />As for taste, they're pleasant, but they seem a bit bland to me, perhaps because they're low sodium.  However, taste is not my main concern when I want "fuel" to bring my blood sugar back up.
