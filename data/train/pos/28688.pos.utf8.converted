I am very pleased with Bob's Red Mill products.  They are always, fresh<br />and top grade.  I love Teff and all of the potential benefits, that I have researched. The grain is very versatile and with a little creativity much can be done with it.  I store the packs in the freezer to retain freshness and use it as needed.  It's easy to grind in a coffee grinder and to add to pancakes, breads, cookies, muffins, as a thickener for soups, etc.  My energy level goes way up when I consistantly use this product.
