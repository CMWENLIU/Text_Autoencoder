I used chestnuts from a jar or can for the Thanksgiving stuffing every year because I don't have the time to roast and peel. Other brands leave a lot of the hard black membranes on the nuts, so I still had to pick through them. Not this brand...they were very clean, fresh and made preparation that much easier.
