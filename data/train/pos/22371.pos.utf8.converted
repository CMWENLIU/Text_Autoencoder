What I received was not Roland, but HikariMiso. Not a big deal, but kinda weird. I bought this to use in a Vegan mock mac & cheese recipe, and I can tell it's going to be delicious because this stuff tastes so much like cheese it's scary. I'm a miso noob, so I don't have a lot to say beyond that. :D<br /><br />UPDATE: I wasn't sure how white miso is supposed to look, but I've been checking out images online, and what I got is a dark red color, despite the packaging claim that it is white. It doesn't look anything like the white miso images I've seen (light yellow color). Is it spoiled? I called Amazon and they are going to send me a replacement. I'll update again, when I receive it.
