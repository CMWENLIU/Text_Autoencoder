I use to take valarian root pill before I went to bed, but always felt it was a little too sedating. With this tea, it's a lot milder (the differance is like a Lullaby vs. a sledge hammer). It also has a nice aroma, bouquet, and flavor. I like to mix this with blueberry, or (when I'm under the weather) Echenacia tea (Celestials wellness tea).<br /><br />One word of warning. If you're on any medications for anxiety, depression, etc., you may want to stick with regular Sleepytime.
