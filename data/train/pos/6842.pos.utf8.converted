I have tried every type of pre-made gluten free bread AND every mix....also have made my own mixes. While some turned out ok...some 'edible', none of them had the taste I craved. Udi's is THE ONE! I actually ate the slices right out of the bag. My sons also love this bread. I hope Amazon can somehow get us a subscribe and save! They also have the best muffins and pizza crusts. My local Hy-Vee stores carry this item, they also make a ready to bake pizza on the Udi's crust. This Artisan baker has opened a whole new door to bread lovers with Celiacs!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!
