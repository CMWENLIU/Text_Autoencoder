This is the best peanut flour I've tried! It has a smooth, deep, roasted flavor that just kicks everything you put it in.<br />I've used it to make a cooked frosting (really!), and various LC bread/pancake items. It's also a great 'flouring' agent for asian-inspired pork and chicken dishes; it gives a delicious crisp coating with an amazing depth of flavor! (Especially if you are serving with a coconut, curry, or peanut sauce)<br />No one will know it's the secret ingredient and they will be surprised when you tell them. It makes a great 'breading' if you mix it with natural almond meal/flour and bake or fry your items.<br /><br />This is top-notch quality peanut flour and worth the cost. If you've ever had lesser quality peanut flour and it left a strange taste in your mouth or smelled rancid or 'not quite right' when you opened it, you have to try this! It will make a believer out of you in a real hurry!
