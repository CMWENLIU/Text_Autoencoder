I have been a pescetarian for 4 years and had been craving beef jerky so bad.  I found this product and now I eat some almost every day!  Plenty of protein and low calories.  The taste is wonderful and seasoning perfect.  Some have said it is expensive, but it is actual hunks of smoked salmon, you can't get that cheap!
