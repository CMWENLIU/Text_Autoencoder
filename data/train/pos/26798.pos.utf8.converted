These pumpkin seeds fulfill my craving for something salty. I can keep<br />I like these with the shell on them.The crispy,salty shell is what I like best.<br />I avoid using salt since I was 12,when my granny stopped using it,I followed her habit ever since.<br />This is just a delicious way to fill the salt cravings I get occasionally. This small bag is gone in one or two days.They are completely irresistible.I can't control myself to have just a few at a time.Low in calories too, they're a nice snack.<br />I haven't tried making them at home.
