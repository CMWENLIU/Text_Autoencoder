I mostly drink English Tea and it is very yummy in English Tea and is pretty good in Green Tea & Herbal Teas as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No Odor<br />It's sweet<br />Not over powering<br />No licorice-like flavor<br />No after taste<br />Zero calories<br />Gluten Free<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's obviously not sugar! But pretty good.
