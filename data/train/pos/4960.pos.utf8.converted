We have tried MANY different foods trying to find a food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but gave our dogs the proper nutrition they needed as well as the health benefits they deserved. We have a dog with super bad allergies and this food hasn't gave us any issues. We have tried california natural (couldn't digest the rice), organics (had an allergy to an ingredient) and then taste of the wild (feed over 15 lbs a week between 2 medium sized dogs!) and now we are on acana and this food is worth it! You feed less because it has higher nutrient values therefore they poop less and you save money, and our vet says they are some of the healthiest dogs they see! Acana is well worth the money, it is made from Orijen which is a very good company!
