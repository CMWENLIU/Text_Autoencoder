My wife was tired of just using vanilla extract in her recipes, and she was wanting to make some creme brulee, which requires vanilla beans. I don't know about you, but once I priced the cost of vanilla beans I told her that she would never be making creme brulee. I saw this vanilla bean paste on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. The creme brulee came out tasting just as good as at any restaurant. That was two years ago, and I've purchased many bottles of this stuff for my wife. I highly recommend it!
