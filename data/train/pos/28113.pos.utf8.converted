this is the real thing no powderized, flavored junk.<br />Lovely and aromatic fennel tea in single use bags. We drink it warm/hot with honey at night before bedtime to relax, soothe the stomach after a big meal and just because we love it. In Italy it is given to infants (lightly brewed) to calm babies with gas issues.
