As a lawyer for primiarily Italian and French clients, offering a coffee is a serious matter! My clients' response to Weavers was "amazing" and "an American roasted coffee"??? One bag a week in my office is a minimum. Very full bodied, it is immediately distinguishable from any and all US competitors. For the first time I have stopped using sugar or milk ... the coffee speaks for itself. Bravo ... Bravissimo.
