I have been eating this salt since I was a child, not this brand but Kala Namak. It is commonly served with fruit and added to lemonades and other North Indian drinks. It is ground volcanic mineral salt and has a STRONG pungent smell and taste. I will not recommend it to anyone because it is such an acquired taste but I LOVE it. I have never used it in cooking, so don't know how that works. And to the reviewer Gordino, the smell is not a result of humanity's influence but because of presence of Hydrogen Sulfide, which is naturally present in the volcanic lava.
