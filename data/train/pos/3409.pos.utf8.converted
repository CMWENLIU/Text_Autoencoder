Instead of following the recipe exactly, I used 1 1/2 cups of softened butter (instead of 1 cup of margerine), 2 eggs, and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Mix, spoon, and bake for 12 minutes; makes about 2 dozen.  I am very picky about baked goods, especially since I am only recently gluten-free, but I must admit, these are wonderful!  I'll definitely be indulging in these again and again!
