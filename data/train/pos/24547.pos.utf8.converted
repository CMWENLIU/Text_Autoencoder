Some time ago I started looking into what is in pet food and was horrified, so I decided to find better food for them.  I usually buy one bag of this brand and one bag of AvoDerm and mix them together.  I've long been a believer that cats should eat fruits and vegetables, and this food has some of both in it, so they get more variety than they would with most cat foods.<br /><br />I'm not sure of what changes the cats may have had since eating this food, but it does seem like the food lasts longer than it used to.  Whatever the case, the cats are all healthy and love this food.  One of the cats has gained a few too many pounds since she got spayed a couple years ago, so I'm going to get the reduced calorie formula for her and see if that helps.
