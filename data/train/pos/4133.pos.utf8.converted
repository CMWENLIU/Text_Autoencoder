This is by far the BEST and MOST REAL honey I have ever come across with in my lifetime. It is also one of the better tasting honeys in its category. It is indeed 100% natural raw honey, which is obviously never heated, filtered or strained; hence preserving all the natural vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants found in honey. The fact that the producers decided to add pollen, propolis, and crushed honeycomb to the jar is also brilliant. Eat two table spoons of this honey everyday, I swear your life span will go up by several years. This honey is simply incredible, what a great gift from mother nature!<br /><br />The jars are also very cute. At the cost of a very reasonable shipping price, I have received my first two jars within 36 hours in perfect shape after my order. Thanks for the super fast shipping Wee-Bee.<br /><br />Don't waste this honey by spreading it on your toast or in your tea. Eat it up all by itself from the jar whenever you feel like it. This is beyond your standard honey, which is totally spoiled by heating and filtering -thanks to the profit oriented industrialists in the honey business. Wee-Bee honey is the real deal, and it is very reasonably priced. What a piece of heaven! I can't wait to order more. Thank you Wee Bee!
