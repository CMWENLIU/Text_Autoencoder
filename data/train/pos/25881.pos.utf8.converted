Can't go wrong here.  Intense flavor and impressive ingredients.  I love 'em and everyone I give them to loves them.  Get a load of these ingredients:  organic evaporated cane juice, organic tapioca syrup (no sulfites added), non-GMO citric acid (from non-GMO sugar beet), organic & natural flavors* (watermelon, pomegranate, orange oils, lemon oils, raspberry), organic & natural colors (red cabbage, purple carrots). * = Cheeky Lemon, Wet-Face Watermelon, Pomegranate Pucker, Orange Squeeze, & upcoming Mango Tango flavor contain some amount of orange or lemon or citrus oils (0.58% of the natural flavor formula of watermelon is derived from lemon oil). Safflower oil is in the Wet-Face Watermelon and upcoming Mango Tango.  HOLY COW!!!  AND THEY'RE REALLY REALLY GOOD!
