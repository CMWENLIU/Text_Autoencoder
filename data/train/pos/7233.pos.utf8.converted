My dog LOVES this food. I bought it because I was looking for something closer to a raw diet. This is also the first food that we've seen a noticeable difference in her fur. The other foods claim that you'll feel and see a difference, but this is the first food that has actually done so! So much that the first week she was on it, I almost took her to the vet because I was concerned why her fur was getting softer. She really looks forward to meal time every day. Amazing food! Well worth the money!
