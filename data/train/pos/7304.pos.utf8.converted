I bought this item for a new mom friend because I knew how picky she was about what she eats, and now about what her new baby is going to be eating. I like the fact that you just have to press a couple of buttons, put some chopped veggies [or meat] into the blender and then walk away. When you come back, it's all done! I think there are always some questions about store bought baby food, and this makes it so easy to make your own - not a lot of pots, steamers and processors. Just this one food maker. Wish I'd had something like it when I had my kids! She loves it and tells me every week about the new recipes she's coming up with. And the baby likes it, too!
