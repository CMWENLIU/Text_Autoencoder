I had requested these for my wife who loves popcorn. She was somewhat skeptical at first because of the small bag size of the Snackwell compared to the much larger size of a regular bag of popcorn. She was watching a movie when I handed her the Snackwell. After she tried the contents of one of the bags she declared her assessment of the product to be "excellent". My only concern is that if she becomes addicted to this version of popcorn I would have to sell my pickup truck to pay for this stuff. Maybe sell the dog as well.
