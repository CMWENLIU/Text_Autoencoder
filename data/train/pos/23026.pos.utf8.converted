Okay.  I admit it. I was a little leary when I discovered Aspen had an egg nog mix.  I love their cider, but egg nog is another thing entirely.  Guess what?  It was great!  I mixed it with Lactaid and it tasted wonderful.  I can also vouch for combining the egg nog mix, milk, vanilla ice cream, and ice in a blender to make a smoothie/shake.
