Not only do these bring back memories but as I've gotten older, I've realized that they not only have that great cinnamon taste but that they are actually useful (after all, they are toothpicks). Not only are they great for a last minute touch up before going out in public, getting stubborn pieces of food from between the teeth, but they sweeten the breath. They are far above the average, run of the mill toothpick.<br /><br />  Back in high school,  they were used by some of my friends as "weight loss aids" (spicy but with no calories). Also, there was the added allure of mild risk, courting the disapproval of adults (they were actually banned in my school, probably by fearful administators who had visions of kids falling while running and getting injured by the sharp points). Parents cautioned us not to "Drive with one of those in your mouth" . They were right but we did, anyway...hey, we were teens.<br /><br />  But I digress....this is one time when taking a trip down memory lane is worth the price.
