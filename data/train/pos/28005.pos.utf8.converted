While planning a tapas dinner, we sampled an excellent roasted pork tenderloin rubbed with Ras El Hanout, a Moroccan spice mixture of over 30 spices in its most traditional version. Even our local metropolitan spice emporium didn't have it. We were delighted to locate it from this seller on Amazon. A wonderful spice mixture from a vendor who shipped promptly. I look forward to trying it added to a stew and rubbed on other meats. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U8AWHQ">Ras El Hanout 4 Oz By Zamouri Spices</a>
