I bake.  A lot.  Everyone looks for my baked goods at the holidays, but no one was expecting the chocolate cake made with Pernigotti.  Another reviewer commented about the rich aroma when the bag is opened, and she's right. The cocoa is a beautiful reddish-brown, and has the richest, most delightful smell ever. The only cocoa I found that remotely reminds me of this one is Schokinag. I found this at Williams-Sonoma, but it's priced much better here, even with shipping.  The only thing I have to say, to those who are not aware that there is a difference between Dutch Process and regular cocoa, is that you have to either watch the recipes you use it in or find a way to modify the recipe you have. I did the latter for the chocolate cake and it was wonderful. My brownies, which don't need modification came out so perfect that no one could believe that just changing the cocoa made that much of a difference.  I would definitely recommend purchasing this product, and had I not bought enough from WS to last the holidays, I would be buying this last one available now. Someone needs to snatch it up quick!
