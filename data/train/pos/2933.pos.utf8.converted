i think i've tried all teeccino flavors and except for the chai one i pretty much LOVE them all.  the maya caffe doesnt taste like coffee but it has its own charm and it did help me to quit coffee. it has the same color and thickness like dark coffee and it gives the same warming feeling that coffee does. i add a little stevia and a little coconut cream...yum. i think the vanilla nut and chocolate mint and almond amaretto are a tiny bit better. overall its way more dramatic than tea :) and its a great way to start the day without the adrenals-exhausting-coffee-stress. also i prefer to use the  coffee drip machine over the french press. overall highly recommended :)
