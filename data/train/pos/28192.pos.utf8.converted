To put is simply, it ruins you for other popcorns.<br /><br />We tried some of this on a whim from our local Costco once. It is amazing. Even though there is great care needed to pop it just the right amount of time (the sugary stuff burns quickly), it is so very, very worth it. As others have said, it's like the fresh kind made in a kettle. It's no sweet flavored popcorn, it actually has the sweet/salty coating on the popped kernels. Delicious. Much like others, I have bought and split a case with another family before. it was gone in a flash.<br /><br />In my opinion, if you're going to try and eat healthy popcorn to stave off hunger of something, buy the "healthy choice" stuff or get a hot air popper. But if you want to truly ENJOY popcorn ... this is it.
