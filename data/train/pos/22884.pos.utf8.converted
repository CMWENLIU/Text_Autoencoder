I have been a fan of Celestial Seasonings products for many years.  I have tried many of Celestial Seasonings teas and this one is one of my favorites.<br /><br />I like this tea both hot and cold.  As a hot tea the honey chamomile blends into a very soothing drink.  I enjoy honey chamomile on cold evenings or when I have had a hard day.  I keep the pot on and have several cups while I relax.<br /><br />As a cold tea it is refreshing yet soothing.  It is a great drink to sip during conversations or when reading a good book.<br /><br />This is a healthy product.  The tea is caffeine free, contains no sugar or carbohydrates.  It is sodium free and has zero calories.<br />Many Celestial Seasonings teas are herbal teas that are free of artificial ingredients.  Finally, Celestial Seasonings teas comes in a box of six that is at least $2.75 cheaper than in the grocery store.<br /><br />I highly recommend Honey Vanilla Chamomile Tea
