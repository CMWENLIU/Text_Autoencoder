I have had this machine for a few weeks now, and love it!!!  After years of the hassle of steam machines, this is such a treat!!!  It is so easy to use, and clean that I look forward to my daily cups of espresso, instead of looking at it as a chore.  I also save counter space, as I do not have to share it with a grinder, anymore.  It is also very nice to have a HOT cup, finally!!!  Every other machine just never seemed to get hot enough.  I highly recommend this machine to all!!!:)
