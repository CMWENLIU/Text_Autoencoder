Once you try Tamari why would you ever use soy sauce again. I first learned about San-J Tamari in 1987 while cooking at a vegetarian restaurant in Charlottesville Virginia. Much like soy sauce yet less salty with a richer and more subtle flavor. Fantastic for stir frying, as a condiment and as an ingredient in the preparation in sauces. Of all the brands I have sampled over the years none comes close to San-J Tamari. Simply the best.
