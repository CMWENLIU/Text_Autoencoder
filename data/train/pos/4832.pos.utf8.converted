A great tasting drink, and full of things that are good for you.  But I found that I no longer had an appetite.  I checked out the ingredient "Super Citrimax" on the Internet, and found that it is an appetite suppressant.  So I thought perhaps that's why I had lost my appetite.  I have since cut down drastically drinking Fuze, and my appetite seems to be returning slowly.  So if you want to cut down on your eating, this might be the drink for you.  But if you are already a light eater, you might want to proceed with caution.
