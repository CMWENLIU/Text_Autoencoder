I always have vegetable stock on hand for those emergencies when I don't have time to make it fresh.  Trader Joe's makes a nice little reduced sodium veggie stock that comes 10 or 12 in a box which are about a cup each when reconstituted, and I also keep those in the cupboard.<br /><br />Let me tell you, the day these More Than Gourmet Veggie-Glace Gold packs arrived at my door was a wonderful day for our household because now we can enjoy wonderful sauces that are rick and complex, more so than any I'd made in years.  Unlike traditional demi-glace which is produced by roasting bones, these are strictly meat-free, yet they are so full of the flavors of roasted vegetables, enhanced by the addition of red wine, all which have been reduced to a "gelatinous" consistency.  I've added this to a stir fry when I simply didn't feel like messing with an assortment of spices, and I've also used it in making a rich sauce with nuts for freshly made pasta.  The small size is deceiving because even though each package is a little plastic flat cup with an aluminum seal, it is as dense as would be expected from a demi-glace.  I look forward to trying the mushroom version for variety.  More Than Gourmet offers recipes on their website which I found inspiring.  I will buy this again and strongly recommend it particularly to vegetarians who enjoy complexity in flavors.
