I do not need to put salt in this rice at all. This is very good quality and it tastes great.  We have been eating White Basmati  rice and were spoiled to it fragrant aroma and delicious taste; so we were skeptical when we were encouraged to eat natural brown rice for health benefits. After cooking this and with the unison approval of my young children we are going to be eating Nishiki Brown Rice for the foreseeable future!  Nice Rice, indeed!
