Caveman Bakery has made the best tasting, yummiest, freshest gluten free, high protein cookies!  Plus they are lower in calories than most cookies.  They do indeed taste old fashioned.  For those of us sensitive to gluten, they are a<br />great alternative to being able to enjoy a cookie while staying "safe" from gluten or corn products.  I took a couple with me when we went to see Avatar on Christmas - I was very happy to have them while the guys were enjoying eating their<br />popcorn.  This item will be a staple in our home for holidays, special occasions, or going to the movies.<br /><br />I do have one big problem with these cookies.  They are so delish that I have difficulty in only eating two per day.<br /><br />A friend recently told me that she could never follow the strict anti-inflammatory diet that I do.  I told her that I know how bad I felt and it's not worth it to me not to follow it.  That's one big reason why I am so excited about these Caveman Cookies.
