.<br /><br />My wife has been a fan of wafer cookies for many years.  Recently I bought her a box of wafers from a different brand.  I hoped to  surprise her.<br /><br />My wife accepted the other cookies but explained they were not the ones she had when she was young. A disappointment for me, but she did enjoy the cookies. I wondered if  the cookies she had as a child existed anymore.  Then I encountered Biscos.<br /><br />These cookies taste good and make a pleasant snack. I enjoyed them myself, but in limited servings.<br /><br />These wafers are 140 calories a serving, according to the rating website I found. The serving size is 8 cookies - I limit myself to 4.<br />At four cookies I get 70 calories 11g of carbs, 7g of sugar and 12 mg of sodium.<br />So from a nutrition point of view, 4 of these cookies are best I have found.<br /><br />I highly recommend Biscos Sugar Wafers. They are a nice treat.
