I just got back from a trip to St. Maarten and on the table at a restaurant there was a bottle of this sauce.  It was love at first taste.  I put it on my tuna filet and was totally in hot sauce heaven.  I brought 2 bottles back with me and I am not sure they will survive the month.  I will be ordering much of this incredible sauce!
