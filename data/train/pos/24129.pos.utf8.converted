This is a very good tasting olive oil and the price is outstanding.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about how it would ship but BMA wrapped each can in thick bubble wrap and they arrived in perfect shape with no dents, leaks or damage.  In addition, I received a lightening fast order acknowledgement and  with standard shipping received the order in just a few days.<br /><br />Excellent product, excellent price and excellent customer service.  If that doesn't make for a five star rating, I don't know what would.
