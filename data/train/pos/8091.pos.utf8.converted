As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a "sugar crash" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.
