I was walking my dog and met some people with a boxer; when I pet their dog, I was wow, her coat is so soft while my dog was stiff and more brittle like; I asked them what they were feeding her and they said Taste of the Wild;  I switched my dog and her coat is just as soft now as the other dog; my dog is still suffering from some allergy itch so it didn't totally alleviate that but it has decreased and her coat is just amazing.
