I have been using this powder for over a week now. I mix it with water and ice cubes in a blender before work outs. The taste is neutral with just a hint of peppermint and quite pleasant, not grassy at all. It is a bit grainy in texture and does not dissolve very well. Some of the powder gets stuck inside the blender and the glass. That's the only draw back.<br /><br />I do feel much more energized and less hungry an hour into exercising. I have also noticed an overall increase in my energy level as well as decreased food cravings. I used to crave salt and sweets all the time. Even after a late night out having had several cocktails and little sleep I feel great whereas before I would feel sluggish, hung over and craving junk food. This is amazing and I just ordered my next month supply.
