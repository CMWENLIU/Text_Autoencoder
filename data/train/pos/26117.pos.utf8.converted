After reading about the effect soy products have on the thyroid system, I decided to replace my soy milk with coconut milk.  I have never been a big fan of coconut, so I was concerned I wouldn't like it.  I was really surprised.  I love it.  It tastes rich like whole cows milk but with a touch of coconut.
