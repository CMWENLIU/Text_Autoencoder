This product is great as usual.  Most people know callebaut chocolate so I wont elaborate on that.  HOWEVER what i will elaborate on is the seller.<br /><br />I have never ordered meltable or perishable items online that have ever came to me in any kind of usable condition.  BUT, culinary direct packaged this stuff so well that even after 5 days on a ground shipment from California to North Carolina, by the time I finally got through the packaging, the tape, the bubble pack, the ice pack, the chocolate inside was unmarred and not a single disc had even smudged the outside of the packaging.  I can NOT believe the amount of care that went into this package and the fact that even with such a small amount they took the time to provide the best product experience.
