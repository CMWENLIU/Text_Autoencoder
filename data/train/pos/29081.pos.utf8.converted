The Kahlua Flavor is one of my favorite DaVinci Sugar Free Flavored Syrup types. This was a great find for me since I am a Type 2 diabetic and really have an overpowering sweet tooth.<br /><br />We have tried quite a few of the different brands on the market, but have settled back to DaVinci since the flavors are good and they are sweetened with Splenda. Several of the other brands use Sorbitol (which my wife is slightly allergic to) or Maltitol (which causes me "gastric distress" in large quantities).<br /><br />The real test for anything sugar free is if my kids will use it, and they all like the flavor enough to go out of their way for it. We have used this in coffee and in baking with great results.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
