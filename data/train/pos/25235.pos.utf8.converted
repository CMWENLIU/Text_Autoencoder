Delicious in salads, marinades.  But the healing and natural cleansing properties of this product... wow.  A tablespoon three times a day (before meals) mixed in 4-6 oz. of water.  I've been using this for several weeks and that little patch of annoying bumpy cellulite on my inner thighs is GONE!  Go for it girls.
