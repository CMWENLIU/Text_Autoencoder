I've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories.  These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!  They are so, so, so good.  Whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate?  I have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that I am FAR from deprived!  Two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic.
