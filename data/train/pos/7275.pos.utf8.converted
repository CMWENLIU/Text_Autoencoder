Normally I buy Appel (imported) or Trader Joe's brand tinned herring, but was looking for a variety without canola oil and stumbled upon these on Amazon.  Upon ordering these, I had a tin right after I received them.  The price is right - the other varieties I was buying were slightly more expensive and usually there were few in stock at the store - maybe 1-4 cans only.  The Bar Harbor herring is great - no canola oil, tin is easy to open, and the fish is just the right texture and taste - not too smoky, not too overpowering.  These are great and I'll definitely be reordering!
