1 tablespoon has 3 grams of carbs and 2 of fiber, 1 of protein, 9 of healthy coconut fat.<br /><br />It does taste sweet to somebody who has been low-carbing or avoiding processed sweeteners for a while.  Probably it will not seem that sweet if you eat a lot of sugars regularly.  It isn't a cloying, over-powering sweetness that comes with sugar laden, refined snacks.<br /><br />The texture of the manna all by itself is a bit pasty, like peanut-butter, only slightly more so. It can have the same stick to the roof of your mouth texture as peanut butter.  The oil will separate, and the way to stir it back in is to warm the entire jar so it's all very soft, and then stir back in.<br /><br />I think it's delicious.  I like a bit spread like butter (warm slightly to spread) on a flax seed cookie I make. Sometimes I mix it into the batter of the flax seed cookie.<br />I like a dab on a sweet potato chip.<br /> It's a good 'candy' if you mix warmed manna well with a bit of ground flax seed, a few drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00142FP5I">SweetLeaf Liquid Stevia, Chocolate 2 fl oz (60 ml)</a>, and cocoa powder- drop onto waxed paper, put in fridge for the manna to harden.  Mmmm.<br /><br />Nutiva explains more about the use of their Coconut Manna on their website.
