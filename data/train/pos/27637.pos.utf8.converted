Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Hot. Spicy. Not habanero or lal mirchi level (very hot Mexican and Indian chilis,) but up there. Comparable to 'hot' at a Thai restaurant for Americans. Add more of your own favorite chilis and call the fire department. Lower sodium means more prominent bean flavor. Fantastic over rice or with tortilla chips. Wonderful vegan taco filling. Also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176EQ">Amy's Light in Sodium Organic Medium Chili, 14.7-Ounce Can (Pack of 12)</a> on the milder side. Six star company. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.
