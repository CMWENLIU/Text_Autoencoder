This is my second purchase of this product and I can attest to the fact that this is the best quality cinnamon that one could ever find, anywhere.  The taste is so far superior to regular grocery store cinnamon, you won't believe it.  Cinnamon is very good for you and I use large amounts of it on my foods and in my drinks every day.  I highly recommend this brand of subperb quality organic cinnamon.
