These are, the MOST delicious, dried cranberries we've ever bought! They are sweetened just enough, don't stick together in a lump, are just slightly juicy, have no preservatives AND taste great refrigerated! For those who are wondering, 4# just fits in a 1-gallon zip lock bag. On the box, it says a serving size is 1/3 cup and there are 45 servings. I will buy these again!
