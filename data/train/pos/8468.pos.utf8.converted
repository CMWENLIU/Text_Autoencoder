Blue Buffalo is an above average quality dog food - and I can't recommend it highly enough. For the price, it is much less expensive - and as good a quality as such overly-priced "high quality" foods as Evo and Orijen. I regularly purchase pet products from amazon.com, and was researching prices here as compared to other online petfood sources.<br /><br />That said, the pricing information that Amazon provides is misleading and FALSE.<br /><br />Note that the product on this page is a 6 lb bag.<br /><br />NEVER has a 6 lb bag been priced at $52.23!!!<br /><br />The average price for a 6 lb bag of Blue Buffalo Weight Control is around $16.00.<br /><br />If you purchase it from petfooddirect . com  you'll pay $15.39.<br /><br />A 30 lb bag isn't even $52!!<br /><br />Very false and misleading on the part of amazon to make "unfamiliar" customers think they are saving $34.24 as shown on this page.
