As a lifetime member of Weight Watchers, I know that a pan of brownies in the house can easily lead to a pan of brownies in my belly.  What I love about No Pudge is that you can make a single serving.  Directions are on the box.  I mix two tablespoons of my favorite lowfat yogurt (the BEST is Axelrod black cherry - which makes this a Black Forest brownie) with 1/4 cup No Pudge mix and pop it in the micro for two minutes. This is a double brownie.  The single brownie is too dinkie to satisfy me.  Then I slather the rest of the yogurt over the brownie.  The creamy yogurt mixes through the chewy brownie and is my hands down favorite send my belly to bed happy nighttime snack.  5 weight watchers points with the double serving and yogurt.
