This granola is delicious.  Being that it's gluten free is a bonus since it's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet.  But my family can eat whatever they want, and they couldn't stop eating it! The cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies. This is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack.
