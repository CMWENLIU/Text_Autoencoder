I can't argue with the other reviewers if the description truly labeled this as gluten free. But "graham" reflers to flour from wheat, which leads me to think one should have questioned any "gluten free" claim. This "graham" crust is delicious. It works with all of my easy crust pie recipes and has no ingredients I don't want my family to eat. It comes wrapped well and in perfect shape. My local health food store only carries this crust periodically, so I am truly grateful to Amazon for having it available to me when I need it.
