My mother taught us decades ago that this mincemeat was the ONLY one to buy -- everything else was garbage.  Many people don't think they like mincemeat, probably because they didn't try the Cross & Blackwell brand.  Everyone I've introduced it to has been quite pleased!<br /><br />It's great in pies, of course, but it's awesome spooning onto shortbread cookies (a rich treat indeed!), putting on vanilla icecream, or eating out of the jar (my private jar, of course!)
