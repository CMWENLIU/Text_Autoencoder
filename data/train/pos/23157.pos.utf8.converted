Tony the Tiger is an iconic image toward which many people of my age (49) gravitate, as our memories are peppered with visions of  childhood mornings, lingering over bowls of Sugar Frosted Flakes.  The boisterous, jovial tiger could be seen during any cartoon show invading some child's home and declaring that "THEY"RE GREAT!" to the young innocent and his well-groomsd chums.  This particular item is an exact taste match from those days packaged in modern, vacuum sealed, plastic  "bowls."  I have initiated my third order of a pack (96 bowls) of these little marvels, as my last "stash" is rapidly diminishing.<br /><br />Each small squared-off delight contains enough precious, fresh little flakes to satiate the immediate urge for cereal without the temptation to consume more than is inherent with those big boxes and their requisite large openings. Like rectangular, lip-less mouths, those open-topped, time-tested, colorful containers silently beckon the customer to ingest more, even if to just satisfy a slight, lingering want.  The portions in these little bowls are a rational alternative to that sort of intake and the attendant  weight gain risks.<br /><br />My wife also enjoys partaking of this product, and I  warrant that her mood has been all the more positively effected by our shared slurping and gulping of said product.  I might well have reported favorably upon this food were there no other benefits than a smiling spouse and happy house, so the added benefits of good taste doubly validates my analysis.<br /><br />I would also note in conclusion that I've yet to witness one of the bowls to rupture or for the cereal to other-wise suffer contamination.  We have on at least two occasions fought off assaults  of marching legions of voracious ants bent upon wholesale raiding of provisions and generally establishing permanent bases in our kitchen.  Our counterattacks were inevitably always successful, but not without severe losses of valuable, vulnerable foods.  The Frosted Flakes in each case remained sealed and untouched.  Even mice would seem to have bypassed these little mini-safes and moved on to crack easier stores of goodies (and always to trigger that "snap" in the night that brings a primordial peace of mind in knowing, as in days of yore when pioneers stalked the woods, that the night's hunt was good).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSCP2G">Kellogg's Frosted Flakes Bowls, 1-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 96)</a>
