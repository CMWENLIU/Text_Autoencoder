We have used these for years in salads. They are just the right size, easy to chew, and have a nice pecan flavor. If you refrigerate them after opening (as directed on the bag), they will taste fresh for weeks.<br /><br />Kirkland is the Costco brand. I currently buy these at my local Costco for fifteen dollars, which is less than half the current price on Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are high quality nuts, but shop for price.
