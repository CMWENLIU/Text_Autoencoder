Like many of the other reviewers, I've tried all of the premium dog foods out there. When our family hit some tough financial times, I began looking for a good food that would be a better fit with our budget. This food absolutely fits the bill.  My golden retriever mix is not crazy about it, but that doesn't bother me that much--he's a good weight, and he will eat it when he's hungry.  He's had some allergy issues in the past and I was sure this food would kick them into gear, but it didn't--after fully transitioning to this food he has not gotten itchy at all.  I'm definitely going to stick with Chicken Soup... why pay twice as much on dog food if you don't have to?
