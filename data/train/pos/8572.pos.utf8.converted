We are from England and miss one thing from back home: Heinz Baked Beans in tomato sauce. It's hard to believe that this healthy, tasty essential fodder for all occasions, made by an American firm, is not in our local supermarket. Shipping from Amazon could be pricey, so add them to an order where you get free postage. Also, they are packed loosely so the cans will be dented but the contents are fine. Yummee!!
