While I wouldn't call this a health food they are healthier than most snack foods so I don't worry as much when my kids eat a bag of these.<br /><br />The taste is a bit more mild than Cheetos so if you are hooked on cheetos these might not do.  I know when we open a bag around here no one can stop eating them until they are gone.<br /><br />Here are the nutrition facts comparing them to Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Cheese Puffs<br /><br />  Cheetos WC  Smart Puff<br />Calories 150  130<br />Fat Calories 80  60<br />Fat  9g  6g<br />Sodium  290mg  50mg<br /><br />Not a huge difference and everything else is close.  I'm sure regular cheetos would have higher numbers.
