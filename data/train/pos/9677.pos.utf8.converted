I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged.  And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.<br /><br />These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch.  I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange.  Brilliant.  I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesn't?
