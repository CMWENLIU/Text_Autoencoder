One of the joys of having a Keurig K-cup machine is that you can make a cup of what anybody wants at anytime (providing that you have it of course).  Dark coffee, decaf, flavored coffee, green tea, English tea, herbal tea, etc.  This has really made entertaining more fun for both the guest and the host/hostess.  Of all of the drinks that I offer my guests the one that often brings smiles to their faces is hot cocoa, especially if the guest is a child.<br /><br />I have tried all of the hot cocoa k-cups that I could find: Green Mountain and Gloria Jeans hot cocoa, Timothy's White Chocolate, Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate, etc.  So far the hands-down favorite for me is this Ghiradelli mix.  As stated in the product description, this is not a K-cup but a pre-measured packet designed for Keurig brewers.  The taste is classic Ghiradelli: rich, sweet and heavy on the chocolate.  When I made a single cup of hot cocoa for a discriminating adult I reach for this one.  However, I find K-cups to be more convenient (especially when making beverages for a lot of people) and children seem to like all of them (and the sweeter the better).<br /><br />If I am serving hot chocolate to a group I will do it the traditional way but when I offer hot beverages to a guest and they are not interested in coffee or tea I am glad that I have Ghiradelli's hot cocoa on hand.  It is, so far, the best tasting hot cocoa for the Keurig brewers.
