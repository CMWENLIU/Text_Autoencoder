I love this coffee.  It makes GREAT espresso drinks, though I prefer lattes and capuccinos.  Lavazza is one of the top brands in Italy (and elsewhere in Europe, having scene their product in other countries). I have also enjoyed Rosa and the pre-ground in the black can (for stovetop espresso percolators).<br /><br />Some people reviewing this product appear to be uneducated about coffee, claiming this is NOT espresso, either because it doesn't say "espresso" on the bag or because it's not a dark roast.  The truth is "espresso" refers to a process of making a coffee beverage, not the roast or the bean itself.  A coffee bean is a coffee bean is a coffee bean.  How you roast it, grind it, send water through it, serve it or drink it is up to you.  Lavazza probably didn't put the word "espresso" on it for one of two reasons: 1) In Italy it's just assumed that if you're normal you're having espresso (probably straight); or 2) Lavazza knows that you may do whatever the heck you want with their beans as long as you keep buying them.<br /><br />Lavazza Oro is a great coffee.  I love the caramel aroma when I first open the bag of beans.  I don't usually drink straight espresso, so I can't comment on how Oro fares as a straight shot.  It seems to make a really nice crema, though that is somewhat controlled by the grind and the machine.  I have a super-automatic espresso machine, and its manufacturer actually recommends NOT using darker, oilier roasts because they may gum up the grinder or brewing apparatus. I've been drinking mainly plain lattes with this coffee, and I think they're phenomenal.  I really miss it if I'm away from home and have to settle for an overpriced, burnt alternative from a mermaid of Seattle.<br /><br />I love that Amazon will ship me four bags of Lavazza Oro every month on subscribe and save, although I've noticed the price jumping up in the past few months.  I hope the price stabilizes or drops back down.  It's currently a real value compared to another Italian espresso giant that comes in silver cans.  Those other guys make delicious coffee, but they're a little too pricey for me to justify buying regularly.
