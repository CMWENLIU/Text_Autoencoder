I stopped purchasing other brands of spaghetti because the De Cecco brand is far superior in taste and quality.<br />My local supermarket has this item for around $3.00 a box and are usually limited on supply so its wonderful purchasing this item on amazon and you cant go wrong with the price.<br />De Cecco all the way for now on!
