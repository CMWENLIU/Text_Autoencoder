There pretty much aren't any bad things to say about this tea.  I love it and drink it every morning, black with no milk or sugar.  It was a very "round", robust flavor that is invigorating and deep.<br /><br />I've found the best way to brew it is to pour the water in with the bag, let it sit for 3-5 minutes, take out the bag and let it cool for around another five minutes if you have the time.  That extra cooling time is pretty important for all Mighty Leaf teas or you miss a lof of flavor otherwise.<br /><br />It'd be nice if it was cheaper, since it costs more than anything else I've had, but it's one of those splurges I allow myself in life.  Give it a try.  If you like breakfast teas, you won't be sorry.
