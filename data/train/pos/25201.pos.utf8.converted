I do not usually write reviews unless I want to warn others about a product, but I have to make an exception with these fruit snacks. Yes, they are pricier than other brands, but I wouldn't take other brands now if you gave them to us! These fruit snacks are very fresh tasting, wonderfully soft and a true "chewy" - not a tough, pull-your-teeth-out texture. I could never give my toddler the usual fruit snacks because of the dyes, texture, and the insane amount of sugar. I love everything about these snacks and our whole family eats them!! She gets excited when she sees a pack of her gummies and I buy them on Amazon by the case! I feel confident giving her these since they contain 100% of her daily vitamin C in one small pack and are actually adding nutrition to her diet instead of a sugary snack. Can't recommend these enough - if you are on the fence and are trying to make good health decisions for your family look no further - buy a box! You won't be disappointed.
