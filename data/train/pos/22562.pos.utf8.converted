Fantastic espresso beans!  I usually drink Illy, but thought I would give this a 'shot'... and I was not disappointed! This has a slightly smokier flavor than the Illy roasts, produces a NICE crema, and is ultra smooth.<br /><br />In short, give this a try.  Highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there...
