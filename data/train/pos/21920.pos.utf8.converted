What can one say, this is the premiere moutarde. We've been using it since we brought one back from France in the 70's. It also is magnificent for any recipe that calls for mustard (forgive my French) like Caesar's Salad. And, you get to keep the pot. I personally like to put in fond memories I had of French politicians. Needless to say, the pot is still empty, but the next election may bring us something to put in there!
