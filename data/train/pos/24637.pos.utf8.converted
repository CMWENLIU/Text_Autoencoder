It is a surprising good tea at great price. The best part is its after taste, leaving a very enjoyable clean, fresh and delicate sweetness at the back of your mouth. I could feel the breath improved too.<br /><br />I work in the office and always wanted to eat some candy or cookie in the afternoon. After start drinking this tea (about a month ago), I was surprise to find out that I didn't have the same desire to eat the candy or cookie any more! What a surprise nice finding! I think it is because of its satisfying aftertaste. Each tea bag, I would say, could make two good cups of tea easily.<br /><br />I also highly recommend following FooJoy Shoumei White Tea (B0007UXIW0), FooJoy China Green Tea (B0007V1Q78) in this line.  If you like black tea, you might want to try Foojoy Dim Sum Bo Nay (B0007Y7Z8E). It is very interesting: very dark in color and you will think it would be strong. But not! it turns out to be very mild and smooth -- almost kind of roundness...
