I love keeping this on hand at all times because I never seem to get through a half gallon of buttermilk before it goes bad, but I like to have it for use in biscuits, breads, and to brine chicken before frying. This stuff is very economical and super convenient. It does require refrigeration once opened, but that's no big deal to me. I mix up batches of biscuit mix and pancake mix in advance, then just add the liquid ingredients when I need it. I can store large quantities in the freezer and whip up buttermilk pancakes for breakfast in a flash. Love it. This is a pantry staple for me.
