As you can see from others' ratings, people either love or hate it! I hope this review helps you decide which category you'd fall into...<br /><br />Its health benefits are totally loveable. Udo Erasmus, in 'Fats that Heal, Fats that Kill', rates the oils from hemp as those most beneficial to humans, surpassing even flax seed. On this recommendation alone I was favorably inclined towards Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder, and I was not disappointed. It provides steady energy, and my body feels good when I eat it.<br /><br />I find it completely palatable and enjoy smoothies with it. I personally use a Vitamix and blend 4 tablespoons of it, as recommended, into soy milk at top speed, adding half a frozen banana, and sometimes organic cocoa powder. Delicious!
