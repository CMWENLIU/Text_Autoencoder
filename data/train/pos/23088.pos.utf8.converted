I researched foods very carefully when we decided to change over, and we decided to try Natural Balance, duck and potato formula, for our 2 dogs, and our son's 2 dogs.<br /><br />We found that the pieces were not overly large, with was nice for the senior, and smaller of the 4.<br /><br />Then, we discovered that they loved it; one, and all. They wouldn't leave the bag alone, and when we tried to change them over slowly, they just picked the Natural Balance out of the bowls, leaving the old food behind.<br /><br />Even so, none experience the slightest system upset at the changeover, not even the one with the sensitive stomach, and everyone looks good, is acting well, and continues to look forward to their meals. Even the dog who has never eaten a whole bowl of food in a meal since he was a puppy is now regularly doing so.<br /><br />I can't guarantee the same results for every dog, as each is an individual, but after trying it on 4 different breeds, and age groups, I can say that I'd recommend it highly as worth a try for someone else!
