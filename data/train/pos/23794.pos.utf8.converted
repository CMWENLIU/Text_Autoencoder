After using cheesecloth AND a small mesh strainer to make soy milk I can't believe there was something like this out there all along. I went from having to strain the milk 4 times to only once. It cut the time required to make soy milk in half and less dishes required for all of the pouring back and forth. It fits perfectly on the old thermos (the plastic kind for taking water or other cold liquids not the coffee type) that is about 5-6" across and is exactly the same height. If I were using a large bowl to make the milk I would probably get the gallon bag but this one fits perfect on the top of a pitcher or thermos. The clean-up was much easier than cleaning cheesecloth as well. Nothing stuck in the bag like it does in the cheesecloth so I just dropped the mess into a bowl, rinsed the inside of the bag and hung it up on my kitchen towel hook. I would recommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />ps: It would be a great bag for rinsing sprouts as well.
