Any type of cheese from iGourmet is excellent, but this one is a big favorite.  It is not really different or smelly or weird and everybody who has tried it loves it.  We just have it on crackers with a beer or a glass of white wine.  It has just the right tanginess of chives and onion.  It is a real treat and very difficult to find in stores.  You will want to have some of this around the house for a snack or a party.
