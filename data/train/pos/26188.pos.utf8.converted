I have been using this coffee for years. French Roast is our favorite...however. the price is extremely HIGH...we paid (at the highest) $9.99 in East Hampton, NY in the month of August.  the regular price at Hannaford Supermarkets in NYS is approx. $6.00...... Price Chopper has it on sale quite often @ $5.99 with a special iSave coupon and you then get it for $4.99.<br />the size of this is 34.5 oz.<br /><br />How come it is soooo high at Amazon????
