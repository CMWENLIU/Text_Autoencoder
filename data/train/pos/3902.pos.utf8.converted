Fructose is fructose. It's a simple sugar found in plants, both fruits and vegetables. Buying fructose is like buying salt. Brand names don't matter much. I'm sure there are conspiracy theories about fructose, but as an old woman I'm tired of hearing "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!"  First it's "Don't eat butter." Then it's "Butter is good for you." Etc. Etc.<br /><br />Getting away from health issues, I have to say that if you want to buy fructose, this Amazon item is a bargain.  You get a LOT of fructose for the money. I think it's less expensive, pound for pound, that the fructose I get from Publix.
