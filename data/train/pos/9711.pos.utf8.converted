I was about 14 years old when I first tried Li Hing Mui powder.  I grew up in Oregon and had never heard of it but my best friend was from Hawaii and introduced the powder to me.  Dipping nectarine slices in the powder is an excellent snack - very tasteful and surprising for first timers.  I have been searching for the powder locally for about 10 years but have not been able to find it.  Believe me, you HAVE TO try Li Hing Mui - it's unlike anything you have ever tasted before in your life.
