I only ordered the Rainforest Espresso because Midnight Magic was out of stock at the time, and I am glad I tried it.  I haven't decided which I prefer out of those 2 yet, but I love the Rainforest Espresso.  Very rich, delicious flavor, but very smooth and not bitter.<br /><br />This has quickly entered my top three K-cups along with Midnight Magic and Gloria Jeans Black Gold Extra Bold (which all have similar characteristics, at least to me...).  I still need to try some of the Coffee People flavors, but I prefer the three K-cups above over CP Black Tiger.  Rainforest Espresso will definitely be kept around in our house.
