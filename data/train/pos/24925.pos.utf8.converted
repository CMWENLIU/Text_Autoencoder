Let's just get this out of the way right up front.  You don't tug on Superman's cape.  You don't spit into the wind.  You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger and you don't mess around with other brands of chili, Jim!<br /><br />Wolf Brand chili is head and shoulders above all other brands of canned chili and that's a fact.  If you do not want to become addicted to it and forget that any other variety exists then don't try it.  You can nitpick the ingredients, the regional availability and/or the price if you want but at the end of the day, you are just not going to find another ready to eat chili from a store shelf that is this delicious.<br /><br />Also, remember that it's just NOT <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM3G">Peggy</a>'s world famous Frito Pie without the Wolf Brand!
