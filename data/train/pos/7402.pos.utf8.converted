What everyone who loves these needs to know is that if you have a Trader Joe's in the neighborhood and they don't stock this, or stock it intermittently, they will be quite happy to order a supply for you. That's what one of the helpful crew members at our local TJs told me, and it is definitely true. Now I have enough for a month or two (30 packages, purchased at the TJ price of $.99 each) and when I run out, I can order more.
