Add from one to four tablespoons of gluten to a bread recipe to make it reach new heights, especially for whole grains or for rye or other low-gluten flours. Hodgson Mill is a producer of quality ingredients for reasonable prices, and the package size is practical for most home bakers. I emptied one package into an airtight container for current use and put the other boxes in the freezer to maintain freshness, but that was probably more cautious than necessary. It will keep for quite some time on the pantry shelf.
