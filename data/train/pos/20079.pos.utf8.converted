I received the pet studio mission diner in cherry. I have the two quart.<br />This is a great item to have for your dogs. It's much better for them to eat/drink from elevated dishes...aides in digestion and takes stress off the body. It is as nice as I hoped it would be. I am very pleased. The cherry wood gives it a taseful, classic look.<br />If you are considering getting an elevated diner, this one is sure to please!<br /><br /> [ASIN:B001TK4ENE Pet Studio Mission Diner 2 Quart Cherry]]
