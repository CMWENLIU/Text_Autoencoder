I really like this product.  And I use it as a coffee substitute.  Since I usually drink Japanese coffee or Vietnamese coffees, they are very strong coffees, and I had a few weeks of discomfort going off coffee.<br /><br />The roastaroma is a really good coffee substitute. I like it very much, and if I let it brew for 8 minutes, I get a nice strong mug. To me, it tasted better than Postum.<br /><br />I'm really happy that Celestial Seasonings make this :-)
