We have a cat that develops urinary stones easily, and must also be on a low purine diet.  The Science Diet food suggested by the vet resulted in dull, dry coats, vomiting, and lethargic behavior, even after a lenghty adjustment period.<br /><br />Weruva foods to the rescue!  Their Paw Lickin' Chicken, Grandma's Chicken Soup, and Peking Duck flavors meet our dietary needs perfectly, with much healthier, higher quality ingredients than the SD food.<br /><br />These are very "soupy" foods, with lots of liquid in the can, ideal for cats who may not stay well hydrated otherwise.  I was afraid that our cats would not eat the vegetable chunks, but they surprised me by not only eating them, but picking them out to eat first!<br /><br />The shredded chicken seems to be very high quality but the texture seems a little hard for them to manage sometimes.  At first, they sometimes left chicken on the plate.  Now, they seem more used to it and eat it more easily.<br /><br />After trying a number of different high end canned products, these are our cats' favorites, paws down! After several months on the food, they seem very healthy, with shiny coats, healthy-looking eyes, and lots of energy.
