Chocolate milk is one of my special treats that I don't usually buy very often.  I saw these on an Amazon special and decided to pick them up partly because I love chocolate milk and partly because my friend's parents own a dairy farm that is part of the Organic Valley co-op.  I like knowing that my purchase is helping the family owned farms in our country--and specifically that I know one of those families.<br /><br />The milk is awesome!  It is sweet, but not overly sweet.  I've also tried Horizon, which I find to be a little too sweet compared to OV.  The expiration date was 3-4 months in the future on the box I received, so it was fresh.  I now have it on Subscribe & Save along with the plain 1% milk from OV.  They are nice to have when I need a quick pick-me-up and I'm also pregnant and in need of plenty of calcium, so these work great.
