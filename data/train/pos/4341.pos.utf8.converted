Rarely am I an advocate for eating healthy foods. You'll often find me devouring a whole pizza by myself or inhaling several pounds of meat at the local Famous Daves. And when it comes cereal, the whole "healthy" section just seems like wasted space to me. I'd sooner eat 2 or 3 boxes of Lucky Charms in a week over a box of Total. All this was true until I was introduced to a fine creation known as Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong. Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries hasn't changed my opinons on healthy cereals. In fact, original Honey Bunches of Oats is nothing more than some corn flakes and oat clusters that taste completely unoriginal. And unoriginallity really doesn't taste so great. Enter strawberries. Those old corn flakes and oat clusters remain here but added in are strawberries. Now, you're probably thinking the same as I did when I first saw the box. "Uhh, probably just some crappy strawberry flavoring smeared on the flakes..." This is not the case. Included in this cereal are REAL dried strawberry slices. Whoever thought of putting them inside the cereal should be given medal. They take the cereal from space-wasting-unoriginal-tasting trash to something that actually tastes GOOD... and it's healthy! The only downside to this cereal is that it's not as resilient when soaked in milk as other cereals. It will get soggy if you don't eat fast enough, but that's never really a problem for me.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan of tooth rotting, chest pain inducing cereals, such as myself, you could definitely try this out. I did and I'm not ashamed to say that Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Strawberries has become part of my regular cereal lineup.
