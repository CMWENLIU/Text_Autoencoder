I love my AeroGarden.  I don't have room in my kitchen for it, so it lives in the foyer between the upstairs bedrooms, so I never miss it going up or down the stairs.  Had great success with salad greens and am now growing French herbs.  Can't wait to try them.  Would recommend this device to anyone who either likes to garden or likes to cook.  It would have been extremely handy during all the winters I used to spend in Vermont!
