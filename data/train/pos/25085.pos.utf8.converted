This 100% pure organic sweet potato puree is slightly tart, so it can be used in many recipes--like sweet potato pie or casseroles--without adding lemon juice.<br /><br />For a fast side dish, dip a couple of tablespoons of puree straight from the can, stir in a little of your favorite sweetener and spice and serve.<br /><br />Cover tightly before refrigerating the leftovers--air causes the puree to discolor.<br /><br />Overall it's a tasty and very handy way to add a nutritious super vegetable to your meals, plus it works great in classic sweet potato recipes.
