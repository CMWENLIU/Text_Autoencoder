I remember growing up in southern California and my Mom would make beanie/weenies for dinner. That was a good night cause we always knew we would get B&M Brown bread right along side. Now I'm almost forty, and terribly troubled that now where on the West coast can you find this wonderful treat. I will have to order some and hope that it is as good as I remember. I really don't want to be disappointed like I was when I tried Spam again for the first time as an adult, that was truly a disgusting venture. However I do believe how can you go wrong with a classic like brown bread in a can?????? Enjoy your childhood memories as have am and indulge in the past.
