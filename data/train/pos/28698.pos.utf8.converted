I am a big fan of Xylichew gums.  My favorite Xylichew flavor is Peppermint - flavor seems to last longer.  Xylichew gums are made in FINLAND.  Cheaper xylitol gums like Spry and most others are made in China.  With all the health scares from Chinese products, I'd rather pay more and go with Xylichew.
