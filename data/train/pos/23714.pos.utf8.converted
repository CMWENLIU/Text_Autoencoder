A lot of tuna at a great price. Exactly what I was looking for. Haven't noticed any taste difference over regular cans Vs Lower Sodium. If you like canned tuna and know how to make it, this is for you. If you are only used to tuna in bags, then you need to know how to drain the cans.<br />It's really easy. Use your can opener, cut the entire top but don't remove it. Take the can over to your sink. Use the freshly cut top to squeeze out the water down your drain. Squeeze slowly until no more water comes out. Now you are ready.<br /><br />I am describing this only because other reviews of cans on Amazon have labeled them as "tuna soup". reviews written by people who haven't used tuna in cans before, and haven't known that you need to drain them.
