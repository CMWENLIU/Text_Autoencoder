Forget all those briney jars sporting "NONPAREIL" on their labels.  This is the real deal.  From that hot volcanic rock off the coast of Sicily, Pantalleria, these are capers to provoke a caper of your own.  I found them in Italy. Five stars for Pantalleria capers which go with caviar.<br /><br />These are the most intensely flavored buds in the business. I use these salted capers in sauces including a lemon caper butter sauce for my veal.  Using only the salt that clings to them, the sauce is stunning and different from sauce using other caper brands that are not Pantalleria or are stored in oil. Brine is the enemy and additives other than salt distort the flavor. For most dishes, you will rinse away the salt, or save it, because whatever you made is already salted. But beware, you kill capers if you cook them. Just add the capers after you turn the heat off. The heat from a warm pan is plenty.<br /><br />I'll admit, these are more expensive.  You can get good capers in salt from elsewhere including some nice Spanish ones.  I will use those more often.  But for special service, I reach for these.  Nice to have them available here.
