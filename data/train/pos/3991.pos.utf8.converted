This is a very high quality Tulsi product and 100% organic. Davidsons farms and harvests the Tulsi tea on their own land in India. Very well priced in comparison to other organic Tulsi found on the net. Great taste and has a very relaxing, de-stressing effect which I love. I also buy Rooibos tea from Davidsons which I mix with the Tulsi for an even better relaxing and healthy cup. Highly Recommended!
