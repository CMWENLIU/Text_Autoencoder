My 7-month-old easily gums these and they dissolve without inducing gagging!  He liked them so much the very first time he tried them, I took a taste and was a bit disappointed because they did taste slightly sweet to me (they do have sugar)...but I'll likely buy these again, and recommend these over anything from Gerber!
