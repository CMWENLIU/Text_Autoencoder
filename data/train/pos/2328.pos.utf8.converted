I don't know what the GI is for these bars, but they really manage to keep me full for hours.  I split one for breakfast and a snack a few hours later, and it does the trick.  When I start my day off with a Luna bar, i am hungry just an hour later. They are sweetenned with Agave nectar which does not affect your blood sugar as much as sugar, nothing artificial and everything organic and raw makes these actually good for you!  They do taste a lot like figs and cashew butter, which might turn some people off but I think its delicious!  Raspberry Chocolate flavor is amazing too.  Calorie count is 276, which is fine for breakfast and lunch combined.
