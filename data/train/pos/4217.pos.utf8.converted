On the strength of the reviews for this, I decided to give Ambrosia Honey a shot. It's a gamble buying honey, having never tasted it.<br /><br />Luckily, this honey exceeded my expectations. I normally buy locally-produced honey at twice the cost. The depth of flavor is much better with this honey. It's hard to describe, but the flavor is both complex and light. If you're used to cheap grocery store honey, Ambrosia Honey will be a real treat.<br /><br />The price for this 4-pack is what pushes this honey to five-stars. It's an incredible value, considering what good honey costs.<br /><br />The dispensers are well sealed, and it would be difficult, if not impossible, for these to leak in transit.
