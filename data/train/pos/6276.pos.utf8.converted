The absolute BEST one pot meal ever.<br />Economical, easy and quick, just add water...cooks in 8 minutes.  As is, it is far better, and less expensive, than any hot and sour soup I have had in a restaurant or a packaged mix purchased at a supermarket, including stores which specialize in Asian products.<br /><br />I have added chopped fresh garlic, cilantro, brocolli.  For extra protein, have added cooked chicken OR turkey, tofu, or may drizzle in raw scrambled egg just before it is finished cooking.<br /><br />Made according to package directions, it yields a gallon of soup, far more with the add ins.<br /><br />Please do note that this product is high in salt, which for me is no problem, as  MD advised to add more water and salt to my diet.<br /><br />PLEASE Country Kitchens and Amazon, do not discontinue this product!
