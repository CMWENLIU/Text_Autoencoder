Matcha comes in many different grades. Make no mistake, you are not going to get a full pound of high-quality matcha for less than several hundred dollars.<br />This is not matcha for drinking; it is matcha for cooking, baking, and even adventurously powdering breakfast cereal and ice cream with. If you want the stuff used in a Japanese tea ceremony, plan to pay a minimum of a dollar a gram, but if you want a lot of decent matcha for other purposes at a good price, this is it.
