I prefer the Maxwell House Columbian Supreme over all the others even if they are slightly less expensive.  It has the perfect flavor, not too bitter yet strong and aromatic.  The jugs are the right size so the coffee doesn't lose flavor from being open and sitting too long.  My husband drinks a pot a day so I go through a lot of this.  Thank goodness for subscibe and save.
