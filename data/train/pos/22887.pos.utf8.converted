You won't find a leaner package of ground buffalo for your grill. I make each 1 lb package into two patties and sprinkle salt, pepper, and then press minced garlic and freshly ground horseradish into both sides then grill them over a charcoal fire, turning every 3 minutes. I like them medium rare so I only turn them 3 times. Best burger you'll ever have. Great in chili also but don't brown first, just crumble raw meat into the rest of your prepared stock and cook "slow and low".
