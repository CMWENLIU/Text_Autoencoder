I don't eat cereal everyday, but when I do, I like to eat Cheerios. There really isn't anything bad I can say about original Cheerios, but I do prefer Honey Nut Cheerios if I have the option. Also, I am not the biggest honey lover, but the taste in this cereal is not overpowering; it is just right. I really think this is one the best classic cereals on the market. They are fairly healthy, especially since General Mills has started to make all of their cereals with whole grains. These are good for lowering your cholesterol and maintaining a good diet. The amazon price is cheaper than my local store, even without the subscribe and save option. So, I recommend :-)<br /><br />Note: The amazon.com seller has the best price. Some other sellers have it for higher prices on amazon, but you probably wont be getting such a good deal. Enjoy.
