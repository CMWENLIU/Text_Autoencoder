I have eaten various protien bars on the market for well over 15 years.  The ThinkThin Chunky Peanut Butter bars have the best taste, excellent texture and fill me up when I need it.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.  I buy them by the box and if I could find a place where I could buy them by the case with a bigger discount, I would.<br /><br />-Julian
