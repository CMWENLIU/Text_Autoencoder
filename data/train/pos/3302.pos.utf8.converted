If you've never had real Swiss fondue, you're really missing something special.  My only regret is that I live in an area that usually doesn't get cold enough to really enjoy fondue to its fullest.  To compensate (and because we love winter), my wife and I often go to the mountains where it does snow and when we do, one of the first things we enjoy is Swiss fondue.<p>I've found that the cheeses in this assortment make a wonderful and very authentic Swiss fondue.  Just be sure to have a loaf of crusty French bread handy as well as white wine and kirsch.  And don't skimp on the kirsch; it really makes the fondue special.<p>My family and I have found that fondue is best served the traditional Swiss way...as a main course.  It's just too filling for an appetizer and just so good you want to eat your fill!  There's nothing quite as relaxing as a good fondue on a cold winter's night.  This cheese assortment is the first really authentic fondue assortment I've found since my days of backpacking and hitchhiking around Europe.<p>I really can't praise this cheese assortment highly enough.  You really have to make a fondue yourself and taste how good it is to believe it.  Try it!  Please!  Once you do, you'll become an addict!
