We have had our AreoGrow Garden for just over a month and we are already eating fresh herbs. We love to cook with fresh herbs, but I have never liked going out to the garden to pick them, then having to wash any little bugs off them before cooking. We tried purchasing herbs from the grocery store, but they can be a bit expensive and need to be used on a timely basis. Then one day I saw this product advertised on TV and immediately researched it online and decided to purchase it from Amazon.<br /><br />At the time I purchased it I also decided to get the Italian Herbs seed kit. We decided to plant the herbs we thought we would use the most from both kits, so we ended up using a few from the kit it comes with and a few from the kit we ordered. Everything germinated early with one exception, the cilantro, to this day it still has not germinated. I did finally give up on it and bought a package of seeds from the store and pushed a few seeds into the sponge a few days ago. I will update this later and let you know if they germinated. It seems from the reviews that I am not the only one with the cilantro problem.<br /><br />I recommend this product to everyone I know who loves to grow herbs, but would prefer not to deal with the dirt and bugs.<br /><br />We received the Gourmet Herb kit with our AeroGrow Garden, it contains:<br />Italian Basil, Cilantro, Mint, Dill, Parsley, Chives and Purple Basil<br /><br />We purchased separately the Italian Herb kit, it contains:<br />Mint, Basil, Savory, Parsley, Garlic Chives, Oregano, and Thyme<br /><br />Update: No luck with the Cilantro. We decided to replace the Cilantro and put in basil instead. Still lovin our AreoGarden!!
