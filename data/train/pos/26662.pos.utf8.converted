Love these Sunkist fruit gems for their flavor and texture.  Each candy is individually wrapped so it was perfect for us to serve to customers in a bowl at the front counter of our income tax office.  My only comment in the negative....it was WAY TOO EXPENSIVE HERE!!  Costco sells the same size bag at 1/3 the cost (or less).
