If you are new to ESE Pods, this is a great way to find the brands of pods you like best. Get this package and keep careful tasting notes - and remember, your machine will also work better with some pods than others. The idea is to experiment as much as you can for as little cost as possble and this sampler makes it easy.<br /><br />On my Francis! Francis! X3, the Espressione, Lavazza, and Caffe Mako seem to be the better of the bunch so far. But I'll probably be able reach a final consensus after my next sampler.
