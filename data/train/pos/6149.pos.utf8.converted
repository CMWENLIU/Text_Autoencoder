As the title states, I am a big fan of 5 Hour Energy - Extra Strength. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AS1A4Q">5-Hour Energy Extra Strength Berry 12 bttls</a> I use them because I'm terminally ill, and I'm sometimes so weak that I start to fall asleep even when my upset stomach is still in full swing. This can lead to a messy situation when you wake up vomiting. LOL The 5 Hour Energy - ES REALLY works, but a few people had urged me to try this product, and so I did. My immediate first impression was that it tasted MUCH better than the other brands, which can be pretty bad. As with the 5 Hour Energy product, I could feel this working right away. It didn't last quite as long as 5 Hour Energy, but very close to it. And here's the catch. It's literally half the price of the other brands. So if you think about it, two bottle for the same price is more energy for the same price. Honestly, I'm gonna do some more comparison's, but these were my initial experiences. I'm still right smack in the middle of my last shot, and it's working just fine. Because my vomiting and nausea is a regular thing, as is being completely exhausted from fighting my illnesses, my wallet definitely likes the idea that I can get twice the product for the same price. I'm a loyal customer of 5 Hour Energy, but that doesn't mean I can't recognize a bargain when I see one. Who knows, maybe 5 Hour Energy will reduce their price some as this stuff takes off and becomes more popular. And I'm guessing it's going to do just that. Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />  Thanks so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell
