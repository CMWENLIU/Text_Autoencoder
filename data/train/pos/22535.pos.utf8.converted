I have been a Keurig / K-cup user for about 3 years.  I have tried truck loads of different brands and flavors.  I like strong, robust coffee.  I do not like flavored or "weak" coffees.  If you have the same taste, then "Coffee People" make the best coffees for you.  They are all robust, taste great, have no bitterness, and if you want to make a larger than usual cup of coffee (if your machine can adjust the setting sizes), than these work great for that.  Any of there flavors are nice.
