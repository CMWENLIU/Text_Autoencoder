I wasn't crazy about these when I first tried them, but I've grown to like them quite a bit.  Off the bat, they're kinda like mildly sweet, slightly bitter plastic shavings, but they have this somewhat indefinable flavor that can be best compared to carrots if carrots dried floppy rather than crispy.  They reconstitute beautifully if you can't deal with the plasticity of dried slices.  Wet, they're like a totally different product.  Anyways, I like them and the probiotic aspect is very helpful since I'm recovering from an ulcer.  They also help counteract the effects of having to take three iron pills a day, which is what makes them a five-star product to me.  I eat them as is.
