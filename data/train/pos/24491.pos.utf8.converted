When I first began seeing one of the doctors who has been most helpful with my chronic health issues, he did an assessment. One of the first things he checked was whether my body was dehydrated, or not. It was - even though I drank over 80 oz. of high quality water per day. He explained that it is necessary to also consume salt so your body can properly metabolize the water. Good quality salt - not "regular" table salt. There are quite a few good, pure mineral laden salts available these days fortunately. I've found that this product "Real Salt" is one of the most readily available and economical. It also has quite a pleasant taste - not overly salty. I carry a cannisted in my purse as well as using it in our cooking and dining. I highly recommend this product.
