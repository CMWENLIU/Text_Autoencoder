Kashi Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest is a great example of how simple ingredients can deliver great taste.  It has three basic organic ingredients:  wheat, evaporated cane juice, and cinnamon.  I am impressed by the amount of flavor that this cereal has.  It is not a knock you over the head in your face and overly powerful experience.  However if you are looking at a cereal like this, you likely have different priorities to begin with.<br /><br />Cinnamon Harvest is a fairly dense cereal with a one cup serving coming in at 190 calories - more than 50% more than a lighter cereal such as Kashi Organic Promise Strawberry Fields.  On the flip side, I find a serving of Cinnamon Harvest stays with me longer than Strawberry Fields does.  It really depends on what you are looking for, and the tastes between the two are completely different as well.<br /><br />Like most "wheat biscuit" type cereals Cinnamon Harvest holds up well in milk although I have found this to be true of most Kashi cereals.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a wheat cereal with great taste and natural ingredients, you should give Kashi Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest a try.
