Similac adv RTF works great for my daughter!  I opted not to breastfeed, so she's been on this formula since birth and is now 3 months.  She has not gotten sick yet, and is growing and reaching all of her milestones beautifully.  We use the RTF formula because we find it more convenient to prepare.  And though it may just be a mental thing, I feel like it's better for her tummy than mixing the powder and water myself.
