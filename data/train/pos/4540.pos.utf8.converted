I bought about a tablespoon of these seeds from a local weigh-your-own-spices vendor and it cost about $2.  This product costs slightly less than $1/oz in bulk, and 2 oz. ($2 worth) fills a tall spice jar.  If you do any Scandinavian baking and use cardamom on a regular basis, it is well worth purchasing this in bulk.  You can divide the stash among friends.  For convenience, it sure beats buying cardamom in the pods, and if you have a means to grind it yourself (even a hammer on a folded piece of cloth will do), it will be much fresher than buying pulverized cardamom.
