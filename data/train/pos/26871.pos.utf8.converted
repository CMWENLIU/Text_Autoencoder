This is very good roasted seaweed.  Excellent, in fact.  Most companies just dry their seaweed but let me tell you, they are lazy and really don't know seaweed.  See, that's the problem with most of the world today, laziness!  I can remember a time when companies and people cared about going the extra mile, when quality still mattered.  It's a shame.  Everyone is all about speed and convenience, speed and convenience.  It's like we're all on treadmills or really fast escalators or something quick and automated like that.  I just don't know what is wrong with everyone.  Sometimes I just have to sit down and shake my head.<br /><br />Roasting makes the seaweed almost taste like chicken and when you use it in your favourite recipes, you will think you've died and gone to heaven.  Yamamotoyama is the best!
