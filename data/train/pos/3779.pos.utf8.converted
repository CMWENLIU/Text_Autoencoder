As a diabetic cooking without sugar can be very difficult for certain dishes, but useing a substantially unrefined cane sugar is an option that doesn't shoot glucose levels up alarmingly like refined sugar.  It does have a Molasses taste so quite often rather than using molasses Ill use Dark Muscovado.  This product thought is gooey and unstable so after opening I keep it in a vacuum sealed jar.
