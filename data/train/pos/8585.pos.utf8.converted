My mix-breed lab suffered from terrible skin problems, especially in his ears, for 2 years.  After a lot of money spent at the vet, we finally identified his problems as food related allergies.  Tried all the expensive "over the counter" foods from pet stores...nothing worked.  THe only thing I could feed him was either lamb or venison based food I bought from the vet at a ridiculous premium.  I saw this at Walmart and decided to give it a try.  My dog has been loving it for 2 years and is in better health than ever.  All skin problems gone.  Also, on the positive side, it seems to make more compact poop...less to pick up (yay!).  I strongly encourage anyone with a food sensitive pet to give this stuff a try.  Price is high, but reasonable compared to high-end foods.  Also, we have had good luck with Natural Life cat food for adult cats.  Poop is much less stinky than with other foods (Iams, vet food).
