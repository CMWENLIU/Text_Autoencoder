I'm not sure what the people who only gave this product one star were tasting -- when I tried the caramel dip, I thought it was great! It may taste a bit more like butterscotch than real caramel, but it's still very good. It's sweet, has the consistency of pudding, and tastes delicious on fruit. Both my son and I love it!
