I don't even like tea, but these candies are delicious. On first taste, they're a little bitter and weird tasting as you absorb the green tea powder coating. As you continue eating the candy, it develops into a chewy tasty gummy type candy. Very tasty and definitely grows on you! One warning, they're not a healthy snack, so watch out how many the you and the kids eat.
