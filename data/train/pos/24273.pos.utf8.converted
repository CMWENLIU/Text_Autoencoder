Wow!  As an unrepentant chocoholic, I'm always looking for great yummy chocolate treats.  Unfortunately, there IS a downside: too much of a good thing can lead to less than desirable results, especially on the scale.<br /><br />Soooo ... I try to moderate my chocolate consumption, exercising portion control, etc.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Warm Delights since they were introduced - they're VERY good and easy to prepare -- but they're rather high in calories (and Weight Watchers points).<br /><br />These new Minis are the perfect solution:  150 calories (or 3 Weight Watchers points).  I fix one of these, and top it with a small scoop of low-fat frozen yogurt -- heaven!  They're just the right size to give me my chocolate "fix."<br /><br />The price here is excellent, too.
