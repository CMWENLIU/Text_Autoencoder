This is IT for breakfast!!  I eat this for breaky everyday with westsoy organic unsweetened soymilk and fresh blueberries.  I feel awesome for hours and I totally feel different if I eat something else. I am a 42 year old female, work out 2x daily, and controlling my carb intake but I was feeling tired as I was slowly losing weight comfortably. So I looked for a very high-quality low-glycemic cereal to eat before my morning workout.  I eat a 1/4 cup muesli with 1/2 cup of the soymilk.  This combo gives you net 17.5g carbs (23.5g minus 6g fiber)& 8.5g protein.  It doesn't initially sound low carb but believe me, those carbs are worth it! OMG! what a difference in my workouts...AND I got over a weight plateau while starting to lose my tummy!  Oh and all of the other great benefits each of these ingredients offers your body.  TRY IT for a week and notice the difference.  If you're not used to an earthier, less sugary food...you'll get used to it and will appreciate the lovely subtle flavors...and HOW you feel and LOOK!
