Agave is the best thing next to a slice of homemade bread. I use it in place of reg. white sugar. My mother is a type 2 diabetic and with agave she can have a full piece of her favorite Thanksgiving desert pumkin pie with no raise in her blood sugar. There is light and dark versions just like in maple syrup. I prefer the dark especially in baking and cooking I think it has more flavor. Try it in your oatmeal with cinnamon. You eat oatmeal because it is good for you so why not make it even better, trade brown sugar or yucky artificial sugar for a more healthy natural alternative.
