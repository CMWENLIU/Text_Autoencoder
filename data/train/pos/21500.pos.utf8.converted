This stuff is on every restaurant table in Costa Rica. Many an unsuspecting tourist has been strung out on this liquid crack brownsauce. It is good on eggs, meat, fish, veggies, table legs, mystery meat, breakfast, brunch, lunch, drunch, dinner, supper, snacks, old leather shoes, pieces of table cloth, tofu, sushi, Thanksgiving turkey, Christmas turkey, random middle of April Turkey, tacos, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, and of course french fries.  In summary, it is good on anything you can shove into your mouth.  If you accidentally drip some on your hand, you may end up nibbling off a few fingers!<br /><br />of course there's a lot of sodium in it, but that just means you can leave off the extra salt in the recipes.<br /><br />Buy one bottle for yourself, and another bottle for yourself.  And a third bottle just in case the first two go empty.
