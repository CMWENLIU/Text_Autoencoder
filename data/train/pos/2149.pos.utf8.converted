For an allergen free family, including gluten, dairy, soy, and egg, this bread mix is a delight!  I replace the eggs with flax meal.  3 Tablespoons flax meal and 9 Tablespoons hot water.  Let the flax meal sit for 10 minutes to gel, then add with liquids to the bread mix.  I have to bake at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  If you make rolls, they bake in about 30 minutes--delicious too!
