My friends at work tease me because I have an entire desk drawer dedicated to tea.  I love my tea.  I almost exclusively drink loose leaf tea.  I love the taste and the ritual.  But sometimes I don't feel like taking the time to prepare a pot of loose leaf tea, so I "settle" for a tea bag.<br /><br />PG Tips really isn't a compromise for me though.  I love PG Tips.  It's a great blend of black teas.  The taste is great and the bag is convenient.<br /><br />It's not completely accurate to call this a "bag" though, because it's a pyramid.  The water flows through the pyramid very nicely.  There's no string to take it out with though.  That's OK.  Use a spoon or let it continue to steep while you drink it.<br /><br />Excellent black tea blend!
