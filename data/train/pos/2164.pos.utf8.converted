I'm sorry to see these lentils have disappeared from Amazon only a few days after I purchased a 10lb bag. The seller, Taste Specialty, is a wholesale only distributor based out of Las Vegas (according to their website) and appears to cater to restaurants, particularly those that are higher-end. At 3 dollrs a lb., the price was right for Beluga lentils, and when I purchased them via Amazon, the shipping was free for Amazon Prime members. The day the lentils arrived, I made my signature red wine lentils (using 1 cup Beluga lentils from this purchase and 1 cup of the French Green lentils I also purchased the same day on Amazon, but sold by Bob's Red Mill).  The dish was excellent, and the lentils were tasty and fresh. There is a small amount of chaff that sticks to the inside of the plastic bag, but there were surprising few culls/bad lentils. Because it is a bulk purchase, the plastic bag was not marked, but the box the bag ships in does have the Taste Specialty Foods logo and nutrition information: serving size 32 grams (1/4 cup); calories 170 (5 from fat); carbs 30 grams; fiber 9 grams; protein 13 grams - and best of all, one serving has 20% of the RDA for Iron. Lentils are a great dish for a pregnant woman looking for extra iron in her diet.  My only complaint is the box/package does not contain an expiration date; regardless, the Black Beluga Lentils are dried, so they should last nearly forever in an airtight jar away from sunlight.  Recommended, and I hope they come back into stock (with continued free shipping) soon!
