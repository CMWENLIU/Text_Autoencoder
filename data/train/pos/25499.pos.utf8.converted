These single serve aseptic cartons of milk, which need no refrigeration, are just incredibly convenient to have on hand. Many trips to the store have been avoided -- saving a lot of gas and time -- when I only needed a cup or two of milk.<br /><br />A plus is that the milk is delicious, organic, and comes in lowfat 1%. Instant milk, though handy to use in recipes, never seems to mix up into a pleasantly drinkable beverage.<br /><br />My idea of coffee is 8 oz. of hot milk to 2 oz. of strong coffee, so I've used these out of my pantry multiple times at 6 a.m. when I really didn't want to go to the store just to get milk for my wake-up coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps you never run out of milk like I do, but if you do, and find yourself needing just enough for cereal, or a recipe, or for your coffee or tea, these are great to have tucked away and available. A terrific time saver!
