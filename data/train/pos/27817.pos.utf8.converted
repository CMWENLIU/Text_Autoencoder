This is the absolute best beef flavoring product out there! Seriously, you should give this a try if you ever use any other kind of beef boullion. I add it to burgers, braises, rub it on meats going on the grill, use it in soups and gravies and just generally use it anywhere that I am using beef. It ups the beefy flavor and makes your sauces and gravies sing with taste. For a long time I couldn't find it, I had originally picked up a few boxes of the cube form when I was on a road trip and haven't found it anywhere else since, when I finally used up the supply I had I was having withdrawals and tried every other product out there but they all fell short on the flavor that this has. I mentioned it on a group I belong to and one of the other members sent me the Amazon link to it in the canisters, I ordered it immediatly and couldn't wait until it arrived, it is exactly the same taste as the cube form and I am once again a happy cook, I even went back and ordered another six pack of the canisters and signed up for auto delivery of it for the future. What usually happens is when I find something we really like, it then stops being sold and I can't find it again for a long time. This time I will have a stockpile of a dozen canisters so I am set for quite a while. You also can't beat the Amazon price of the six canisters, consider that I paid almost two bucks for the pack of 8 cubes that I had originally bought and the price at Amazon is like getting it almost free compared to what I paid for 8 little cubes and each of these canisters is almost eight ounces of the product. Try this stuff, you'll love what it does for anything beef.
