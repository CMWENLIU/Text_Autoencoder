The packaging was great, came sealed inside a cardboard box which can easily be gift-wrapped. Although I was planning to give this one as a gift, I felt the need to open it and take a look.  Shouldn't have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine.  With my first dinner guests after delivery, I boiled water, opened the bamboo box, removed the glass pot, selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile, and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea.  Oh my Godness, what a sight!  I didn't say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom!  We agreed that it looked like a monster at first, and after laughing amongst ourselves, I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups.  Yummy.  Poured a second pot, then a third.  Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely.  We came to the computer and ordered three more sets.  I know I'll be ordering more, too, with extra boxes of the flowering teas.  Every part of this set was wonderful, from the packaging and delivery, bamboo boxes, little glass teapot, and tasty teas.  It's a real nice value and very presentable gift. Amazon's prices can't be beat on these!
