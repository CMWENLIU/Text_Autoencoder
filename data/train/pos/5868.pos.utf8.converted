It tastes pretty good. I mix it in a single-serve blender with water, chia seeds (that's been soaking in the water for 30 min), a banana, an apple and sometimes frozen mixed berries.<br /><br />Don't mix it with coconut water. I tried that and it tasted horrible.<br /><br />I bought this at first at Whole Foods but Amazon is MUCH cheaper, especially with the subscription program.
