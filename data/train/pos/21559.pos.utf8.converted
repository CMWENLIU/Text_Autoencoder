Let me explain why people either rate this as 5-star or 1-star.  Muesli does taste like cardboard, but this good muesli tastes like good cardboard.  Just kidding, but not far off the truth.<br />Some who rate it low perhaps are expecting granola.  I know lots of people who see and taste real muesli for the first time are disappointed.  It takes some getting used to.  Muesli is an acquired taste, kind of like beer.  This muesli would have disgusted me as someone new to muesli just as a fine Pale Ale would have tasted bitter and awful to me if it had been the first beer I had tasted!<br />This Bob's muesli is really good if you like real muesli (not the Kellogg's variety softened up for the American pallette.)
