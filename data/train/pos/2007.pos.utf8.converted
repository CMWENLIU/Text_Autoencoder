This is an excellent all around seasoning product that I use a lot of.  My only complaint is that I think the sodium content is a little high, therefore I make sure to use plenty of liquid with whatever I am adding this to so that it's not too salty.  I wish Rapunzel offered this broth product in a jar with lower sodium.  I use other Rapunzel products, they are always top-notch.
