My kids are allergic to so many food items it was hard to find a replacement for pasta.  The rice pastas are sticky and the texture is wrong.  This linguini is great!  If you follow the directions on the box and don't overcook, this is a perfect substitute.  I will rinse it with cold water to stop the cooking process exactly.  I can even serve it to their non allergic friends and they like it too!
