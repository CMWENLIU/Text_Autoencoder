I am a person who dislikes drinking plain water. My wife bought me some of this stuff that was supposed to be pretty good. It was also sugarless. THAT, in itself, was a bad sign, too.<br /><br />BUT, I tried some of this Crystal Light and I really loved it! There was a slight after-taste in the beginning, but now, I totally do not notice it at all.<br /><br />I recommend Crystal Light in Strawberry/Banana flavor. It really is good.
