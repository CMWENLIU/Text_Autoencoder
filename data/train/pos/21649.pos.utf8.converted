After reading several articles maintaining that vitamin supplements are basically a scam, with no positive correlation to health or longevity, I decided to ditch my multivitamin and switch to a natural food supplement instead. The ingredient list in Green Superfood is impressive-I'm not sure how costly it would be to duplicate through juicing but this accomplishes the same goal for me without all the shopping, food prep and cleanup! In the past year I've cleaned up my diet quite a bit, but I always seem to come up short in consuming green leafy vegetables, so this product fills that gap nicely. As for the drinkability, I have tried mixing with V8 and some water. Not very good. Today I tried mixing with just straight water, and surprisingly, it wasn't bad! My advice to anyone who wants to get the best health result: don't use Green Superfood as a magic bullet that allows you to make multiple bad food choices on a daily basis. Dump the processed sugars, refined flours and sweet drinks, eat as many natural foods and whole grains as possible and over time, your palate will readjust to a normal state. Your cravings should become manangeable and weight/fat loss will begin to occur naturally! I would definitely recommend this product to any busy, health-minded and budget-conscious person who wants an easy way to enhance their diet!
