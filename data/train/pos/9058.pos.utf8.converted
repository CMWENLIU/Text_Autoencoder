I was a big skeptic- but I have to say this product DOES indeed work! Within 24 hours I noticed a BIG increase in my milk supply. My baby has a shallow latch due to extreme distractability- and due to that was not effectivly emptying my breasts...which meant my body was beginning to produce less milk because of supply and demand. This corrected my low milk supply and also seems to help with boosting a slow letdown into a bit faster one..all of which have made my fussy 4 month old MUCH happier! Now I am using breast compressions and also working on helping her correct her latch to maintain my new supply. I will continue to drink this pleasant tasting tea 3 times per day until she weans herself..which will hopefully be a long ways off. :-)
