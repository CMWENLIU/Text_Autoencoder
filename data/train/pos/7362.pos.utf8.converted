Let me start by saying I HATE MUSTARD! I'm 42 and i've never liked it, won't even eat it in potato salads. My husband got a little jar of this in a salami/beef stick gift basket. It sat on the shelf for months and one day I was hungry for a bologna sandwich. For some odd reason I decided to put this on my sandwich and it was so good. When I finished off that jar (all by myself) I searched the grocery stores for it and found it nowhere. Yes, I had to buy 4 bottles of it to get it on Amazon, but that's ok, they won't go to waste!
