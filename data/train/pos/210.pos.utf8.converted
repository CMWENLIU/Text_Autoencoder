Our family has tried just about every gluten-free pancake mix on the market. Bisquick is one of the best! Two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us don't, but we all love this mix for our tradition of Saturday morning pancakes. The only other gluten-free pancake mix we like even better is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XP3R4I">Nuffins Gluten Free Pancake Mix - Case of 6</a> It's not always available on Amazon, but when it is we try to stock up. Nuffins is definitely worth trying! Their other products are great too. Otherwise it's Bisquick or Pamelas for our family.<br /><br />The only "con" I can think of is the price. At $5.00+ per pound, this mix is expensive. If you agree, mark this review as helpful! Maybe the good folks at Betty Crocker will take notice.
