The packaging of this spice is superior to other packaging methods I've experienced.  The color is vibrant and aroma excellent.  I've used this in rice dishes so far and plan to develop more ways to get it in my family's diet.  I've seen on many sites and in other reviews advice to use turmeric with oil (olive oil would probably be ideal) to aid absorption.  Absorption is the goal because this isn't just food; it's medicinal.<br /><br />The active ingredient is curcumin.  This product claims at least 5% curcumin.  Turmeric typically has a range of curcumin between 2% - 6%.  Curcumin is responsible for the dramatic and many health effects of this spice.  It helps against inflammation, diarrhea, arthritis and a lot more.  The one getting a lot of attention now is to aid against the prevention of Alzheimer disease.  There are studies on this so it's not official yet.  I guess it's semi-official if you think about all the doctors behind this movement and some statistics about populations that use turmeric.<br /><br />The spice is agreeable in many dishes in combination with other flavors.
