I first bought this tea at an Ethnic store when I was literally about to give up on breastfeeding during my LO's 6 week growth spurt. I was looking for something to help boost my milk supply and this did it!! Then I made a mistake of telling other nursing moms and the tea was gone from the store wiithin 2 days lol thank amazon!<br />Make sure to really steep this tea for 10 min or so and I drink 5 cups a day. I don't mind the taste but then again I'm a fan of herbal teas! Yummm<br />Best advice: stay hydrated, feed on demand and this tea will only increase your chances of successful breastfeeding!<br /><br />I'm off to order another box :) good luck, mommies!
