Its soy people. And soy cannot a chicken be. However, this is delicious. I'm not even a vegetarian and I tend to prefer this to meat. It tastes good (meaty but not meat), and it's much lighter in my stomach than actual meat. I feel much better after eating it than I do after eating meat.<br /><br />AMAZON! BRING IT BACK!!
