This dinosaur lasts a long time - incredible with the way my dog chews.  And he doesn't seem to lose interest in it, no matter how raggedy it looks.  He likes the little knobbies on it because of the texture. He always finds where this thing is hidden and chomps away on it. I definitely recommend this dinosaur if you have a serious chewer.
