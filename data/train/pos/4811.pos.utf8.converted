These are so flavorful and each type is significantly different from the others. so you get a very nice selection. Buying the 4-pack from Amazon winds up being about half the price it would buying them individually from my local grocery (which only carries one or two of the types available in this pack) or even from the local health food market, which doesn't have the couscous anyway, where I live whole wheat couscous is hard to find!  I would definitely recommend this sampler pack.  I'll buy another as soon as my husband and I can get through our first-they last a long time, so it is a great value!
