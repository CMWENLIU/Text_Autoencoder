Having tried two different matcha powders thus far from Amazon.com, I am extremely impressed by the quality of DoMatcha's product. The other product I had ordered from Tao of Tea, while cheaper and 3 times the size and also of Japanese origin, simply does not compare to the fresh appearance and taste of DoMatcha's product. Exceptionally vibrant green color out of the box that turns into an extremely lush, dark forest green color upon addition of water, with an exceptionally fresh taste to match. If the matcha powder Starbuck's uses is taken as a token standard of like 100, Tao of Tea's matcha would be 80 or 90, while DoMatcha would be at least 125. The former two have colors of dull green and greenish-yellow respectively after water is mixed in with the matcha.<br /><br />I have not tried the really high-quality, really expensive premium matcha with elegant Japanese names and calligraphy on the cases they come in. But I am willing to bet that DoMatcha can quite hold its own against the super-premium labels/brands of matcha out there.
