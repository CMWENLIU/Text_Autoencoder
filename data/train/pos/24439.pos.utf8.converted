I set out to find an organic black sesame vendor after several bad tasting experiences with the store-bought variety. I have already ordered this item multiple times, because of its consistency in quality and delivery. The seeds are wonderfully tasty and, because they are raw, they can be roasted to one's taste. I recommend this product wholeheartedly.
