being from the midlands of england black pudding was sold in most butcher shops,so i had my fair share of it ,tommy moloneys pudding is very near the consitancy and taste that i grew up on ,however further up north it does vary ,they even have competitions for it,so for me i really liked this brand and will definately buy it again,in fact i prefer it to some of the german black puddings i have tried from new york
