I'm currently on a high protein, low carb diet (Ideal Protein Diet).  Carbs were restricted, but as I'm allowed to work them back into my diet, this is one condiment that is allowed (One Carb Heinz).  Before now, I tried the Walden Farms ketchup and that was pretty bad - but this Heinz tastes just like their regular ketchup only it's low carb, reduced sugar - so it's less bad for you.  I will say that this item is available in most Walmart stores for $2.88 per bottle, which sure beats having to buy in bulk OR having to pay for shipping.  So if you choose to try this product, I suggest getting it at Walmart.
