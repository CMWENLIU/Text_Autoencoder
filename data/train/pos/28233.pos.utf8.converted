These are my hands-down, absolute favorite packaged Korean style noodles. Great noodles, and a soup flavored with anchovy rather than just salt and MSG. One packet, some cut up tofu, a few green vegetables, maybe even some fresh seafood if it's on hand... and for real luxury, an egg. The only thing keeping me from ordering this 40-pack is that I can buy the 5-packs at my local Korean grocery for about the same price. But if they ever stop carrying them... Amazon, here I come.
