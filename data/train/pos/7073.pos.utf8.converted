I am an experienced cook but new to Indian, so this spice box was the best way for me to jump in and test the waters.  This was out of stock at the time I wanted it, so I contacted the Ajanta site directly and spoke to the owner and author of the accompanying cookbook (who signed my book) at their west coast CA restaurant--and it was shipped promptly the next day and I rec'd it two days later...mind you, I am on the east coast, in NY. I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery.  I was impressed with the spice box too.  Everything was in its place, and the top of the lid is 'mapped' out in alphabetical order, just like a box of chocolates, so you can quickly find the specific spice you want--a veritable file cabinet of spices.  Someone else mentioned that theirs arrived all jumbled up, so I have to assume that it got that way in shipping.  Mine was pristine and thoroughly organized, with a gold sticker sealing it down, lovely enough to 'gift.'  Having all spices in front of you to see, touch, and smell is easier to learn about too, better than just seeing illustrations in a book.  All in all, as a beginner of Indian cooking, this was an economical and practical way to try almost 100% of the necessary spices needed for ANY cookbook of Indian cuisine. I highly recommend it.
