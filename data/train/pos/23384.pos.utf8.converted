I have been ordering low mercury tuna from Amazon for some time. The last time I ran out, Amazon was not selling the brand I was buying (wild planet) so I looked for alternatives.<br /><br />I could not really find an alternative on Amazon.com that actually identified itself as "low mercury." Low mercury tuna that I could find outside Amazon.com is very expensive plus you have to pay shipping. One brand that Amazon does sell - Crown Prince - says that their tuna is Dolphin-safe and line caught. Usually, the line-caught and troll-caught tuna from the Pacific Ocean is lower in Mercury than the typical tuna you find from brands like Starkist and Chicken-of-the-Sea. I also read a story recently that the high amount of selenium in tuna actually helps bind with mercury in tuna to negate its effects.<br /><br />According to several articles I found, the interactions between dietary selenium and mercury are now the topic of exciting new research. Some of those studies were presented at a recent scientific meeting dedicated to the subject. The First International Symposium on Selenium and Mercury Interactions, was held February 22-24, 2007 in La Jolla, California. The symposium assembled scientists from the US, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Slowenia, Denmark and elsewhere to share information on selenium and mercury interactions and health effects.<br /><br />Of particular interest was a paper given by Dr. Nicholas Ralston of the Energy and Environmental Research Center in North Dakota on the biochemical basis of selenium's protective effects on mercury toxicity. Selenium has an extremely high binding attraction and strength with mercury, forming a biologically inactive compound, mercury selenide.<br /><br />But how much selenium is in tuna? All tuna species sampled, including bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack contained a healthy excess of selenium over the mercury content. For this reason, eating tuna, an excellent source of selenium, is more likely to protect against mercury toxicity, than cause it.<br /><br />So, that was enough for me to give this tuna a try. From Amazon, it comes in a 12-pack case with free shipping. The price per can is very good. The tuna tastes great and the 12-oz can is a good size for me and my wife who like to mix it with low fat miracle whip, mustard, chopped onions, and green & red peppers and eat it with corn chips or make paninis. This is good quality tuna and worth stocking in your pantry.
