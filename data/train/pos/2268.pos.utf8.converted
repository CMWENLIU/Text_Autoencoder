There is no better Yerba Mate on the market. I have tried hundreds of brands and the quality just does not compare to Guayaki. I really like how they include stems with leaf. Mate is meant to be drunk this way and the stems add a significant amount of theophylline and theobromine and also add to the sweet and nutty flavor notes not found in other Mate's. I also appreciate that Guayaki uses only shade grown Mate - as it is meant to be. Sun grown mate lacks body and benefits.<br /><br />I really like the companies sustainable business model. The company is true blue when it comes to their mission. Fairly traded products that allow the indigenous people to receive a fair wage for their work. Guayaki's reforestation efforts should be applauded.<br /><br />Thank you for making such a fine product.
