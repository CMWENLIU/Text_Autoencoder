I think that this must be a relatively new formulation of these cookies because I remember trying them (maybe a different brand, but I could have sworn they were from Kinnikinnick) and finding that they were so hard that you could practically break your teeth on them!<br /><br />Fortunately, though, I decided to pick up some today and see if my daughter likes them.  Well, it turns out that these are absolutely great!  They're very much like original Oreos.  I'm so happy and my daughter, who is also GF was happy to be able to come home tonight and dip cookies in milk, "just like the commercials".  When I gave her one she said, "these are like the ones on tv.  For me?  Are they gluten free?  Yay!"  She's three and was very happy to have a fun treat.  She asked if I'd send one to school with her in her lunch so she can eat what the other kids are eating.<br /><br />Pick these up, for sure.  You won't be disappointed.
