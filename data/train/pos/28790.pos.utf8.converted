Lucky for me I found out about Element in my local newspaper (as it's made by a local company)<br />Or else I might have missed out!<br />I am a caffeine junky ...but hate that it always comes in soda or energy drink form.<br />This is an amazing alternative.<br />Even room temperature it  tastes like pure water. I couldn't detect any other flavor or additive.<br />Kudos!
