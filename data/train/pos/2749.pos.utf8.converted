The first time I had this product was about three weeks ago at my sister's house.  She and her family were introduced to it a few years ago and have had difficulty finding the envelopes of special seasonings. Luckily she found these and gave one to me! It is not traditional southern chili but a specialty that Ohioan's are eating every day with variations. Save yourself the trouble of finding all the ingredients and working out the best way for your family and just get these envelopes, use the directions and go for it. Wonderful for hot dogs with chili. Wonderful over spaghetti with cheese and fresh chopped onions. Wonderful with chopped cooked hotdogs. Wonderful with a drained and rinsed can of light red or dark red kidney beans. Wonderful with all of the above and oyster crackers on the side. There is no way everyone wont love this dish.<br /><br />Sincerely!
