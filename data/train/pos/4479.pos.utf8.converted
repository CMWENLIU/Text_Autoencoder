I can't really properly review this stuff from my own personal perspective since I don't eat cat food (well not yet anyway).  But I will say that my cats love it and I guess that's the test, huh?  My cats have always been very partial to Fancy Feast so I give it to them as a treat.  I also have to mix a little into their vet prescribed food (which they DON'T like) to make it palatable for them.  They'll eat pretty much any wet food the vet prescribes as long as I mix in a bit of Fancy Feast - without it they just turn up their noses and won't eat it.<br /><br />I get the food by subscription with free shipping so I always have some on hand.  It's easy and convenient and I love having it delivered right to my door.<br /><br />I rate this food and the subscription service with five Meows.
