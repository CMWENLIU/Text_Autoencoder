I just wolfed down 4 of these delicious dates. I love dates and these are as good as any I've ever had. Though I ordered with Amazon Prime two day shipping but it took 4 business days to arrive. The packaging is quite convenient. I would definitely order these again... though I now have 4 lbs in my fridge so it will be a while!
