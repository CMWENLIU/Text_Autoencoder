My cats ADORE this cat food, they cannot eat it quick enough. And, I hate to admit it, but the pleasant smell and lack of by-products tickled my curious side as well. I have eaten this cat food on more than one occasion, and it is actually pretty good. I find myself nibbling whenever I run out of people food or just feel like sharing a meal with my cats. Tres bien!
