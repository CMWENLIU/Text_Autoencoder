I tried these candy bars today and I love them.  Most "crisp" bars have some form of flour, which is bad for me. So I hesitantly tried one and at first, I thought the crisp part was like freeze-dried ice cream.  After reading the ingredients, I realized it is a meringue.  Even better for me!!  So for anyone who can't tolerate flour but likes a crisp bite, these are fantastic.  I highly recommend giving this a try.
