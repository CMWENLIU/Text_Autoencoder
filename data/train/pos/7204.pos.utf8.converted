During one of my "We've got to eat healthier" phases, I found this product. My family hates these phases because of the changes that take place.  We've begun to eat healthier over the years, but brown rice is one thing I can't get them to eat.  My son HATES brown rice, and anything he thinks might be healthy for that matter. Anyway, I decided to try it in spite of the complaints I knew I'd hear.  I like brown rice and it sounded interesting.  I used it in a recipe that normally called for white rice and it turned out great, EVEN my son liked it.  It does take a little while to cook and it is a little pricey, but it tastes good and it's good for you.
