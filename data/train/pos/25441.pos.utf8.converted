Plum Organics is a really good product, and this flavor is no exception.  My 8-month old loves, loves, loves the Spinach, Peas & Pear combo...more so than any other brand out there.  She is keen on savory foods and I guess this qualifies because she can't get enough of it!  It is still sweet, but not overwhelming so, and you can really smell the spinach in it, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />As far as the integrity of the product is concerned, I also give it a 5 star.  After researching "where" the product is made, it has become apparent to me in talking both with Plum Baby Organics and the distributor, Oregon Tilth, that most of the main ingredients are made in the U.S. and not in China.  The bulk of their ingredients come from Emeryville, CA.  The exception would be fruit such as bananas, mangoes and other tropical fruit come from Mexico.  So, until proven otherwise, I will continue purchasing their products gladly and quite satisfied.  I was also quite pleased that I actually spoke with representatives from both companies in a timely manner.  I will gladly support small businesses such as Plum, especially knowing that they are endeavoring to provide a quality product for our children.
