I learned to love Bull Dog Tonkatsu sauce while I was living in Japan. There was a small deli/grill just outside my local train station that sold set meals of tempura and tonkatsu. (For those who may not know, tonkatsu is a breaded, deep fried pork cutlet. The sauce is designed to garnish this delicacy.) I used to pick some up on my way home from work, stamping my feet to keep warm as I trudged up the interminable hill that led to my apartment. I bought this sauce at the local grocery store and kept it on hand for just such occasions!<br /><br />To the previous reviewer who compared the flavor to that of nutmeg: Bravo! you almost nailed it:) I have a home made version of tonkatsu sauce I cobble together as a clone. It calls for a significant amount of allspice and clove, as well as a generous splash of sake. If you Google for recipes you can experiment yourself, if you're so inclined. But then, the good folks over at Bull Dog may object to my counter productive views--sorry folks! :)<br /><br />In closing, I want to urge you to visit Japan and try tonkatsu for yourselves! I had a wonderful time during the two years I lived there! Here's a treasure hunt for you: there is a restaurant specializing in tonkatsu to be found on the top floor of the mall that encompasses the bullet train station in Kyoto. Give that place a try for an unbeatable taste of Japanese cuisine; the view is fantastic! I recommend it highly. Bon appetit!:)
