I've always wondered why Reese's didn't have a peanut butter and well, now they do!  You can open a jar of this stuff, put it next to every other brand and NONE of them can compare to color, freshness, etc.  I've used this stuff for years and won't use anything else for my gourmet peanut butter fudge.  It makes such a HUGE difference in the taste, that I actually tossed out a batch of my famous fudge when I substituted another brand and the results were terrible!  It is so amazing to me how one brand can make that much difference in how a recipe can turn out, or not, as in this case.  Can't recommend this stuff enough - it's loved in this house.  Highly, highly recommend!
