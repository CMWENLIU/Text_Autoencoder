Once you see sharkbanana, you can never look at sharks or bananas the same way again. Why has evolution created two magnificent species which fit together so beautifully like this?<br /><br />I recommend giving a sharkbanana to all the most wonderful people in your life. Then they too will understand what it is to be alive.
