I have not purchased Thai Kitchen from Amazon however I will be needing some soon and probably will. With that being said I want to say I have been consuming Thai kitchen coconut milk on a daily basis. It is rich thick and delicious. Ingredients are coconut milk, water, and guar gum(thickener). It is comparable to native forest brand. Which I also enjoy, their serving sizes are diffeernt but after doing out the math I think the Native Forest has a slightly higher by 1% total fat per can. Doing a taste test to compare the two I don't notice a difference. So in the future I will buy whichever is cheaper. I live in Texas and this summer when I would open a can that had been in my pantry I didn't notice any chunks or anything but I could clearly see the oil, and it looked very rich (as well as tasted). Now that the temperature has cooled off outside to about 80 I notice a big difference. When I open the can it is very thick with many chunks. I am writing this because I read reviews where someone complained about this. IT'S A GOOD THING TO SEE!!!! It's the oil in the milk. As far as someone talking about the BPA in the cans, maybe they have since changed this. It is my understanding that you can see whan a can has a coating hence the cans that are white on the inside. These cans are not white they are just the plain old tin cans. If I am incorrect and there is a new way they are doing this, then I apologize. But my cans DO NOT appear to have any type of BPA lining.<br /><br />UPDATE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE ORGANIC BRAND WHICH MY LOCAL SPROUTS EVERY 3-4 MONTHS HAS ON SALE 2 CANS FOR 3 DOLLARS.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/9/2011:<br />I purchased a few cans of the Native Forest classic on sale & I have found myself reaching for it before the Thai Kitchen. I find it to be a bit smoother with a little bit of a milder flavor. It's cold right now so I open the cans from the bottom so the liquid (oil & water) are on top. I poured the liquid from each into measuring cups. The Native forest had exactly 8oz of liquid with the rest being solid cream. The Thai Kitchen had just over 5oz of liquid with the rest being solid cream.<br />With this being said, it all comes down to personal preference. If the price on Native Forest was comparable to Thai Kitchen I would buy Native. Otherwise I will buy the Thai Kitchen because the price is much more affordable and there's not enough of a difference in tase to make me want to spend more.
