For those who don't know what a trifle is it's a layered dessert with sponge cake or lady fingers on the bottom covered with fruit cocktail then covered with custard or pudding then covered with whipped cream. I make a traditional English Sherry Trifle where the lady fingers are doused with (a bit of) sherry wine.<br /><br />My friend has celiac autoimmune disease, so I always try to make a gluten-free dish for her when we're at parties together. I came across these Schar Gluten Free Lady Fingers and thought I'd try a gluten-free Trifle (by the way, there is a recipe for gluten-free tiramisu on the packaging). They are stiffer than regular ladyfingers and at first I was worried. They are more like cookies out of the box than cake - you can't cut into them without breaking them into pieces. I was worried that soaking them with liquid would turn them to mush, but I only added a bit to coat each one and several hours later (and even next day) they kept their form and was even spongy (and tasty). I don't recommend drenching them or they will likely go to mush!<br /><br />The dish was a complete success, both in taste and in structure. A very good product!
