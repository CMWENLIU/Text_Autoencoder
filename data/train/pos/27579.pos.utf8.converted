I have a 2 year old wheaten terrier that's been on Wellness Core for about 6 months.  Very happy with the results, he's a very fit and and active dog.  Wheatens are supposedly not good with wheat oddly enough.  This is one of the highest rated foods by dogfoodanalysis.com and it's pretty easy to find locally now.  I haven't found this through a Prime vendor yet but I keep hoping.<br /><br />***Update -coming up on 4 years soon and this formula is hard to find at local stores. I like giving him the variety of the different flavors...
