Has a plethora of quality ingredients, no meat by-products, and no wheat gluten.<br /><br />In addition to a pleasant smell, this cat food also has other vegetable and fruit ingredients-- now do cats normally eat these tidbits?? Well... since I HAVE been able to slip my cats some well-cooked broccoli mixed into their canned food, and also judging by what I've seen my cats pull from the kitchen garbage pail -- banana peels, tomatoes, cantelope --  perhaps Harmony Farms is onto something here -- and besides, they are not the only pet food makers who include such things as cranberries and other fruit/veggies in their food.<br /><br />No articificial colors or flavoring -- my cats dive into the food dish, and it makes me happy that they are getting quaity food, even if I have to spend a little extra.
