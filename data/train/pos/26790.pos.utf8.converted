I don't really know what it is about David's that sets them apart from other brands, but they are unquestionably the best sunflower seeds that money can buy. I work out doors and I eat sunflower seeds every day. There have been times when I have been forced to purchase other brands of seeds, and over the years I have tried them all. It is amazing how much better David's seeds are than every other brand. Their seeds are not toothpick thin like some other brands, they have the best flavor, they are not too salty, and they don't fill the bag with empty shells. Now that I have found these seeds for sale from Amazon, I shall never be forced to buy those horrid, bitter, burnt, stale seeds from other brands ever again.  Thanks, Amazon.
