These are totally delicious, and also one of the few breakfast cereals without high fructose corn syrup (even All Bran has that). They are a bit sugary but not too sweet. Certainly filling and just what I like for breakfast, and so do my kids.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Amazon isn't doing this on subscribe and save (at least when I'm writing this), but seeing as almost every grocery store I know of runs out of these on a fairly regular basis, probably worth getting from Amazon.
