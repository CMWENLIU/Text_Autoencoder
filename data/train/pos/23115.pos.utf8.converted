I am very particular about the flavor, color and aroma for high calorie foods, like honey.  If I am going to have honey, I am very picky.  This right here is definitely a 5 star product based on quality of the product.<br /><br />I wish the squirt bottle had a better cap, like Busy Bee, which only pours the honey when squeezed.  Otherwise, the quality of the product completely overshadows this small detail.  Amazon does a great job packaging this product so that nothing is spilled, and if it did, it would easily be contained.<br /><br />Excellent honey!
