I agree with the first review on here.  I have tried several gluten free flour mixtures, and this is the best that I have tried.  It does not leave a gritty taste in the foods.  It makes good pizza crust, cookies, etc. It is nice to eat baked goods with a more "normal" consistency again and no funky aftertaste as I have had with some other GF flour mixes.  I highly recommend this!
