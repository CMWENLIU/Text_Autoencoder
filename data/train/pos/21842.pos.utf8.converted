This morning I taste-tested 3 top-rated Matcha green teas that I recently purchased on Amazon.<br /><br />1. Serendipi Tea matcha culinary grade organic green tea from Japan, 4 oz. costs $17.43<br />(result: *****)<br /><br />2. Tea Zone matcha green tea powder, 8 oz. costs $16.99 (Amazon sells this as `Matcha Green Tea Powder By Malden Tea', but my black foil packaging label says it's made by Tea Zone)<br />(result: ****)<br /><br />3. Liquid Jade powdered matcha green tea 100% organic, 3 oz. Cost $18.46<br />(result: ***)<br /><br />Recipe:<br />I made 3 different cups of  `green tea latte' with the following method:<br />1 tsp tea powder,<br />mixed with filtered water into a smooth paste,<br />added to 1/3 cup hot soymilk + 1/3 cup boiling water + 1 tsp raw agave nectar,<br />frothed into a Latte-style tea with hand-pump device.<br />NOTE: I am a scientist.  Each cup was clearly labeled.  I tasted the teas side-by-side, taking 3 sips of each before proceeding to next sample.  I tasted in random order until all 3 cups were consumed.  Total time: 15 minutes.  I took lots of notes and drew graphs etc.<br /><br />Result:<br />Serendipi Tea (5+ stars)  won for sweet smooth flavor, amazing long lasting froth bubbles, and the fact it's organic!!  Cost: $4.30/oz but worth it.  Note on the packaging: For those reviewers complaining of the green tea powder leaking, I have to point out that it's hand packed, with a note explaining that you must pack it yourself in an airtight and light-blocking container.  Fine with me, since this is the best tea I've found, and the act of packing it myself is itself a ZEN moment in which I feel a connection to the individual soul who packed the brown bag by hand just for me.  You decide.<br /><br />Tea Zone (Malden Tea) (4+ stars) came in second for a very nice flavor, but the frothy bubbles popped sooner than the Serendipi Tea, making for a lower rating, and plus, it isn't organic.  But it gets extra points for its low cost:  $2.12/oz (can't beat it for a daily tea).<br /><br />Liquid Jade (3 stars) was an O.K. tea, ever-so-slightly more bitter than the other two I taste tested, and almost a chalky feeling (perhaps it was ground into larger particles than the other teas).  Yes it's organic, always a plus, but at a cost of $6.15/oz, no way will I buy this again when I can get TeaZone 4 stars for a third this cost, and Serendipi Tea 5 stars for significantly less money as well.  So long Liquid Jade (though I do love your container and I'll save it.)
