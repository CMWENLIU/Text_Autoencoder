I ground these with the Messerschmidt grain mill attachment for my Kitchen Aid (no oiliness issue) and I couldn't be happier with the results.  Our poppy seed rolls were some of the best we've ever baked.  The seeds were fresh.  Not bitter.  And because we tend to bake "low sugar", the flavor of the seeds really ... dare I say, "popped!"  Thank you for your quality product.
