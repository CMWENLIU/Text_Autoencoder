This is the authentic product, I can vouch for it since I am from India. The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.<br /><br />The lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).<br /><br />I usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.<br /><br />Once done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.<br /><br />Variations:<br />I sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a "Lamb Vindaloo". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.<br /><br />If you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.<br /><br />Pairing:<br />Pair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy. Yummy!
