McCann's is "just" oatmeal, but it's perhaps the best oatmeal widely available in the United States.  It's made from nothing but 100% whole grain oat kernels which are grown in Ireland and cut in a device similar to a burmill.  The cutting technique provides a much firmer and more complex texture than the rolling which is used on commoditized oatmeal products available in the U.S.  This is not an "instant" or "quick" oat product, and these oats have not been precooked at all.<br /><br />What this means is that McCann's Traditional makes a great bowl of porridge with a fresh grain flavor and an al dente consistency.  This is oatmeal with a natural crunch and tang to it.  Rolled oats -- especially instant, sugar-added, flavored rolled oats -- don't come close.<br /><br />The obverse of this is that you are actually cooking these grains rather than merely heating and stirring a pre-cooked product.  Be prepared to spend some time -- a half hour or so -- in your kitchen  watching over these and stirring them with your spurtle (porridge-stirring spoon).  Consider this a luxury, an excuse to slow down for a while.  You can find cooking ideas and great recipes at goldenspurtle dot com, which is the home page for the world porridge-making championships.  Specialty porridges, made with fresh fruits, liqueurs, and cream sauces, make distinctive desserts if you really want to get creative.<br /><br />A few more things: these oats are kosher, the can looks sharp, and they make great cookies.
