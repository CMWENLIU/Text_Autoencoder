I had to throw it away.....because I couldn't stop eating it!  I tried the Trader joes cookie butter because a friend recommended it and then was told the biscoff spread was better.  I thought "how is that possible?". But it is!  This spread is heaven in a glass jar and unbelievable on an apple.  But beware....it is completely Addicting. I threw it away in a garbage can far away from my home so I would stop eating it.
