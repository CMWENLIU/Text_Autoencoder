I have fed my cats (successive generations) various grocery store and premium cat foods.  I have found that Royal Canin is the best:  ingredients, palatability and results in a can.  My cat is happy, stays at a healthy weight and loves this food.  Having it delivered from Amazon makes it convenient for me too.  Yes, it is pricey, but so are vet bills.
