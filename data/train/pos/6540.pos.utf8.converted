These are the best dried cherries I've found.  Yummy, not too dry, very healthy.  My entire family loves them.<br /><br />I used to order them directly from the company (being in GA I couldn't find this MI product in my local stores) but with my Prime membership it's actually less expensive to buy from Amazon than to buy from the company and pay shipping.
