I LOVE THIS TEA! It is the perfect blend of zippy ginger and refreshing lemon, and not as tart as other lemon-flavored herb teas. I like to add slices of apple and orange (no sweetener needed!) and drink it by the gallon during the day. When I have company, I make up a large pitcher and serve over ice. It gets rave reviews every time.
