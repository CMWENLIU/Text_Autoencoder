If you're going to sip this lusciously delicious tea you might as well grab your kitty or puppy, a good book, blanket and snuggle up in the favorite armchair because good times are ahead!<br /><br />Having the pleasure of all ready trying out some of the Ahmad teas I was pretty sure this was a good purchase but it ended up being tasty beyond my predictions. This tea tastes like a wonderful black smooth tea with the succulent mouth watering flavors of juicy apricots. I prefer a black tea with fruit blend to herbal fruit teas when I want something soothing because the black tea give the fruit unparallel depth and character.<br /><br />This really bursts with flavor when sugar is added and it can be drank day and night. I'm really looking forward to tasting other Ahmad flavors like Strawberry and passion fruit and maybe their Earl Gray. This is easily one of my favorite teas and I can't see anyone not loving it from the first sip!
