First, I wouldn't trust anybody's opinion on a food item because everyone has different tastes. Secondly, these chips are awesome and you should buy them because I say so.  Okay, well, actually, I suggest you go buy one bag somewhere prior to buying a dozen bags and finding out you don't like them.  I do love these chips though.  Most Vinegar/Salt chips are too wangy or tart for me.  These chips have a mildly tart, slightly sweet vinegar flavor.  Also I am a salt-aholic and these chips satisfy my salt cravings perfectly. Texture is similar to other kettle type chips - plenty crunchy.  Totally yummy!  I'm salivating just thinking of them.
