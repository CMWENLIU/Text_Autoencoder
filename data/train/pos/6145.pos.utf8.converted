I am currently a 3rd year Med student who has looked high and low for the ONE (in terms of energy supplements)<br />Without having access to ephedra-containing products (legal-ephedra is NOT ephedra folks), I've had to seek a worthy alternative.<br />I've tried nearly every product out there in terms of energy drinks, coffees, herbals, etc...<br /><br />And this is the absolute BEST of them all.<br /><br />It works well just by consuming a few sips at a time, and beats 5-hr energy (both regular and extra strength) in terms of price and effect.<br /><br />I will be subscribe-n-saving this product for the next 7 years (MS3-4, and PGY1-5) if they continue to produce it.<br /><br />Please, please - give this product a "SHOT".<br />Over n out.
