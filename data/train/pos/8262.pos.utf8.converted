After reading numerous reviews on these beans from JRmushroom and debating on whether or not I really needed them, I finally decided to just go ahead and order. At my local grocery store 1 woody, dried out bean is $7.99! These beans arrived 2 days after I ordered them and the quality is amazing. All of the beans are 6-8 inches long, juicy, plump and full of seeds. They have oily skin (as vanilla beans should) and the aroma is divine. I made vanilla bean cupcakes and vanilla bean ice cream and started homemade extract(half of this pack, about 22 beans). These beans are perfect. I can't believe the quality for the price. If you are debating, go for it. You won't regret it!<br /><br />******UPDATE*******<br />I am still just as pleased with these beans as I was when I first got them. After 3 months of maturation, my homemade vanilla extract is excellent! Dark brown and slightly "syrupy" and it will only get better with age. Total price of the beans used in the extract (22 whole beans, split ~$10.00) and the alcohol (smirnoff vodka750 ml. ~$9.00) just under $20.00 produced an entire quart/32 ouces of fantastic extract and seeing as the "pure" vanilla extract in my grocery is about $6.00 per 2 oz. bottle the savings is tremendous. I would still be saving a fair amount if I purchased vanilla in bulk (like at Costco.) It is simply a win-win.
