HEM's Precious Rose incense is a pleasure lover's delight. Intense and deeply evocative, it conjures the intoxicating scent of times long past, of the best roses at the height of their power.  Perfect for summer afternoons - the heat of the day enhances and is entranced by the pungent billowing profusion of this incense.  I burn this and most incense outdoors usually and it wafts into the house creating a sense of expectation and relaxation.  There's something quite powerful about this Precious Rose, making it one of my very favorites.  It's scent is definite and potent and may not be for everyone, but a sybarite may be smitten.
