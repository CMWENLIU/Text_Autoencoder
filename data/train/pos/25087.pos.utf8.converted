If you are an avid bread machine user I highly recommend getting this. We haven't eaten store bought bread at home for almost 2 years now. I was using active dry yeast in my bread machine and switched when I saw this at a local store. A 7 oz jar at Walmart is like $5.98. I keep it in my fridge after opening and it lasts forever. The bread turns out much better using this. I highly recmoned this product! I love it so much I wont even try Fleischmann's.
