Feeding an addiction to ginger/honey tea and chocolate over the last 3 years has lead to a severe overgrowth of candidias (yeast)throughout my system.  Hence at present I've undertaken a serious change of diet to kill off as much as possible. I purchased fresh MIRACLE BERRIES to help with the sweet cravings.  I'm thanking my Creator for such a berry.  It really works.  And Ethan Gardens is a fantastic vendor to do business with. So helpful, and quick and ready to accomodate. I also purchased the tablets, but of course the fresh berries were much more to the point. I've also purchased seeds to grow and look forward to the good results this summer.
