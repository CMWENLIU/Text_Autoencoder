Not sure why this item has received any bad reviews. These blueberries are just what I needed. Freeze-dried and naturally sweet.<br /><br />Regular/traditionally dried blueberries (not freeze-dried) often have sugar added to make them sweet, which I cannot have, so I am ecstatic that these are so good.<br /><br />I ordered a whole case and none of the blueberries were pulverized, no extra powder, they are all beautiful and whole.
