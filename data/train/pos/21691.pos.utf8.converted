Our dog was put on a "special diet" years ago (he is 9), as a result of constant diarrhea and skin problems. The vet<br />put him on Iam's, which helped with the symptoms, but he always acted as if he was starved. The Taste of the Wild changed<br />all that. He is healthy, active, and satisfied with this food. No diarrhea ever, great consistent bowel movements, good coat<br />and no bad breath.
