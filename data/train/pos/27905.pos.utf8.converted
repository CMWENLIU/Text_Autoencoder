One of my friends gave me an innocent-looking banana, but I should have known something was amiss.<br /><br />"What's this blue fin sticking out of the top?" I asked.<br /><br />"It's for speed."<br /><br />"Oh, of course. That makes sense."<br /><br />If only I had heeded my intuition: I started to peel the banana and--SHARKBANANA ATTACK!
