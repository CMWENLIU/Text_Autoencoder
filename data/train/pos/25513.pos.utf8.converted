They have a nice hard chocolately coating, soft and ever-so-sweet chocolate cake and all wrapped around a swirly layer of creamy filling.  Let me ask you something, DO YOU POSSIBLY NEED ANYTHING ELSE to satisfy that sweet tooth of yours?  I don't think ya do.  I also agree these are pretty addicting, not nearly as bad as coke, there's no crappy come-down, they're a lot cheaper, and don't give nosebleeds!  I'd say those are all the more reasons to buy this wonderful snack food.
