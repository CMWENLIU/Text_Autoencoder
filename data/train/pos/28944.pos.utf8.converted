THis is an outstanding product which I am using to help combat ongoing problems with sinus infections.  I started using this, with my  doctor's ok, after reading about a study at the University of Ottawa on the anti-bacterial properties of manuka honey from New Zealand.  The study showed the honey to be more effective than antibiotics in combating certain bacteria.  This particular honey has a high number (+20) to indicate its strength.  The company sends it in a timely manner with helpful literature.  I use it in the saline nasal rinse that I use twice a day.  I add 1/2 teaspoon of the honey.
