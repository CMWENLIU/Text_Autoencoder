I would be lost without a source for PG Tips pyramid teabags.<br /><br />This is good, everyday tea for a strong, near-lifesaving cuppa.<br /><br />Don't buy it expecting a gourmet experience (this tea doesn't come in wild ginger or peach flavours).  Buy it expecting a good normal cup of tea, miles better than Lipton's floorsweepings or Tetley's pure tannin.
