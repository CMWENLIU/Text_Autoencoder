Let's face it: most store-bought gluten-free bread is absolutely terrible.  This is the best-tasting bread mix for making fresh gluten-free bread at home.  With this mix, I find that if I activate the yeast before mixing the dough and then keep the dough extra-warm after I shape it, I can get the loaf to rise just like wheat bread.  Priceless!<br /><br />It should be noted, however, this is *not* a good mix to use for pancakes or waffles, even if you add your own baking powder.  It is too starchy to make a good pancake or waffle, and it tends to stick to the pan or waffle iron even when plenty of oil is used.<br /><br />Update 12/25/2009: this mix is fantastic for pie crusts!
