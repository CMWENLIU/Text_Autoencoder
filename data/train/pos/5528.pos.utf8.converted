It's winter here, so in a couple weeks I had a good batch of KOMBUCHA tea. It was probably one of the best tastes I've ever had. This is the second time I've made it, the first time I've ordered a mother. The first time I used two bottles of GT kombucha.<br /><br />This seems to be a great deal. The tea tastes great and gives the body buzz.
