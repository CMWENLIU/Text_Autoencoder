I bought this at the health food store.  My initial thought was "This had better be a great product if they have the nerve to charge forty bucks for a bottle of juice!"  I like the fact that I paid for unadulterated acai, and not for a "blend" that includes a lot of stuff I can get at the grocery store at $3 for 64oz.  If you're paying the premium for acai, be sure you're actually getting acai!<br /><br />On its own this juice is thick and bland, but not offensive.<br /><br />Mixed with some sugar-free lemonade, acai juice is very pleasant and I didn't lose out on any of the wholesome goodness.<br /><br />I drank this when I kicked off my eating-right-exercising-regularly behavior two months ago, and I believe the nutrients in this juice were helpful in giving me energy and getting me off to a great start.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this product, and because of my experience with it I recently bought (from other companies) acai berry air freshener spray and acai berry diffuser reeds and even a cologne that has acai scent in it!  I'd drink this product even if it weren't healthy/therapeutic.
