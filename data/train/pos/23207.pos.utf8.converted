I also use this to get the magnesium in my diet.  I pour about a half teaspoon into water, swirl it around to dissolve it, and throw it back like a shot.  Follow with a little coffee and it's over with quickly.  Having enough magnesium gives you great energy - almost like coffee without feeling lousy afterwards.<br /><br />As for the company, the nigari was shipped very quickly and arrived at my office in less than the expected time.  I was impressed enough that I am about to order another bag from them.
