I tried this Ramen on a whim.  I normally steer clear of Ramen noodles because they have a high fat content and the broth pretty much tastes like briny water no matter what flavor you are eating. These noodles are truly delicious. First of all they are organic, which is a draw for me.  Second they are baked, which makes them healthier for those of us who need to be conscious about fat content.  I can't say enough about how tasty these noodles are.  Mixing in the flavor packet, I could actually SEE the lemongrass and ginger.  Super flavorful and very unique.  I love these noodles.  Highly recommended.
