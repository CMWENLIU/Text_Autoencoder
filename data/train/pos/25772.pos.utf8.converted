I was looking for something that would honestly replace the creamer in my coffee.  After months of using only coconut milk, I finally stumbled upon this wonderful product!  It is creamy and only slightly coconut flavored, if you notice it at all.  The package says to use the product within two days of opening but I've kept it in the fridge for two weeks without any change in taste.
