As other reviewers have noted, when they say lemon flavor they mean lemon flavor.  But, my God, are they ever good!  I've tried the cherry and the apple but the lemon are my favorites.  You might even get your kids to eat them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is the kicker--only five items (dates, cashews, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, natural lemon flavor).  Not a bunch of artificial flavors, high-fructose corn syrup, preservatives and the like.
