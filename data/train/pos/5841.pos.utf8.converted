I tried this litter for the health factors, but didn't feel like waiting for the Feline Pine Litter Box to ship (not available on Amazon, only from company website), so I got the Lift 'n Sift variety thinking I could use it the same way since they are similarly constructed. This was not the case. The holes in the LNSift version are too big, and the pellets fall through. The Feline Pine Litter Box (FPLB) has square holes that are 3/16", which is big enough for the sawdust to go through but not the majority of pellets. You would think that the wet pellets/sawdust would get clogged in the holes, but I don't have this problem as long as I don't overfill the box.<br /><br />Using LnSift box: Big waste of litter and more of a mess to clean up than I was expecting. I almost gave up on the litter and then saw other reviews that said the FPLB is a must for you to truly get the full benefit of this litter. With the old box, weekly cleaning was around an hour, with the appropriate box, clean is a few minutes per week.<br /><br />Using FPLB: The key to using this box with minimum work on your end is to FILL IT NO HIGHER THAN 1-2" with litter. Every time I've accidentally overfilled it, there's been a big mess for me to clean up in the end. When the box is filled too high, the sawdust can't get through the pellets and out the holes to the bottom box, which creates tracking and messy litter. And, the bottom box fills up too quickly and you have to try to empty it while keeping the top part from spilling all over. Not fun, and I end up wasting litter doing this. My advice: Take a permanent marker and put a line or mark at the 1" and 2" spots on all sides (inside) of the upper box (measuring up from the bottom of the box with the holes in it). This way you know when to stop pouring.<br /><br />Pros: Healthier litter, no tracking (we find maybe a handful of pellets, no sawdust, outside the box), odors are greatly reduced, easy to clean on a daily basis (we flush the solids and just use the scope to shuffle any leftover sawdust around to get it to sift through the holes), easy to clean on a weekly/biweekly basis (just tip the sawdust filled box into a garbage bag and top off the pellets), one bag of litter lasts us about 3 months if we fill the litter box as noted above (1 cat), fairly simple to transition our cat using the instructions on the Feline Pine website (took about 2 weeks total).<br /><br />Cons: No real cons about the litter now that I'm using it properly and with the right tools, but I wish the FPLB came with a hood (kitty doesn't have the best aim at times...).<br /><br />Additional advice: I didn't like the clumping version of Feline Pine (bought that first before the pellets), but instead of getting rid of it I used the clumping version to lightly line the bottom pan of the FPLB. It's recommended that the bottom box be lined with some pellets to catch any liquids that get through in the first couple of uses to reduce odor, but I just used the clumping version to do the same. Worked great and I didn't have to waste the clumping litter.<br /><br />Also, feeding your cat a species appropriate diet (no grain, raw meat preferrably) has a significant effect on both the amount of waste produced and the odor. We're extremely pleased with the results that a grain-free diet has had for our kitty!
