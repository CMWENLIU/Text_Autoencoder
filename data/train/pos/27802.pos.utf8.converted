I was first introduced to this wonderful tea while in New Zealand.  I enjoyed it so much that when I ran out, tea time wasn't so good anymore.  After drinking Dilmah tea, my taste buds couldn't go back to the tea I once dranked.  So you can imagine my delight when I found out that Dilmah Tea was being sold on Amazon.com.  Now I can enjoy my tea, knowing that I don't have to worry about running out.
