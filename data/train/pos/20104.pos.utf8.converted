My husband and I live in a small town and there was a Lebanese doctor who always used to order a tray of Greek/Mediterranean Pastries for Christmas and it was the highlight of the holiday.  Alas, he moved away and no more trays.  We never knew where he ordered the trays from but the next year, the kids (including my husband) really needed a Baklava fix.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand.  Well, it it didn't last long!  Fights broke out, pieces were stolen... it wasn't pretty.  I'm pretty sure even the woman who cleans our house took a piece.<br /><br />The pastry itself is light and flaky but the filling is dripping with honey and filled with nuts.  The taste is wonderful.  They should put a warning label on this stuff that it is addictive and can cause "civil unrest" within the home.<br /><br />Highly recommended -- particularly if you need to add a few pounds and don't have to share!
