I chose this as a gift for relatives and as I live in Iceland the<br />postage to the USA is very expensive. To be able to order from Amazon, send a greeting with the present, and have it gift wrapped for me is a grand idea! My relatives were very delighted with the chocolates and so was I!! the service was excellent!<br />Thank you Amazon!<br />Karen Elizabeth
