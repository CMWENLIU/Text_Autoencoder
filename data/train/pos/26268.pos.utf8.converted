My 15 year-old cat was on a special diet for digestive problems and she also has diabetes.  When she stopped eating her usual special-formula food, I tried about 10 different kinds of catfood, and this was the only one she liked.  It is easy on her digestion and doesn't interfere with her diabetes. Thank you, Newman's Own!!
