This coffee is delicious. I would assume it's an instant blend, because the K-Cup is completely empty after usage. The caffeine content is low, so it's a great afternoon coffee that won't keep you up at night. If the price stays at 10 dollars with free shipping, it's a good deal. Once they raise the price though, I'm out of here.
