I agree with others that the one or 2 negative reviews amidst all the glowing reviews for each and every Kitchen of India product might be planted by Indian restaurant owners. They are that good. As a lifelong vegetarian I've eaten lots of Indian food at both high end and family style Indian restaurants in New York City. These products are as good as any Indian food I've had. The only exception is the one curry containing spinach because I think spinach gets bitter once prepared. All of the others are excellent. It's hard to believe something this good can come in a freeze dried pouch.<br />As an added bonus it can be stored in the pantry.
