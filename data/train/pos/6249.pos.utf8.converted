This product actually works!! I don't leave reviews for anything, but Neuro Sleep earned one.  I work shift work so it is very hard for me to get a set sleep schedule and that has affected things at home, I feel I'm always tired. I used to value sleep more than other things (I.E dinners, events, ect..) but now using Neuro Sleep I sleep good and on a normal schedule. It relaxes me and helps me fall asleep and stay asleep, I wake up fully and completely rested even if I only get 6 hrs of sleep. Neuro Sleep is amazing and I would recommend it to everyone!!
