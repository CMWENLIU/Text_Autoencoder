These are the freshest vanilla beans you'll find anywhere.  I've made vanilla for myself and a few bottles as gifts, try some in your sugar jar for an interesting flavor and last but not least place a bean wrapped in cloth in your linen closet, etc.  Beanilla Co.ships fast and you will like the way the beans are wrapped for shipping.  #1 in my book....
