I'm not a health nut per se, nor am I a vegetarian. I eat all foods, more healthily than your average American perhaps and prefer organic, but I'll nab a chicken sandwich from McD's in a pinch. But I do run a lot, and fitness buffs might share an experience I get pretty regularly: cravings for vegetables! When you put your body through physical stresses, I think it does a pretty good job of telling you what you need. So veggies really satisfy that craving, both for sustenance and feeling that I'm putting good nutrients in that my body is asking for. And this is where wheatgrass juice fades in...<br /><br />Through a little bird advertisement message or Amazon stumbling, I heard of wheatgrass and decided to investigate. My research pointed towards nutrient info, substantiated and unsubstantiated claims that sum to this: it's at least a healthy serving of veggies, plus maybe some protein, etc. I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I'm now happy to report that wheatgrass is an amazingly refreshing alternative to crunching on or preparing veggies, choking down protein shakes after a run, or satisfying a general craving for something healthy to ingest pretty quickly. I drink usually two scoops at a time, shook up in a blender bottle, or one scoop if it's in the morning before work. After work or a run (H20 plus veggies? gold!), I can enjoy it a bit more, with the two full scoops, 2/3s a bottle full and fully shook up. Letting it sit a few minutes and slowly drinking it allows the powder to dissolve more quickly. If you're two quick, you're likely to get some green blobs in your teeth. But it's not bad, nothing like some stomach turning protein shakes (I am probably burned out on them).<br /><br />And hey, I might live longer, might stay younger, might heal strange diseases. None of that is bad, so who cares if it's not totally true! The only negative I've heard of is from an office mate, who appeared to relay second hand information about the fiber making you 'super-regular', if that makes sense. I'm plenty regular as it is though, and haven't noticed any change in that for better or worse.<br /><br />So take it for what it is, and enjoy some healthy wheatgrass! In case anyone cares, I don't sell the stuff or partake in the health food industry at all...I just buy the stuff! Enjoy!
