I bought these to throw in the counter and sell at our store to make some change.  I sold the whole box almost immediately and continue to subscribe to these.  At a quarter for two we are making money and keeping the drawer stocked with quarters, exactly what we wanted.<br /><br />The only thing I will point out is that these are not a super sized version of the ones you buy in the 1 oz. pouches, imagine one of those squashed to he less thick and more spread out.  It's not a big deal, but I was expecting them to look as they do on the box and they do not.  Plus, the pink and green colors are swirled and do not look like a little watermelon except in shape.<br /><br />Just picky things, so I am still giving five stars because they are a great seller and a great value.
