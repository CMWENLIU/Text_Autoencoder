I'm not a vegan, vegetarian, nutrition freak, hippy, etc.... Yet, somehow, despite some of the reviews I've see, I find this stuff AMAZING.  It tastes great.  I mixed it with milk and loved it...  It doesn't dissolve completely so there is a bit of grainyness to it, but it's mild and didn't bother me in the slightest...<br /><br />Highly recommended...
