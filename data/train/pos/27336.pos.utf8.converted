These sugar free cupcakes are really very good. No one can really expect a sugar free product to taste EXACTLY like the real thing but for what it is, it's very tasty (just like the brand name says). However, this seller is pricing this product way above what the Tastykake website sells them for and 3 times more than what you can get them for at WalMart. I suppose, if you can't find them at your local stores and don't want to settle for something else, you might be tempted to pay $18 for 12 servings.
