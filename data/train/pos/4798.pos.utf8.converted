If you're used to those best-selling boxed raisins that feature a health woman happily working in the fields, get real, and then get Newman's Organic Raisins.<br /><br />These may be the best-tasting grocery raisins you've ever had. Nothing even approaches these for their flavor, texture, and all those Newman Company extras that aficionados like me adore. (We're talking organic ingredients, environmentally sound production, profits donated to the needy, and supporting the goals of one of the most compelling actors of all time, and a heck of a nice guy as well.)<br /><br />But back to the food at hand.<br /><br />These are plump, JUICY raisins, startlingly different from the usual fare. I don't know how they do it, but Newman's Organic California Raisns retain their natural flavor; pleasant scent, and a succulent mouth feel that one expects from fine port.  One "secret" may be the ingredients: Raisins. C'est tout. Make that ingredient, in fact. THe only thing missing is Newman's usual story on the package--usually some wild, adventurous story shedding light on the product, and featuring Mr. Newman as raconteur-narrator.  Perhaps with raisins this classically delicious, we must resort to the Latin --"Res Ipsa Loquitor" -- the thing speaks for itself.
