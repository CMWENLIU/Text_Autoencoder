My all-time favorite coconut flavored tea has been Golden Moon's Coconut Pouchong and I was trying to branch out to see what else was there. Normal coconut flavorings seem very heavy and overpowering to me - especially over the actual tea. This tea was exquisitely flavored - very delicate flavor of coconut over  white tea that just soothes me and relaxes me with flavor and aroma!
