They should of used this type of bottles for ages.  Use to come in tin cans, typically I use it once, and it rots away because there is no good way to store it after opening.  Even though this bottle is a bit more costly, but use it, wash it, then buy the tin cans to refill it.  Eco friendly and pocket friendly :)
