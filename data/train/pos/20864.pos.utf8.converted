Black walnuts represent a taste remembered from childhood.  Not to be confused with the easily-obtained Eastern Walnuts, these black walnuts have a characteristic flavor that can't be duplicated.  When used in oatmeal cookies, they produced a flavor that transported us back to when we used to collect and shell these delicious treats.  These nuts, from Superior Nut Company were well-packaged in resealable bags, and can be kept in the freezer for freshness.
