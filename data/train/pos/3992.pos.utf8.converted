My husband loves the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn, but it's hard to find in our area anymore....guess it doesn't sell well due to the calorie content!  I did find it on Amazon, but only in large quantities which isn't what we need. I found this topping on Amazon, and because of the reviews I decided to buy it for him to try.  He loves it!  It smells great, no rancid smell, and he says it's just as good as the stuff that is packaged with the popcorn; may be the same stuff altogether.  It's less expensive to buy this bottle and the regular boxed popcorn, than to purchase the larger quantities of the Movie Theater Buttery Popcorn.
