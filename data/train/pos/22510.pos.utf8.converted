I first used this product in 2005 when I lived in London and I used it until I moved to the US at the end of 2007 when my son was almost 3.  I found it to be absolutely invaluable.  My son never ate a jar of baby food - not once, because of this handy gadget.  All of his food for the first year was made in this and he was still eating food prepared in it when we left the UK.<br /><br />The pros for us was that it eliminated the need for 2 separate (and usually bulky) appliances (very handy in our Central London apartment) and it allowed us to prepare food for our son when we travelled which we did extensively.  This item travelled (and cooked) in Morocco, Amsterdam, New York, Washington DC, the Caribbean, the Alps and many other places.  Wherever there was an electricity socket we could use it.<br /><br />The best thing about it though is that this appliance is BPA and PVC (phthalate) free.  I know that many American parents are not as across this issue of toxic chemicals as the Europeans and the Canadians but it is a hugely important topic for young children.  Heating food in plastic is something you have to be very careful about, especially if you are feeding young children.  I'm simplifying this but in a nutshell BPA and phthalates have the ability to mimic the female hormone estrogen and interfere with the production of the male hormone (testosterone) amongst other things.  These chemicals are implicated in diseases such as breast cancer, testicular cancer, lowered sperm counts and defective sperm and diabetes.  Studies have shown that plastics, when heated, can leach (pass on) these chemicals.  Food and fluid heated in plastic containers or devices that contain these chemicals, will contain these chemicals in them also.  Chemicals that you (or your child) then eat.<br /><br />If your family eats lots of steamed vegetables etc then you will probably have a steamer that you are already using and I agree if you are steaming for a family then this is simply too small, but it worked perfectly for us and I would often steam food for us (spinach, baby carrots etc) from time to time.<br /><br />I never had a problem with mold or brown fluid!! (Also I am not sure you can blame an appliance for mold!)<br /><br />In a nutshell if you can afford it and want to make your own baby food, I cannot recommend this more highly.  I am pregnant again and am so happy that this is now available in the US.  I cannot wait to use it again.
