Being allergic to dairy, gluten and not wanting to eat soy due to the health problems associated with heavy soy consumption, I looked into hemp protein as a source of easily digestible protein to help bulk up when working out.<br /><br />Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised and have ordered 4 more canisters of ruth's hemp protein powder(2 just hemp, 2 with sprouted flax) and will order more of the Maca when I run out as this one contains Maca and it's advisable to only take 5g of Maca per day(1 serving of this has 5g) since it's just an effective energy booster.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all. I mix a scoop of the powder with some unsweetened almond milk, just a bit of fruit and some chia seeds and it tastes good. It does have a bit of an earthy taste, a kick of sorts but it doesn't bother me at all and I'm glad that you don't have to add tons of sugary fruit to cover up the taste.<br /><br />As far as how it works, the powder is a great meal replacement or another meal if you're trying to gain weight. The powder itself provides 11g of Protein(with the sprouted flax one providing 13g and the standalone hemp powder one providing 15g) and they all have about 120-140 calories so adding 2 scoops, some milk and some fruit and even some nuts is a good calorie boost. It also provides a lot of energy due to the protein being easily assimilated and the maca being an excellent energy booster on its own.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this thing is a champ with a great Omega 6:Omega 3 ratio(3:1 which is the optimal healthy range) as well as being a great source of dietary fiber to keep the intestinal tract healthy and having many vitamins and minerals(being an excellent source of Zinc and Vitamin E, 2 minerals which can be hard to get in our daily diets). Overall, this a great product that I recommend wholeheartedly and will continue to use for a while.
