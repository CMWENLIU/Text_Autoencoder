I have enjoyed over 200 single origin estate grown coffees from various world markets - Blue Horse ranks at or near the top of the list. Perfect medium roast, super fresh product that yields an incredibly smooth taste in the cup with absolutely no bitterness. Have used both french press and Technivorm drip machine with equally good results...will be back for more.
