I'm comparing this to Lavazza Cafe Espresso and Lavazza In Blue.  I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso. Still waiting to try Oro and Illy Dark roast.<br />Lavazza Cafe Espresso would get 3.5/5 from me. In Blue would get 4/5, Illy 4.5/5.
