my baby eats these snacks frequently. They dissolve in the mouth easily. I like them too.  If you have to worry about food allergies, these are great b/c it is in a nut/peanut free facility.<br /><br />The apples & pears are the best. The peaches are ok...not as sweet, kind of bitter.  They also make potato chips which aren't fried or baked! They aren't as good though as regular chips, but a much better alternative.<br /><br />I love these products & glad to see Amazon is finally carrying them
