If you've ever peeled and cut whole mangos you'll appreciate this can of delicious prepared mangos.  There has to be 2 or 3 whole mangos per can.  If they would use the natural mango juice instead of light sugary syrup they would have a HIT on their hands.  Still, even with the high sugar content, these canned mangos are terrific as a cake or ice cream topping or even just by themselves.  I will be buying this product again when it's in stock and on sale again.  If you like mangos and can tolerate some added sugar, I highly recommend this canned fruit.  Roland does a nice job with their fruits but stay away from their vegetables.
