I'm a bi-racial woman with fine naturally curly hair and I've been looking for something that would moisturize without weighing my hair down, so I took to the web and did some research.  COCONUT (my favorite smell) OIL kept coming up, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've used Olive Oil and found it to be too heavy and it really doesn't smell that great in my opinion.  The day I got the Coconut Oil I put a few tablespoons in a dish, warmed it in the microwave (which I've now found out you shouldn't do, stovetop warming is better) I parted my hair in sections and then brushed the oil in my hair with a hair dye brush, wrapped my head in plastic wrap (attractive right) and let it sit for a couple of hours while I did housework.  When I washed out the oil it only took one shampooing, which surprised me (olive oil always took two) I conditioned and then dried my hair with a blow dryer and smoothed it out with my in-styler and let me tell you my hair was so smooth and silky and shiny! I was amazed! Now mind you my hair isn't in bad condition, not dry or frizzy, I do color it dark brown because I have to cover those grays.  I used to get some poof in the crown area, but after the coconut oil there is none.  I use it once a week and I've noticed that my hair is fuller as well, very happy with the product and the results! I have 3 daughters with very thick curly hair and I use it for them as well.  The oil can also be used on skin and it's not greasy at all.
