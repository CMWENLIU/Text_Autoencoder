1) I use a 1/2 cup of Dannon NonFat Plain Yoghurt (per the instructions) and find that even without butter or milk, the sauce is creamy, tangy, perfect.<br /><br />2) Tabasco for a kick<br /><br />3) Parsley (dried will do) because it is awesome.<br /><br />4) Cracked red and black pepper because that's how I roll.<br /><br />5) Tuna if you like tuna.<br /><br />Result = wholesome joy.
