Cacao bean, unrefined cane sugar, and chili. That's all, and it's all organic. If the chili/chocolate mix sounds odd, think of Mexican mole sauce - this stays close to chocolate's Aztec origins. I don't judge the preparation by what goes in, though, it's the outcome that matters.<br /><br />What comes out is the richest chocolate taste I've ever found. This pushes far into the dark side of chocolate flavor (I mean that in a good way), but without the astringence of some of the darkest. Flavors emerge in layers on top of that bitter-sweet base: a pleasant tartness followed by a fruity overtone like none I've ever tasted, leading eventually to a mild chili tingle just vivid enough to make you pay attention. This thoroughly grown-up flavor pairs well with fresh fruit or fine spirits - I wish I had some calvados in the house. That would be an outrageous combination.<br /><br />The package advertises a 'rustic' texture. If you're used to the silky smoothness of Godiva and the like, get your tongue ready for sandpaper. Outside of that (and the premium price), I find nothing to complain about here. Taza makes other flavors in this line, including cinammon, vanilla, and cacao puro. Based on my experience with the chili chocolate, I'll be happy to try them all.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
