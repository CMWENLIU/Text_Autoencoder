I was brought up drinking this caffeine free tea at home in South Africa and now my sons enjoys it so much that I'm considering buying in bulk.  He drinks it with soy milk and a little honey, and can't seem to get enough of it.<br /><br />I'm just glad I'm able to get it here in the US now.<br /><br />Buying it like this is also a much better deal than in some stores.
