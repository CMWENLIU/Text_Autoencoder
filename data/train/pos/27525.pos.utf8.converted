I do freezer jams using agar to set them instead of pectin because it costs a lot less, and we go through a lot of jam in our household. Using agar to set the jellies means that I can use a lot less sugar and get something like a fruit spread.<br />This is a reliable product, just be careful not to get any water in the jar, measure out what you need, then seal it back up. If you're making a recipe you usually use gelatin with, use less agar, start with half the amount called for, then increase as necessary. Agar gels up very firmly if you're not working with high acidic fruits and it's pretty stable once it's gelled even at room temperature.<br />Recipes for kanten call for agar frequently, and agar makes a good vegan substitute for gelatin, but it's not as nutritious as gelatin. It is a decent source of dietary fiber though.<br />I still use gelatin for some recipes, and agar for others. Agar doesn't have the faint smell that gelatin has so for a lot of desserts, it is preferable. For a good dessert book that uses agar as an ingredient, I suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4915831922">Q&E Chilled Desserts from the Japanese Kitchen (Quick and Easy Series)</a>.
