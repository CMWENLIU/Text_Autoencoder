This is not your little shipment-stale curry powder from India nor locally made Swad company's innocuous curry powder. This is work of art. A little of it goes a long way. It is highly aromatic and intense. I am obsessed with this spice. I just made  a simple dinner for a diabetic friend of mine. He was in tears when he said this was just awesome sauteed fish (buffalo fish fillet with lovely innards and silverfish) and vegetables (string beans and cauliflorets) he ever had. Little sea salt and this curry powder were all I needed to get a rave review like that. Another friend also commented when I made sauteed potatoes with this dry rub: ''What is this wicked thing you made? This is totally aphrodisiac.'' If your kids do not eat veggies, just dry rub this a little bit with sea salt and olive oil, and see what they say. My kid hates potatoes with a gusto but when it is made with this curry powder, he'd say: ''I do not know what to say.I hate potatoes but this is awesome.'' I always keep it handy wherever I go. My local organic market does not have it all the time (My Organic Market). They said it is the most sold item. Its base of organic turmeric powder is a panacea for all kinds of stomach ailment, so it is good to make this part of your diet.
