I stumbled on Ann's Soy Energy Blend at Costco about two months ago.  I've been buying two tubs every two weeks since.  My husband & teenage son won't touch it, but my toddler & I eat some every day.  I have to have protein to keep from shaking during the day & often I'm not even hungry enough to eat anything, so the Soy Energy Blend makes a perfect snack that gives me the boost I need without making me feel like I overate.  It's also a great movie night guilt-free snack.  I know the soy nuts can seem bland, but they've honestly grown on me.  Whereas I used to pick out the cranberries & almonds first, now I only eat about half of those, letting my toddler pick them out for herself instead.  Now, the reason I'm here.  I ran out yesterday & made a special trip to Costco today for more.  They're all sold out!  I did an online search to see if I could find them anywhere else in my area & found them here.  But $22.00?!  Seriously? I pay just under $7 for the 36oz tub at Costco!  If they don't start carrying them again I'll have to start buying the items in bulk & making my own mix.  Cause this price is simply outrageous.  UPDATE:  February 2012 - Costco has them back in stock!  $6.99 a tub.  It's the first aisle I check every trip and today I bought 4 tubs.  :)
