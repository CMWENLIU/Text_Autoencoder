I have been using Smart Sugar for 2+ years, but then the local grocery stopped carrying it. So sad. I am pre-diabetic and lactose intolerant, so I make a fab ice cream using smart sugar and coconut milk in a Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. So easy and tastes great. Smart sugar also does well in baking cakes & other baked goods. I have tried pineapple upside down cake and date cake as well as bran muffins. If you use this Smart sugar with a high protein, high fiber soy, coconut, and ancient grain flour mix, the carbs stay really low on baked goods and is balanced by high fiber. Enjoy! Thank you Amazon for marketing this great product. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FV9VSC">Smart Sugar</a>
