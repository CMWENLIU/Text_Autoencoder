I have an addiction to 7-11's Cappuccino, and buying one of those everyday adds up quickly. I have been looking for a replacement to 7-11's for sometime and have not found one until now. I decided to purchase this item and try it and do not regret it in the least. This is even better than 7-11's and a lot cheaper. If you like French Vanilla Cappuccino you should definitely try this, I do not think you will be disappointed.<br />I purchased the 6 pack from Amazon, not the 3 pack.
