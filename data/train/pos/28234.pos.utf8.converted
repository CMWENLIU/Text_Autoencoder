Sometimes, you just don't want to deal with traffic, and waiting, and tipping, and hasty ahjumas that rush you out of your table. Sometimes you just want a bowl of hot noodles right here at home and you don't want to mess around with lengthy prep. I make the noodles first and rinse them. I make the sop  mix and poach an egg in it (YUM!), then add some tofu, and drop in some bok choy. Finally, neatly pile the noodles in a big bowl and pour the liquid over...top with an abundant pile of thin sliced green onion. Done! The whole operation takes about 10 minutes tops. If you skip all the add-ins, you are eating withing 3 minutes of thinking, "hmmmm, noodles!". No MSG, lo-salt, and the noodles are NOT fried.
