These are delicious sun dried tomatoes and a better value than those in jars in the grocery. We use them to add bold flavor to pasta and salads. We even eat them right out of the bag. And the bag makes them portable. I take them to work and we can throw them in our picnic basket or backpack without the weight of a jar. They are moist from the bag and not heavy with olive oil as most are packed. I strongly recommend them :)
