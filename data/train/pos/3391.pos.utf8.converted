As a clean-eating vegan, I can't help but love everything about Larabars. Most of them taste great, and you can't beat an ingredient list this short. Of all the vegan flavors, I have to say the peanut cookie is the BEST. Ginger snap and apple pie are also great. The blueberry muffin is heinous, though. Steer clear of that one!
