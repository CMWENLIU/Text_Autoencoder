Lakewood's ORGANIC 100% PURE Pomegranate Juice is expensive compared to Wild Oats's brand, but it's organic (Wild Oats' is not), and pure pomegranate. The flavor is outstanding, and it come in glass bottles, a definite plus over plastic. Shipping was reasonably fast and the packing was also outstanding. My only complaint: I wish shipping would fall under Amazon Prime, but alas it does not. To me, Lakewood's Organic Pure Pomegranate Juice is the best choice in the pomegranate juice market.
