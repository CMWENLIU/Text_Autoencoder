Fortunately, I do not suffer from IBS (my sympathies to those who do); however, minor health issues and a diet that includes sugar-free products and a lot of fruits and veggies often lead to uncomfortable bloating and an upset tummy.  Further, I've been trying to lose weight and haven't had much luck with a few stubborn, remaining pounds.  So, when I stumbled across a website that heralded "Heather's Tummy Tea Fennel" as beneficial for bloating, it tweaked my interest.  After further research revealed fennel's usefulness for tummy pain and, possibly, weight loss I decided to give this product a try.<br /><br />So far, I love this tea.  It works like a charm on stomach problems and my tummy has felt much better while on my current diet.  Although I've only used this tea for two  or three days, I've already noticed slightly less tummy bloating and the scale was down a couple of pounds this morning.  So, for my money, this product has been doing exactly what users claim it does.<br /><br />In fact, it also yielded a very unexpected benefit in my case.  I've suffered with chronic muscle pain for 8+ years following an on-the-job injury.  I've been having an especially bad flareup with my shoulder for the last several days.  The usual treatments--heat, massage, painkillers, stretches, etc--have not been helping so I've been in agony.  Then, yesterday, I drank a cup of this tea for my tummy and promptly forgot about it on my way out the door to do errands.  About an hour later, I suddenly realized that my shoulder and neck weren't hurting anymore.  Since I hadn't done anything else to help the pain that day and had not taken any pain medication, I can only assume the fennel must have helped relax the spasm in my shoulder and neck.  Whatever it did, I was most grateful.<br /><br />Anyway, even if Heather's fennel tummy tea didn't do anything at all to help my various pains and discomforts, I would still love it because it tastes fantastic.  I steep it for 10 minutes--as the package directs--and then add Splenda sweetener and a bit of milk...it is sooo tasty and is a real treat for someone who can't eat sugary goodies.  I also love that it's all natural and uses whole seeds.  When the majority of products these days are overly-processed and/or have sugar and other crap added, it's really nice to find something that has been left the way Mother Nature intended.  I very, very highly recommend.
