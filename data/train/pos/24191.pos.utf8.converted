My 8 month old son gets 50% breast milk, 50% formula. Of course breast is best, but we all know how that goes when returning to work...supply was not possible to be met for my son. The week I went back to work, be it stress, lack of time with baby latching on, etc...I couldn't pump nearly enough..If you're like me, and need to supplement, even if you don't want to, consider this about Baby's Only Organic formula:<br /><br />1. No synthetic DHA added. Recent findings show that DHA added to infant formula (in all cases of organic formulas including Earth's Best, except Baby's Only) is extracted from fungus and algae, using hexane solvents, bleach etc - As a biochemist, this is disconcerting. Hexane is a human neurotoxin and narcotic agent. Organic ingredient? Not in the slightest. It will damage nerves, brain, heart and who knows what else. Believe it or not, the FDA doesn't have a regulation on hexane extractions in food.. . The best source of DHA are natural sources, not synthetic. Good DHA sources are animal-based (eggs, fish, meat, etc) and of course are found in breast milk. The fact that no synthetic DHA is included was the #1 seller for me on this formula. Also, Baby's Only manufacturer sells a separate supplement of DHA that you can add to the formula, which is egg-yolk based - all natural. Some might be concerned about egg allergies - Most egg allergies come from the proteins in the egg white, not the yolk, but in the very rare chance that the egg yolk could cause an allergy, it's nice that they sell it separately and not mixed in the formula.<br /><br />2. Only 60% lactose may be a good thing...in response to ahbnyc's comment<br /><br />"Earth's Best uses Lactose as their primary sugar (carb source). In human breast milk, lactose is almost the exclusive source for carbs...exactly the same as Earth's Best. Again on the Baby's Only website they claim lactose to be inferior to their brown rice syrup. How can they do this?? They show no evidence to support their claim, especially when Lactose is what's in breast milk!!"<br /><br />According to the American Pregnancy Association, lactose accounts for approximately 40% of the total calories provided by breast milk. Why is it that when infants are started on lactose-based formula, so many have problems digesting it and then many assume they are lactose intolerant and are given soy or lactose-free formulas?? Isn't this counter intuative if human milk is lactose based? True lactose intolerance in babies is extremely rare - Did anyone ever wonder if the commercial formulas contain WAY more lactose than a baby's sensitive system can handle and way more than is found in breast milk? It is possible to have too much lactose in a baby's diet and this may be why they have problems when switched to formula while the same baby may be fine with breast milk. Also, lactose is a simple sugar which easily spikes insulin levels, contributing to overly plump babies that have a higher risk of obesity later in life. Just look at the growth chart differences of formula-fed vs. breast-fed babies. Rice syrup takes longer to break-down as it's more complex, and won't spike insulin levels like lactose. Rice syrup may not be suitable for a newborn - true. But Nature's One - Baby's Only manufacturer clearly recommends breast is best for newborns...There may be no perfect formula for a newborn.<br /><br />3. No cane sugar. Similac Organic is garbage because they add cane sugar as a source of carbs. Way to add to the child diabetic epidemic.<br /><br />4. It's way less expensive than Earth's Best.<br /><br />I recommend this formula - my son has had no problems with it and I feel good knowing he's getting ALL organic ingredients.
