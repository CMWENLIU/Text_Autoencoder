I received these as a gift, absolutely unexpected.  I am greatly pleased with the glasses.  The long glass allows for aromatics to be released by the heat of one's hand and reach the nose in a sequence of small discoveries.  The shaped lip does the same for the liquid as it crosses the lips and expands into the mouth.<br /><br />These really do increase the pleasure of fine single malts.
