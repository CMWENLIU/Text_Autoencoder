I am an adult who has been allergic to peanuts since childhood. I have never eaten peanut butter, but have always been envious of the idea of peanut butter...a quick, tasty, healthful food that goes with a multitude of other things and is found in recipes everywhere. Unfortunately, since peanuts = death for me, I put it out of my mind. Then one day I found this Sunbutter. Not only is it peanut and tree nut free, it explicitly states on the label that it is manufactured in a facilty that is peanut and nut free. A good thing, because it was with fear and trepidation that I opened and then tasted sunbutter...I mean, it looks and smells just like peanut butter. Obviously, I can't say if it tastes like peanut butter, but I can say that it is DELICIOUS! I have been gleefully eating it on crackers, with apple slices, on sandwiches, and out of the jar straight. It is a major food discovery for me, and I am oh so thankful.
