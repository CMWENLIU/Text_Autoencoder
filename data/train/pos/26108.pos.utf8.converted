San Pellegrino, Limonata; still manufactured in Italy. Still the same great intense lemon flavor without all the sweetness. A beverage to be savored and drunk slowly. They're now packaged in this more American, big old serving size, almost 12 ounces. I loved this drink when it was in those little tiny 3 or 4 ounce bottles.
