I can give her a tiny crumb and she'd be thrilled.  This bag is going to last me months.  She will do anything for a chance at a lamb munchie.<br /><br />When she was a puppy, she wouldn't touch any treats.  I brought her to a doggy bakery - we spent 15 minutes trying to get her to eat all sorts of treats.  Finally the lady pulls out one of these lamb treats and says 'when all else fails'.  Sure enough :)
