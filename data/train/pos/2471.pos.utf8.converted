Great organic seeds, they appear to be almost unwashed - smell like soil.  They aren't that great for cooking at all.  They have an odd residue coating them that you can get rid of with water, but then the seeds are useless!<br /><br />Stay away if you want quality seeds to COOK with, I'M VERY HIGHly informed on quality seeds.
