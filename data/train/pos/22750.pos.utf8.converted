This is your basic Easy Mac.  I actually prefer this packaging over the version that comes with its own little bowl.  If you have a measuring cup that can measure 2/3 of a cup, and a bowl, you don't need to get the kind with the bowls, which I find wasteful.  Either way, they are a great snack.  I think they have 260 calories, so they are not a meal.  Either way, if you've had Easy Mac before, and like it, this is the same stuff.  If you are picky about your macaroni, this is not the macaroni for you.<br /><br />If you really find it bland you can always do what I do an put a little bit of sriracha in right before you eat it.
