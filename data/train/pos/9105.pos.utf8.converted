These 6 oz packs of organic California prunes have more flavor than the non-organic brands. They are also drier and firmer, which I wasn't sure I liked at first. I quickly grew used to it and now I prefer them this way. They are sweet and chewy.<br /><br />The freshness date is 16 months in the future, so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have.<br /><br />You can't go wrong at this price for 12 bags. This is one brand you can trust<br /><br />Update 10/31/10  I bought some more of the prunes recently and they are not dry and firm anymore. Now they seem like they've been steamed because they are very moist and the inside of the bag has prune gunk stuck to the sides. If you stick your hand in the bag, it will come out pruned, so I use a fork.  They taste fine, but I was a little taken aback when I first opened them.
