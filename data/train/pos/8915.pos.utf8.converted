This is a great buy!  I was purchasing Organic Kefir at the store & that really gets costly!  Not only is it expensive but talk about going through way too many plastic bottles.  Not exactly environmentally friendly!  It's very easy to make once you get the hang of it & it doesn't take long to get the hang of.  I've read that you don't have to refrigerate it...I haven't had the nerve to take it that far yet.  Kefir is very good for you.  It is reported that it has more beneficial bugs than yogurt!  Plain kefir has a cheesy taste.  I like to describe it has drinking cheese!  I love cheese!  You can sweeten it if you like, but I think that takes away from it's healthy purpose.  It also is a very satisfying drink.  I like to have it with a light breakfast or lunch.  It's a stick to the ribs kind of drink to helps stave off hunger.  Try it!  Your body will thank you, showing it's thanks in the great way it will make you feel!
