We had a 16 yr old tortie that developed an extreme vomiting problem.  I began to research and found that this can be caused by allergies to corn and various other grain products.  During my research I was also surprised to learn that cats really do eat a 100% meat diet.  Unlike other carnivores, such as bears, who eat berries and other such plant life, it is relatively unnecessary for cats.  After several trips to the vet we also discovered our old kitty had feline diabetes.  I researched this as well and found that diabetes does not occur naturally in cats and is primarily caused by the high grain content (read: carbs) in regular cat food.  Before we discovered the diabetes I had been searching for a cat food that had as little grain (primarily corn products) in it as possible and tried several brands over the course of probably a year.  Once we discovered the feline diabetes I found Wellness Core.  It was grain free and used only high quality protein sources in the first 5 ingredients (note: if your first ingredient is a corn product, pass on that food).  The Core immediately remedied the vomiting problem.  Unfortunately, we found out too late about her diabetes which had caused other health complications and she passed away from those complications.  A few months later we brought home two new kittens and started them on Wellness Core immediately.<br /><br />Once I discovered all the adverse effects that can be caused by standard cat food that was enough for me.  I learned too late with our Aiki, and I wasn't about to feed our new kittens anything but the best.  Now they're about 1 1/2 years old.  They love Core, their coats are shiny and healthy, are energetic, and have healthy weights (recent vet visit, 9 and 10 lbs respectively).  To me the added cost is worth it.  It will save in added vet bills in the future.  I wanted to start our kittens off with the best chance at a happy healthy life.  I still have the guilt of not knowing about feline diabetes and how easy it is to treat if caught early enough and given the right diet.  I would never switch to any other food.<br /><br />In response to some readers concerns about urinary crystals, this happens when you feed cats 100% dry cat food and happens most frequently in males.  You have to occasionally give your cats wet cat food to prevent these crystals.  I suspect if they developed the crystals within a week or so of starting on Core that they had a preexisting condition they may have been exacerbated by the change in diet.  I recommend this food to anyone wanting a high quality grain free cat food.
