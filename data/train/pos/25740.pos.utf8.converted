For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the "Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost "Two-forty" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to "legendary" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its "Star Quality" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake!  And...it's pretty!  What more could a person want?
