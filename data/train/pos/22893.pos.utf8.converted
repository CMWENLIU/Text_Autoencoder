I'm from Turin (Italy) and I'm used to the real Gianduiotti.<br /><br />I'm living in Texas now, so I decided to give these Gianduiotti a try.<br /><br />They are not the typical Italian brand product manufactured abroad. They are the real thing, imported from Piedmont.<br /><br />The shipment was perfect. At the end of July, when shipping chocolate is very difficult, the package was shipped by air and it contained a ice bag. The chocolate arrived in perfect condition. Top quality chocolate.<br /><br />Great service.
