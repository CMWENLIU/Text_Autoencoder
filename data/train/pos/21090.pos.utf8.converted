Chlorine kills yeast;  You didn't use tap water did you?<br />Champagne yeast is a slower yeast. I would suggest creating a starter batch first.<br />Buy an Erlenmeyer flask and an airlock. (or a yeast starter kit.<br />Pitch yeast distilled non chlorinated water (your favorite bottled water) and yeast nutriant(Sugar) into the flask.<br />Apply the airlock to the top of the flask. Place in a dark place at around 70 - 75 degrees.<br />(A closet or pantry) Return in a few days, you should have a yeast culture ready to use!<br />(Throw the yeast into some apple juice!)  :)
