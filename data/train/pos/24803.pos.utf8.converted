I'm a group exercise instructor who suffers from frequent and severe low blood sugar.  I've been through all sorts of different bars and these are hands down THE BEST.  They taste great, have 6g of dietary fiber and 11g of protein, low in fat....chocolate tastes exactly like a Crunch bar.<br /><br />I noticed a difference in my blood sugar stability the first morning I had one.  I usually can't go without eating something for more than an hour and a half, but these carried me about 3 hours before I realized I needed to eat again.  That says a LOT!  I'm not even going to try the 9 hour claim it makes, but that's just me.<br /><br />LOVE THEM and I'll cry if they ever discontinue them!!
