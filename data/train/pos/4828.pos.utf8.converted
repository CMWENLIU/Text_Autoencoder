Without getting into a discussion of how "organic" it is or isn't.  There is one crucial thing you need to know about this product: for about 100 years Heinz ketchup (like Coca-Cola) was sweetened with sugar when a switch was made to high-fructose corn syrup.  Cheaper due to government farm subsidies for Heinz to use but not the same taste.  This Heinz Organic Ketchup uses sugar like the old days and the taste is instantly noticeable.  That's why we buy it.  The fact that we are reducing our high fructose corn syrup intake is of course a plus.
