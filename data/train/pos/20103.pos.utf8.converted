This was the first time I've tried any of the Frontier Soups (hadn't heard of the brand prior, and was never available at my local supermarket), and I love it! I would have given it six stars, if I could...:)<br /><br />Talk about hearty! This "Ohio Valley Vegetable Soup" blend is all natural, wholesome and quite frankly, chock full of good stuff! I've never seen so many whole veggies in a soup mix before. In the package, you will find dried corn, zucchini, string beans, peas, peppers, celery, carrots, onions, herbs, brown rice and pasta...even a bay leaf; very impressive! To complete the soup, they suggest you add chicken or veggie broth, sugar snap peas, lemon juice and garlic(you may also add chicken or turkey meat, unless you wish to leave it vegetarian). No additional salt is added, so it's very low sodium (20 mg), but you might wish to add a little for flavor. Each bag makes 6-8 servings (approx. 1 cup each).<br /><br />I can easily see keeping this in my cupboard as a "staple"...and I believe you will too once you try it!
