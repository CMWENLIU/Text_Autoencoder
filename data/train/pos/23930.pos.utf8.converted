Most GF bread that I've tried is not very palatable to me for various reasons.  If you've tried it, you probably already know what I mean.  Not so with these little rolls, they're are actually tasty!  They come 4 in a plastic pouch, not compartmented, just all in there together.  Once opened, the extra's (if there are any) keep well in the fridge.  Each roll is on average 3 inches square, and around 2 inches thick.  Fairly light density.  Not pre-sliced.  Soft, porous interior.  Lightly browned top and bottom.  They come lightly dusted on the outside with GF flour.  Texture is similar to wheat bread.  Taste is light, mildly yeasty, and not overly sweet.  This roll is good as a dinner roll, small burger bun, small sandwich roll, etc.  Unopened, they are shelf stable.  The last order that I placed with Schar, I received in mid October 2011, with a "best before" date of March 5, 2012.  The rolls are parbaked (pre-baked, but you complete the baking with 8-10 minutes in a 400 degree oven), but they are good to me right out of the package.  Schar also makes parbaked sub rolls and baguettes.  Hope you enjoy these as much as I have!
