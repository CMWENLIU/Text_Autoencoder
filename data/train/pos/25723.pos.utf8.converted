This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day. I particularly like the fresh blend in Stash brand and I think this particular brand makes superior mint tea over other fancy tea brands. My husband and I each have a box in our separate offices and a box at home at all times. Yes, it really is that good- just try it and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />On a related note- we have tried the Moroccan Mint bags and the Premium Peppermint is much better.
