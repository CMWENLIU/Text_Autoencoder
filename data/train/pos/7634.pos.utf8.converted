Nutiva Organic Coconut Oil is the finest coconut oil available. It's taste, texture, and purity is addictively delicious. I use it to make salad dressings, sautee with it, put it in smoothies, drizzle it on yogurt (creating a creme brulee-like crust), and use it as a spread on english muffins...try adding raw honey on top of it for a taste sensation. When you discover the health benefits of coconut oil, you'll understand why this product is one of the greatest gifts you can give to your family when you feed them.
