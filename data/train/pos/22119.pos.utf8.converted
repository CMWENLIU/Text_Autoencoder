This cinnamon has a rich warm flavor that will remind you of a Vietnamese cinnamon, it is not your typical Ceylon. Forget about how easy it is to tuck in a purse or briefcase. Forget how it will enhance every single cup of restaurant coffee or bland white rice.  Studies have come out touting cinnamon's ability to stabilize blood sugar, so I gave a tin to a diabetic friend. She claimed that after a teaspoon a day, within a week she noticed a difference. How amazing that something so delightfully flavorful might (for some) have a health benefit!  I sprinkle it in lentil soup, meatloaf, spaghetti sauce, on toast, and in anything chocolate. Any 'foodie' would love this elegant little tin.
