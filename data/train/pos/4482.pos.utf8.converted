I don't know how they prepare it, but somehow, this drink is much tastier than anything I can ever make myself with the same ingredients...ACV, honey and water. How do you do it, guys?<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is the best workout drink ever. Whatever magic ACV has, if I start getting fatigued during an intense workout, a sip from a bottle of this acts like some sort of reset and lets me keep going, amazing stuff. I take it on the bike, too! Instant recovery after climbing a steep hill.<br /><br />Hippocrates apparently knew something, alright.
