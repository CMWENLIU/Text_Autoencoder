Mochi is a rice cake made out of sweet rice, which is very sticky rice. Eden's Mochi is made of sprouted brown rice, which is famous for its health benefit. The ingredients for this super tasty mochi is only sweet brown rice. It's fairly expensive, but it's pretty expensive anyways if you buy white mochi that is not too healthy but okay. It comes with the benefit of brown rice, such as Thiamin B1, Niacin B3, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Zinc, Iron, and Manganese. Very easy to make this super food by just put a cake on a sheet of aluminum foil in the oven toaster and bake it at 425F for about 5~7 minutes. When you see it's puffed up, then it's done! Take it out, wrap it with a sheet of Nori (seaweed sheet), and use soy sauce or Liquid Amino as the dipping sauce. It makes fast breakfast that is super nutritious! You could eat this super delicious Mochi with cinnamon & sugar, which makes it very healthy and tasty desert. I buy this using Amazon's subscription program and never let it run out in our household.
