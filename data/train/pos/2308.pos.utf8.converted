Gustaf's come in all the classic wine gum shapes and flavors.  They have a slightly tart and tangy flavor with a chewie texture that is nothing like many of the soft, nondescript gummies.  These wine gums are like the ones I remember buying from little candy shops while studying in England. As for the merchant, my order came sooner than expected and was in excellent condition.
