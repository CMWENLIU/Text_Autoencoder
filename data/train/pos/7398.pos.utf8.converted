After a lot of research I decided to switch my cats to an all wet food diet. A website specifically recommended this brand of Fancy Feast as a more economical store brand variety of food because it has fewer fillers and more meat. There are certainly better varieties but the ones I saw on Amazon cost twice as much. When I started my two cats on the all wet food diet, I alternated days of this variety with cheap generic chicken flavored wet food (I believe it was mostly fillers and organ meat). They acted like they were starving on the days when I gave them the lower quality food, I would have to feed them an extra can. They would finish eating and beg for food an hour later. Now that I only use this variety, they are more active and less hungry and generally seem much more content. Soft shiny coats, bright eyes, lots of playing. As an added bonus, one of my cats is very large and heavy and the other is very small and skinny. The heavy cat has lost 4lbs (down to a trim 17lbs for his size) and the skinny little cat has basically maintained her weight. So, good reviews all around!
