I really enjoy this tea and love that it is caffeine free too!  There isn't any other Jasmine Tea that I've found that is also caffeine free.  I can share this with my mother who normally does not like tea, but she enjoys this.  Because of her heart condition she has to stay away from the caffeine so this works out great.
