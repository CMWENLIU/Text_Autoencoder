This is my sixth or seventh Haribo bulk item purchased at Amazon, and so far, perhaps my favorite. The peaches and the cherry gummies would be a close second. I would hardly call the flavor anything like actual raspberries, but like most Haribo confections, it's still very fragrant and pleasant---not at all chemical/noxious/phony. The main problem with these raspberries is their small size and interesting chewy/crunchy texture tempts you to come back for more. Before you know it, you've finished the bag, ordered three more, and are seeing an endocrinologist regularly for acute pancreatic failure---basically the highest compliment you can pay to a confectionery company. Way to go, Haribo!
