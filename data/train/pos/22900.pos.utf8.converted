Konjac (often also called shirataki) noodles are fairly new to the American market, so don't be turned off by negative reviews, learn about this product, try several different varieties, maybe several different brands, try to cook it with different meats and veggies, and I believe most of you will like this product.<br />DO NOT expect it to taste like regular (made out of flour) pasta because it won't. These noodles are made from yam root plus fiber. Konjac noodles have no taste and will absorb any flavor you introduce into the dish. They tend to be kind of "rubbery", so if you're offended by that, try tofu shirataki noodles (these are original konjac noodles with added tofu). They are softer than original konjac noodles. They also look white which makes them look more like regular pasta. Try both kinds and then make up your mind.<br />Both kinds come water packed and both have to be rinsed THOROUGHLY before use. I, personally, prefer original konjac noodles because (to me) tofu shirataki noodles have a fishy kind of odor, it takes longer to rinse it out of them and the smell still lingers sometimes (or maybe my nose is too sensitive). Konjac noodles can be stored at room temperature and shirataki tofu noodles need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />In any case, check out the many sites dedicated to this great product and I am sure you'll find a recipe or two to your liking. This product is as close as you'll get to zero calorie food. That said, let me give you one more friendly advice:<br />this type of food is NOT nutritious, so make sure you are taking your vitamins and/or get the necessary nutrients from other foods. This product would definitely be beneficial to people looking for a low glycemic impact food.<br />Here's just one of the sites you may want to check out:<br />[...]
