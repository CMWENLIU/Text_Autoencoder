I eat popcorn most nights.  I use an air popper and a little melted butter (not marjarine or spread).  I've tried every thing available in the stores and many gourmet popcorns looking for the perfect one -- and organic.  I found it here.  This popcorn has a mild corn taste and pops up big and fluffy.  I've read more than once that if you are going to buy anything organic, make it popcorn.  Pesticides are found on popcorn.  You wash some of that stuff off of your veggies, but popcorn is never washed -- just sifted before packaging.  You won't be disappointed with this popcorn.
