I love these TVP chunks as a veggie substitute in recipes that call for chicken. It is great in "chicken" curries, casserole, and creamy soups and stews. Although TVP is normally really boring, these chunks have a great texture and seems to have a really good taste in sauce-rich recipes. They are slightly more chewy than minced TVP, which makes your recipe more interesting. My meat-eating friends don't seem to spot that this is veggie food, so I suppose that is a plus for entertaining ... :-)<br />These chunks reconstitute really quickly (about 10 minutes) in water or cooking sauce. So this is a very easy ingredient to use. The chunks provide good value and a tasty addition for veggie cooking.
