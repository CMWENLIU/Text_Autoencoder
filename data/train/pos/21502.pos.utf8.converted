This sauce is from my country of birth, Costa Rica yet it is American owned now if I'm not mistaken. In Costa Rica it is used mostly in the seasoning of meats (beef) and chicken.  One of our typical dishes "arroz con pollo- rice with chicken) is prepared using this sauce in most parts. A word of warning however, do not use much of it because it is very strong and your food can be left quite salty if you go over board! Additionally, for those of you who are wondering, NO, I am not related in anyway to the makers of this sauce.<br /><br />Good cooking and happy taste buds! jl
