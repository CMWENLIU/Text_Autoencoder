When I lived on the border of England and Wales, I had a roommate from Copenhagen Denmark, and he got some of this in his Christmas goodie basket from his Mom. At first it is a shock to the system, and I was the only American in the house that didn't spit it out. Soon I was bugging him to get his Mom to send more. It is a testament to the impression that it made that 25 years later I checked Amazon to see if I could get it here.<br /><br />Before I got home my wife and kids had gotten into the box and tried it. They didn't try a second piece. I however after the initial shock of the first piece, remembered why I liked it. And although this case will probably last me a long time, I do rather enjoy the flavor. But be warned the flavor is HEAVY on the salt and very light on the sweet. But it is a treat that you can enjoy without emptying the whole container in a sitting and wonder where it went. So... if you are adventurous, or if you remember the taste from your European adventures, try this exotic treat.
