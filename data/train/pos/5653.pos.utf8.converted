I have been eating Wheatena for over 60 years.  It's the most hearty, tasty,  filling, cereal I have ever found.  Now, because of cholesterol concerns, I mix the dry cereal with oat bran for its soluble fiber, and quinoa for its complete protein (helps cut down on animal protein).  I eat the cooked combination with soy milk.  I can't find Wheatena in stores all the time so I'm thankful that I can get it via Amazon.com.
