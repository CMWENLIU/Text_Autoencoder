I admit, I was skeptical that this would really taste like coffee. I love coffee and couldn't imagine liking this as much.  My daughter gave me a sample and it was weeks before I actually "made" myself try it.  I loved it!  I love almond flavor so the almond is my favorite but they make all different flavors (natural, of course, not artificial) even one that just tastes like plain coffee.  I should add that the flavors in the flavored ones are subtle, it still tastes mostly like plain coffee with just a hint of almond or whatever flavor you choose.  They smell great too!
