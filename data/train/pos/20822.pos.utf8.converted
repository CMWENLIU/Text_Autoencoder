Yes, these crackers may look like they would be a great replacement for your old roof shingles or last well into the next millenium in your cabinets safe and sound, so make sure you eat these with some care to avoid accidentally tearing into your gums: they are quite dense and their high fiber and "cracker-ization" process makes them resemble tree bark in more ways than one.  Seriously, these are tasty and go wonderfully with peanut butter, cheese or just by themselves on business trips.  There is no better cracker for keeping your personal plumbing going smoothly and the concurrent benefits of good digestion.  Even my 13 year old eats them as well as many of her friends when they need a small bite of something at our house before mealtime.  I've been a customer of Wasa crisp for over 20 years and I'm convinced there is no better cracker for the nutritional value and fiber content for the money: this one is the Millenium Falcon of their cracker fleet.  You won't be disappointed.
