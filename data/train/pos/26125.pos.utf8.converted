I don't know how these would taste if one is used to eating junk foods and cooked foods, but I have been eating only raw foods for two months and these bars are really a special treat.  The chocolate in them is as pleasing to me as any chocolate cake, brownie, or candy bar ever was when I used to eat junk foods - even more so because I know that they are healthy and I am truly satisfied once I am finished with the bar!
