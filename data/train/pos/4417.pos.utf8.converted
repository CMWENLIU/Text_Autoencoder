I am unable to remember exactly how I came across these, but try them I did. When you hit the fruit flavors you are readily reminded of Jelly Belly jelly beans. Given that Bertie Bott's Beans are made by Jelly Belly, your taste buds would be correct. So, what makes these particular Jelly Belly jelly beans different from regular Jelly Bellys? The bizarre flavors, of course.<br /><br />I think I had a vomit bean in my box, but I did not think it was that bad. I also had dirt, which tasted like I thought dirt should taste like. The sardine flavored beans tasted just like fish; strongly like fish. Unfortunately, I got too many of the sardine flavored beans, so I think I have had enough of those. The grass flavored beans tasted like grass. I was able to reasonably handle all these flavors except for the earthworm, which is just gross. I have had real earthworms before, and they did not taste as bad as these jelly beans did.<br /><br />I am amazed at how authentic the Bertie Bott's Beans tasted. I warn you that they taste so authentic that you may wish you had not eaten them. For children, who often like such things, these candies may be a perfect gift, especially for male children. These candies may be great for someone interested in some sort of a contest. However, if you are past the phase where getting grossed out by nasty tasting stuff, then I recommend you pass these by.
