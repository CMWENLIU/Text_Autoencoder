There are a million different snack bars out there. The ones from Divinely D'lish are unique and in a class by themselves. I discovered them at the farmer's market in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. One taste and I was hooked for life.<br /><br />Since then, they have found their way into local shops here on the peninsula in the Bay Area. But now that they are available online at Amazon, anyone anywhere can enjoy them.<br /><br />The ingredient list is simple, straightforward, healthy and impressive. No GMO, no trans fats, unsulphered dried fruit, an emphasis on organic. They look like someone took tons of different kinds of grains (but they're wheat-free), seeds and nuts and mashed them together with dates, raisins, syrup, coconut. You can see every seed - nothing is pulverized and there's no flour filler. They're soft, but the nuts and seeds give them an oh-so-satisfying crunch.<br /><br />I heat them up very slightly and they taste like the most heavenly fresh baked cookies imaginable. My husband's favorite is the Cheeky Cherry Chocolate but since I try and steer clear of chocolate, my favorite is the Haute Diggity Date. He packs them on long business trips to help him over jet lag. I pack them as gifts for my east coast friends instead of the See's candy I used to bring. People seem to really appreciate something good to eat they don't have to feel guilty about.<br /><br />The only negative - and it's a big one - is it's almost impossible to exercise moderation with these things. Even if you can buy them locally here in the Bay Area, you might as well buy them online by the box. They'll be gone in a flash.
