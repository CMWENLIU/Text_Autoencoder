No, these are not indestructible hefty hefty hefty bags...yes they are thin, yes moisture builds up in your trash can if you let them sit full of food for more than a week - that's what makes them biodegradable folks!  With a little care in removal and disposal, and changing the bag every 5-7 days, these do the job perfectly (put most of your food waste in the compost and these can sit for even longer without too much moisture build up to weaken the bag).  If you want a steel toed, tear-proof bag, well it's going to sit in the landfill for the next thousand years. If you want something that will biodegrade and significantly reduce your eco-footprint, these are the real deal. Put a little effort into your "green" rather than complaining that these don't take out the trash and do the dishes on their own. Our planet goes to way more trouble taking care of us, so let's return the favor.
