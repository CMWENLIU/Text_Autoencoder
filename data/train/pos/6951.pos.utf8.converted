It's not like they're addicted. There's no withdrawal if I finish a tub. But this is the BEST, FRESHEST, most aromatic catnip I've found. My three cats don't agree on much, but they LOVE this stuff, sniff it, chew it, roll in it each time, going on three years now. It calms, delights, entertains them and makes me very popular on the home front. Plus it's mainly nice clean leaves, not so many seeds, so it's easy clean up.
