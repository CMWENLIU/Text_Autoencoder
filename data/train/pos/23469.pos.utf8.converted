Delicious product, tastes just like the Mate my local bakery brews. I really enjoy this company's products and its customer service and would definitely buy from them again.<br /><br />If you've never tried it, Yerba Mate tastes faintly smoky, bright, and almost grassy (in a good way). Certainly not for everyone, but if you enjoy strong herbal teas, you'll likely enjoy this. One of the best parts is the caffeine content--it pumps me up like coffee without any of the weird side effects (jitters, sweats, etc). I like mine with soy milk.<br /><br />Yummmy!
