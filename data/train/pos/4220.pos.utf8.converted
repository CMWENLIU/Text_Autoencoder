I know you're thinking no way, but actually this is really good. It is hard to find this soda on sale in grocery stores, so the price of this case is pretty competitive. The best part about this purchase was getting to try 2 cans of every flavor. Here are my favorites:<br /><br />Cola, Caffeine free Cola, Root Beer, Grape, Dr. Zevia, Mountain Zevia, Cream Soda, Lemon Lime Twist.<br /><br />Flavors I wasnt crazy about:<br /><br />Ginger Ale, Black Cherry, Grapefruit Citrus, Orange.<br /><br />Having a husband to pawn those last four flavors off on is awesome! Stranded on a desert island, I would pick the Root Beer. It even makes a great chaser, although I prefer the Cola for chasers.
