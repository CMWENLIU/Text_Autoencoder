When my husband saved our first little kitten from being mauled by a dog we just ran to the store and grabbed some IAMS kitten.  He would gorge himself on it and then throw up. All he did was go to the bathroom....he pooed like 5 times a day. He always seemed hungry despite all the eating. By then we had bought a Maine Coon and I switched them to a raw food diet, which was great except it was to rich for our first kitty. I finally went back and forth between EVO and Orijen. Evo is great but gave my cats sticky poo. Orijen is number one in my book. My cats have been eating it since they were about 3 months old (that's over a year now). They have NEVER thrown up or had a hair ball. They hardly shed. They have glossy coats....and they are REALLY active. They don't lay around and sleep all day. They are constantly moving and playing. This food is amazing. And they only eat 1/3c. twice a day and it's more than enough. Sometimes there is food left in the bowl. They absolutely love the taste of it. It's more expensive but a big bag lasts my two cats<br />7-8 weeks. That's about 20-25 dollars a month on cat food. Not bad considering you will save on vet bills.
