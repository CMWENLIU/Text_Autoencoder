This juice is not touted as a "cure". It is listed as a supplement to HELP people with their illnesses when the medicines just can't do enough. i have been using it for several months now and although my asthma is not gone, it isn't worse and is more under control. My husband's creaky knees don't hurt anymore. My 85 year old mom can walk without pain in her joints now. No we didn't stop our medicines (yet), but this is an all natural juice that helps.
