Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor!<br /><br />  I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.
