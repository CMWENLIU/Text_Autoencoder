So it's a given that Skippy makes the best peanut butter. Their regular Super Chunk set the bar. But the addition of honey makes this the best pb I've ever tasted.<br /><br />So why did grocery stores throughout Illinois stop carrying it? I have no idea. I've checked multiple stores and ended up buying it through Amazon. It's a little strange to buy peanut butter this way, but it's worth it since it's the only way I can get it.
