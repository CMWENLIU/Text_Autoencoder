Nice light pure peach flavor.<br /><br />Does not 'feel' caffeinated, even tho it does have caffeine...light in all regards.<br /><br />Enjoy it very much, great value and a plus for me...none of those strange herbs that are often in flavored teas that make them all taste the same.<br /><br />A winner!
