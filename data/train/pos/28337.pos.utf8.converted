This is a delicious and very affordable gluten free hot cereal. After eating wheat based cereals, breads and pasta all of my long life, adjusting to a gluten free diet has not been easy.  This is one of the gluten free products that has helped with the transition. I add varying combinations of cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, nuts, to this cereal and create new flavors. Highly recommended.
