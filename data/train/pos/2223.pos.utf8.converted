the planters whole cashews i received from amazon.com in my opinion are absolutely delicious and just lightly salted. i will be ordering alot more of these in the near future.<br /><br />update: i eat alot of planter's cashews and to this day Friday December 25th 2009 i highly recommend these cashews because they are still the most delicious i have found with just a touch of salt on them. the price is really great. i buy them on subscribe and they are delivered right to my house. i couldn't be any happier.
