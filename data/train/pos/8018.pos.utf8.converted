This is awesome, awesome tea.  Does not taste like coffee - though I can see how it has a sort of grain-based civil-war coffee stand in appeal to it.  My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea was Almond Sunset which they discontinued - it was AWESOME.  This tastes someone what Almond Sunset, but without the amaretto tones.  I am scared they will discontinue this, though my husband is convinced that will never happen.  I think I may buy a few cases just in case.<br /><br />If you loved Almond Sunset, you will like this tea.
