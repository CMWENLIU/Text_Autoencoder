If  you are looking for a really bold cup of coffee then you must try these K-Cups.  It actually foams after brewing just like a great cup of espresso.  My husband was looking for a great morning cup and this is it! I stick to my Donut Shop K-cup but if you are in the market for a really true, rich, strong cup then go for it.
