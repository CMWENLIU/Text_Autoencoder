I've been using Folger's Coffee Singles for 3 years or so.  Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, they are so simple to use and taste as good as brewed coffee...but no leftovers!  I also try to control my caffeine intake and what is more simple than a single serving of real brewed coffee made in your cup.  I take them traveling, better than the hotel coffee anyday.  The decaf is also great.  The answer to camping, work and play.
