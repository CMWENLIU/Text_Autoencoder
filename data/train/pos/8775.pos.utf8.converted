Just adding this to my normal diet routine has caused a big difference in my weight loss.  I'm not hungry and have plenty of energy - a huge change from before I started drinking it.  I was actually a little concerned at first due to the sudden drop in weight.  I thought I was losing water weight but I was wrong.  I use about a teaspoon/teaspoon and a half per day and brew it 4 times - about 8 cups - per day.  As a bonus, it tastes pretty good too.
