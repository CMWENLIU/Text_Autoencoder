My friend who is a raw vegan recommended I start taking wheat grass to energize and detoxify my body. I was a bit skeptical at first but this stuff really does wonders. Not only does it give me loads of energy in the mornings it also has helped me stay a "regular" guy in the bathroom. Also! For any of you folks that are drinkers this stuff is AMAZING for detoxifying. Take this hungover and you'll feel like a million bucks in a half an hour. Taste isn't amazing but then again I just drink it straight with water. Would highly recommend this product for anyone looking to live a healthier lifestyle.
