I am a college freshman and have become particularly concerned with my nutritional habits over the past couple of years because my father is on the verge of becoming diabetic.  In hopes of avoiding gaining the "freshman fifteen" this year and in maintaining my dietary goals, I've stocked up on Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix.  It provides me with the sweet fix I need when I'm craving chocolate and don't want to calorie splurge.<br /><br />I used to be a Starbucks junkie, and before my dietary turnaround, I downed my grande (16 ounce) Starbucks Signature Hot chocolate as if it was water.  When I became aware that my formerly innocent, non-fat, no-whip, winter refreshment still had 410 calories and 42 grams of sugar in it, I began my search for a better alternative.  In discovering Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix, now I am able to get an even greater satisfaction with the 25-calorie miracle packet that transforms plain water into my favorite treat.<br /><br />Without the addition of milk, it is essential to add a large spoonful of Splenda to reach optimal taste.  When I first tried the mix without artificial sweeteners and mixed with only water, I was very disappointed at how bland the flavor was.  However, now, with a heap of Splenda, a Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa Mix packet, and a mug of steaming water, I claim victory in taste and nutrition.<br /><br />I began buying Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa when I found it at my local grocery store, Pavilions.  It would cost around $5.25 a box, and with six packets in each box, around 88 cents per packet.  At Amazon.com, I am able to purchase the mix in bulk and in purchasing a case of six boxes, each packet costs me 31 cents, saving me 57 cents per packet.<br /><br />Some reviewers have claimed that the hot cocoa clumps up in mixing it with water.  This has occurred to me several times when my water was too hot.  Avoid boiling hot water, and stir as you pour the water into the mug with the hot cocoa mix and Splenda already in it, and you should no longer encounter this problem.<br /><br />I have experimented in using sugar-free chocolate syrups to make hot cocoa instead of using a mix and have been highly disappointed with the results. The syrup does not mix as well, and the texture of the hot cocoa is too thin, especially if just mixing the syrup in water.<br /><br />After a long day of studying in the library and a snowy trek back to my dorm, a mug of Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa with a heap of Splenda and a spritz of cinnamon is my always highly anticipated reward.
