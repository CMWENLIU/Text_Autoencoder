This is just a delightful coffee.  My husband and I are fans of flavored coffee, particularly vanilla and hazelnut.  Even though this is already ground, there is a distinct vanilla aroma/flavor that lasts and is not overpowering.  A secondary concern is that I drink about five cups a day, so I'm looking for any acidic reaction; there is none.  The coffee strength is medium, perfect for drinking in the morning and all day.  I always keep my coffee, especially ground, in the freezer for freshness.  The expiration date is clearly marked on the bottom of the package; mine are for June 29, 2011, but the four packages will not last that long.  Do the math on the cost; my purchase worked about to about $6.60 per pound, including super saver shipping, which is most reasonable these days.  I recommend this coffee.
