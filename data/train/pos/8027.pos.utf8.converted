[[ASIN:B001EO6FKK Odell's Chef's Butter Clarified No Salt Added, 10-Ounce Unit(Pack of 3)]<br /><br />This is a fabulous product. It truly excels when used for saut&eacute;ing or frying. While it delivers a great butter taste, the best part of using it is that it will not burn your food (like regular butter does). I use it for saut&eacute;ing chicken and vegetables. My favorite use of this product is for hashbrowns. It makes the potatoes nice and crisp without ever burning. Far superior to any oil or regular butter, you'll be hooked the first time you use it. Added bonus: extraordinary shelf life.
