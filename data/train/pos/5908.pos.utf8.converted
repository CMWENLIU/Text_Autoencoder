I love licorice and thought I would try this stuff out. I wondered how a double-salt licorice could have 0 mg of sodium. Well, the answer is, the saltiness is the ammonium chloride. There is no sodium chloride (table salt) in this licorice. I'm not sure that ammonium chloride is any better for you than plain old salt, but since it is 'sodium free' it appears on the surface to be a healthy choice. Bottom line: This stuff is salty. A very close friend of mine is Dutch. He's not the typical, "I'm Dutch because my grandparents came from Holland." He is the real deal. He is not even remotely interested in visits to Amsterdam, like most people are. I told him I had some Dubbel Zout (Dutch for double-salt) and he was over to see me instantly. He loved it. Where most people immediately spat it out or nearly choked on it, he was crazy about it. I think that says a lot about its authenticity. Now, as to the saltiness, if that's not your thing, I suggest not buying six tubs at first (though the price is great), but rather pick up a single tub from an import market. If you have tried the double-salt and think that all of the dutch licorice is like that, then you need to try Gustaf's Licorice Coins (which my friend refers to as single-salt). They are outstanding as well. Both the double-salt and single-salt are interesting and authentic Dutch confections and I highly recommend them both.
