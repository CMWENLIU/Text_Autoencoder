This is the perfect comfort food for those of us who cannot eat gluten. I let the water (along with olive oil and salt)  come to a rolling boil, dropped in the noodles, stirred until it came back to a rolling boil, and let it go for ten minutes stirring occasionally. I drained the noodles. While they were draining, I mixed 1/4 cup water, some butter, and the sauce packet in the pan until blended. I then tossed the noodles into the sauce and mixed. Perfection. It was just like Kraft, only way better. In fact, it was so good, I ate the entire box in one sitting. I ate it again the next day. This is becoming an addiction.
