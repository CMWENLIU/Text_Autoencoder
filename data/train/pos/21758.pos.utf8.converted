My husband loves this stuff. We ran out of it because I had a pending order elsewhere that fell through(they might have kept my money forever if I hadn't cancelled the backordered order), so, needless to say, I was happy to find a good price on Amazon that actually beat what I had thought was the best deal I could find. I received my product within a couple of days and am very satisfied.
