This Kitchens of India Butter Chicken curry paste is a real find, tasty and well-priced. The preparation is so easy - just add butter, water, and cut-up chicken to the paste and stir. Well, you do have to turn on the stove.<br /><br />I used two boneless breasts and cut them into fairly large chunks as breast meat tends to dry out easily. I would think boneless thighs would work just as well. The whole dish was cooked in less than 30 minutes. Jasmine rice is the perfect accompaniment. The dish was a big hit with everyone.
