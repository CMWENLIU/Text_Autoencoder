This is the only canned food that our oldest cat, now at least 17, will eat.  She has eaten it for years and now<br />the next oldest is eating it too.  #2 ate only dry but now eats that very little and has the Liver and Chicken Feast.<br />#3 loves it too but also eats a variety of other Fancy Feast foods.  The younger ones eat it some but it is the<br />older ones who really really like it the most.  I love it because it goes down and stays down and they get the<br />nourishment they need.
