I have a love/hate relationship with wheat. I loves it, it hates me. There was a point that I went without baked goods for many years. With this company and it's products, I can now have baked goods without the bloating and tummy ache that I once had. I have found coconut flour highly digestible and it's a pretty good source of protein and fiber and it's relatively low in carbs and calories. It does not tastes like wheat. But when baked, it has a bit of the same consistency and texture. It won't bake like wheat,nor does it rise with yeast. It absorbs liquid much more and when stirring it into recipes it can clump up-so sometimes one's better off using a whisk or a handheld electric mixer.<br /><br />To make this stuff rise like other baked goods, one must use a lot of eggs and baking powder (I've been told that baking soda works, too but I haven't tried that yet.)<br /><br />Ordering via subscription visa vi Amazon saves about $3-6 a bag, depending on what grocer one is comparing the price to.<br /><br />I use roughly one bag every two weeks.<br /><br />I am athletic and I must eat in the morning (as much as I hate too). This does make it easier. Below is a recipe to assist in the use of this flour. One can make many variations of this. Substitute 1 T of Coconut Flour with 1 T of Ground Flaxseed Meal. One can use spices instead of fruit (but one must add a 2T of soy milk or almond milk as a substitute to add moisture.<br /><br />2 T of coconut flour<br />1/2 t of unsalted butter (softened)<br />1 large egg<br />1 t of baking powder<br />1 or 2 T of Splenda or Trivia (what ever one prefers-I use Splenda and the nutritional value is with that)<br />3 T of defrosted frozen blueberries<br /><br />Blend all of these ingredients together. Put in a greased coffee mug or beaker. Microwave for about 1 and 1/2 minutes. Start out with one 1 and test the top of the muffin with your finger to see if it's still to moist, if so, microwave for another 20-30 seconds. The muffin will rise and it will pop right out of the cup. It makes a really big muffin that will fill one up for hours. Also with regular sugar and wheat, I crave sugar and wheat all day long afterwards. With this muffin, I don't crave the sugar and wheat afterwards.<br /><br />I top this with regular cream cheese. I drink with a glass of unsweetened Almond Breeze milk.<br /><br />The variables are how much liquid is in the blueberries and how much one needs to microwave-dependent on the watts of the appliance. There are a few variables that one can mess with. I've used Parmesan cheese and no splenda and it's just okay. This type of flour has a bit of a sweet taste to it. For cheese "rolls" I use the tapioca flour instead.<br /><br />One can also use apple sauce and cinnamon. I personally don't fancy that. I love berries though. You can add a half a scope of whey powder and an extra egg to make is really full of protein. It makes the muffin about 350 calories and adds roughly around 20 grams of protein.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional values of the above recipe: 237 Calories, 20 Carbs, 9 Grams of protein, 7 grams of fiber.  In comparison to a Starbucks muffin 360 Calories, 59 carbs, 7 protein, 2 fiber. However the Starbucks muffin won't set well for anyone wheat intolerant.<br /><br />Here's another recipe that was in my health clubs magazine.<br /><br />4 T coconut flour<br />4 eggs<br />2 T grated ginger<br />1/2 t baking powder<br />4 cups grated carrots<br />salt and pepper to taste<br /><br />Heat frying pan with coconut oil or olive oil as you would for pancakes. Make patties thin and about 1.5" in diameter<br />brown on each side. They need to be carefully slide into the oil. They firm up after cooked.  Makes about 16 patties. The carb count is under 5 each and the calories aren't quite 35 each.<br /><br />This recipe does help take the place of starchy things like potatoes, rice or bread as a side dish. It is good, but it can be a bit dry. I've been trying to figure out a low-carb/low-calorie sauce for it. But this recipe gives you the idea of how versatile this flour can be.
