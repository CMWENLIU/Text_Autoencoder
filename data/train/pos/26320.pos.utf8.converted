I live in Northern New Mexico, where tortilla soup recipes are printed both in the paper and stored in safety deposit boxes.  I eat this because I like the taste.  At home I usually add some green chile since it is a little bland, but at work, right out of the cup.  Highly recommended.  You can add red chile or a little cayenne if too bland for the office.  Peeling green chiles in the lunch room makes a bit of a mess.  Prepared green chile could be left in the office fridge, though.
