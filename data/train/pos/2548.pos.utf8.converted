I've never been a fan of strong coffee or a coffee snob but after visiting New Orleans I got hooked on C&C (coffee and chicory).  I started out with the medium-dark Creole roast (I called the company and found out that Creole Roast in the red can and Restaurant Blend in the white can are both the same exact medium-dark roast C&C - the can thing is just done for marketing).<br /><br />Just for fun I tried a can of the dark roast (City Roast) C&C and to my surprise found I enjoy it more than the medium-dark roast.  For comparison I then tried a can of the Cafe du Monde C&C which is also a dark roast and it isn't nearly as good (had kind of a burnt taste) as the French Market City Roast.<br /><br />Also found that if you make the French Market City Roast a little strong it has kind of a chocolate taste to it.  I've read that C&C has chocolate undertones but never tasted it until I made the dark roast a little stronger than I usually do.
