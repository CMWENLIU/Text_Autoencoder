Nothing against the prior reviewer who does not believe this is the original Oi Ocha, but I must say though...as a repeat buyer both of these 16.9 oz. bottles from Amazon as well as 2 liter imports straight from Japan, the two are identical. Every now and then I feel like having the stronger Oi Ocha Koi Aji (not sold by Amazon as of the time of this review), so I'm familiar with it as well. I've uploaded three photos, comparing the packaging, as well as closeups of exactly 1.0 fl. oz. of each. (The prior reviewer's pic has ice, no listed amount, and appears to be far darker than the Koi Aji he believes it is.) Hopefully, this will help folks decide for themselves...as for me, I'll just keep on drinking my favorite beverage.<br /><br />On to the actual review...for informational purposes, most of the bottled "green tea" sold in the US is nothing like real green tea. It's essentially tea-flavored kool-aid, with ingredients that have no business being there. Do not expect Oi Ocha to taste anything like these beverages and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Mellow and ever-so-slightly nutty, Oi Ocha's flavor is delicate, subtle, and amazingly refreshing. Drink it as cold as possible, and store unused portions in the refrigerator after opening. (Left out and oxidized, it turns dark and the taste goes bad. I have a theory that this is what the prior reviewer may have inadvertently done.) It doesn't have a single calorie, and contains 120% of your daily value of vitamin C per serving, but I don't drink it because it happens to be healthy...I drink it because it tastes so very, very good. Oi Ocha is the best.
