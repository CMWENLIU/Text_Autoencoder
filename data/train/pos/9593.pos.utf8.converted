For Christmas 2006, I received one of these aerogarden kits as a gift.  Within 3 1/2 weeks, we began reaping the benefits of our indoor garden.  Last week we picked the last of this initial crop which gave us at least a dozen salads for two people.<br /><br />No mess, no fuss, no bugs, and the added bonus of security knowing where and how our salad makings are grown.<br /><br />We now have two units going with the plan to purchase two more.
