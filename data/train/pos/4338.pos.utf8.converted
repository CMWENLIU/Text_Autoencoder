Since the ingredients weren't printed on the Amazon listing, I contacted the manufacturer and asked before purchasing. I received a prompt, courteous, accurate reply. The ingredients are vanilla extracts and alcohol. For comparison, the ingredients in the vanilla extract we purchased at the grocery store (McCormick) were vanilla extract, water, alcohol, and corn syrup. The taste and quality of the LorAnn extract is great. It arrived very well packaged, with each individual glass bottle wrapped in bubble wrap. The product was perfectly fresh - the expiration date was about two and a half years away still. We will be using this product from now on.<br /><br />Note: At the time of this review, the product photo was incorrect on the Amazon website, but the actual product we received was correct.
