I've been supplementing with K-9 Liquid Health Glucosamine/chond with MSM for well over a year now and I know my senior dogs have a better quality of life because of it. So much so that I am also giving it preemtively to my younger dogs. It's easy to administer; I just pour it on their dry food. They've never turned up their nose at it.
