I had read that organic coconut oil was good for healing skin yeast infections so I thought I'd try it.  This is alot of coconut oil for the price!!  It smells clean and like coconut ( of course!)  It cleared up my minor infection within days.  I use the oil all over now because it goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin rather quickly.  Don't leave it in the sun because the heat will warm it to liquid!
