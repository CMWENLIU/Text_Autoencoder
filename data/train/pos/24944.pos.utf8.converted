I love this pineapple.  Right now Amazon's price is pretty comparable to what I pay at Costco for this.  My problem with a lot of fruit snacks is you think you are getting something healthy, but the way they process it makes it not so.  This product is truly healthy!  It is organic and it is not processed with sulphur.  I think it tastes amazing!  It is sweet and juicier than any dried pineapple I've ever had.  Yes, it is not going to drip with juice because it is DRIED pineapple, but it is definitely moist and tasty.  It is a bit brown, but isn't that to be expected?  This is an organic, all natural product that is actually good for you.  If that is what matters to you, get this.  If you care more about looks and cosmetic features of your food, then I'd recommend going the sulphur route where your pineapple will look super pretty but be more unhealthy.
