The Starkist Chunk Light Tuna packed in *oil* has a superior, fresh flavor, not greasy, with just the right amount of salt.  The texture is firm and, unlike canned tuna, there is actually tuna in this pouch.  A 7-oz pouch of tuna has more tuna than two 6-ounce cans (which are about half water or oil).  I highly recommend you try this.
