I love Jello Custard but haven't been able to find it in any grocery stores lately.  I had friends around the country searching their stores too!  One wrote to Jello to ask why it's so hard to find.  She was told that Jello was no longer selling the Custard mix in stores because customers don't like taking the time to stir it until it reaches the boiling point. They do, however, sell it on their site to restaurants, etc in bulk.  I went on their site to order some.  The price was good but the shipping was outrageous so I didn't fill the order.<br /><br />I looked on Amazon and it showed they were out of it. Stupidly, I thought this meant that they wouldn't be getting anymore in.  A week later, another friend told me it was back in stock on Amazon!!!  I order a case of 24 at an excellent price (less than $1 a box - I was paying $2+ in grocery stores).  Then, by simply buying an item worth $5, I got FREE shipping.  I needed a new spatula so I bought that!<br /><br />The best part is, when it arrived I looked on the box to see if there were microwave instructions.  There were!!!  I now make it in a microwave in about 8 minutes.  It says to stir it but you don't really have to.<br /><br />Thank you AMAZON for caring one of my favorite foods!!!
