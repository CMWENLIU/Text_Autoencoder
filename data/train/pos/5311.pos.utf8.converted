I love the wellness brand of cat food.<br />My cats are doing so much better since we switched them three months ago.<br />Before we switched their food they were getting fat and shedding clumps of fur all over the place.<br />Not even my furminator could handle that much hair!<br />Now they are thinner and more energetic and the shedding has been reduced by at least 75%.<br />Which makes us all happy.
