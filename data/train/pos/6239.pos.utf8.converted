This is an unusual food product if you are not familiar, but once used, it is nearly essential. It adds so much flavor and body to soups and broth and I liked another reviewers comment that to her it is like 'bacon'....very true. It soon becomes an essential that you want to dust onto everything....greatly expands your food..especially grains and soups.
