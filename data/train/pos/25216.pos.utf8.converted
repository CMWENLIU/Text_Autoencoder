What's not to love?  It's apple cider vinegar!  Great for cooking but I use it for other purposes as well.  For example, my 9-year-old gets the occasional wart on her hands.  Not sure if it is the placebo effect or if this stuff is really magic, but I put a little piece of cotton soaked in it on the wart, cover with a bandaid and leave it on overnight.  Two nights of treatment and the wart usually turns black and falls off within a week,  Friends have had similar success with warts the doctor couldn't even get rid of with multiple freezing.<br /><br />Gross, I know!  But hey, warts and all, right?<br /><br />I also use it as an astringent on my face and it has really helped clear up any breakouts I've had.  Like I said, it may be the placebo effect but if it works- it works!! And it is far cheaper than other remedies out there.<br /><br />Bragg's has a much better taste to me than the regular apple cider vinegars out there I've tried(for some reason, I feel like it smells better, too).  It does have more sediment in it than other brands so shake before using and it may not be optimal for household cleaning(I know my mom likes to use vinegar and water on her wood floors).  Love the stuff and can be used for many purposes!
