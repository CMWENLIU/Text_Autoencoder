I tried MIO because it was on sale locally. I chose the sweet tea flavor because I knew that flavor would be easy to compare to other no-calorie powdered drinks. I am a big fan of the Walmart version of Crystal Light (Walmart's is less expensive and better tasting than CL).<br /><br />The delivery method is a great idea. You can adjust the amount depending on the glass size or your mood, it can go into a water bottle just as easy, it's convenient to carry, great for camping, at the office or whenever you don't want to make a whole pitcher of drink mix or don't like the taste of your tap water.<br /><br />The flavor is FANTASTIC. Better than any sugared or non-sugared powder mix! The cost for such a small bottle seems expensive, but it is super concentrated, excellent flavor, you'll drink more water than ever before, well worth the price when you compare it to bottled water or other drinks.
