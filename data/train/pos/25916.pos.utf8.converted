We have a Keurig in our small office, and since we got it in December half the office has taken to making themselves a green tea pick-me-up in the afternoon. I find the Bigelow K-cup green tea to taste the same as that brewed from most green tea tea bags. It is not quite the same as green tea brewed from loose leaves, but for what it is, it is great.
