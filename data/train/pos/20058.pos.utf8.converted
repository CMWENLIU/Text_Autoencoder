I think Altoids are wonderful, and when I heard that they had them in liquorice you know I had to try them!  These are great.  They have a lovely, mildly spicy flavor, freshen your breath, soothe your sore threat and taste very "natural."  Liquorice is known for its healing and calming properties and I can honestly say that these wonderful candies make me feel happy whenever I eat them.
