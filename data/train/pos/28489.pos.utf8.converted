I chanced across this stuff at a store that carries odd lots and overstocks, and now am trying to find out where I can keep a steady supply going.<br />I prefer loose tea, but even in a teabag this Yorkshire Tea blew away anything I had tried before, and sadly to say, my entire stock of other tea will be very hard to use up, because it doesn't even taste like tea by comparison. Even other brands of English tea taste like hot dishwater in a side-by-side comparison.<br /><br />Interestingly, this tea is strong without being bitter, and whereas it is made to stand up to milk, it is quite good without as well. I will be showing a local merchant the barcode and asking if they can locate the loose-leaf variety, and if all else fails, ordering it online.
