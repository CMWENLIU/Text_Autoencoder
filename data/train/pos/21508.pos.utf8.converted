This kit comes with everything that you will need including the corks and labels.  Following the directions I was able to create a wine that is very tasty.  It is slightly dry and the flavor hits the tongue with a pleasant and slightly fruity flavor.  The dryness of this wine disappears quickly after you swallow.  This is an excellent wine for meals and should make a very good sangria when combined with fruit and a hot summer afternoon.
