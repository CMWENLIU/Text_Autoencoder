I have an 8 year old and a 2 year old. They are both very finicky and get bored with food easily. If they don't like a food, they just lick up the gravy and the rest dries out, so the leftovers go outside for the feral cats. I'm always on the search for new things to let them try. Now that one of my cats is getting older, I'm getting proactive about his urinary tract health so I was happy to find the variety of Friskies Senior cannned cat food here on Amazon. This flavor is their favorite, they lick their plate clean. It has chunks that are small enough for my older cat to eat (he has some missing teeth, I took him in as a stray) and plenty of gravy which both of them love. I like that when I open the can it smells like real meat instead of stinky mystery meat by products. This food ( any flavor) is a great deal on this site. Friskies runs about 50 cents a can when it's on sale at the grocery store, and with Super Saver Shipping I come out almost equal and don't have to wait for sales to stock up. There are also so many flavors available here that aren't in stores. My furry friends are happy, so I'm happy.
