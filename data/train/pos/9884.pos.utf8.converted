Ethan's Garden is an excellent vendor.  I received an e-mail shortly after my Amazon order confirming that I would be available to pick up the package as soon as it arrived so that we could tweak the shipping date if I wasn't able to be there.<br /><br />The berries arrived the next day with very clear and informative instructions.  We followed the advice for storing them and tried them out with an assortment of food the following day.  What a fun experience!<br /><br />Here's what we found:<br /><br />- Grapefruits are absolutely amazing.  They win in my book for "best improved taste."<br />- Both lemons and limes are bright and sweet, without the pucker face!<br />- Radishes are reduced to the taste of a "dense" water chestnut, with no "bite."<br />- Yellow onions taste like sweeter onions, but don't sting the tongue.  They did affect my nasal passages, however. :)<br />- Salsa tastes bizarre.  The tomatoes come out extremely sweet and "take over" for the other notes in the salsa.<br />- Beer tastes less bitter and tequila tastes less pungent.  Because the berries alter the tongue, you still get the raw effects of alcohol on your throat, etc.<br />- Pickles tasted fruitier.<br />- Tabasco sauce tasted sweet and less hot.  Similar with alcohol -- you still know you're consuming something harsh!<br />- Raw sugar tasted like ... weird sugar.  Maybe smoother.  Hard to explain.  :)<br />- The berries themselves didn't cause any reaction or stomach discomfort for us.  However, beware of the odd mixture of foods you try, your belly might not like such a harsh combination of acids. :)<br /><br />Here's what we recommend:<br /><br />- The berries are actually very tiny (maybe the size of a large raisin), and you definitely want to be delicate when pullling the pulp off of the large (in proportion) seeds.<br />- Use Granny Smith apples as a "palate cleanser" between trying different things.  We also tried tortilla chips, but that seemed to alter the flavors a bit.<br /><br />Great vendor and great experience.  Thanks, Ethan's Garden!
