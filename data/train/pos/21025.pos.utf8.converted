I did enjoy the Crown Prince smoked clams for years (cottenseed oil). They were sand and shell free in the beginning . Over the years, however, these tasty clams contained too much sand and shell to enjoy - spitting out the sandy treat. Surprisingly, these olive oil cans contain the same soft clam taste without ANY sand so far on the fourth can. Love them.
