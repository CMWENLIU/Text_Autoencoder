I have used these many times.  They are a wonderful product.  All you do is push the spikes in the dirt around your plants and it fertilizes and releases insecticide that the plant draws up into it's tissues.  Any bugs, like aphids, that want to chew on your plants are history.  No spraying or mixing and you don't have to worry about applying on a windy day, or trying to get it on the under side of leaves.  I LOVE it.
