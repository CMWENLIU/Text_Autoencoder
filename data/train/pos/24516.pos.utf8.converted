I first heard about Golden Malted Waffle mix here on Amazon when I was searching for a new waffle maker and saw that on pratically every maker this mix was recommended. After reading up on the mix and finding out that it is the same mix served at various hotels across the country, I decided to give it a try. I have to tell you that this is the best waffle mix I have ever had. From the moment you open the first canister and you get that malt smeel hits your nose, you know that this is going to be good. The flavor is great and it is not an overly sweet batter which makes it good for both breakfast and for using for dessert waffles with ice cream and fruit. Also I recommend using milk in place of the water when making the waffle batter. It makes for a much better waffle. So if you are on the fence about trying this mix do yourself a favor and order. You will not be disappointed.
