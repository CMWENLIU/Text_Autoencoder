I love this syrup, use it in my coffee every morning. But the best thing about this is that I don't have to go out and get it and I never run out. Amazon has all the flavors too. Even though I only use the vanilla, there are 3 different vanilla flavors.<br />I could buy this same syrup locally for about $5+/ bottle, then add tax and the gas to get to the store that carries it(not all grocery stores have this). But this subscription cuts the cost down to about $3/bottle And it comes to me! Very cool. Thanks, Amazon.
