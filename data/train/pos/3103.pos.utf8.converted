I believe this is the best choice of any coffees used with the Tassimo.  It not only has a good taste, but it give you a large normal mug size cup of fresh brewed coffee.  The other Gevalia coffees are great (well, not the decaf), but they're too small.  I was using 2 for each cup of coffe.  This product has both.
