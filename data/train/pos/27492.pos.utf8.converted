Good tahina is not hard to find, but good tahina at a great price is much harder to locate. Al Wadi produces a quality product that makes making tahini sauce one of the easiest tasks a cook could have. There's no waste, it can last for ages in the refrigerator (but not in *my* house, we eat it too often!), and I always have some on hand for a snack with fresh bread, or for wraps, or a dip with kebabs.
