I've made many waffle recipes from scratch, and I've tried a bunch of mixes. This is the only mix that literally tastes home-made, to the point that I basically don't make homemade waffles anymore. It's totally simple to make (just mix + water + egg + oil). Unfortunately it's hard to find in grocery stores, so it's great to see it on Amazon. Cooking tip: undercook it a little to keep the waffle light & fluffy. When the waffle gets crispy it's not quite as good (but still very good).<br /><br />I have also tried Krusteaz pancake mix, which is easier to find in stores. It isn't as good, and doesn't work well for waffles.
