My wife loves this stuff and sometimes can't find this flavor in the grocery stores.  I found it on Amazon for her one time, and even though ordering this on Amazon felt weird at first, I got used to it.  Eventually, I just put it on  a subscription so I get a 6-pack every couple of months.  We have a pitcher made in the fridge at all times.
