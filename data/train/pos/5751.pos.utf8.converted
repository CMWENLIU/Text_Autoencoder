Patek's is my favorite curry paste--no MSG and simple ingredients. For a great, easy meal on an evening when you are too tired to make a curry from scratch, saute some onions, throw in a can of tomatoes, some water, and a few tablespoons of Patek's Mild Curry Paste, and then you can take it wherever you like it--meat, tofu, veggies--as your fancy strikes you.<br /><br />Now this paste may say "mild," but there is still enough spice to make your mouth tingle pleasantly--just enough. When I serve Patek's mild, I take out some chicken or whatever before serving to my four-year-old--I don't think she could handle the "mild" spice level. Mom and Dad love it, though.<br /><br />The downside is that one little jar does not go a long way. If you use the paste in the concentration that it calls for (and I recommend doing so, for an authentic Indian taste), you will get two or three dinners out of it. But for flavor and ease of use and sheer delight, you cannot beat Patek's. The guests you serve it to will be amazed--and you can hide your little jar in the refrig and bask in all that glory.<br /><br />Amazon's cost is high for this item, at $5, but if convenience is important to you, then that's a consideration--having a powerful culinary secret delivered to your door might make the extra buck or two worth it. If you have time and are near an Asian/Indian foods store, then expect to pay $3 if you are lucky, or around $4 in most places. Stock up, because unopened, these last forever.
