I have used my ways for examining how pure this honey is. It seemed at the beginning pure about 90%, and after using it I still give it a pure percent between 85%-90%. It is really a good honey, delicious of course, easy to spread, and thick enough. I loved this one, but was hoping to find it within cheaper price, as a can of 250g is really small for the price charged for this honey.
