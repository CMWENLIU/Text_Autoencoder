This lavender extract is very, very strong. More potent than I expected actually. I added one teaspoon to a cupcake recipe and it was overpowering. I ended up adding extra vanilla to tone it down and it worked but next time I will probably only use a half teaspoon of lavender. Any kind of flavoring needs to be experimented with to achieve your personal tastes so I'm not complaining. It's really perfect for baking with. Stronger than lavender water and not sugary like lavender syrup. And the fact that you get a 4oz bottle is great. This stuff will last me quite a while. Between that and the fact that I can't find this in physical stores, the price is well worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to add lavender flavor to a recipe. Just remember that to some people it might be "soapy" tasting as here in the states flower flavors aren't commonly eaten but they're commonly in perfumes and soaps. When you get used to the flavor it's positively delightful though. :)
