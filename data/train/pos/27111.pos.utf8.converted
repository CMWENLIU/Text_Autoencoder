After I had a pizza with truffles and porcini mushrooms in a small town in Tuscany, I was a committed truffle fan.<br /><br />And the deal was already sealed when I had potato chips with truffle oil.<br /><br />It was with at least those two things in mind that I started looking for truffle oil. My first attempt was La Tourangelle (see my review on Amazon).  You really have to work to find the truffle essence in the Tourangelle version.<br /><br />But, JR's La Truffiere is the real deal.  Pungent, garlicky, and very powerful.  I've only tried two different truffle oils, but I'll risk giving this one a five star rating since I can't imagine a better version.
