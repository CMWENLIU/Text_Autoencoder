So, not a frequent reviewer but after using this stuff for so long, I felt I should give some feedback.  This stuff will not make you a raging animal in the gym.  I know of no pre-workout supplement that will that does not also contain caffeine.  So, wtf is one supposed to do if you work out late?  Ever done that with a caffeinated supplement and laid in bed staring at the ceiling, with a totally drop-dead tired body but alert brain?  sucks doesnt it?  This is the only supplement I keep coming back to for that reason.  It gives you some energy and definitely increases stamina.  It also has kre-alkalyn creatine which is awesome because you need very little and none of it turns into creatinine.  It doesnt mess with my stomach one bit and it tastes great.  This sucker is a no-brainer for a caffeine free workout booster.  I've been using it for years and will likely continue to do so.  Enjoy  : )
