We are licensed Home Bakers in Vermont and people think we bake with FRESH blueberries...that is how good these blueberries are! When we explain that we bake with dried blueberries they are astounded. Traverse Bay blueberries have minimal processing and since we do not use any preservatives or anything artificial in our baking we appreciate that ! Just note these blueberries are NOT small as some blueberries are that are grown in other parts of the country.
