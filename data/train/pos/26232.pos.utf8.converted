I first purchased Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie in the Caramel Apple flavor. While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and again, it was tasty and fulfilling, but was I in love with it? No, not really...<br /><br />I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!<br /><br />I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how "fresh" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)
