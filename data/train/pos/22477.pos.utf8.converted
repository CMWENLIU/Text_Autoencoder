I have been drinking Rooibos now for sometime and have become quite fond of it both for its taste and health benefits.  This is an excellent product at a great price.  I usually brew it at night and take it with milk.  It can also be taken without milk and has a mild sweet taste on its own.  Love rooibos (redbush) and can't recommend it enough.
