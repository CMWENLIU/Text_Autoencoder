I only just purchased my AeroGarden, so I have nothing to harvest just yet, but I wanted to comment on the high quality of the package, and the ease of setup.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The instruction manual was clearly written and diagrammed.  You simply screw in the light bulbs, attach the light to the base, add water, drop the seed packets into their slots (clearly marked), cover them, plug it in, drop in a couple of tablets and you're good to go.<br /><br />The salad greens seed kit was included in the package, but I started with the herbs, which I ordered separately.  Apparently there are additional seed packets under development.  Also, the grow light is indeed very, very bright but it's easy to program for nighttime shut-off.
