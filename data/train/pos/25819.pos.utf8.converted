PERFECT size for our little 2 lb Chihuahua puppy, and he loves the taste, and Mom loves the ingredients! I only feed him great products, and this is one of them!<br />If you have a small dog/puppy and would like to find other small tasty, healthy, treats, you should also consider Blue Buffalo Blue Bits (Which I could only find at PetSmart), and also the Zuke's Mini Naturals (which you can find here on Amazon, or Pet Supermarket). =) Have happy and healthy puppies!
