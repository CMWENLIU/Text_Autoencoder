I fed Nutro Lamb & Rice to my Min Pin for about 8 months because it was on the recommended list at the county shelter. Recently someone suggested that I stop feeding it to her, and I learned about recommendations at a DogFoodAnalysis site.<br /><br />While eating Nutro, my dog's pee was entirely clear and her poop was hard as a rock (she actually looked uncomfortable).<br /><br />Based on recommendations, I switched to Innova Adult Small Bites. Within a day, my dog's pee was appropriately yellow again and withn two days her poo was normal (not rock hard, with less straining). I don't know if there's a link, but I'm glad we switched.<br /><br />This is top quality food.
