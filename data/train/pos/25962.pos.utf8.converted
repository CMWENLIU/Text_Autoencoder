My mother recommended this product a while back.  This flaxseed meal is easy to digest and packed full of nutrition.  I add this to my oatmeal every morning.<br /><br />My daily yummy oatmeal recipe:  Boil the oatmeal (not the quick kind) with water, turn off the heat, sprinkle a little cinnamon, add couple of spoonful of this flaxseed meal and stir.  (The amount of oatmeal and the flaxseed meal will depend on the individual taste.)  Pour into a bowl; add frozen (or regular) blueberries, banana, and sprinkle with roasted walnuts.  You can add a little maple syrup or brown sugar for sweetness.  It's delicious without feeling that you are eating food that's good-for-you.  Even my picky hubby likes it.  Highly recommended for your daily health routine.<br /><br />(Note:  Pay attention to the expiration date and keep the product in the fridge in the summer so it won't get stale.  Also, after you opened the bag, keep it in an airtight container to retain freshness.)
