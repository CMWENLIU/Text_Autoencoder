I originally ordered this for my husband's k-cup style coffee pods.  I like the larger size (35 pods) compared to most carousels out there, especially since I tend to order the pods in larger quantities.  It fits easily under my upper cabinets and looks nice beside the Cuisinart coffee maker.  Since it's taller but not wider than other carousels, it makes maximum use of countertop space.  After using it for a couple of days, I've ordered a second one for tea and cocoa.  It was only a few dollars more than the 21-slot version at my local BB&B and I got free shipping.  Happy buyer here.
