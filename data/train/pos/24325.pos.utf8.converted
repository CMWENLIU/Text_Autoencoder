At the time of this review the title notes that this is a "hot chocolate tin" while it can easily be made into "hot chocolate" the buyer should know this is unsweetened cocoa...not a hot chocolate mix.  BUT...<br /><br />that said...<br /><br />Coming from a household of two foodies, two gourmet cooks (one a trained chef) and chocolate LOVERS...if you have yet to replace whatever cocoa you are using  with Scharffen berger, best do so now. :-)  Ohhhh this stuff is the best.<br /><br />I actually read about this cocoa, cough cough, in People Magazine about 10 years ago and was intriqued due to the level of true cocoa bean in it...unlike any other so called "gourmet" cocoa.  At that time I couldn't find it anywhere and had to order it from the company. Now I find it in some grocery stores...unfortunately just the "upscale" or "all natural ones"..not a bad thing, but I don't shop there every week, so not a good thing either for me at least if you are trying to find it locally.  I hope to see it more mainstream soon.<br /><br />Because we are foodies, if we like something at a restaurant it's not uncommon for us to wind up talking to the manager or chef about ingredients that stand out. In the past 3 years when I have asked about a chocolate dessert I think only once were they not using this.<br /><br />Is it great as hot cocoa? Sure...but that is SO limiting its use. I just use it for any recipe calling for cocoa.<br /><br />Negative: I have no negative on taste or quality and ratio of real cocoa used...that can't be beat. However, the price is higher...I'd rather have it in a less fancy tin and kick it down a notch on price...but I pay it and so does anyone else I know into baking...so maybe they don't have to consider that...still, it is higher so I have to grumble SOME...
