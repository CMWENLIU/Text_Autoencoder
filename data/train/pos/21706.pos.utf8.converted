Started eating sardines recently and discovered this preparation. While my Pop always has sardines around, he eats them with cheddar cheese and crackers...I eat the King O mediterranean sardines with saltines and hot giardinera! Woosh! Blasted good, you'll be dancin' in the kitchen! I've tried alot of brands at various price points and these win out. Try 'em, you'll like 'em!
