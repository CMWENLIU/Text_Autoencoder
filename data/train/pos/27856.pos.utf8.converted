I lift weights and eat a low carb diet and was looking for something I could consume that was sugar free but would satiate my cravings for sweets. This was a great buy.<br /><br />As I kid I became familiar with the taste of carob through carob malt balls. I ate them all the time. And while I do love chocolate, carob to me is a distinct flavor and I don't consider it 'fake chocolate.' I had never eaten carob in any other way and wondered if it wouldn't make a good hot drink. It definitely does. Mixing almond milk, Stevia, vanilla extract, and Chatfield's carob powder, it makes an incredible sweet and delicious hot drink without any sugar added.<br /><br />When I first tried making a hot carob drink with this product I made the mistake of just mixing it with hot water. This was actually disgusting. The carob powder however becomes delicious with the addition of a creamy milk and sweeteners.<br /><br />I look forward to doing more with this powder. For example I've already successfully made some delicious gluten-free carob muffins. I also plan on adding some to my protein drinks. There is no sugar added to this product so I can do so freely.
