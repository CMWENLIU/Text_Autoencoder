Quaker's Instant Oatmeal Express is a household favorite for us - we love the golden brown sugar, cinnamon, and baked apple varieties. Perfect to take to work & nuke in the microwave. No worries about bringing/cleaning your own bowl or (e-gads!) using a bowl already at the office. I know, not very environmentally friendly but have you seen how some other people wash the "office" dishes?
