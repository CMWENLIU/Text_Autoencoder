I have been mixing my flours to bake. But this blend comes in handy when I am short of time. I have successfully used it to convert my toll house cookie recipe, muffin recipes etc from gluten cookbooks and it works fine. The nicest thing is that it already has the gum in it, so its easy baking, with great quality! Thank you Amazon for carrying this it sures beats the local haelth food store price and is delivered to my doorstep!
