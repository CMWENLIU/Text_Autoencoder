Not only does it take less time, but you don't have the problem of the crushed pearls you often find in the standard packages. (When they dry out, some crackle and fall apart, which means you end up cooking not only the intact ones, but also the powdery stuff that ends up forming a goo in your hot water; also, some break in the process of cooking with the normal kind.) Less delicate, easy to make, and just as tasty in the end, I would suggest buying the minute kind.
