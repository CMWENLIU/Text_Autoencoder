These sterilized and filled bones are great for heavy chewers.  I raise labs for Guiding Eyes for the Blind and they recommend these bones for all their pups and dogs.  They are safe and give great chewing satisfaction and last nearly forever!  I add peanut butter to them once they are empty when I am leaving the house to give my dog something to make him happy to see me leave.  I have about 8 of them around the house and probably should just throw some away but they last soooo long!!
