I switched to Equal Exchange baking cocoa after learning about human trafficking and forced labor of children in the cocoa industry; Equal Exchange is Fair Trade so the producers are paid fairly and labor rights are respected. Prior to my Fair Trade switch, I'd always used Hershey's cocoa for baking, making hot chocolate, etc. After using Equal Exchange cocoa, I would not go back to Hershey's, even if they offered Fair Trade cocoa. The Equal Exchange cocoa is a much finer, less bitter product: it makes fantastic from-scratch brownies and hot cocoa! With Hershey's my hot cocoa was always gritty, with a lot of undissolved cocoa at the bottom of the cup; Equal Exchange baking cocoa blends right into the hot milk and tastes as smooth as the commercial hot cocoas (better flavor, though).  This is quite a bit more expensive, but it's honestly worth it, both for the sake of ethics and taste!
