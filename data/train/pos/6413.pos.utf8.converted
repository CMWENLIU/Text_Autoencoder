I ordered this product direct from ener-g website. Its really great stuff. It is the only baking powder that is sodium AND potassium free. So those who must avoid both can use this baking powder.<br />I just want to mention that there are two versions of this baking powder. An older version and a new improved version. MAKE SURE you get the NEW IMPROVED version. When I ordered from them I got two new and one old. I tryed them both and the old version didn't make the recipe rise but more than that it tasted disgusting. I called them back and they immediately sent me anothe new version of their baking powder.<br />Before buying I read some reviews and read that it can't be used in some recipes, I just want to clarify that this is absolutely not true. This baking powder can be used in any and every recipe I can think of, but there is a trick to using it. The only problem with this baking powder is that after mixing with wet ingredients it starts working. And if you wait too long to put it in the oven all the gas will have been used up. The trick is to use it at the end. My trick, which has worked perfectly every time with every recipe, is to even mix the wet and dry ingredients together before and make sure the oven is pre-heated. Then just before putting it in the oven you mix the baking powder in the mixture. It mixes and dissolves very easily with no lumps. And then put it in for baking. It works perfectly. Very small price to pay for such an awesome product.<br />do the same for any other recipe even pancakes or anything else.<br />I know of another sodium free baking powder from HAIN called featherweight baking powder BUT it contains Potassium. And it too is a single acting baking powder so you have to use it the same way I described.<br /><br />One more thing, the main ingredient in this baking powder is calcium carbonate. By using this baking powder in your foods you will be adding alot of calcium to your diet. This is Great.<br /><br />Oh sorry, one more very important note. You MUST use alot of this baking powder to have successful results. If a recipe asks for one teaspoon of baking powder then you must use around one and a half TABlESPOONS not teaspoons (which is around 5 teaspoons). The directions say to use two or three times as much but I found that using around 4 to 5 times as much gives me the best results. Surprisingly using too much never caused the end product to taste off in any way, only maybe a little dry.
