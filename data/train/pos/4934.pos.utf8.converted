I was a little dubious...I couldn't believe that green stuff would taste good since I'm kind of veggie-phobic, but these things are great!  They don't taste like green stuff at all, just a nice chocolate peanut butter flavor.  The bars have a tiny bit of crunchiness, but in a pleasant way and aren't too sweet.  I just found a tasty way to get more green in my diet, I'm so happy!  The bars are greenish inside, but if you don't look you'd never know it.
