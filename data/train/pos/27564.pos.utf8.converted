The k cup sample pack contains so many different brews of delicious coffee, cider, hot chocolate, iced coffee, cappacinos, espressos.  There are hardly two cups that are alike. Every one is different.  I don't know how there could be so many and every one delicious. I've ordered the sample pack before and plan to many more times.  It's a great gift for anyone with a k cup coffee maker. The value is good too.
