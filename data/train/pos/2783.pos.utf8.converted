I thoroughly enjoy this product.  It soothes my throat, and I believe has a calming effect on my nerves.  I dont have to take an aspirin, or anything stronger if I feel a little upset, as I do when I have to drive on the highway, for example.  I put one of the chews in the roof of my mouth and let the essence flow into my mouth and throat.  I am calmed and ready to roll.  It's better than a cough drop too.
