I first saw this product mentioned in Men's Health as a recommended breakfast supplement.  It tastes pretty good (not too sweet or bitter) and is quite filling. Very healthy, especially if you use skim milk. This product uses Splenda as a sweetener and my doctor says there are no concerns about Splenda the way there are with Aspartame. This has a nice level of protein and extremely low fat - but not over the top protein like body builders like to supplement, and there's no need for blenders etc. - just spoon stir.  I drink some almost every morning and it helps curb my apettite.  You can prepare and drink in about one minute.  The only issue is it is hard to find in local stores - but you get a better deal on line anyway if you order by the case...
