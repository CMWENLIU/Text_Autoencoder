This pasta is really delicious, as well as being considerably lower in calories than regular pasta, and having 18g fiber per serving. I agree that it is a bit blander tasting that regular pasta, but I actually like that: since it doesn't overwhelm the sauce you are using (the way whole wheat pastas tend to do), it allows the sauce to be the star of your dish. A 2-ounce portion is very satisfying. The sampler is a nice way to try it out. Mine came with 2 boxes each of penne, rotini, and linguine. Will definitely recommend it friends!
