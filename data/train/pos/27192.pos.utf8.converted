My cousin started the Atkin's diet to lose weight before his wedding.  I was getting married 2 months after him and needed a diet buddy.  Since we worked & lunched together it was perfect.  He was eating pasta one day and told me that I could have pasta too as long as it's Dreamfields.  He suggested that I buy the Victoria's Organic Tomato & Basil sauce it's lower in carbs (4 net carbs per cup).  I bought it and added a splash of red wine, a bit of garlic, some fresh frozen basil leaves crumbled up and a dash of salt and pepper.  I had a low carb spaghetti dish that my Italian fiance drooled over... haha!  Good stuff.  Just be sure to follow the directions so that it's not over cooked ;o)
