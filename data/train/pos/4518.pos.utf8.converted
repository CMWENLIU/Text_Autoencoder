Jawbusters are hard candies about the size and shape of a gumball.  Why I like them:<br /><br />  1. They are individually wrapped so you can stuff them in your purse<br /><br />  or pocket and they won't get sticky or lint-y.<br /><br />  2. The flavors are really distinctive from each other, they don't all<br /><br />  taste the same - red really tastes like cherry and yellow really<br /><br />  tastes like lemon<br /><br />  3. They are not too sweet.
