I used to buy the GREEN TEA WITH GINSING and it was very good but then they stopped selling it and replaced<br />it with GREEN TEA WITH GINSING & HONEY.....way too sweet! And the diet kind had that funny taste.<br />  I'm so glad I found this one....it tastes wonderful...AND HAS 0 CALORIES & it's way cheaper then the jugs<br />in the stores. It's very simple to mix & it stays mixed. GREAT PRODUCT!
