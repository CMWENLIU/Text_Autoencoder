Had vines that were taking over. They were creeping / had buried roots growing horizontally, which can complicate killing them. To get rid of them, I cut the upward=growing vines about half a foot above the ground. I did this so that if I had to apply the product again, I would have enough vine remaining to cut again. Sometimes if the vine (or root or base of tree or shrub) is really thick, it can take more than one application. (It's best to apply the product to a fresh cut.) In order to apply it twice or three times, you want to leave enough length so that you can make the cut again. This stuff is strong, so don't get me wrong. But, for really large diameters, leave yourself some extra in case you have to come back.<br /><br />I've used this on oak trees too. Just cut the sapling down to size and spritz the stub. If anything grows back, you can spray the leaves or make a fresh cut. Eventually when enough of the root is destroyed, it will not grow back.<br /><br />Great product. Would buy again.
