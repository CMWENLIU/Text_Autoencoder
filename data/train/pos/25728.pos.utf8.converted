I use these for several reasons.  They are great if your 'throughput' is a little sluggish, they will help you up your water intake (because they are VERY dry), and they stop carb cravings because they fill your stomach.  I spread a little sugar free jelly or Walden Farms sugar free chocolate sauce on them to help ease the dryness.  Don't get me wrong, you need to like the taste of bran.  They are sort of like all-bran got stomped by an elephant and made into a wafer.  I eat them to stop my pacing the kitchen late at night or to cure the same thing around 3:30 in the afternoon, which allows me to stay on my eating program.
