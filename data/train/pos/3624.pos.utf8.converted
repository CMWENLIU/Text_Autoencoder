I love this chocolate powder. My family and I recently became aware that MSG and its hidden forms (autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed protein, yeast extract, calcium caseinate, natural flavors, etc.) are the source of our health problems. This discovery led to searching for less processed (especially by high heat) food products. This is a great find! Do beware, if you try this stuff you will not be able to go back to Hershey's....it is that good. Hot chocolate, chocolate ice cream, chocolate nut butters are all fabulous made with chocolate powder rather than highly processed cocoa powder.
