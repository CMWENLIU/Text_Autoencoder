My dog had an expensive and painful bout of pancreatitis, the vet prescribed this food for me.  Generally, these specialized diets don't impress me when you really look at the ingredients, but the first few ingredients on this can are: chicken broth, chicken, whitefish, brewers rice, corn grits, chicken liver, beef by-products...and so on.  I generally look at the first 5 ingredients and I thought these were pretty good.  Still, my dog was VERY sick and hadn't eaten in 3 days, the vet tried the Hills prescription diet and she didn't want it, finally my dog ate a few bites of this food.  In conclusion, my dog doesn't have the greatest constitution, if you have a greyhound, you know that solid poopies are a blessing, and with this food, she did great.  She liked it and didn't get diarrhea, so I can't complain.  Except that the price is a bit much, come on, lets be real.  But compared to a vet visit, this food has worked wonders.
