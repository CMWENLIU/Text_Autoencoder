Honestly, I was a bit skeptical on ordering nuts online. Mainly for fear they would not be as fresh AND they would be broken via the shipping process. I am a baker year round and quality is of highest inportance to me. I am THRILLED to tell anyone else with these concerns, these nuts not only arrived quite fresh with a long expire date but so well packaged, breakage was of normal expectation, quite minimal, no more than if you picked them from a shelf at a grocery. Even though I chose free shipping, which can take a bit longer, they arrived in no time at all. I will not hesitate to continue ordering my baking needs from Amazon.com.
