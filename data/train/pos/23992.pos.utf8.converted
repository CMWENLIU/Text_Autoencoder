These are my favorite veggie dogs, tender and tasty. Morningstar frozen ones are terrible. I see they're back! Another way to prepare: Mash one up with mayonnaise and eat like tuna salad. They're precooked. Try it, you'll like it.<br /><br />Order now if they're available; they go in and out of stock.
