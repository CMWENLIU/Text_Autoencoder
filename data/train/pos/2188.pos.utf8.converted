This stuff is really hard to find in the stores when it's not the holiday season. I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon for a decent price.<br /><br />I've been making raw vegan chocolate avocado pudding, and the color just isn't as appetizing when you use regular cocoa; you need the special dark to avoid it turning out greenish-brown.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, here's the recipe:<br /><br />5 Tablespoons Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa<br />5 Tablespoons honey or agave (agave gives a milder taste)<br />3/4 C full-fat coconut milk or cream (canned is fine)<br />1 tsp vanilla<br />2 ripe avocados<br /><br />Throw it all in a blender and blend, blend, blend until it's totally smooth. Spoon into small dishes (this stuff is rich!) and chill. That's it! You won't believe how awesome this tastes; you don't taste the avocado at all.
