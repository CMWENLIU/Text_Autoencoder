When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!
