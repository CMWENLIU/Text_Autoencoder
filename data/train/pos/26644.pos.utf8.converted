Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Strawberry is second only to blueberry for my favorite of those flavors; the strawberry ones, like the blueberry ones seem a little sweeter but the sugars content is the same so it may just be my imagination.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together.  Dried strawberries are the third fruit in the strawberry flavor.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts:  calories, 170; total carbs, 14g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.
