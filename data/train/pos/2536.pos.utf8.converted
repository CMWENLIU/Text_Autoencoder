These bars were soft and not too sweet.  The blackberry center actually tasted like blackberries and not that fake, super sweet, not-real-fruit taste.  The graham crust compliments the blackberries.  The wrappers keep the bars moist so they travel well.  They are small but filling and a great snack or part of a breakfast at just 110 calories each.  I will buy these again.
