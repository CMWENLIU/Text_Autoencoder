What can be said about Quinoa that somebody shopping for it doesn't already know?  One thing I've seen - a lot of talk about "pre-washing" and how it's worth a couple of dollars a pound.  I don't agree.  It's not a lot of trouble to wash some grain.  Put it in a sieve, hold it under the faucet, let the water run a minute and dump the sieve into the water in the cookpot.  Pay yourself two dollars.<br /><br />Plain, boiled quinoa tastes a little funny to me.  So, I found I like it half and half with rice.  A cup of rice, a cup of quinoa, four and a half cups of water.  Bring to a boil.  Simmer covered without stirring for 15-20 minutes.  Push the rice/quinoa apart a little with a fork to see if there's any water left on the bottom of the pot.  Let it sit covered with no heat for ten minutes.  It is a LOT faster than rice.  But the rice cooks completely - I have no idea why.  I like it that way with butter, salt and pepper.  But I'll add things like sausage and/or chopped onions, peppers - it's like making an omelette - try it anyway you fancy and you'll like it. It keeps nicely in Glad or Tupperware in the refrigerator.  Scoop some out, microwave it, melt some butter in it and enjoy.  Hard to believe it's healthy, too.<br /><br />I bought this big bag six months ago and eat some every noon and often under goulash or stew.  It's been uniformly good and I haven't found anything in the bag other than Quinoa.  But, if I were to find gravel or something else in it, I'd contact Amazon or whoever sold it to me.  I haven't needed to very often in more than ten years of dealing with them but when I have, Amazon has been immediate in doing whatever it is they decide needs to be done to make me happy.
