I'm addicted to the Lemon Feta.  Had these at the Hilton in Orlando on vacation by the pool and could not stop eating them.  I had to scour the web to find sellers as no one sold them locally when I got home. They are healthy and amazing! If you have kids, give them these, not those greasy brands we all know come in a big yellow bag.  Blech!
