I ate a lot of ramen noodle soups in my college dorm days (didn't we all?) but this one is SO much better!  The noodles are the Udon style which means they are thicker and heartier than the Nissan or Maruchan.  Also, this soup contains not only a soup base packet but also a veggie packet, which the other soups don't.  Even better!<br /><br />In the veggie packet is a lot of dried seaweed, which, when added to the boiling water, rehydrates into recognizable, pleasantly chewy chunks of seaweed!  The flavor base contains mussels and cuttlefish, so, between the seaweed and those sea creatures, there is a nice seafood flavor to the broth.  And, to be honest, with Nissan and Maruchan, I really can't tell the difference between "oriental" "chicken" "beef" or "pork" flavors... they all just taste pretty much like "broth".  With this soup, the broth actually tastes good and the seafood flavor comes through!  And, while it is nicely spicy, in the future, I may add some Sriracha since I like it even spicier!  I might also add some dried mushrooms and a few green onions, and, once in a while, Sichuan peppercorns for some tingly, floral flavor since I love them in my Asian soups!<br /><br />Also, I have never been to any Asian countries (only Europe) but Hubby has spent a lot of time with the military in Japan and Korea, so I asked him how this packaged soup compared to noodle vendors on the streets... and he said that they usually included some sort of protein (squid, octopus, pork or beef mostly) with the soup, but the noodles and broth were VERY similar to the flavor and spiciness of this soup.  He also enjoys it!<br /><br />As some reviewers recommended, I also added an egg at the end of cooking to add to the protein.  I love to cook, but there are days when I'm just too tired and 2 packages of this soup makes a nice, filling (and quick and easy!) meal for under a dollar each for Hubby and me.  I actually purchased this soup at a HUGE Asian market about 30 miles from me... for $1.09, so amazon beats their price if you spend $25 to get free shipping... and you don't have to spend the gas!  I see they now also have a subscription service which lowers the price even further.<br /><br />Compared to Nissan and Maruchan (and especially that dreck in the "cup o' noodles" which has NO flavor!), this Nong Shim soup rates 5 stars from me!
