Blackstrap Molasses is sought for its natural Calcium, Iron, Potassium, and Magnesium ingredients.  It is as valuable as a food as much as it is a sweetener.  Brer Rabbit has the highest content of these than any other brand I've used. This is why I prefer Brer Rabbit Blackstrap Molasses above all the rest.<br />Example :  Per 1Tbsp Serving<br />  BrerRabbit Magnesium 25%<br />  TreeofLife Magnesium 10%
