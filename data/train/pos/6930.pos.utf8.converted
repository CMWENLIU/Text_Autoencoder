I originally decided to try Amazing Grass after some great reviews of the stuff. I ordered both the Normal and Kids Samples of the Green Superfood variety. The chocolate was the first one I tasted, and by far, the best. So, it's the one I bought. I have used this stuff for 2 weeks now.<br /><br />Taste: The taste is pretty fair. Not the best. Not the worst. Compared to the other flavors, this stuff is fantastic. It has a very apparent chocolate flavor with hints of a "green" flavor. It is not very sweet, but not bitter, either. I use plain, unsweetened almond milk to mix mine with, and it tastes decent. However, it tastes best when blended with half a frozen banana, or just half of a banana with some blended crushed ice. When prepared this way, it's really quite good. Drinking it with a milk of some variety is rather important, as when mixed strictly with water (didn't have milk at one point) it tastes absolutely horrific. Taste wise, this stuff is maybe a solid B. I certainly appreciated it most after trying the Berry, Lemon Lime, Original, Kids Chocolate and Kids Berry flavors. They were all absolutely repulsive. I let a couple of people I work with try the Berry with me, one girl ran to the bathroom gagging, one spit it out, and the guy who tried it choked it down unwillingly and stuffed about 3 peppermints into his mouth afterward, cursing me for having him try it. So, compared to those, chocolate is exceptionally good.<br /><br />Texture: The texture depends on how it's blended. If you just use milk, it does get chunky and doesn't blend well. If you blend it with a small amount of water first, then add your choice of milk afterward, it blends much better and you should get a chocolate milk appearance. I have had several occasions where it just didn't blend, even with water, for some reason. When I blend it with a frozen banana, I do not add milk. The blender seems to be the best way to get it all good and mixed up perfectly.<br /><br />Health Effects: This is why I gave this product a full five stars. It's absolutely amazing. I read so many reviews thinking "placebo effect" or "it certainly won't affect ME that much." However, I've noticed very distinct differences in my health. My chronic fatigue has  disappeared. I simply don't get sleepy throughout the day anymore. Also, I have food sensitivities to dairy, grains, and excessive sugars, so I typically eat a paleo-ish diet. Normally, when I eat something even remotely bad, such as a cupcake, I'll become extremely exhausted within an hour and will always break out within a day or two. However, I've eaten very poorly the past week with candies, donuts and even a pizza with cheese. I drink this stuff immediately after and the inevitable crash NEVER comes and my face doesn't break out. I actually left this stuff at home over the weekend when I was out of town, and when I had a donut without drinking this stuff after, I had my usual crash followed by a mild breakout. Had some candy this morning, followed by this stuff, and again, no crash. For the health benefits alone, this stuff lives up to the hype and it's name. It truly is amazing.
