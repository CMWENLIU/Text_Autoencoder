Basmati rice is a very well kept secret in America. Most Americans seem to think all rice is the same (often boring is mentioned). Basmati rice is an adventure from the moment you read the label on the package. As the rice is cooked, a savory fragrance fills the air not too unlike freshly popped pop corn. Having tried various brands of Basmati rice, none have come close to Tilda. The superior quality of product and packageing has made me a loyal fan.
