Torani's White Chocolate Mocha Sauce is an absolute acceptable substitute to StarBucks! And if you think not than you're just too picky and you should go there and pay the price for the real thing! I mean seriously what more could you ask for? By signing up for subscribe & save thru Amazon it drops the price down to $19.12 with free shipping and you pick when you want your next shipment to be, up to 6 months out, plus if you put in the promotional coupon code UNILEV51 you get another 15% off bringing your total to only $14.62 for a case of 6 average ketchup size bottles 16.5oz! Which breaks down to be $2.44 per bottle. You can go into your account and skip an order or get one sooner or even cancel anytime you want. Once you open a bottle you put it in the refrigerator, they're not gigantic size like the 64oz ones which may expire before you have a chance to use it up. The quaility of the product itself far exceeds it's price. Rich flavor and thick texture, a little goes along way, even for those who like there's extra sweet like me! I drink my latte's with quadropple shots and use more syrup to level out the bitterness while keeping the strongness. My coffe mug is large and I make at least one if not two drinks per day, with that being said for a reference it still takes me at least a week to use one bottle. I do buy the StarBucks beans, the Italian roast instead of the Expresso it's a stronger bean so I don't have to use as much. What I use to pay $7.88 for(6 shot, venti, white mocha)I now pay approximately $0.86! My savings in the first month alone paid for a cappichino-expresso-steamer-coffee maker macchine and I didn't buy a cheap one either. Of course it's not exactly StarBucks, but once you've played around and experimented to get it the way you like it the difference is minor enough for the sacrifice and the HUGE savings! What I use to spend per year at Starbucks will now easily cover the cost of my utility bills: gas, electric and my cell phone! So exactly how picky do you really want to be?
