I love this product for it's taste and nutritional benefits. Since I eat it almost every morning, I usually cook up 4 servings at a time. Four cups water, 1 cup McCann's Steelcut Oatmeal, 1/4 cup Cranraisins, 1/4 golden raisins. I cook it for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. I then pour it into a square pyrex dish, cover, refrigerate.  When it is fully cold, I cut it into 4 section.  Each morning, I'm able to pull out one section, chop it up a bit, add Vanilla Soy Milk, and microwave for 2 minutes (depending on microwave power). Before eating I add 1/4 cup raw oatbran, a dash of cinnamon and enjoy. I highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal.
