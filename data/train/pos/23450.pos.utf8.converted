A one-ounce package consists of a little over a dozen bites. This package has only 18 oz in it... and is way overpriced! I bought a 1 oz package from Walmart for $0.88. I've tried the orange, apple, and pomegranite flavors and all are really yummy and no artificial ingredients although I don't see any pomegrante in the ingredient list for that flavor. They are mostly made of apple, very soft, chewy, and just about melt in your mouth.<br /><br />If Amazon becomes more reasonable on their bulk packaging... I'll be picking them up here, otherwise I'll buy them individually.<br /><br />They do come in a resealable ziploc package but not enough in a 1 oz to really "keep" for long so I feel it's a wasted benefit. However, if the bulk packages were 5 or 6 oz, then the ziploc would be great (and the price would be more fitting)!
