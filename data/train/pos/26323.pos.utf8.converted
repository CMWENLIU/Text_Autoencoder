Went to a Red Robin's chain restaurant the other night and they featured a holiday drink made with this syrup and Sprite. I decided to try it, and the waitress warned me not to get it unless I liked the taste of gingerbread. I assured her I did. Wow, was it delicious! The syrup gave it a very ginger bread cookie flavor; it even had a bit of bite to it. I can see why I was warned about the strength. Turns out this company makes a ton of syrup flavors. I can't wait to try a bunch of them. If this one is any indication, they'll taste just like what they say they are, and have versatile applications mixed with soda, coffee, hot chocolate, smoothies and more!
