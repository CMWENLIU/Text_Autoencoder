I just love this stuff. To some it may seem weird to eat the flowers you relate to your perfume etc. But it's a taste you must try! My favorite is to sprinkle sparingly on my rice dishes and deserts! Plain Rice, Dab Of Butter, Dash Of Salt, and sprinkle of Lavender...MMMHHH GOOD!<br /><br />A major benefit is for my son who has Autism. He just loves to smell this and adds it to everything he wants to give me. It makes him feel so proud that he made Mom's food, birthday card, etc not only look good but smell wonderful. It has him smiling daily at his accomplishments. He knows IT IS SAFE FOR INGESTING! That's a really good thing. The other day I caught him adding it to his bath water! The sheepish grin when I walked in was priceless! I recommend keeping a bottle of this handy!
