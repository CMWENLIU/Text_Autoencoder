I've had my Senseo for about 2 months and love it.  I'm the only coffee drinker in my family so making a pot of coffee is a waste for me.  This is quick and easy and great tasting.  Pods are expensive at the grocery store but can be found other places cheaper.  Folgers is coming out with a competing machine and pods so the price of the pods should go down soon.
