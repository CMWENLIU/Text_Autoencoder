This Scottish oatmeal from Barry Farms is absolutely delicious.  It cooks fairly quickly - much faster than steel cut oats which also have great flavor - and has a full nutty flavor.  I usually fix mine the night before which is so easy, I can do it during a commercial on TV  - use a ratio of 1 c milk, 1/4 c oats, a pinch of salt, a tablespoon of raw sugar and some dried cranberries. Bring to a slight boil while stirring, cook one minute, turn off the heat and let it cool covered for a while then put into the fridge.  Next morning, stir and then microwave until hot.  Add more milk if you like it runnier.  This is perfect every time and the flavour can't be beaten.
