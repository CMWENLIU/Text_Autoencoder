This is good stuff.<br /><br />I add a coarsely chopped large onion, a full bulb of crushed garlic cloves, about 1/4 of a 16 oz jar of better than bullion chicken seasoning, a half dozen bay leaves, 2 tablespoons of chopped basil, 2 tablespoons of ground cumin seed, approximately 1 tablespoon of sea salt, a tablespoon of crushed red papper flakes, and enough water so that this fills a 5 quart dutch oven when it's fully cooked.  It's more like a stew than a soup as it's thick, but it is very good eating and leftovers are even better.<br /><br />One package of this makes enough for several meals for both the wife and I.
