After living in Japan for 4 years, I am hooked on Green Tea. At home I drink loose green tea (better quality), but as far as tea bags go this one is excellent. I use the tea bags at work and on travel.<br />I particular like this value pack. It is a lot cheaper than buying smaller units or buying it directly from Yamamotoyama.
