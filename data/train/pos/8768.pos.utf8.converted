As someone who is sensitive to chemicals in foods, I was very upset when Malt O Meal who mass produced Puffed Wheat stopped. The only other product available to me was Quaker, but that had BHT preservatives in it which set off allergic reactions.<br />Being desperated I tried Arrowhead Mills product and was so grateful it is just puffed wheat without anything else.<br /><br />For people who have eaten enough puffed cereals, they will know that some taste burnt and some are light puffed. This comes from a process where one company explodes the grain in puffing by heating the grain which toasts it and another more modern method which uses steam pressure.<br />It is either the heat or steam pressure which when released which causes the grain to "puff".<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills is the toasted type and it is very good. It also unlike the steam pressure or the old Malt O Meal type not as perfected in that it is a bit more crunchy like the original puffed wheat of a century ago.<br /><br />For those with allergies, I believe the toasting makes the product less inflamatory to the body in "killing" the oils, germ and hull which affect many people.<br /><br />The bags are small, but surprisingly one can get around 7 bowls of cereal out of them.<br />The puffed wheat is though like all puffed wheat in softening readily in milk, but as stated the packages I have the puffed wheat has a bit more texture like original puffed wheat.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with this product and hope to have it stocked locally. It was good enough for me to even consider purchasing puffed millet in the future.<br /><br />I hope this helps people in their decisions. God bless.
