These are great! Just like the other reviewer said, you honeslty can't tell the difference between these and regular pretzels. And they're healthier for you becuase they're made with whole grains instead of enriched flours....plus, Amazon offers them at a SUPER price. My local whole foods store sells them for around 2.50-3.00 a bag. It's a smaller bag, so $19 for 12 bags is super.
