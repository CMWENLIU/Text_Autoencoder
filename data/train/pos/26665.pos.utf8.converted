This does not taste artificial. It's delicious! Better tasting than most actual pulpy peaches these days. You'd have to have the tastebuds of a Macho Montana Iguana to not enjoy savoring this tea. I know whereof I speak, having entertained an Irascible Iguana who only deigned to eat raw elk-burger. Then he'd run around and try to bite the cat's tail. He grew large and monstrous on elk-burger, but would never eat a peach, or any other foodstuff he was supposed to like, aside from meat.<br /><br />So, go for it. Be an Uniguana and drink your serene peach tea sweetened with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granular, Individual Packets, 700-Count Box</a>. This true peach adds to the fantastic spectrum of Celestial Season's flavors. PS: The cat was given to a rural artist, grew large and happy, and did not miss the lizard.
