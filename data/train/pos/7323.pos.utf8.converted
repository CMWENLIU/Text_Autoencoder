I have enjoyed this tea for about fifeteen years. It was introduced to me by a tea shop owned by a Ms. Gray originally from London, England. She was a child there during the second world war. She was moved to the country side during the war because of the bombing of London. After thae war she moved to the United Staes settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I never questioned her about her reason to move here but suspect it was because of her marriage to an American soldier while he was in England. Ms. Gray and her daughter ran a tea shop in Bay View, an area on the south side of Milwakee. For a reason unknown to me she moved her business to Waukesha, a small city about twenty miles west of Miwaukee. Her new shop was located in the heart of Waukesha and drew many people. I moved to Waukesha in nineteen eighty and was introduced to the new shop by my wife. We then enjoyed breakfast there almost evey Saturday morning.<br /><br />My paternal grandmother was originally from London, having moved to Milwaukee at the age of seven, with her mother and her father, an engineer, who was sent to a new engineering office in Milwaukee by his employer in England in eighteen eighty two. She spoke to me at quite length about her childhood in England and Milwaukee. As a result I developed a kinship to the English people.<br /><br />One morning at the tea shop Ms. Gray sat down at my table and we discussed our past and other things. I then learned that Ms. Gray's grandfather had started the Gray's Pottery Company in England. My wife was a collector of English Children's Plates, epescially those from Gray's Pottery. We all became quite good friends, having a number of things in common.<br /><br />The tea Ms. Gray served as her "House Tea" was what she called Yorkshire Red, the very tea that I am speaking of here. It is a rather full bodied tea, often replacing coffee in many people's breakfasts. Taylors of Harrogate recommends the use of sugar and cream or milk in this coffee, the same way that I prefer it.<br /><br />The tea shop was closed in the late nineteen ninety due to the hard work required to make all the items the tea shop sold. These included skones and other baked items along with the breakfast staples served by Ms. Gray and her daughter. Yet Yorkshire Red remains my favorite beverage for breakfast. I have never lost my taste for it and probably never will. It has become an old friend of mine bringing back to me many fond memories. I suspect that you too will feel this way afer adding to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Martin Ullstrup<br />Saint Francis, Wisconsin.
