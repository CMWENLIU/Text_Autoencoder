I had given up using bullion cubes due to their toxic levels of sodium and other questionable ingredients. I had started making my own broth on the weekends and freezing it but as a hack cook, it was too laborious for me. So I was thrilled to find this product - way less sodium and still has plenty of flavor. This has become a staple in my pantry.
