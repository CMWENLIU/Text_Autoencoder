Once I had the Ceylon cinnamon, I realized just how much of the typical grocery store cinnamon was some kind of filler and not real cinnamon at all. I was interested in the health benefits of the Ceylon cinnamon which helps regulate blood sugar and reduce the very dangerous abdominal fat. I add a little of this to oatmeal or yogurt every morning and am just now beginning to see positive results. This seems to curb my sweet tooth too. That may be all in my head, but I notice that I crave sweets more when I miss my daily dose of cinnamon.
