I used to eat a ton of tuna.<br />I'm 37 years old...do any of you remember what tuna was like when we were little?<br />It was actually chunky and looked like something that came from a living creature?<br />Then somewhere along the line "chunk" tuna literally started looking like cat food.<br />You'd open the can to drain the water and half the tuna would spill out with the water.<br />It's revolting.<br />Then upon further research (Google LOL)..... I found out that the majority of tuna makers started using a variety of Tuna called "Skip Jack".<br />They're still tuna but much smaller and less expensive.<br />That's why tuna looks like cat food nowadays.<br />If you want the good stuff, you have to get the solid chunk tuna.<br />It's more expensive but it's worth it.<br />Then one fine day I saw the Bumblebee Thai and figured it would taste like spicy cat food.<br />Man was I WRONG!!!<br />I went from a tuna lover to a tuna hater and back again.<br />This tuna is the ultimate treat.<br />It's spicy but not overly hot.<br />It's simply delicious in salad.<br />It's probably the only tuna I can literally eat right out of the can.<br />I cannot rave enough about this particular brand of tuna.<br />Spicy<br />Delicious<br />A home run for Bumblebee.<br />Highly recommended.
