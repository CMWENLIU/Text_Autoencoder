I love these bars! If you are on WW, they are only 2 points. They are much largers than the WW 2pt. bars and very filling. You could treat them as a snack or meal replacement. My local grocery is no longer carrying these bars as a result, I made my purchase through Amazon at a great price. I was paying a dollar or more for individual bars. The chocolate peanut is fabulous. Can easily curb your craving for a Snickers! I was also pleased with how fresh they were.
