Well, unlike some of the reviewers here I know granola.<br />Good granola is hard to come by, it is even hard to make it so that it still tastes good the next day, because it requires freshness, high ratio of quality non-oat ingredients, small baking batch size, large oat size and flavor/texture variety.<br /><br />I hesitate to give this granola the accolades it deserves because I worry it will go the deplorable way of Be*r N*ked.<br /><br />I can safely say I have tried all the granola in all the stores on both West and East coasts and this Dr Flynn's Granola is probably the smartest and one of the best, up there with some of the small bakeries who make their own daily.<br /><br />How does Dr. Flynn do it, in a packaged granola from Amazon?<br />This granola is generous to a fault and has an opinion, called oily cassia.<br />Organic Saigon Cassia is not the dry cinnamon you get at the grocery store.<br /><br />Most granola is baked too fast, stingy with the good stuff and substitutes sugar for flavor, but not Dr. Flynn's Organic Granola.<br /><br />The high quality cassia cinnamon in this granola has a mind altering sweetness to it that regular stick cinnamon does not. Which means that Dr Flynn can use less sugar while giving more sweetness, and not only that, but instead of filler oats pumped full of cheap sugar, she loads it up with protein-rich pecans, almonds, cashews and coconut, wow!<br /><br />The prize goes to the cassia she found, which has more of the aromatic oils that coat and mingle gloriously well with the nutty roasty flavors in granola. It is like a healthy version of MSG, that transforms familiar flavors into the state they usually only achieve while baking. Just smell this granola, it is like opening the oven when you are baking cookies!<br /><br />Cassia also has some controversial and astonishing health effects such as a blood sugar regulating ability and anticoagulant properties.<br />With so many people suffering from blood sugar and heart disease related issues this granola, used in moderation, seems like it might be both a dangerously delicious and potentially live saving way to start the day.
