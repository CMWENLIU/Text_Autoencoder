I was given this by my daughter in law, and it works as I slept through the night, rare for me. Plus it is sweet nectar.  She bought it for me from a party store.  Your price is high in comparison to the party store.  1.79 a bottle vrs 2.60 per bottle when bought in a case of 12 for 31.19. I'm tempted to pay it, but will check out the local stores first.
