First off, we all love rice at our house. I also love wild rice and rice pilaf,<br />although the others are not all that big on those dishes.<br /><br />So, when I read the descriptions on this, I thought it sounded really tasty, but<br />had some real hesitations about buying six packs of the rice. I wondered how we'd actually<br />manage to use six bags before it went bad.<br /><br />Well, the bags are not all that huge. Each bag is one pound of rice. I guess I had a hard<br />time visualizing it, but the bags are fairly small. I don't have one in front of me, but they<br />are maybe 6" square.<br /><br />Anyway, we made the first bag this weekend, putting it in a crock pot and letting it cook<br />on low for 2 or 3 hours. Hubby is the chef in our house, and he used beef broth with the rice.<br />We had it with some sausage for dinner. Let me say - WOW!<br />This is really tasty rice! Between the four of us, we managed to wipe out the entire pound<br />of rice (yes, it was that good!), and were figuring out what the next meal with the rice would be!<br /><br />Watch your prices on this - they vary widely, even across Amazon. But, as long as it stays in the price<br />range on this listing, then we'll be buying it again. Seriously, this stuff tastes great! It was<br />tasty, filling and actually easier to chew than I thought it might be (I have troubles with crunchy foods).<br /><br />Thank you Lundberg for a really great blend of rice.  You've converted us!
