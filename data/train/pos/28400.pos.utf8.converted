Several years ago, we found this in the local stores when it was first introduced.  We tried it and loved it.  For people who aren't huge Spam fans, the cheese helps to soften the taste.  For kids, anything with cheese is a big hit.  We haven't been able to find this in stores for a very long time.  Several years ago, we looked at ordering it directly from Spam online but their price was too high and shipping even worse.  Discovering Spam with Cheese at Amazon and Prime eligible is a great find.
