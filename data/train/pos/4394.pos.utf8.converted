With all the various Mothers/Stepmothers/In-laws, etc that I had to buy for on Mother's Day, I decided to order flowers through amazon, for ease.  It was a convenient way to send flowers to multiple recipients - and I just hoped that the flowers would look okay.  In fact I was thrilled that EVERYONE who received these tulips raved about them.  All recipients stated that the flowers were expertly packed, very fresh, beautiful, and lasted a long time.  I will use pro-flowers (via amazon) for all future flower purchases.
