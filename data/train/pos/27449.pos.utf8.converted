I absolutely love dark chocolate. However it can be hard to find a really good dark chocolate product. Some products can be too bitter. However, Dove dark chocolate is the best that I have ever tasted. The chocolate is so smooth and has a taste of luxury. I have tasted expensive chocolates before but Dove has them beat. Just like my review title, it is a pure chocolate dream. Their dark chocolate ice cream bars I highly recommend too!!
