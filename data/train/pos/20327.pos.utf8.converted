I began purchasing this food after moving into my own apartment with my cat Lily.  I had been buying her store bought cat food, but started researching the different foods to try to find the best one.  I found this, and started her on it.  After a few weeks/months, I noticed a big difference...more energy, shinier and softer coat, less poop.<br /><br />I now have two cats (Lily and a stray I adopted off the street)who are living with another family member for the time being.  I still buy this food and take it up to them, it's just worth it that much!  The difference in the stray's appearance is amazing, he has gone from a slightly dirty looking black cat to a silky, shiny, super soft black cat.<br /><br />This food is absolutely worth it.  You are feeding the cats a VERY good diet, they actually eat less (my 2 cats get one cup of food per day, they may not even eat all of it), they poop less, and the poo is firmer and less smelly.<br /><br />The price seems high, but when you factor in the economy of the food, it is not bad at all.  One of these big bags will feed my 2 cats for over 2 months!<br /><br />I have no doubt that if I continue feeding this to my 2 cats, they will live long, healthy, and happy lives.
