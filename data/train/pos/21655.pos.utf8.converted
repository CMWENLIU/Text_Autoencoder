My aunt recommended years ago that I try Greens First, or something like that. She is a dietician and knew my eating habits, which is to say she knew I didn't eat vegetables hardly at all. I never really liked the idea, I imagined it would taste gross and I really didn't care much about my health at the time.<br /><br />Fast forward to age 31 and I'm looking to lose some weight and try to avoid major health issues down the road. My girlfriend was using this stuff, and when she moved out, she left a full, unopened container of the Berry flavored version of this stuff. I decided I'd try it out. I read that you were to mix 1 scoop with at least 6 oz of water, and so I put a scoop in a 16oz glass and filled the cup with water, and mixed it all around. The visual disgusted me. It looked like I had taken a glass and dipped it into a scummy pond and filled it with it's water. But I got over that and took a sip. It wasn't bad! Not something I crave, but it wasn't disgusting at all. So I took a bigger drink, licked the chunky crap off my lips, and set it down. I kept going until the glass was half full and I noticed the sludge at the bottom. So I poured more water in, and kept at it.<br /><br />Moral of the story, it tastes good enough for me to mix with just water. However, I need lots of water. I just take on scoop, put it in my glass, then poor in water. When I get to the sludgy bottom, I poor more water in, re mix and drink down. Repeat until it's all gone. This gives me a healthy dose of water for the day, plus the greens.<br /><br />I can't say I have any more energy then before. I can certainly see how it would help with constipation issues, if you have those. And I've been losing weight, but I've also been working out and consuming fewer calories. In the end, I'll keep using it because my diet needs improvement.
