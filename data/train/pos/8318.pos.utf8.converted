I wanted to taste it just because I like to taste new stuff, and because it is claimed to be "superfood". I liked the taste and now I drink this one or ONE Acai nearly every day, just because I like the taste and because it's conveniently delivered to me by Amazon's subscription.<br /><br />I buy tons of stuff on Amazon and rarely write reviews, but I remember when I first open this web-page I hesitated to buy, because there were a lot of negative reviews. I finally bought it out of curiosity, and was prepared for something awful. It turned out to be one of my favorite drinks. So I thought it would be fair for the product if I write a review.<br /><br />I gave it to other people to taste, and most people liked it. Like with any food, there are personal preferences. Some people drink coffee, some don't. So my advice is - ignore any review (positive and negative). If you want to taste it, taste it.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not telling that Acai juice is any better than let's say blueberry juice. It's just that I like variety, and that Amazon delivers this one to me. I would enjoy Amazon having more natural berry juices available for delivery.<br />P.P.S. Amazon, please, resume selling the Acai+Blueberry juice from Zola. I liked it the most out of Original/+Blueberry/+Pineapple, and you took it out...
