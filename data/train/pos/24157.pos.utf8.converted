I purchased several cases of the Trivedi Water to try for myself.  After obtaining the water I noticed a cold sore coming on.  I put a little bit of the water (about 1 drop) on the area that was beginning to hurt and repeated this every hour for 12 hours.  At the end of that time the cold sore was GONE.  It has been over a week and I still do not have any signs of the dreaded cold sore.  After that experirnce I had several small cuts on my hands(I work with my hands) and I put the water on these cuts and they were HEALED over night.  I then put some on a pineapple plant that I have struggled with for over a year and the results are nothing short of stunning.  The plant has started to grow with vigor and it is NOVEMBER!  I then put some in my dogs water and they are all much more active and my oldest dog (she is 12) is now acting like a puppy! Please do yourself a favor and try a case of the water.  You will not be disappointed.  Sign me A TRUE BELIEVER.
