These berries are thought to be one of the one of the healthiest natural foods. There are many "stories" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats.<br /><br />2) Decent fiber content (about 10%)<br /><br />3) 18 (!!) amino acids<br /><br />4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat.<br /><br />5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts)<br /><br />6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals.<br /><br />Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this:<br /><br />Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes.<br /><br />This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.<br /><br />Of note:<br /><br />- If you let them soak for too long (more than about 5-10 minutes) they get mushy and lose their texture and flavor.<br /><br />- If you do not soak them long enough, they can feel a little bit gritty. I think this is due to the seeds. I don't mind it myself, but some might.<br /><br />I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost.<br /><br />If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk.<br /><br />The reviewer that reported these are "gross" may have received something from a bad batch. I think they have a nice cranberry/raisin-ish flavor and have almost no noticeable odor (and the odor isn't an unpleasant one to me).
