I love this tea.  Ahmad tea is just a perfect cup of tea.  English Tea No. 1 is my tea of choice.  It's perfectly balanced and never bitter, no matter how long it's brewed.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you want to purchase English Tea No. 1 in it's loose form, you have to buy "English Afternoon Tea" loose.  Please note, however, that in teabag form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are two distinct blends.  But in loose form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are on in the same. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what a representative from Ahmad Tea told me when I emailed them to ask where I can buy English Tea No. 1 in loose form.<br /><br />I purchased loose English Afteroon Tea (aka Eng. Tea No. 1) from another online purveyor, and the loose version of the tea is just as delicious (maybe even more so) than the bagged version.  the loose tea is whole leaf tea, which is hard to find in a black tea.  usually, loose black tea is very finely shredded, not altogether different from its bagged form.  but the loose Ahmad black tea is whole leaf, which just goes to show how high the quality is at Ahmad tea.<br /><br />all in all, a terrific tea, and highly recommended.
