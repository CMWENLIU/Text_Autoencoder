I work in a specialty pet store that carries a wide range of high quality products for both cats and dogs. I spend a lot of my time looking at ingredients and researching brands so that I can pass my knowledge onto my customers. Natures Variety Instinct is the best quality food on the market, even when compared to other great foods like Orijen, Wellness Core, or Health Extension. Keep in mind that these other foods (with the exception of Science Diet, Iams, and other big store brands) are also very healthy for your pet and are loaded with high quality ingredients. I personally feed my cats Health Extension because it's the best food you can get for the price. However, if you want the absolute best, this is it.<br /><br />A look at the first four ingredients will tell you why. They're all "meals", which is essentially meat that has been ground up and dehydrated to around 10 percent moisture as opposed to 75 percent. Some fats are also removed because meat this compressed would have too high a fat percentage otherwise. Though "meals" do often contain other part of the animal humans wouldn't consider "meat", it doesn't matter to cats or dogs and is actually more nutritious. This food also contains rabbit organs, a few fruits and vegetables, and two different kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />As for taste, I just opened a sample bag and gave some dry food to my cats. They're currently on my table clawing at the bag to get to what's left of it. They absolutely love the food.
