Love fig newtons!  These are really fresh individually sealed, unlike their 1lb counterpart packages that have a tendency to get stale rather quickly.  These are worth the extra cost for that reason alone.  But, they're grab and go snacks too that are somewhat healthy for you than a regular cookie.  They also make great treats for after ballgames and other sports.  We love these in our house, highly recommend!
