I love Duke's mayonnaise. Recently, it has become available everywhere in Houston, but it wasn't that way a year ago. I used to order from them directly by the case, and I was delighted to find out a few months ago that amazon now carries it at a a very competitive price. Unlike one of the other reviewers, the expiry on the mayo isn't for almost two years, so I am confident I will be able to finish the four containers well within that time frame.<br /><br />Taste. I think people tend to like the mayo that they ate as a kid. I certainly didn't have Duke's as a kid (miracle whip!), but the taste to me is second to none. It has a rich flavor with a tangy kick to it. My mayo of choice before was Hellman's, but this kicks it out of the park.<br /><br />Texture. This is thicker and richer than any other mayo I've ever had. The closest in thickness was Hellman's.<br /><br />Check out Hellman's ingredient list: Soybean Oil, Water, Whole Eggs and Egg Yolks, Vinegar, Salt, Sugar, Lemon Juice, Natural Flavors, Calcium Disodium Edta (Used to Protect Quality).<br /><br />Duke's Ingredient List: Soybean oil, eggs, water, distilled and cider vinegar, salt, oleoresin paprika, natural flavors, calcium disodium EDTA added to protect flavor. Contains: Eggs<br /><br />Water comes later in the ingredient list of Duke's, and is completely evident in the mayo.<br /><br />I am happy that Duke's is now available locally, but Amazon is my go-to when I want to stock up.
