This is the most amazing peanut butter cookie I have eaten in awhile...and it's good for you!  Unless you eat the whole bag, which I did in one day. They are small, so you can eat them by the handful.  Also, for some reason, there seem to be a lot of pieces at the bottom, which makes me sad.  But, you can save them and use them for toppings for yogurt, ice cream, fruit.  Better for you than hot fudge (although that would make it taste even more awesome)!<br /><br />And I like to think that they are really good for you too...especially since they are all natural.<br /><br />I really like all the PB2 products that I've tried so far.  Another win!
