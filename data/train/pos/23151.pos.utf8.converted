yoga tea's women's moon cycle is a godsend.  i have suffered from pms since i was a teenager (for me it is manifests as irritability, sensitiveness and exhaustion). i start using this tea at the first sign of pms symptoms, usually a day or two before my period, and then continue to use for the first two days, when my cramps cause pain.<br />this tea smells and tastes wonderful - reminds me of baking something with cinnamon and nutmeg.<br />i try to squeeze a few cups out of each bag. if you are using this for cramps, go ahead and drink it throughout the day. it really does help!! better than advil!<br />if you are considering trying this tea, don't hesitate. really. it is wonderful.
