This is probably one of the best brand of sweetener available right now.  There are many sweeteners at supermarkets & grocery stores: like Equal, Splenda, Truvia, Purevia, etc...  But Ideal is my favorite for two reasons: Taste & Consistency.<br /><br />Taste: It's the closest thing you will get to sugar without being sugar.  In "my opinion", it ALMOST leaves none of the aftertaste that you come to expect from sweeteners like Sweet-N-Low (saccharin), Nutrasweet (aspartame), or to an extent Splenda (sucralose). Truvia & Purevia do taste like sugar initially, but I find they have a bitter aftertaste.  Ideal (xylitol) has a slight hint of non-sugar initially, that eventually subside and disappear.<br /><br />Consistency: It looks like sugar!! It is not powdery or too off-white or too dark. It's crystally like sugar. Actually, you could mistake it with real sugar by just the look of it.  The only thing that gives it away is the feel of it on your spoon or your hand.  It feels lighter than real sugar, almost fluffy (light 'n airy).<br /><br />One of the best thing about Ideal is it dissolves equally well in hot AND cold beverages, unlike real sugar.  I have not tried it for baking or sweet recipes, but have added to savory dishes and it is a worthy substitute.<br /><br />The only problem that I have with Ideal is you can't find it at many grocery stores or supermarket.  You need to order it on Amazon or look on their website where they get distributed.<br /><br />Overall, A++
