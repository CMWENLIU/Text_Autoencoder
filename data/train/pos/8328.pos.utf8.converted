These are very fresh  well flavored bite sized cubes of candied ginger.  These are beautifully processed  good ginger flavor with a nice bite but not too spicy. Pieces are a bit bigger than most packaged candied ginger and quite  suitable for eating out of hand. They  need to be chopped up a bit if you want to add them to  cookie  dough etc or add to jam. I've shared these with a friend who had  morning sickness and used them on a boat trip in rough seas to avert mal de mer and for mild stomach distress  they are a very useful folk remedy though of course they are mainly intended as a candy and condiment I will probably include some in a sauce/chutney  to serve with duckling
