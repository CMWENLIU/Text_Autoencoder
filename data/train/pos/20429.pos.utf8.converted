After trying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NSH6O8">Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate with Sea Salted Almonds</a> (yum!) I had to try another of their flavors, and chose the Nibby. I had no idea really what that might taste like, but it sounded interesting.<br />It is. And it's also yummy.<br /><br />These bars are not as soft as the almond, so it's a little harder to break apart. The nibs are chewy, and not as sweet as the chocolate of course so it's a nice contrast. It's a little odd when you chew that last bit of nib and it almost feels like eating sand -- doesn't bother me, but texture-people might have a problem with that.<br /><br />Each (3oz) bar is 41% cocoa, gluton-free. Service size is half a bar (hehe, right, I try), and it lists calories at 220 and total carb at 20g (per serving). Ingredients include milk, cacao beans nibs and butter, 2% or less of non-gmo soy lecithin, and whole vanilla beans.<br /><br />I enjoy the soft saltiness of the almond bars better, though I like the Nibby. My sister thinks the almond ones aren't sweet enough, but she likes the nib bars.<br /><br />The Scharffen Berger bars are nicely wrapped. The wrapping of mine was yellow, the current picture on this product is for the Dark Chocolate. See this product listing: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DIXODK">Scharffen Berger Chocolate Bar Milk Nibby, 3-ounces, 41% Cacao (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />For something a bit different, and a delicious experience, I recommend the Chocolate Nibby.
