This is the best gluten free pizza crust mix I've tried yet, and I've tried a few others.  My husband eats gluten free because I must, so he is always very vocal on letting me know if a gluten free product is thumbs up or thumbs down--and he really likes this one.  Not at all gritty, no funny tastes (which is his complaint on some of the gluten free breads).  We make one cookie sheet size pizza from one package of this mix.  I've never been a big fan of commercial pizza, but homemade with this mix and my favorite toppings is such a treat!
