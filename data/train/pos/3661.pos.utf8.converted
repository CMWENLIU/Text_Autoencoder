I've tried many mosquito repellents over the years.  Mosquitos really like my fresh skin.  All sorts of products over the years failed, and in fact, many times I believed the repellents were actually BRINGING the nasty bugs in my direction.  Not so with any kind of Cutter mosquito repellent.  Not only does it take the itch away immediately, and not only do mosquitos avoid you the second you apply some on your skin, but the next day you might wake up to find that the bites you had from the night before have been completely healed.  No kidding.  Great, great product.  Highly recommended.
