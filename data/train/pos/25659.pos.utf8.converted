Black Licorice Scottie Dogs are GREAT!  I grew up thinking that licorice was "awful" and "disgusting" until the day I tried the wonderful black licorice Scottie Dogs.  I could not believe that I liked licorice; I mean I REALLY LIKE IT.  I went to the candy store and bought a little of every kind of licorice available.  When I would travel, I would do the same thing.  I tried anise product to compare the difference in flavor.  I found that most licorice has molasses which is absolutely NOT for me.  I continue to judge some licorice as "awful" and "disgusting"; I always came back to these wonderful black dogs.  There is something really refreshing, like spearmint is to me, about these licorice dogs.  I say, "Don't give up on licorice until you have tried these black dogs."
