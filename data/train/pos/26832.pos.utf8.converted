The tree came in great condition, healthy and alive.  To add on some of the other comments:<p>-Of course it doesn't come looking like a mature, trained bonsai tree.  It's a 39 dollar tree!!  It won't be trained for that cost!!!!! A fully trained tree takes years and much care to create the illusion of an old, natural tree.  I recommend getting a book and reading up a little before buying.  For the price, this tree is a bargain!!<p>-As far as I can tell, the styrofoam peanuts are the only way to really protect the tree in transit.  Yes, they're a pain to unpack (took 10 minutes) but it's worth protecting the tree.  However, if you noticed, they use corn-starch based foam and they dissolve in water.  They're not environmentally unfriendly.  They're not petro-carbon based polymer.  They're perfectly safe and if you don't want to throw them away, pour them in a bucket of water and pour the water on your lawn.  It may even have some fertilizing properties.
