This is called Cincinnati Chili because it originated there but is a fine minced ground beef with spices that are different than normal Texas chili; this chili is flavored with cinnamon, cumin, cloves and chocolate.  It's different but a cult favorite in the midwest.  The traditional method of serving is called a 3-way where you pour the chili over cooked spaghetti and cover in finely shredded cheddar cheese.  There is also a 4-way which includes either adding light red kidney beans or chopped white onions.  The 5-way is adding both beans and onions.  Often hot sauce is used along with oyster crackers.  The other favorite is a cheese coney where you take a traditional hot dog and then pour the chili over top adding the shredded cheddar cheese with mustard and/or onions.  You can make this chili from scratch getting a recipe from allrecipes or you can use the dry packet mix <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B6O4LO">6 Pack Cincinnati Chili</a> but either way is not the same.  You just can't get the ground beef minced enough to resemble the true stuff.<br />This is also a great gift to send to any troop overseas who is from the midwest.  They would instantly know and love your package.  Facebook even has pages committed to this chili.  It's a cult favorite and you will either love it or hate it.
