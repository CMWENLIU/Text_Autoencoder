I have bought their Lemon and Apricot flavors. They are so good, I cannot imagine the other flavors could be better, but I may have to try them one day. My son has a sugar intolerence, so we've used Sweet Leaf Stevia for years. We added 5 or 6 drops of the apricot to a large glass of water, and he asks for "apricot water" instead of soda pop. Sent some to relatives and they love it too...<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL SWEET LEAF PRODUCTS
