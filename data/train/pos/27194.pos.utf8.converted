We are a 2 person household with one diabetic and one low-carber.  We love this pasta and eat it at least once per week.  We haven't noticed any appreciable rise in blood glucose level, or any negative effects on low-carb dieting while using this product.  Of course we limit the portion and eat it with plenty of protein and vegetables, which probably helps prevent glucose/insulin spikes.  I think we have had success because the proportion of pasta to protein and vegetables is low.  But essentially this pasta is delicious and we highly recommend it.
