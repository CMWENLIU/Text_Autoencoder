This is the best drink for people who really like grapefruit juice but cannot have it because it interfers with their medication. Since it contains no real juice, but has calcium and no sugar it is a great drink for those with diabetes too. We drink it every morning and it is really refreshing any time during the day. I highly recommend it to everyone.
