This European licorice product is excellent especially as it is "sugar free."  However, one must remember that this is not like the cheap licorice products one may find in their supermarket and that it may contain elements unfamiliar to the average American palate. But, in any event I am thankful that I can purchase this product in quantity without having to travel a distance to a specialty food store for it and at competitive pricing.<br /><br />Gustaf's makes other licorice products, e.g. "Double Salted" which is also an acquired taste as the ammoniate in it is more discernible both taste and in odor for some.<br /><br />I saw one review that complained that the product gave them gastric distress.  Well, licorice is a cathartic and if you get carried away in consuming it, you will have that problem.  As for me, I will probably continue to enjoy Gustaf's products.
