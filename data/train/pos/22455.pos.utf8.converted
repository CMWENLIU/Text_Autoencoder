I absolutely love these sesame seeds. I wanted a healthier option for a seasoning and have found that by  roasting these seeds. First I very lightly butter a pan, than add 2 drops of liquid smoke, wipe pan with this combo than roast seeds over medium heat until very lightly brown. Cool on a paper towel and then I put them in a old spice container. When sprinkled on buttered toast, wasa , crackers etc  makes a very good snack.  I freeze the unopened bags and store the open bag in the fridge.
