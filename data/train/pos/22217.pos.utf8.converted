My sixteen year old border collie loves this food.  She's was used to dry dog food so I started out mixing this with the dry which she eats heartily, but she really woofs it up when I give it to her plain. Usually I give it to her mixed with the dry food.  It is definitely doggie friendly as well as nutritionally excelent.
