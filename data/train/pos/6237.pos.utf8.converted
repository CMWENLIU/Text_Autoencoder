I know, some of you may be thinking, GROSS! Fish shavings?? But if you like fish, and the flavors of Japanese food, then you'll love these Bonito Flakes. This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving.<br /><br />Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too.<br /><br />Bonito flakes, called "hanakatsuo" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice. I guess if you purchase some and don't agree with my review, you can follow the lead of one of the other reviewers and feed it to your cats...
