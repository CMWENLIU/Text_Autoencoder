Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, in addition to a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.
