Recently my 3 year old was diagnosed with Autism. We have since put him on a gluten-free diet and it is like a miracle!  The one huge drawback was he really missed breads and cakes and cookies.  This product has been a prayer answered for our family.  I just made my first loaf of gluten-free bread following the recipe on the package exactly.  The bread came out soft fluffy and no-one could even tell it was gluten-free.  This will now be a permanent fixture in our home. As if we weren't already thrilled, the cost is very reasonable for a gluten-free product.  I wish I could give this product 10 stars I am so happy with it!!!
