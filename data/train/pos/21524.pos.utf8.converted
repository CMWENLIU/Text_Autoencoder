I think Blue Energy tastes great and is a natural alternative to Red Bull. I've tried other alternatives and this is simply the best. It has a great kick (1000 mg of Taurine as well as caffeine and ginseng) and find the 8.3 oz. can to be just the right size and is easily transportable. It also tastes less artificial (some energy drinks taste like fizzy cough syrup). This has a clean taste and I don't feel gross chugging it down.<br /><br />I've been drinking this for over a year and a half now. It cured my jet lag on a trip to NYC in 2005. I'm glad I found it here on Amazon because even though it's stocked at Whole Foods, I usually end up grabbing the few remaining cans on the shelf.
