This is my favorite cherry juice. First, I chose it because it's made with cherries picked locally to my home. Next, I discovered there are alleged anti-inflammatory benefits. (Personally, I have experienced this; however, I'm not a doctor and can't say it would work for others). Lastly, I tried others and why I keep coming back to Cheribundi Tru Cherry is two-fold: this brand is made entirely of cherries/not from concentrate AND tastes FANTASTIC. Other brands cannot come close.
