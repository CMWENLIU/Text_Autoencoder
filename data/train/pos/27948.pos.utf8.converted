I used to live in Taipei, Taiwan. From my time there, I think I can tell you what good tea is, and it sure is hard to find back here. All too often beverage companies kill their bottled teas by adding way too much sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Honest Tea's Honey Green Tea has just the perfect amount of sweetness. I realize the most authentic way of drinking tea is to drink it fresh-brewed (preferably loose-leaf) with nothing added, but alas, I can't drink my tea that way. I wish I did though. For those of us who gotta have our tea with a pinch of sugar, this is the closest to the stuff I enjoyed back in Taiwan, and boy do they have some excellent tea there.
