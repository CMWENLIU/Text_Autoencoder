First...I am not a doctor, so take my review with a grain of salt.  However I read in several posts on the internet that pumpkin seeds could help shrink the prostrate gland in men over 40.  I noticed in recent years, I'm 42 now, that when I needed to empty my bladder it took longer before urine would start flowing and it took longer to empty my bladder.  I've been eating a handful of pumpkin seeds everyday for 6 weeks and I have noticed an improvement where the urine starts faster and flows faster like it did when I was younger.  Plus these seeds taste great and make a nice snack.  It took about 3 to 4 weeks before I noticed a difference in urine flow.
