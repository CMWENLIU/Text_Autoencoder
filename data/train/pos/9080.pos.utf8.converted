My pup (3 year old maltese) has a serious allergy to grain and a generally screwed up digestive system. The first year of his life was sort of trial and error when it comes to the right kind of dog food for him and a lot of long nights with upset stomachs. Eukanuba (which can barely be called dog 'food') nearly killed him and he ended up having to get fluids injected because of how dehydrated he got on it.  Hundreds of dollars to the vet later, we did research on dog food and the common grain allergy. We have tried all of the good grain-free brands, like Evo, Wellness, Merrick, etc. Orijen has been the best of the bunch.<br /><br />If you are worried about your dog having too much protein, I haven't really had a problem at all despite my little dog. He has been on Orijen for over two years and he is pretty much all lean muscle (all 13lbs of him!), despite being mostly sedentary outside of daily walks. He has clear, tear-stain free eyes, a shiny coat, and has never been sick since starting on this food. I can't help but think his excellent quality food has been keeping him healthy!<br /><br />Orijen is expensive, but worth it!
