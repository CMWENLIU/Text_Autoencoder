No, this isn't the healthiest green tea ever, but it does taste exactly like Starbucks Green Tea lattes.  I love it.  Buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032Z7UJE">Copco 2510-9963 Acadia Reusable To-Go Mug, 16-Ounce Capacity</a> and make your own at home before work or school for a fraction of the cost.  The only real issue is there is no scoop so it's trial and error as to how much to put in.  I've made it hot, cold and blended (all with water) and it's delicious.  I'm going to buy this again when I run out and try the other flavors.
