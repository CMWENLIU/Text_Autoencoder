I was invited to friends house for breakfast one weekend and she prepared belgian waffles with this mix and I couldn't believe how good they were...I've always loved belgian waffle in the waffle houses, but didn't think I'd ever find any mix to compare. I got home and immediately ordered the same waffle maker she had and this mix...My family LOVES it when I make them. I know some of you may think I'm a big dummy,but the mix calls for 5/8 of a cup of liquid and it took forever for me to figure out that 5/8 of a cup is 5oz..
