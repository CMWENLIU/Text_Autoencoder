Over the years I've bought and disposed of lots of coffee substitutes that were supposed to taste "just like coffee", but didn't. So, I was prepared to add this one to the compost too! I like my coffee strong, aromatic, and with an edge of bitterness. Could a drink made from roasted barley, rye, chicory and beet roots give me that? Well, as a natural-born skeptic, and generally immune to hype of any kind, I have to say that Cafix has become my afternoon and evening beverage of choice. Does Cafix taste "just like coffee"? No, because it isn't. But its aroma and flavor are as good as and better than some real coffee I've known. And what's more, it lets me sleep at night without the eight hour half-life of caffeine buzzing around in my being!
