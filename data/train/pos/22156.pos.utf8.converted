I've been buying this brand of brownies for 2 years and I've received nothing but compliments when I take them for pitch-in dinners with friends or at the office.<br /><br />But you know what?  I don't make these according to the directions on the box - when my brother was deciding whether or not to have weight loss surgery, I was looking for recipes for him on some local hospital web sites.<br /><br />I came across this recipe for diet brownies - it didn't specify the Betty Crocker brand, but it did say look for a low-fat brownie mix - and this is the only one I can find other than No Pudge at the grocery store...incidentally, these are better than the No Pudge Brownies.<br /><br />Try making these this way instead of according to the package.<br /><br />1 package of Betty Crocker Low Fat Fudge Brownie Mix<br />1 - 15 to 16 oz. can of black beans (I've also used great northern beans & they turn out just as good)<br />1 tablespoon water<br /><br />Puree the beans (with their juice) in a blender or food processor.  Puree them thoroughly, so they don't look like beans!<br />Combine all ingredients, stir and bake according to the directions on the box.<br /><br />These are healthier as they are full of fiber from the beans.  Don't tell anyone the brownies have beans in them or you won't get people to try them...but you will certainly get the compliments from these moist, tasty brownies.
