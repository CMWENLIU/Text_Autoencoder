This is a fizzy, refreshing fruit soda with natural sweetening limited to whatever the 70% juice content can provide. So this is a slightly sweet-sour soda with no cloying taste and it tastes exactly like what it is--pomegranate juice. This is more in the tradition of the European "lemonades"--fizzy water and fruit juice with little or no sugar.<br /><br />The can is the size of one of those energy drinks. (8oz.) If you like a fizzy drink now and then, I can't think of anything better. I don't drink soda, diet or regular (no point to either.) Izze, however, is quite nice. Try it.
