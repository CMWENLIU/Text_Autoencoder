This is a real gourmet product. You can add them to melon cut in dices and it makes an excellent entr&eacute;e. You can add to ice cream as well,and unless you are anti alcohol, no one will be dissapointed, but probably most surprised, it's delicious.<br />We discovered this in a fancy gourmet store in the heart of France, and are very pleased that it is also available in the US and Canada.
