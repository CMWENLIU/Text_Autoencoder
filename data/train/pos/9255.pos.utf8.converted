The price was good when I bought the honey from Amazon, and was even better because I chose to take advantage of Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer. (I've used it in the past and never had a problem canceling or changing a scheduled order, and therefore I never received an order I didn't need or want. Amazon sends an email before shipping an item you've subscribed to, giving you a chance to cancel or postpone it.)<br /><br />It's hard for me to find raw, unfiltered honey that is 100% a product of the US in local markets at anything close to what I'd consider a reasonable price (and that's if and when they have such honey in stock at all). I've tried a different brand of raw, unfiltered, produced in the US honey from Amazon, and while I like it and may buy it again in the future (e.g., for the sake of variety), I like the Ambrosia Honey better. I operated natural food stores in CA in the late 70's and early 80's, and the smell and taste of Ambrosia Honey reminds me of some of the good, pure honey we sold in bulk back then.<br /><br />The shipment of a 4-pack of 23 ounce plastic bottles (as pictured) arrived without any leaks or stickiness on the bottles at all, and I appreciate that each bottle has a pour-type cap (you just have to snip or cut the top of the spout off to the diameter you want), as opposed to honey containers that you have to use a spoon or honey dipper with. There are nice, simple instructions on the label about how to reliquify the Ambrosia Honey if and when necessary.<br /><br />I think anyone who appreciates really good quality pure, unfiltered honey will like this honey.
