I just logged on to place my Maca order for 3rd time; this time will order two bags.  Maca is a remarkable product.  If you check you will find this is a great price for organic raw Maca.  I have not tried other Maca products but frankly feel no urge to do so as I am quite pleased.  Lot's of the negativer reviews compain about the taste.  I actually like the taste (in smoothies and mixed into my hot quinoa cereal -- I must have some affinity for Andean food).  But my wife finds the taste positvely revolting.  So it seems to be a personal matter.  I think it tastes like roasted malt with a nutty flavor that is very earthy.  The impact on my health -- some increased stamina, altertness, and a very positive feeling of overall physical wellbeing -- has been quite remarkable.  Having tried many herbs, supplements and healthy foods over the years this is quite unlike anything else I have tried.  It may be that my body resonates particularly well with it.  Obviously others don't have the same experience.  But it may be worth a trial.
