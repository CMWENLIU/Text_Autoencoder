I have used this product in the past with great results. Just be sure you mix it into the dry ingredients and not the water.  I don't usually have it in the frig and it's nice to be able to make something calling for buttermilk without having to go to the store.  I haven't had a problem in the past with it getting hard.  I highly recommend it.
