I must say I cannot agree with the other reviewer in that I thought the grape flavor tasted great, kinda like a slightly bitter, yet refreshing grape kool-aid. Everyone is different though and/or perhaps he got a bad batch, not sure, but I liked it....also I thought FAST TWITCH(GO GRAPE) had better taste, texture and performance than NO-XPLODE!!!! So forget  the coffee and dump the pills, this stuff works WAY better than any pre-workout stimulant I have ever tried.
