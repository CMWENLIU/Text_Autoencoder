I had been dieting and missing so much the great flavor I was used to with flavored creamers for my coffee. I am one of those people who like a little coffee with a whole lot of other stuff. I had tried several flavors of stevia but the flavor vanilla creme did it for me. I had been making hazlenut coffe and adding vanilla but could not get that cream flavor untill this product. If I close my eyes I can imagine it is my old coffe with lots of cream flavor!!!! Thanks for product.
