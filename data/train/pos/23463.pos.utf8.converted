I have used this tea for years to help promote overall good health.  I combine it with their Green Tea (1bag of each to 2 cups hot water).  I don't use sugar with this combo but you might.  I don't like the green tea taste alone but the Cranberry Tea makes the green tea much tastier plus, I feel, a better aide to my immune system. When my immune system is feeling low, this combo revives it quickly (although it may take a little longer to notice the effects when first starting to use it).  I use it 2 - 3 times daily, initially, then once a day.  I have tried this companies' Weightless Cranberry, which, I feel, is not as good as this product for my purposes.  This Traditional Medicinals Organic Cran-Aid cranberry tea is promoted for urinary infections.  Before I started combining it with green tea (which I did not discover until several years later), I used it for urinary tract infections and it cleared it up quickly.  For urinary tract infections, I used to consume lots and lots of Cranberry Juice with little or no help.  The help I received from this tea was a blessing!  I am very anti-biotic resistant.  I do not take antibiotics anymore for urinary infections.  I am not a tea drinker and it was difficult for me, at first, to discipline myself to drink teas.  I am very grateful for this tea.<br /><br />I have used different tea products from Traditional Medicinals and, overall, have been very satisfied with their products.<br /><br />Until I developed issues with anti-biotic resistance, I was not into the "natural health movement."  Over the years, since then, I have tried many different health aides.  Some of the naturals do not work at all.  When you find the ones that do work, you stick with them.  This is one company and their teas that I have used since the late 1970's.  I am so glad to have found this on Amazon so that I do not have to drive for miles to get these teas any longer.
