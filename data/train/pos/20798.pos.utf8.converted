Crazy Richard's is a tremendous peanunt butter for those peanut butter lovers who enjoy a great peanut butter without salt and without hydrogenated oil added.  Initially mixing in the peanit oil which settles at the top of the jar is required.<br /><br />If the peanut butter is very fresh, mixing in the oil is easily accomplished, but as the peanut butter ages, the peanut solids become more firm, as more peanut oil separates from the peanut solids.  Regardless of the effort required to mix the peanut oil into this great peanut butter, it is worth it!!
