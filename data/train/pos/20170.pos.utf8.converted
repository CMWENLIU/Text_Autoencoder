Wonderful value - less than half the price of the McCormick "Gourmet Collection" I had been using and tastes just as delicious.  Has a kick to it that reminds me of Hot Tamales candy...sweet but spicy and completely different than 'traditional' cinnamon.  I can't even enjoy regular cinnamon any longer.  I use this on my daily apples and in oatmeal to help with fat burning (a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!) and it is a simply delightful way of 'dieting'!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
