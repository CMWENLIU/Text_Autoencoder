Really no difference in the flavor than regular pancake mix. My children ate it with no problems and said it tasted the same as regular. Great for my daughter that's allergic to wheat!  Give it a try.  I paid $6.89 for just one at the local health food store. This is a much better deal!<br /><br />I wanted to add that I posted this description under Pamela's Pancake mix. I have also used the Chocolate cake mix and the bread mix. Since this is posted under all 3 for some reason I will comment on those too. The Bread mix is very good. It does take a little tweaking, maybe it's my bread machine. It is very good, everyone in the family likes it. We have made pizza crust out of it for my little girl and she loves it. We have made the cookies from the pancake mix and she loves them, we add cinnamon and sugar to them before baking. The Chocolate Cake mix is very good, it is more of a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate. We make cupcakes out of them and freeze them. Nice and fluffy. She loves them too. All in all I would say that if you can't have wheat, Pamela's products are the best choice for flavor and texture. Don't buy that already made bread. It was awful, sorry I don't remember the brand but Amazon sells it.
