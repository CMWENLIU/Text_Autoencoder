There is chicory and then there is Community Coffee Chicory.  I started using chicory with another company's mixed coffee and chicory product available in the Seattle area and learned to love the special flavor it gives to enhance my coffee.  When a friend went to visit her family who had just moved to Mississippi, she was nice enough to return with various bags of chicory so we could taste test all the ones the local grocery store had.  The winner was Community Coffee's chicory.  I have tried their coffee/chicory mix, and it's good too, but I like flavored ground coffee and playing with really dark roasts and medium roasts that are available up here, so buying just chicory works the best for me.  I've been buying Community Coffee for about 8-10 years and was pleasantly surprised to see it sold on Amazon.<br /><br />If you haven't tried chicory, take the chance and brew some up!  It's full of anti-oxidants, and has been known to help lower blood sugar with type 2 diabetes and help the liver work better.  Even tea drinkers can like chicory.  I also like that I don't need to put as much in the brew filter; it simply doesn't take as many grounds to brew.  If you've had chicory and found it to be bitter or have heard the 'bitter coffee' stories about it, keep that in mind.  If I am only brewing it without the coffee, I only put in 2 1/2 or 3 scoops instead of 4.<br /><br />Community Coffe Chicory and Amazon.com.  A prefect combination!  Try it today!<br /><br />(This is not paid for by Community Coffee or Amazon.  I really like them both!)
