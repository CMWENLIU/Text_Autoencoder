From 1995 to 1998 I lived and worked in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was here where I first encountered Nido -- actually it was a cross-cultural exchange as a result of my getting lost in the desert.<br /><br />I had been camping in the desert with a group of westerners, in an organization known as the Megamob Hash House Harriers, essentially a group of walkers, runners and overnight campers...I could say more but the Ministry of the Interior would investigate.<br /><br />I attempted to drive back home in the morning but found I was going around in circles. I didn't want to do that all day, or I'd run out of fuel and eventually water...so I approached a Bedouin encampment. It was exactly as you'd expect, a few goats wandering around, perhaps three or four camels, and a Toyota Hilux pickup truck...also a veiled Bedouin woman, and a few kid of various ages.<br /><br />I approached cautiously -- noticed that there was fairly large family -- but eventually I was able to engage in a conversation with the father, probably the grandfather, of this tribe. He carried on in Arabic while I replied in English -- one or two word phrases and lots of gesturing; eventually after five minutes eureka, I said the magic word: 'asphalt'. This seemed to register, he pointed with a stick at the ground, indicating to follow the tire tracks to the city.<br /><br />While at the Bedouin camp I enjoyed some warm Nido. It was very good. I was surprised that they drank Nido when they also had fresh steaming camel milk available.<br /><br />Luckily I made it out of the desert and I lived to tell the tale.
