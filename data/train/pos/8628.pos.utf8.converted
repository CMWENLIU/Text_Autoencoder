If you like lime\lime flavor, you will love this product.  Our local stores quit selling this product so I was very relieved that I could find it on Amazon and ordered a case as we use it so much.  It is very versitile.  We use it just in water, in our smoothies, and in cooking.  It's a wonderful portable product that you don't have to worry about spoiling anytime soon like you do with fresh fruit.
