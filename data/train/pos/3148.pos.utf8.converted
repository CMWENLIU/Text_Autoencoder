and I used to.  Growing up in western NY I picked tree ripened sour cherries, pitted and canned them, knowing no canned cherries on the market could compare to the home canned ones.  After moving to southern California and finding that sour cherries won't grow here it took me several years to discover Oregon brand cherries, but in the 32 years since then I won't make a cherry pie with any other kind.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying them.  So few people cook anymore, it seems, they're getting hard to find.
