Pros:<br />Great mocha taste that doesn't overpower other flavors.<br />Lots of dark chocolate chips to satisfy chocolate cravings.<br />One bar is very filling and satisfying.<br />Lots of protein and fiber.<br />Made with whole grains.<br />Contains no high fructose corn syrup, or artificial ingredients.<br />Very little sugar.<br />Contains whole or nearly whole almonds versus little pieces.<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive than some other granola bars, but very much worth it.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'd recommend these bars to anyone who enjoys the flavor of mocha.  I love these, they taste oh so good.
