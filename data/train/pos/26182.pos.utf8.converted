These kippers have a wonderful flavor and texture.  They are smokey with just enough salt.  I wish the cans were bigger.  You open the can and the fillets are solid and firm, which is surprising for not being in oil.  I think they taste a touch better than the John West brand without the oil.  If I had both in front of me I would have a problem picking between the two.  If you like smoked kippers this is the brand I would suggest.  I was a lifelong King Oscar fan until I tried these.
