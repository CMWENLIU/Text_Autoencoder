Whole vanilla beans come in three "flavors":  Mexican, Tahitian, and Bourbon-Madagascar.  Because Mexican beans are reputed to have the boldest, best vanilla flavor, I had to try some in my favorite "speckled vanilla" ice cream recipe.  Usually I make this recipe with the more common Bourbon-Madagascar beans.<br /><br />The Mexican  beans did not disappoint:  they produced an especially delicious, full-flavored vanilla ice cream.  In the future, Mexican vanilla beans will always be my first choice for making plain vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />The Mexican vanilla beans that I purchased from Arizona Vanilla were plump, moist, and beautiful.  Although they were a little more expensive than Bourbon-Madagascar beans, they were still far less expensive than the whole vanilla beans sold in spice jars in grocery stores.  The Mexican beans were a little shorter and smaller than the Bourbon-Madagascar beans that I purchased from a different seller, but this is probably a characteristic of the different plant types.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great book of ice cream recipes, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060187654">The Best Ice Cream Maker Cookbook Ever</a>, which includes the "speckled vanilla" recipe.  (The "speckles" are the tiny vanilla seeds that you scrape out of the whole vanilla bean pods.)
