Having only recently purchased our Keurig brewer, my wife and I have been experimenting/taste-testing with various flavor/vendor offerings. I prefer the flavored variety while my wife prefers the fuller bodied blends. The Timothy's World Coffee, Mocha Java, was a pleasant surprise for both of us. It had the special flavor that I enjoy and the full bodied flavor my wife enjoys. The Mocha flavor was sufficient enough to not have to enquire what flavor was just made for me. It also was not so over powering that a second cup would become sickening. Nice balance! Great price point by Amazon. Should have taken full advantage and purchased 4 double packs for the ultimate savings! We can now add Timothy's to our vendors of choice.<br /><br />Robert
