It is a slim packet with mostly tuna meat and not much water.  Make sure you bring a small spoon to get every bits out.  It was a little hard to use my fingers to eat.<br /><br />I bought it primarily for backpacking and hiking.  It is light weight, healthy, and fulfilling as a part of my lunch.  The calorie count is good (80 per packet) and the taste is not bad when the body screams for fuel.  I can also see it being added into rehydrated TVP, rehydrated instant refried beans, and canned soup, etc..<br /><br />I also put a few packets in my cubicle in case i get hungry.  it's a super healthy snack (if u prefer savory snack).<br /><br />Overall I am very happy to have it in my pantry so that I can grab it whenever i need one or two.
