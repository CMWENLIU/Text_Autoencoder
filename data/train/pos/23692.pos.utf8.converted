I was really skeptical at first. A lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size. After the first day, my breasts started to feel heavier, fuller, and more firm. I started at an A-cup and even with inconsistent use (maybe 2 capsules a day or less), I was reaching toward a C-cup at the end of a couple months or so. I would highly recommend this product, cause it also helps with constipation too. I stopped taking it orally because I noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts. So at the moment I'm gonna try making a rub out of it so I can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage.
