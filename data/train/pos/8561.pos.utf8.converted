Made by the American Licorice Company, this is quite simply the best licorice there is. Red Vines have a very distinctive taste and the texture is soft and chewy. This 4-pound tub is very economical and helps keep the licorice fresh, too. My kids and I absolutely LOVE this licorice! Red Vines rule!!
