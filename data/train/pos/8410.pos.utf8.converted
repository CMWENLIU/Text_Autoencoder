Not sure if it is just me or what but this stuff is very nasty tasting lol. I have not tried it in a smoothie yet but I have tried it in Water & in Yogurt. I am not giving up on it because I need the health benefits lol. But. Just wanted to warn you before hand that it is an acquired taste & do not expect it to taste yummy right off the bat lol.
