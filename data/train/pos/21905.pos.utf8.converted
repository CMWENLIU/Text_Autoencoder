Hazelnut Butter tastes amazing! This is my 2nd or 3rd time buying form this company, and while the butter is not cheap, it is worth the price becase it is so good and fresh. I can definitely tell the difference in taste. So far I tried hazelnut and pistachio butters, but hazelnut tastes better in my opinion. The butter is creamy but not as smooth as, lets say, store bought peanut butter (jeff), there are definitely crunchy pieces in there.<br />This company also ships fast, packs well and stands behind their products!
