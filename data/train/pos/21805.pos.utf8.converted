I'm a bit of a cooking snob and love the very labor-intensive but rewarding Choc. Chip cookie recipe from Cooks' Illustrated.  Seriously- it's dangerous (to your waistline).  What elevates that recipe above all others is the toffee base you make with browned butter.  If you have the time and patience, you'll be rewarded.<br /><br />So I was apprehensive when a co-worker was selling this Ghirardelli cookie as a school fund-raiser for her child at $4.50/box.  But I've enjoyed Ghirardelli's triple chocolate brownie mix (no scratch recipe comes close) and I owed this friend a favor.  With the exception of the browned butter toffee notes of the C.I. "scratch" recipe, these cookies (the large size batch) were nearly identical with a fraction of the labor.  I had to fight off the kids for a second cookie.<br /><br />I bought this mix on Amazon at $33/case with free Super Saver Shipping and now it's down to ~$27/case of 12.  Time to buy another case... then hit the gym.<br /><br />I'm thinking that for my next batch, I'll brown half the butter before mixing it in and see if I can pass them off as the "scratch" recipe.<br /><br />Like the Ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix, this cookie mix is impossible to find in stores.  Costco has the brownie mix.  If I want to really impress someone with those brownies, I put in a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and slather them with a rich ganache that has a pinch of cayenne.
