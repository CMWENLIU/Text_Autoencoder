I use this coconut oil for homemade toothpaste. It's a match made in heaven, given coconut oil's antibacterial and antimicrobial properties.<br /><br />Just 1/2 coconut oil, 1/2 baking soda and a generous amount of spearmint essential oil and you've got yourself some cheap, homemade toothpaste.<br /><br />I've been using it for a while. My teeth are whiter and less sensitive and my gums are healthier. (No glycerin in MY toothpaste!)
