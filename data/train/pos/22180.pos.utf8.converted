Firstly, google the health benefits of fungreek [they are numerous].<br /><br />Secondly, fenugreek is one of those spices that you cannot deal with like other spices. These little seeds are hard as rocks and unless you want to ruin your spice-grinder, I'd highly recommend you follow my procedure for using fenugreek:<br /><br />Well, to begin, fenugreek is actually a legume (so, if you are prone to gastro problems with beans and legumes then you might want to take a beano or equivalent supplement before ingesting fenugreek).<br /><br />If you want the benefits of raw fenugreek seeds. Put 1/4 cup of fenugreek seeds in a 2 cup or so capacity container and add 1/2 cup boiling water and let steep for an hour, place steeped fenugreek covered in fridge overnight and you will have some lovely, slightly chewy, less bitter fenugreek that you can add to soups and stews or eaten by the spoonful as a health supplement. One thing you will notice, is, when you add hot water to fenugreek, they will not only soften, but, they will sprout out little tail-buds which makes them sort of mid-sprout and highly digestible.<br /><br />If you want to fully sprout fenugreek, you can google for many techniques.<br /><br />If you only want to sprout this fenugreek, I'd say this is highly sproutable since even adding boiling water to the seeds did not stop them from sprouting little sprout ends.<br /><br />Warning: If you 'toast' fenugreek it will stink up your house to high hell and it takes days and days to get the odor out of your house and if you are planning on selling your home, you do NOT want to toast fenugreek!<br /><br />Anyway, my husband hates fenugreek and I love it with a passion. I think fenugreek is one of those love or hate spices.<br /><br />In closing, this fenugreek is very high quality, fresh and definitely sproutable!<br /><br />Happy fenugreeking! lol
