In preparation for going back to work, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep my breastmilk supply up to keep up with my baby.  I tried Motherlove More Milk Two Alcohol Free because Motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet I got from my lactation consultant.  It didn't work for me.  So then I tried More Milk Plus Alcohol Free.  That also didn't work for me.  Finally after talking to a couple of people, they recommended Fenugreek, which I had read about before, but wanted to give Motherlove's More Milk product line a try because of all the great reviews I read.  I ordered Motherlove's Fenugreek, and finally my breastmilk supply started to go up.<br /><br />Before Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total (1 to 1.5 oz on left side and 1.5 to 2 oz on right side).  By the time I finished a 4 oz bottle of Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was still pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total (up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right side).<br /><br />I was worried about keeping up with my baby, but now my baby can't keep up with me.  After using Fenugreek for about a month, I'll have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and I now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer, and running out of room to store any more!<br /><br />Note: Although your supply increases, it does eventually plateau.  After finishing the Motherlove's Fenugreek, I switched to Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules because they're a fraction of the price, and you can take them with meals.  Motherlove recommends you avoid water 20 minutes before and after taking their product.  The Nature's Way capsules is maintaining my supply that Motherlove's started.<br /><br />In fact, now that I'm back to work, after my last pump in the morning, it will be 6 to 8 hours before I get to pump again at lunch at work, then another 4 to 5 hours after that before I get to pump again when I return home.  I then pump every 3 to 5 hours from the time I get home to the last time before work in the morning.  Even though I'm pumping less often than before (before it was after each feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours in a 24 hour span), I'm still pumping a very minimum of 5 oz total.  For those the times I have to go longer between pumps (more than 6 hours) I will pump up to a maximum of 11 to 12 oz total depending on how long I had to go between pumps.
