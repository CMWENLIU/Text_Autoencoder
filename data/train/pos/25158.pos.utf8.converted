I bought this because I needed to make an effect of red eyes using a liquid red dye and contact lenses.  It worked, although I used too much and it was very difficult to see, but aside from that:<br /><br />In an age where all food coloring seems to have strayed to that of gels, this is a high quality, very good color red food dye.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand for others.
