First of all, for most people a birch beer and a root beer are almost the same thing. The taste is similar, and birch root is used in many products labeled as root beer. This company also bottles another soda called root beer, but this tastes better. It has a touch of wintermint in the complex flavor, spices, and vanillas. Nice  creamy texture on the tongue, less carbonation than most, which is good since it allows the flavor to come through. Yet it still has a nice foamy head.  They did not use high fructose corn syrup,  but chose cane sugar as their sweetener. It is more expensive but you can weigh down a soda with the corn syrup. So without it it is lighter and more refreshing.  I have to warn you, you may get spoiled if you drink Boylan's sodas as they are not cheap, but very addictive.<br /><br /> Originally brewed in 1891, this New York classic has the same flavor as it did over a century ago.  Boylan's Birch Beer started in a apothecary in the early 1890's and developed into the most popular flavor of The Boylan Sodaworks. Boylan was a bottling and keg filling operation located in the heart of Paterson, NJ, the first industrialized city in the country. Competition increased however, and in the 1930's Boylan was forced to close its bottling lines, leaving Boylan's Draught Birch Beer as its only product. Shortly thereafter, the rights to the name, the formula, and the sole route was purchased by the driver. His grandkids the Fiorina's still run the company in New Jersey today, and have expanded to near a dozen very delicious flavors. They recently changed to the very good looking and nostalgic bottles and painted on labels that are different than the shown at the time I write this reveiw.
