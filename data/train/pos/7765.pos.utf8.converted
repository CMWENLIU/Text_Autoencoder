I really enjoyed my first batch of Kim Chee using Noh of Hawaii Kim Chee Mix. It comes with instructions. I watched some youtube videos of others making Kim Chee which were helpful.<br /><br />I used one Napa Cabbage, half a cucumber (peeled) and half a bunch of green onions with one package mix; soaked for 8 hours at least in brine. I sliced everything into bite sized amounts.<br /><br />Then I rinsed the produce and drained it. I mixed up the mix with water and poured it onto my cut produce. It covered everything with with the sauce.<br /><br />I let it sit and ferment. I like the flavor very much. It is hot and spicy; just enough to be delightful.<br /><br />I already have a second batch fermenting now.<br /><br />September.24.2011 update:<br />I've really enjoyed Kim Chee made with the Noh of Hawaii seasoning mix. I've experimented with adding more produce and now I make larger batches of Kim Chee so that I need to use two packages of Kim Chee for the following:<br /><br />1 Napa Cabbage (large),<br />1 bunch of green onions<br />1 carrot,<br />1 cucumber.<br />1/2 leek.<br />3 Jalepeno Peppers.<br /> Diakon Radish 1/2 lbs.<br /><br />I clean, rinse off everything and slice it up into bite sizes. Then I soak the cut produce in brine. Finally I rinse it three times before mixing in the seasoning mix with fresh water.<br /><br />I like the flavor a lot more with all the above ingredients in it. It is full of flavor with interesting textures and looks.
