Sweetened condensed milk is yummy, we all know that.  What makes this product great is the container used.  Normally you buy it in a can and then if you don't use it all then you need to figure out how you want to store it.  And it is easier to use as well, with the squeeze bottle.  Good product, what more can I say.
