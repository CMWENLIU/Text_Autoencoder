I drive between Pittsburgh and Philly most weekends.  Usually an hour or two into the drive, I start to nod off with highway hypnosis.  When I get in the car I pop one of these down the pie hole and no nodding off.  I arrive at my destination alert and without the Red Bull and triple latte induced jitters normally experienced prior to finding this product.  Experienced none of the negative effects I saw in other reviews.  I suspect there may be secret agendas involving reputation assasination with some of those posters.
