Lalvin 71B-1122 is my yeast of choice for mead.  It is delivering consistent, tasty results.  I prefer my meads to be sweet and this yeast has never failed me.  Other yeasts can give dryer results that are less desireable for meads (in my opinion).<br /><br />One note of caution - it does take a significant amount of time to finish.  (I do not use yeast nutrients or energizers as I am brewing for a specific audience and prefer not to have modern ingredients in my mead.)  That being said, I will continue to use it and be patient.  Good mead is worth the wait!
