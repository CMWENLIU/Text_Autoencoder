Amaranth is one of the few non-dairy products containing all the amino acids. I am into fitness and building lean mass and muscle and always looking for good, clean sources of protein. Amaranth is a good source of protein. This product in particular comes neatly packaged and ready to be consumed. You can eat the amaranth raw or cooked. I recommend this product to anyone.
