In all honesty, this is similar in potency to vanilla extracts I have tried.  There are benefits to using the paste, however.<br /><br />There is not much alcohol in the paste, so it's great to use for a true vanilla flavor without the bitter aftertaste (keep in mind it does contain some extract so I'm guessing there is a minimal amount of alcohol in this).  This is certified kosher and is gluten free for anyone who might be interested in this info.  Also, the vanilla specks create visual flavor...after all, people taste first with their eyes.  I'll admit that I tend to overdo vanilla in my recipes, which is why the paste is so much better for recipes where the amount of liquid does matter (whipping creams, ice creams, creme brulee, etc.).<br /><br />Be aware that the paste isn't really a paste.  It's more like a syrup.  I've tried other Lorann products before (mostly their emulsions), so I'm glad that this product meets expectations.  It's comparable in price and potency to vanilla extracts, but I'll be using this paste almost exclusively for the reasons mentioned above.
