I am an active person, trying to eat what's best for me and although I know the health benefits of hemp, I think hemp protein powder is gross.  No matter what I mix with it, it still tastes like dirt.<br /><br />So I decided to try the shelled hempseeds and boy, are they delicious!  To me, they taste like sunflower seeds and I just eat them raw right out of the bag.<br /><br />Delicious!  I recommend that you try them if you, like me, hate hemp powder shakes.
