Unlike most of the reviewers for Gu, I am not a marathon runner, or even much of a runner at all. I'm hoping that I will be one day!  I'm lucky if I can make it to 2 miles.  I have issues with my blood sugar getting too low and it really affects me during exercise.  I take GU about 15 minutes before exercise to keep my blood sugar from plummeting during my run.  It is EXTREMELY effective!  I have made more progress with my fitness level since starting to use GU than in the last 2 years of struggling with my blood sugar issues.  I tried several different brands and flavors of "energy supplements" and came to the conclusion that GU is the most effective and tasty version out there.<br /><br />One caveat - I'm not particularly fond of the taste.  I get the Strawberry Banana and Lemon Lime flavors as those are the most palatable ones for me; however even those flavors are somewhat off.  The flavors are not really all that bad, and since the results are so impressive, I've gotten to where I don't really notice anymore.<br /><br />In short, this is a great way to boost your blood sugar before or during a workout.  It is also be useful as a safety measure for hypoglycemics; I keep one in my purse in case my blood sugar suddenly drops off a cliff.
