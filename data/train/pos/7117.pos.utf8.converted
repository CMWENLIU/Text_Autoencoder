As far as taste, what can we ask for? Plain with milk it's only passable. But heck, it's a hemp protein. Now there are ways of making it taste better and it's a nutritious product. Not too shabby is adding about a half of a decent sized frozen banana (a natural sweetener, thickener, and flavoring) to 8 oz of milk (I use organic fat free milk) to 3 tablespoons of the product. This tasted pretty good, and I would have no problem drinking it like this every day. So what I am saying is that for products like these that don't taste like a Steak and Shake milkshake or a Wendy's Frosty, one would need to experiment to find something that is suitable as far as taste to the consumer. I did think about giving four stars for taste, but it's not god awful and can be gotten around with a little creativity. Plus we are dealing with hemp here so I don't think it would be fair. This is the first hemp protein I have tried so maybe there are better tasting ones out there. However, since I like the way I made it above with the banana and may be able to find other good tasting concoctions, I may be just running risk and find something worse by seeking elsewhere. If I were to stick with this one, and I may, the bottom line then becomes final price. I am not a pure vegan although I do restrict meat intake and usually stick to salmon and chicken breasts when I do eat meat. So I use a supplement like this to fill in days when I don't get enough protein from animal products. I won't eat soy protein, trace amounts notwithstanding, and I would not put Splenda or sucralose (poison) in my system so I needed an alternative protein shake/smoothy. All the regular good tasting standard bodybuilding proteins use sucralose to sweeten them. Well, the ones I like and have used anyway. Even these latter mentioned ones that have the best relative taste, don't taste like an unhealthy milkshake anyway.<br /><br />Update 3/14/2012: Ok this is how I drink it now, and I love it. 8 oz of Pacific Brand organic oat non-dairy beverage (any kind of milk such as hemp, almond, or soy can be used), 1 medium banana, 1/2 cup of raw organic oatmeal (we buy this in the bulk section at Whole Foods), 4 tablespoons of this Hemp Protein, 1 packet of Sweet Leaf Stevia. This is my breakfast every other day. One can add a tablespoon of organic freshly ground (at the store which make it nothing but ground nuts) nut butter if you are not too worried about fat. To me the oatmeal really makes it great.
