I am a published Author, and have been searching for something to "destress" the tummy, and when I discovered Heathers Tummy Teas, I was delighted to try it.  After using it for only 3 days, my feelings of bloating, and irritability have ALL gone.<br />  It is nice now, to finally sit and write my next book without worrying about the feelings of indigestion and bloating.  It tastes wonderful, and soothes you to the very core.  Undoubtedly, and without question, a fantabulous product!!! A+++++++<br /><br />  Blessings,<br /><br />  Joseph<br /><br />Ps: Any questions, feel free to contact @ daag1981@yahoo.com
