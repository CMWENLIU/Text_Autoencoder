How happy I am to have found a mix that lives up to its name! The original Tunnel of Fudge bundt cake was a prize winning cake of the 70's and the very best chocolate cake ever, in my opinion. The dry frosting mix used in this recipe went obsolete in the 90's. Now, finally, my family can enjoy this lushous cake once more with Nordic Ware's cake mix. I bought one and tried it and the same wonderful taste came back to me. I have recommeded this taste sensation to all of my friends and bought 2 more for myself. Hint:If the price scares you just think of what you pay at a bakery for a simple birthday cake.<br />J.Peterson, MN
