I gave several of these to business associates for the holidays and they were a big hit. Chocked full of  Ghirardelli milk chocolate, Godiva dark chocolate covered almonds, cinnamon roasted cashews, Wine Country sesame crackers, camembert cheese spread and cheese knife, stone ground mustard, baguettes, salami, butter cookies, Lindt dark and milk chocolate truffles, Ghirardelli Citrus Sunset dark chocolate with orange and caramel crunch, Nonni's roasted garlic crackers, and more. Even has a matching Wine Country candy dish ensures.  These are simply loaded with some of the best "goodies" out there.  For the price you just cannot beat them.
