So. . . .<br /><br />I work at a place where I spend a lot of time online.  Because I live in a college town and I'm at that tender age where it's obvious that college was a catastrophic failure for me, but I've not yet found the "real" job that will keep me busy until it's time to put me in the ground, I work with a lot of friends that found themselves in the same situation.<br /><br />I was surfing around and found these Haribo Raspberries listed.  I remembered getting these in a little pack that looked like it was from a farmer's market as a kid -- a little waxed cardboard basket with these vacuum packed in the middle.  I LOVED THESE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN.<br /><br />Being a little older, and having the ability to make orders online, I sent a link to this item to a friend and was rambling about how I'd ordered these.  I told them that I was really excited to have found them again.<br /><br />Because we're all trying to reach out to oblivion in our own ways. . . and we don't fear the consequences of any types of self-destructive behaviour, we started talking about having a contest to see who could eat the most candy -- I'd alluded to how I could likely eat all five pounds in one sitting.  A candy eating contest was born.  The rules were going to be that everyone that wished to participate would bring five pounds of their chosen candy.  For me, it was easy -- this came in a five pound bag.<br /><br />Long story short. . . . These are so good you can get through about 2.3 pounds in a sitting. . . .<br /><br />Can't say that for many other types of candy.
