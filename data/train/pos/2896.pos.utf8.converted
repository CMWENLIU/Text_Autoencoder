I have bought almond paste and made my own marzipan in the past. I tried this premade product and was completely satisfied. Not much more expensive than do-it-yourself and certainly a lot less work! I would like to get it in smaller blocks, say 2 lb. If marzipan is not available to you locally, the extra expense of shipping is inevitable and your only choice.
