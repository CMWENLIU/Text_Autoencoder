Don't be fooled by all the foodies who insist fresh ground is the only way to go.  This stuff beats every fresh ground pepper I have tried.  It has a much more intensely peppery taste and is wonderful.  I was turned on by a friend who is a chef in a very nice restaurant.  He told me they only keep a peppermill around for all the food snobs, but all the gourmet cooking is done with this!
