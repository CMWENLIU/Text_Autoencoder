I bought these for my girlfriend who can not eat Gluten.  I kept one of the bags for my self cause they make such good pancakes.  We first made crepes.  They were light and yummy.  We put in some fresh fruit and chocolate (yum).  The next day we made pancakes and waffles.  Sooooo good.  I don't have to eat GF pancakes but i doubt i will go back to my usual mix.  This mix can also be used in other baking applications.  Buy the case now!
