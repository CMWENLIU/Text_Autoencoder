I was looking for a pancake/waffle mix with natural ingredients and no hydrogenated vegetable oil (trans fats) and tried Canterbury Naturals Old Fashioned Pancake & Waffle Mix. I followed the mixing directions, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and these pancakes tasted very close to my Mom's homemade recipe but without the fuss. The pancakes have a tender texture and great taste. My family loves these pancakes and so do I.
