Due to a nurse recommendation,  we started our baby off on RTF (Ready to Feed) ProSobee until we read about it having the highest BPA concentration in their cans of all RTF formulas. The report from Enfamil stating that "people only use RTF formulas infrequently, and primarily use powder formulas" confirmed they didn't really care.<br />A little more research showed that Soy has high concentrations of Aluminum and Estrogen, neither of which did we want for our Baby Boy. Thus we decided to try switching to a dairy-based product.<br />After EXTENSIVE research, taking into consideration BPA levels, flouride levels, melamine concerns, and corn syrup, our list quickly shrunk to Earth's Best and Nature's One.  Nature's One appeared better since Earth's Best uses hexane to extract their DHA, however the constipation reports with Nature's One convinced us to try Earth's Best first, especially since our baby was only 4 months old.<br />After a week of transition to Earth's Best (1 can), our baby was having trouble sleeping through the night, his stool was loose and green, he had a fussy tummy, and we were wondering if he had a milk allergy. Since several reviews had mentioned babies quickly taking to Nature's One, we decided to give it a try before switching back to Soy.<br />Right off the bat, Nature's One mixes so much easier and more completely with water than Earth's Best did. It doesn't clump, looks cleaner and tastes MUCH better (yes, we both tried it). It didn't surprise us when our son immediately took to it. Additionally, however, to our amazement and delight, his stool firmed back up, was no longer green, and he started sleeping through the night again!  5 days later... the reports of arsenic popped up on every news channel possible. Argh!<br />From the research available, it appears Nature's One is the only manufacturer that doesn't use some form of corn syrup, melamine, nor hexane. They also appear to use the most expensive ingredients, yet provide a very affordable product (it's comparably priced to the mass-produced brands).  We were disappointed to hear of this new concern, but are taking the recent reports with a grain of salt. Here's why:<br />1) California-grown Brown Rice has 41% lower arsenic levels than other US-grown Brown Rice<br />2) These tests were done at one University, who didn't specifically name Nature's One Baby's Only (possibly so they can't be sued?)<br />3) The tests showed inorganic arsenic levels "as high as" twice the limits allowed in US drinking water (10 parts/billion), yet the levels shown to cause harm were in water supplies 35 times this level. What does "as high as" mean? Did they run the test 100 times, and it came up that high once? Extraneous data points are generally thrown out in scientific studies. How were these tests tabulated?<br />4) The alerts were MUCH higher for the other products tested (energy bars, etc) which had 20+ times the limits allowed in US drinking water.<br />5) Which is worse? Still-quite-low amounts of arsenic, or the only alternatives which contain melamine, aluminum, BPA and/or hexane.<br />6) Are these recent reports an attempt to halt a shift of buyers away from these other brands? Maybe not, but...<br /><br />In any case, for now we're sticking with this product. Ultimately, our baby's digestive system seems to prefer it, he REALLY likes it, and it still seems to be the best/safest option available. I just hope they don't go out of business as a result of this mass-scare...
