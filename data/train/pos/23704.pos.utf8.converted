Assorted Green Tea Flowers should be called Assorted Jasmine Green Tea Flowers.  It's the blooms that are assorted not the tea flavor.  They are all Jasmine.  Having said that, it's a wonderful surprise when you put in the bud and don't know what kind of flower you're going to be getting next!<br /><br />Usually when I buy Jasmine Tea I get the finest- A small 4 ounce bag that runs me  $20 and although this tea isn't as good as what I regularly buy it's still very nice tasting.  The best part is that it's practically impossible to overbrew.  Jasmine Tea in particular can get really bitter easily if it is overbrewed even a bit and I was afraid I would have to take the flower out after a couple of minutes to stop the brewing process.  But NO!  The makers thought ahead and made it so that you can leave the flower in and it won't overbrew.  The only bad thing about this is that if you like your Jasmine Tea really strong then you won't like the way this works for you.  But strong Jasmine Tea is always bitter so you might want to try a lighter brew like this.<br />Hint: If you never liked the way Jasmine Tea tasted because of it's bitterness here's a trick.  Standard instructions for Jasmine include having your water at around 180 degrees and brewing for aprox 2 minutes.  Instead of this, try using a lower temperature instead- say 130ish and brew for 7 minutes.  What you'll get is a tea with all the Jasmine and none of the bitterness.  With these flowers however you don't have to worry about brewing time (unless you like your tea VERY weak) and are free to enjoy the flower until your tea is gone.
