The tiny little containers of wheat grass / cat grass that you see in the grocery stores and pet stores (ranging in price from $2.99 to $6.99!) are ridiculous, when you can get this 5 pound bucket for $15 or so and have it last for a long time.  I purchased The Sprout House Hard Wheat for Wheatgrass Sprouting Seeds about a month ago, and I can already see this is going to last me for awhile.  I have a recycled wheatgrass container from one of those grocery stores, and each batch takes less than 1/4 cup of wheat grass seeds to grow the same amount.  I'm literally growing the same amount of grass for pennies.  It's so easy to grow this for my cats, that I'm thinking about buying a manual juicer and growing some for us as well!<br /><br />The only down-side to this bucket is how hard it was to get the lid off!  But the opposite point is that it closes VERY securely, so you can be assured of keeping your seeds dry and free from contaminants.<br /><br />All around, I find this an excellent purchase and if / when I run out, I'll be sure to order from The Sprout House again!
