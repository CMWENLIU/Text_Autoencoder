The other 50% is to not do something stupid to ruin your otherwise delicious sauce, like make a red wine reduction using Yellow-Tail.<br /><br />Short review: Great stuff/best of its kind by far. No good reason not to use this unless you've got a ready supply of fresh veal-stock.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore foodie, but not a professional. My friends all think I should open a restaurant because I really can cook (when I'm motivated), but I'm too lazy for that.  I've learned the hard way how to make Demi-Glace and, frankly, it's a pain in the ass, not to mention expensive (Veal stock? Really?). But since I'm too narcissistic to make a dinner for friends that is nothing short of awesome (not to mention how competitive and snobby some of my friends are), I will practice/test/rehearse something to perfection before I'll share it.<br /><br />In search of the perfect red wine redux/sauce, I came across a friend who knew the chef for a restaurant in wine country that made one of the best Wagyu/Kobe filet dishes I've ever had that has stayed on their menu for years.  After two years, I finally met the executive chef and after a lot of drinking, he revealed to me that there are two ways to make a great demi-glace red wine sauce - the hard way, and the really really hard stupid way.  The really hard stupid way is to do it all from scratch, which if you know what Demi-Glace really entails, you had better have all the stock-making ingredients already on hand on a regular basis.<br /><br />Or you can use someone else's well designed, fine tuned reduction ready to go.<br /><br />I've tried several of the others and had varying success, but nothing that would sing out to you "yes, this is the real deal".  The other premade Demi-glace (or similar variations) I've tired were as if you were eating Select-grade sirloin when you were wanting to get Choice-grade rib-eye.  I always just assumed you just had to do a real demi-glace to get the real-deal result you needed.<br /><br />Then I came across this chef and he reluctantly told me that this was his "Secret ingredient".  So I tried it.  And now I'm a believer too.<br /><br />The best thing you can do to make sure this stuff works (eg, to not screw it up) is to use a quality wine in your reduction.  Don't use that 30 day old rancid yellow tail crap. Don't use 1 hour old Yellow-Tail. And if you drink Yellow Tail then you probably don't care about this product anyway.  I recommend adding something to bring up the sweet level, not to make it sweet per se, but as a seasoning agent - like a port or a cognac mixed in with a Cab, Merlot or anything in the Bordeaux family. The flavors will really sing at you.
