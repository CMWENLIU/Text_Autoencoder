I made this Riesling wine kit from Vino Italiano and am very happy with the results.  Keep in mind that this is a value priced wine kit and can't be compared to a primium 16 liter wine kit.  But I am very happy with the results.  This is a refreshing, fruity, dry, white wine.  I made it a 5 gallon kit instead of the 6 gallons per the instructions and have found this kit to have surprisingly great flavor.  These Vino Italiano kits are better than two buck chuck and they are fun to make.  I used to drink Trader Joes wines in the $5-$7 range for everyday enjoyment.  I think the Vino Italiano wines are better than what I had been drinking. Adjust your expectations and you will be very happy with the results.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELJK3M">Vino Italiano 4 Week Wine Kit, Riesling, 15.5-Pound Box</a>
