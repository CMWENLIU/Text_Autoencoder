This was exactly what I was looking for and I can't believe that people who get something they thought was a different product will actually leave it a bad review.  Take it for what it's worth and you will get delightfully little balls of sugar to be used for your fun and fine baking projects.  The seller is also easy to deal with and has great customer service!
