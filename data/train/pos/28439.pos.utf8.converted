The product itself is excellent. Good quality and great taste.<br /><br />Beware------>If you live in a warm climate or have this item shipped in the hottest months, the cookies will most likely arrive fused together because the chocolate coating melts while sitting in the delivery truck for even the shortest amount of time. Having them sent overnight, next-day delivery can help reduce this risk, but if the delivery arrives late in the day, or sits outside your door for a while, odds are you will have a fused block of degestive cookies. The first time I orderd them I had them shipped ground...needless to say a bad choice. Second time was overnight, they arrived slightly melted but not fused into a single, messy block.
