This stuff is pretty tasty and pretty darn filling.  When I first got my hands on some, I filled a bowl up and added milk.  When I was halfway through my bowl I knew I had made to much.  This stuff doesn't float like crappy fluff cereal.  So when you make some, it seems like you don't have that much.  When I was looking at the product I didn't see that it had raisins, but it is brimming with them.  Raisin Bran's two scoops has nothing on this stuff.  I really like this product and I would like to try more Bob's Red Mill products in the future.
