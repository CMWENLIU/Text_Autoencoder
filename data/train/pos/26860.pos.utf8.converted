I tried Pure Bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. The site waxed poetic about the flavor, as well as the extremely high quality ingredients, but I figured "right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are". Well, I stand corrected, the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best I've tasted (and I've tasted quite a few). That's a real bonus, considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. To those unfamiliar with raw food bars, take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like "granola" bars or candy bars, you'll be disappointed. Think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. I can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. On to the chocolate next...
