This is a hard to find vinegar that is superior to balsamic especially when rich flavor is needed. While balsamic adds sweetness and a strong vinegar flavor, sherry vinegar is a mild vinegar that adds huge flavor with a depth and richness that is unique. It can be used very much like white wine, but it adds a smooth nutty flavor similar to pecans. This can be used whenever cooking sherry is called for. I like to use it instead of beer to cook turkey brats, and when cooking cut up chicken: cover the bottom of a fry or saute pan, let the liquid reduce while browning each side; it turns out great. I haven't tried it with other meats, such as beef or pork, but I would expect the rich, mellow flavor to compliment those meats as well. The bottles are large, the size of wine bottles, and this will force you to think up ways to use it--lucky you.
