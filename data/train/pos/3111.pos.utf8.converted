This house was quite large and comes with more than enough frosting and candy.  Everything is high quality and very fresh.  We got 3 houses and had a contest between our children with grandchildren. It was easy and fun for all ages.  After a while, we couldn't resist and decorated the extra cookies, then ate them.  All the flavors of candies along with of the frosting are delicious!  This is a new tradition for us and can't wait to do it again next year.  Merry Christmas!
