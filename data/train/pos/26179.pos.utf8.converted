I've enjoyed kippered herring all my (long) life, and have tried all of the popular brands found on supermarket shelves, at least in my area.  Found these by accident and, boy, they're head and shoulders above the competition....well, herring don't have shoulders, but you know what I mean.  Kippered means smoked, and these have fine smoky flavor, are beautifully packed in nice wide tins.  There's no extra juice or excessive oil, just fine flavor, packed like soldiers, no empty space.  Savor them!!
