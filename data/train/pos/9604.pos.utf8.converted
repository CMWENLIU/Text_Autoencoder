I've had my AeroGarden for about three months now, and it's been a joy.  The herbs grew unbelievably rapidly and I have more fresh basil than I'm able to use!  It's nice to be able to pluck off a few leaves and toss them right into the spaghetti sauce.  It's very easy to use - about every two weeks a little light comes on, and I re-fill it with water and add two more nutrient tablets.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the strawberry kit!
