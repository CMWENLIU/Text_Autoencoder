Anyone who makes the statement "I do not like fruitcake" has never tasted homemade fruitcakes. I make them all year long for special occasions. They are easy to make when you follow the easy Paradise directions. I always add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and chocolate chips. One should consider this an organic recipe since it is all natural "sugar, butter and eggs" (and RUM! too)I would guess there could easily be 250-300 calories in one slice of cake - but Oh Well we only bake on special occasions!
