First off, Cinnamon has one of the highest antioxidant levels of any spice and even more than many foods.  That said, I use it daily in smoothies, oatmeal, etc.  I didn't realize the difference between "regular" "store-bought" cassia cinnamon and Ceylon until I opened the package and had a taste.  At first, I was disappointed expecting a strong flavor as my taste buds were use to the cassia type cinnamon.  Over the days of use, this wonderful Ceylon cinnamon flavor has grown on me; I can't imagine going back to the cassia.<br /><br />I highly recommend Frontier's Ceylon Cinnamon.  Great taste!
