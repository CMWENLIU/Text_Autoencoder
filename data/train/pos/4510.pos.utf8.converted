I have been diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia and acid reflux. I suffered with constant hoarseness, sometimes loosing my voice, not to mention the sleepless nights when I could not lie down. I have sit up to sleep many nights & you just don't sleep as well as when you can't  go to bed with your head on a pillow.  and all the medications give me gastritis.( I have tried all of them).  The Hoarseness was so bad  I had trouble talking , couldn't sing at church anymore and while I still have some of the hoarseness,  it is MUCH better since I started using Himalayan  Salt. I have been keeping quiet about it for about 2 weeks but finally told my daughter this week. I guess I was afraid if I talked  it would come back as bad as ever.  I was actually able to sing a little at Church this week end! So  now I am sure this salt is  is helping . I bought my first two small shakers at a local Health Food Store and then found this site on amazon, The price is so much more affordable. I gave my daughter a salt shaker full this week to try and I will see my sister this week end and have a shaker full for her to try. I Should shop for smaller shakers :) I will be ordering more salt soon if I keep giving this away but I am so thrilled with the results and I love the taste. I just want everybody to try it.<br />I don't even like the taste of my grocery store salt  after tasting  Himalayan  Crystal Salt<br />Try it You Just Might Like It
