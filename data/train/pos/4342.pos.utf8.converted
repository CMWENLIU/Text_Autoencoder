I used to order these directly from Think Products and they were consistently chewy and fresh.  Sometimes at health food stores they can be dry and tough and somewhat flavorless.  The first Amazon order I got was dry, gross, and a total waste of money.  I told Think Products and they never responded.  The second order was excellent, tender, chocolatey, and chewy.  The third order was not as fresh tasting.  I love these bars and the fact that I can eat something that tastes like candy but is full of protein and has no sugar or questionable sugar substitutes, but the inconsistency of the batches is disconcerting.  For the price, they should always be moist and fresh, not chalky.
