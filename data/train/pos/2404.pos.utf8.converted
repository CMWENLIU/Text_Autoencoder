Ok, so you can cook up a bowl of chewy tasty brown rice for a lot less than the $2 this will cost you.  But it will take you the better part of an hour, and won't be any better than this rice which takes only 90 seconds.  So keep the non-instant brown rice around for those times when time isn't of the essence, and keep this around for when you need a quick, delicious bowl in less than two minutes.  It's really that simple.
