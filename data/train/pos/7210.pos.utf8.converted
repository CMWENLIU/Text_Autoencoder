I was very excited to try this out as I've used mostly the generic seeming vanilla extracts from the grocery store.  Unfortunately in Beijing its hard to get even that stuff.  I was very excited to get the package and as soon as I opened the bottle I was really taken with the smell, its great!  I can't do a side by side test of the different extracts, but I made some cookies and pancakes with these, and they were delicious.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this vanilla.  Also the people at JR are very friendly people and enclosed a nice note so it feels good buying from them.
