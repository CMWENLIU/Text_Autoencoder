By now, most everyone has heard of the health benefits of eating broccoli sprouts.  The demand has driven the cost up to $3.80 for a 2-ounce carton at the few grocery stores that carry them.  Countless sprouters hawk their wares on the Internet selling both seeds and all sorts of fancy sprouting devices at a premium.  Add shipping to that.  Many growers make their own sprouters - and there are as many different designs as there are growers. Many websites show good pictures of these setups.  Most use glass jars with screen wire replacing the lid. After reading every bit of information I could find on growing broccoli sprouts, I ordered my first batch of seeds.  First off, at $20.00 a pound on Amazon.Com, these seeds  are $5.00/lb. cheaper than the competition plus Amazon offers free shipping.<br />I opted for a clear plastic jar in stead of glass for a sprouter. Glass and cats do NOT mix. I had to order three types of stainless steel wire before I got the size that was perfect.  Here's what works best for me. Stainless Steel Type 304 Mesh #16 X 16 .018" Wire Diameter 12" x 12" available at Amazon for $8.62 with free shipping. #16 means the number of openings per lineal inch. Most craft stores sell scissors to cut wire mesh.  Fiskars makes a good pair.  Cut a circle 1mm larger in diameter than the mouth of your growing jar.  I use Folgers 12oz. coffee jars(38oz.liquid capacity) and cut out the lid with a Dremmel leaving only the rim with a 1mm ridge to the inside.  Insert the wire mesh circle into the top of the remaining lid. It should slightly bow outward but not so much that you can't rest the jar upside down with the lid on.(see attached photo image) Draining after washing is the part that gets tricky.  I read one website that said beat, slam, shake or do whatever necessary to thoroughly drain the sprouts after washing. So, I killed my first two jars of baby sprouts by blunt force tramma. They turned to mush.  Here's a secret I learned the hard way.  Wash the seeds/sprouts by swirling them in cold water for about 20 seconds.  Then, instead of violent slamming, simply place the growing jar upside down on a fluffed white paper towel.  After a minute, squeeze out the towel, refluff it and place it back under the lid.  No beating.  No knocking.  No shaking.  After ten minutes, your sprouts are well drained, still fluffed and happy.  The paper towel soaks the excess moisture through the screen better than any other method I've found.  Next, place the jar on its side in indirect sunlight between 66 and 70 degrees. I like a window sill behind a thin curtain.  Wash and drain twice a day.  For me, they grow much better when not compressed.  Two or three times a day, I'll rotate the jar about 90 degrees to allow them to gently tumble and bring submerged sprouts to the light. Another thing that seems to help is a very gentle air circulation flowing across the screen.  I have a small air cleaner/filter set on low about six feet away from the containers. From the first step of soaking the seeds to harvest, it takes me between 8 and 12 days. I understand that different varieties of seeds sprout differently and there are many variables to consider.  I wait until my jar becomes full of sprouts. Even the few seeds that don't sprout and the hulls are edible.  Some people remove these. During the final draining, most of the husks will float away and stick to the inside of the sprouter making them easy to remove. On average, 3 tablespoons of seeds yields 6.4oz of drained sprouts per jar. Based on the weights I'm getting on a postage scale, $20.00 in seeds yields about $90.00 in sprouts.  They are greener than the pale sprouts from the grocery store and taste much better, too.  This is a fun and productive hobby for the Winter months.  I have yet to come up with a cool growing idea for the Summer.  I'm thinking of a very small, shelf-type refrigerator set at 68 degrees and rigging it where the light will stay on inside.  Another bright idea that might burn out.
