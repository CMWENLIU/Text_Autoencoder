I've been eating various Indian retorted veggie entrees for a while now -- we use them as side dishes when I cook main dishes that may be, but aren't always, Indian. The Madras Lentils remind me a lot of really good Louisiana Red Beans (as in Red Beans & Rice--with or without sausage). Very flavorful and actually a bit meaty in taste. I first encountered them at Trader Joe's but it seems that they are going over to their own labels and they wouldn't admit that they were using TastyBite (see someone else's review of Punjabi Eggplant)so I'll stick with the original. I've also tried, and liked, the Punjabi Eggplant.
