Barley Malt powder is super healthy, since the sugars are largely Maltose, which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics.  I have tried just about every one available, and Barry Farms makes the best one of all.  The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk.  I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink.  Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar.  This is one great tasting health food.
