I was sent a box of Uncle Eddie's by my young niece, a convert to veganism after a recent - and by all accounts, traumatic - school trip to the local abattoir.<br /><br />Not being of the vegan persuasion myself, I was unaccustomed to animal-free comestibles. The chewiness of the cookies was surprisingly pleasant, although they definitely lacked the flavour of their traditionally-made cookie cousins due to the absence of butter and other ethically-incorrect animal ingredients.<br /><br />Happily this minor disappointment was easily remedied by immersing the cookies in a shallow bath of warmed lard prior to ingestion. Personally, I prefer the fuller flavour of unrendered lard (obtained from the fatty deposits surrounding the pig's kidneys) but feel sure that the cheaper varieties made from the hard fat between the back skin and the flesh of the pig will suffice for people with less refined palates.<br /><br />By following my advice for post-production animal fat insertion, you can now guzzle guilt-free without compromising on the flavour.
