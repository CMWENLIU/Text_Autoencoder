What gives?  I can't buy it anywhere.  I became a fan a few years back for health reasons, but all I find in shops is that "other stuff".  (Top-of-the-line caviar is much easier to find. Sheesh!) Hopefully, Kraft will begin to think about selling it in the States.  If it wasn't good-tasting and good for me, I wouldn't go through all the trouble!
