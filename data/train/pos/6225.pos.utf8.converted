I've been eating Jing Jing Jahe for the past 15 years, even taking some with me when traveling in Indonesia, where it is manufactured.  When you first put a candy in your mouth, you might wonder where the ginger heat is, but don't worry.  After a few minutes your mouth will be enveloped with the most wonderful ginger taste you'll ever experience.  This chewy candy is not for those who do not like "hot" foods, but for ginger affecionados, it's a wonderful treat.
