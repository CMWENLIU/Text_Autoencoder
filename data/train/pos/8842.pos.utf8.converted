Bisibelebath is a great lentil and vegetable broth that is thick, musky, with a hint of a little something spicy, but not too spicy or hott. This dish is amazing by itself, or i would recommend accompanying with Vegetable Pulao or you can make your own Rice. I usually serve with Tempe or Tofu. Among the MTR Products i recommend this one, Shahi Paneer Masala, Pav Bhaji, Vegetable Pulao........... actually you know what, i recomment ALL MTR products, the sincerely unique Indian taste surpasses in authenticity compared to Tasty Bite products!<br /><br />Enjoy!
