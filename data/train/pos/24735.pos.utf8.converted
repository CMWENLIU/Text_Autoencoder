If your favorite coffee at Starbucks is the Caramel Macchiato- then you will LOVE this coffee.  The price is just over a buck a cup so it's still pricey by home coffee standards, but is such a savings compared to Starbucks prices.  Side note- you don't have to follow the directions and make a tiny cup from these servings- I make my portions much larger and just stop the flow when the color runs opaque. Delicious!
