I've tried many brands of green tea and this is by far the best.  The only thing better was a loose tea I bought in Japan.  Remember to let the water cool a little before adding the bag.  And I would suggest checking your local Asian market for a lower price.  I usually pay $19.00 for a pack of 100 bags.
