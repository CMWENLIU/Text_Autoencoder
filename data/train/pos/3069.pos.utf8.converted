I've been looking for a green tea I like, knowing all the reported benefits of green tea. This one's perfect for me because it's got a little berry taste to make it interesting. I'm not really a tea drinker. There are only two or three teas I've ever liked, and this is one of them. Plus, goji berries are supposedly good for you, too, so double bonus!
