I drink strong black coffee. After sampling all the bold brew T-Discs available, and prior to the release of Starbuck's Africa Kitamu, I was a faithful user of their Verona discs. That all changed with my first sip of the Africa Kitamu coffee. The strength is decidedly bold but not bitter. The best description may be that it is very smooth. It is absolutely delicious, and Africa is now my first choice and new favorite.<br /><br />The coffee is also a wise choice for those who like a lighter brew. Simply use the manual override procedure on the Tassimo coffee maker to add extra water to taste. In the process, an even larger cup of coffee is created.<br /><br />With each new release, Starbucks's has added significant quality to the T-Disc line and is quickly making my Tassimo indispensable.
