I ordered these with a bit of doubt because I often buy Eden's regular canned beans at Whole Foods and find them very bland. I mean, totally unsalty. I am not a saltoholic, but I also don't want to eat something so bland that I can hardly tell what I'm eating. I buy them anyway because they are packaged in BPA-free cans and  because I can add some sea salt or chili seasonings and make them taste pretty darned good. Still, the thought of getting twelve cans of bland rice and beans put me off a wee bit.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I opened the first can and this wonderful aroma wafted up to my prepared-for-disappointment nose. Yummy smell, and, as I found to my delight, wonderful taste. The beans (black) are paired with short grain brown rice that has been cooked to perfection. Both are in a sauce that tastes pretty authentic (I'm Mexican-American and, thanks to Mama,  have a good sense for what spices should be used here) but isn't fiery or tummy-troubling.  There's just enough salt to bring out the flavors without sending your blood pressure soaring or your kidneys into an apoplectic fit.<br /><br />I like to put this in my whole wheat tortillas, topped with a little shredded cheese or with shredded green lettuce (not iceberg--yuk!), chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, and minced jalapeno peppers. Wonderful. Also works well with either ground beef or ground beef-sub in crispy taco shells. Oh--another fave combo of mine is this one (which might make you wonder about my sanity):  these beans and rice, heated up, with cold cottage cheese. Get a little of each in each forkful and enjoy the contrast between hot and cold and spicy mixture and cool dairy. Majorly yummy.<br /><br />Try these--I think you'll  like them, and Amazon prices are pretty darned good.
