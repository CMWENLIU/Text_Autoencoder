We bought a Breadman TR2200C Ultimate Bread Machine about five years ago.  We discovered Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001G6V8S">Hodgson Mill, Bread Mix Nine Grain, 16-Ounce</a>, at the HEB supermarkets when we lived in the Austin, TX, area, and found them at Sweetbay and Publix here in Florida when we moved her three years ago.  For some reason both stores quit carrying this item, so we were delighted to find that Amazon carries it at a very reasonable price <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDESM">Hodgson Mill 9 Grain Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />My wife adds dried cranberries, coconut flakes and walnut pieces to this mix and it makes a delightful bread, comparable to artisan loaves selling for $5 or more.
