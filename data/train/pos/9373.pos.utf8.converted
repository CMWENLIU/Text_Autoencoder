I realize this review may seem a bit odd, because I don't have a cat. I actually have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. But I think my review of this product may still be of value to any dog owners who might come across it.<br /><br />Andie has been taking pills for her hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Wrapping the pills in meat or cheese never worked; she simply eats around the pill or spits it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!)<br /><br />Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something call "Pill Pockets". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in a variety of flavors (any of which Andie would like), but the dog packages came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat packages only came in one size (small).<br /><br />I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Amazon.com they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, "I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"<br /><br />I've been happy with that decision ever since.<br /><br />I've bought both the salmon and chicken flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes both of them. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the "doggie" Pill Pockets.<br /><br />This is a great product, for cats OR dogs. I have never owned a cat but for any dog owners out there I can definitely attest that Pill Pockets for Cats are NOT just for cats! Dogs love 'em, too! If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice -- your dog will never know the difference!
