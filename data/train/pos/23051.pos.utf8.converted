I really love this liquid stevia.  It is sweet, not bitter and has absolutely no after-taste.  Exactly what you want in stevia.  I've been using stevia as a sweetener in my drinks and cooking for the past few years now.  I couldn't dream of going back to sugar at this point.  I've tried a number of different brands and this one is one of my top choices hands down.  I also like to keep a powder around for cooking purposes.  Tried many powder brands as well, in terms of taste and price, this brand is the best I've found; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">100 Grams (3.5 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  Come to my home and you'll find both products in my cupboard.  Highly Recommended!
