In my humble opinion, AlsoSalt is the best salt substitute on the market. I use no other as it has no bitter aftertaste. I often need to cook from scratch to keep my sodium count low. AlsoSalt makes that extra work worthwhile as it is a great help in making the food taste good.  It does have extra potassium which is not appropriate for all. It also comes in little packets to throw into your purse or pocket to bring to a cafe or a friend's home.
