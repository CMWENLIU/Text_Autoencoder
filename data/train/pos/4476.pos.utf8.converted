This stuff is simply crack for cats.<br /><br />All my cats are addicted to it so I use it as treats, and the big bag goes a looooong way if you only give them a few kibbles at a time like candy. I've turned friends on to this stuff and it's always the same thing - their cats go crazy over it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend to use it as a regular food because it's very fattening and you'll wind up with lazy jumbokitties that take up all the couch space.
