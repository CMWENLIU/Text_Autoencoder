I agree the cardboard box isn't ready for gift giving.  However, the coffee selection is wonderful.  I'm learning which brands I prefer so I can narrow down future sample packs.  It's a great decaf introduction to the world of coffee for new Keurig owners.  If you're looking for presentation, buy a carousel and put the K-cups on display before wrapping, perhaps with some tape to hold them in while transporting.  The leftover K-cups that don't fit can then be transfered into any pretty box you desire.  The important thing is the coffee selection can't be beat, and the price is very reasonable.
