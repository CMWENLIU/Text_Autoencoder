I consider myself a Chai connoisseur.  I have been enjoying a Tazo Chai Latte nearly every day since 2001.  I am very picky and really only enjoy a limited selection of Chai brands.  My favorite is Tazo, especially when prepared by a Starbucks barista without water.  I was hesitant to purchase the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte k-cups in fear of it not meeting my high expectations; however, at first sip, I was hooked.  Although it has a slightly different taste than Tazo, it has a sweet aroma, full of spice with the perfect amount of creaminess.  I look forward to drinking this Chai Latte in the afternoon as a treat or pick-me-up. It is the perfect comfort item for me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOH5Y2">Cafe Escapes 96 Chai Latte K-Cups</a>
