I am cursed.  I love these things.  At one time I truly feel I was addicted to them.  It is one of the few foods that once I start eating, I simply cannot stop until I either run out of them or I founder.  Hot or cold, I love them.<br /><br />Alas though, I am no longer allowed to eat them.  My physicians and my wife conspired against me (Well, my body did too...it really let me down), and they all monitor what I eat quite closely.  They have even brought my kids and grandkids into their repressive ring of food police.  Curses.<br /><br />When I get separated from my wife at the grocery store she never has to notify the manager.  She always goes to the pop-tart shelf where she will find me gazing longingly at the wonderful displays and fondling the boxes.  She gently but firmly leads me away...sigh.<br /><br />In the big scheme of things, these little gems are really not all that unhealthy for normal people.  My problem is that I am not normal.  I could probably get buy with it if I could only eat one now and then.  For me that is impossible...I simply can not stop.  This is odd because I am actually a pretty disciplined individual with an iron will...not with these though...they are my bane.<br /><br />The last time I had one of these delights was about a year ago.  My wife was gone and I found a box of them in the very back of one of our pantries.  I opened a pack and was blissfully stuffing my face when suddenly she came through the back door.  I quickly crammed the half eaten tart in the little bag and slipped in under the edge of my chair.  I fear to report to you that my beloved and faithful dog Brodie ratted me out and started snuffling and scratching and instantly my wife knew what was up.  It was heart breaking and humiliating.  She sarcastically retrieved the half eaten tart and gave it to the dog...right in front of my eyes!<br /><br />Anyway, these things are the best.  I love them and dearly wish I could pig on them again.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
