You may think you like anchovies, but you've never had anchovies if you haven't had these.<br /><br />Packed in salt, these anchovies come to us from the famous Amalfi Coast of Italy. There's more delicious anchovy flavor in one of these than in ten of the usual canned/tinned anchovy fillets. We use them on pizza, in pasta with pesto, and anywhere else a bit (or a lot) of anchovy flavor is welcome. And a little bit goes a _long_ way.<br /><br />As you take them out of the jar, rinse them in cold water. They're already sliced open at the stomach, but unless you like your anchovies crunchier than we do, you'll want to finish the filleting job: cut off the heads and tails, slice them the rest of the way open, and carefully peel out their little fishy spines and ribs (and a couple bits of squidgy fish organ). You can also scrape off the scales if you like.<br /><br />Just be aware that because their flavor is so strong, it may take you a long time to use up a whole jar. Once the jar is open, use them as quickly as you can -- and you might want to consider storing some of them in smaller jars or other containers, covered with salt (or maybe olive oil) and tightly sealed. We're planning to divide our next jar into smaller portions and try freezing them.<br /><br />(EDIT: We did try freezing them in small batches; they kept fine for several months, but then they got soft and we didn't trust them any more. Probably they'd have been safer preserved in salt.)
