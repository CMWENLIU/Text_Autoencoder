We bought a bag of these after seeing our dog's reaction to the Zuke's Mini Naturals, and he can't get enough.  They are large pieces for a small dog (we have a 6 pound toy poodle), but he doesn't have any trouble with them because they're not stiff.  They are also very easy to break into small pieces with your hands if you're using them for training.  They actually smell good, like beef jerky.  Highly recommended.
