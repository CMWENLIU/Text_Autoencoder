I can't say enough about the Melitta line of coffees!  They are by far the best coffee I've ever made at home.  I typically by the "Buzzworthy" and fill my "to go" coffee cup twice (using my Melitta Coffee maker, one large cup and one small cup buttons).  It's perfectly diluted, but still strong.  My mom prefers this brand, "Love At First Sip".  It's a milder blend, but still VERY good, even when pressing the small cup button twice.<br /><br />These coffee blends taste like the gourmet coffee you buy in the trendy coffee houses.  You will LOVE these coffees!
