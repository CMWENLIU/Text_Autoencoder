The Trivedi water gives me a sense of well being vs. regular filtered water.  Also, I was having an allergic reaction that would have required an antihistamine, but within 3 gulps of the water the reaction completely stopped.  My plants love the water; they are greener and the Peace Lily gave me 3 blooms the very week of being fed the Trivedi water. Thank you Mr. Trivedi!
