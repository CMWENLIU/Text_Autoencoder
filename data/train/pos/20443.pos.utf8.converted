I love this product.  All I care about is my health, (breast cancer survivor). Yes, of course I have bits in between my teeth afterwards, so what. I have already recommended this product to two friends.  It does not bloat me out, it is zapped in a blender with almond milk, a banana, goji berries and a few strawberries and a bit of pineapple.<br /><br />I know that I am getting a good and healthy breakfast, plus I have lost a few pounds in the last two weeks as well.  I also have the hemp seeds and oil on a salad at lunchtime.<br /><br />Thank you Nutiva!
