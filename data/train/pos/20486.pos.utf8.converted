I won't even delve into the fact that this oatmeal is gluten free, because it doesn't matter. This is by far the best instant oatmeal I've ever tasted, and I've tasted them all. Take it from this died-in-the-wool oatmeal addict, you don't want your cupboard to be bare of this product. Forget the dried out packets that lurk in your grocery aisle, because they not only look but taste like cardboard. These oats have a higher moisture content already, and so they are naturally more plump in the bowl, and their taste is more consistent with long-cook-time oatmeal than any of their other counterparts. The added ingredients really are only the finest, and the taste proves it - raisins are yummy when plucked directly from the packet! I don't care for cooked bananas, but the banana oatmeal is just as delicious as my favorite maple flavor. The price is reasonable for this organic, gluten-free product. The taste is without parallel. This is a product I can recommend at the highest level without a single doubt or qualification!Glutenfreeda's Instant Oatmeal, Variety Pack Instant Oatmeal, 6-Oatmeal Packets (Pack of 8)
