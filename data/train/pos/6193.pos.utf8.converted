So far, our Cairn is happy with the purchase. He absolutely loves bully sticks, and we like the teeth cleaning factors they offer. Our dog is what we call a "Super Chewer". Once he gets a bully stick, he can't leave it alone until it's finished. With the Downtown Pet Supply bullies, it takes about one hour for our dog to chew it down to a 1-1/2" piece. Considering how much our dog loves to chew, I don't feel like the bully wears down too quick. We typically give our pup a break at the 30-minute mark so the bully lasts several days. We try to steer clear of giving him too much protein all at once.<br /><br />What we do like with the DPS bullies is the size. DPS claims they are 6" sticks and they don't disappoint. Out of the entire 18 pack, we didn't find one under 6 inches so they aren't skimping on product.<br /><br />In the past, we've bought the expensive bullies from Petco, but we feel these are by far the best value. For the most part, they don't stink too bad. We can't speak to the claim they are free range, but the good news is they don't reek like a barn full of bulls! What really matters is we will buy these again and couldn't find a reason to give them less than 5 stars!
