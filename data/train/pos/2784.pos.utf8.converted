Based on the reviews I tried these, and I LOVE them. I've tried the other ginger chews made by the ginger people, but these are far superior. I've had the ginger people chews for months and haven't come close to finishing the package. I've had the Reed's ginger candy for a couple of days and I've already finished my first pack. If you like ginger then you will really like these. I know it may be a splurge, but it's worth it. You get 20 packs with each package containing 10 individually wrapped candies. My only problem is going to be in pacing my consumption of this yummy treat.
