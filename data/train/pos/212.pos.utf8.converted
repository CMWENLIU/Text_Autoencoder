It must be true because it says so on the package: "America's Favorite Cake."<br /><br />I seem to remember a check box on the 2010 Census regarding cake preference, but I don't think I voted for Yellow Cake. I would have voted for Devil's Food Cake, although it may be politically incorrect these days to mention, you know, The Devil, so I may have voted for German Chocolate Cake, but Germany is, you know, the Old Europe, so I  may have voted for a chocolate cupcake. But without peanuts because so many people are now allergic to peanuts that they can't even serve 0.5 grams of salted nuts on airplanes. Sigh.<br /><br />Where was I? Hmmm? Oh, yes....<br /><br />I certainly would vote for Duncan Hines cake but I feel it should be mentioned that this is not cake.....yet. This is cake mix.<br /><br />Its sort of a cake fetus, or a cake stem cell. It still needs lots of development. You have to add additional ingredients and warmth and time to develop the mix into a cake. There is the promise of cake, but unless you follow the protocol written on the box very carefully, you may not get cake. Depending on what you do, you may get something very odd and rubbery or something very dark and charred.<br /><br />It's complicated!<br /><br />Amazon has allowed third-party vendors to offer Duncan Hines Cake Mixes for sale for quite some time. An example of this is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IMS5K">Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Layer Cake Mix 18.25 oz - 6 Unit Pack</a>. Amazon, being a very clever retailer, has obviously read the numerous, highly enthusiastic customer reviews for this product, and has now started selling these products directly to its customers, so many of whom must be begging for a six pack of a product readily available in any supermarket or convenience store.<br /><br />In order to enhance customer demand, Amazon's copywriters have outdone themselves listing this product's outstanding features:<br /><br />-Pack of six, 16.5 18.25 ounces each (now 1.75 oz. lighter!)<br />-The moistest, most delicious<br />-A special treat for the special people<br /><br />Of course, "the special people" must be those who voted for Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. That's why it's "America's Favorite Cake". Makes perfect sense. This is a Democracy! This is a great country and this is great cake mix!<br /><br />Another thing you should know is that you get six boxes of cake mix. This is enough mix to incubate a very, very big sheet cake that would require a very, very large incubator or oven. You could also prepare a tall 12 layer cake which would kind of look like a miniature version of the Coit Tower in San Francisco. Certainly enough "the moistest, most delicious" yellow cake for a very large number of "the special people".<br /><br />Finally, a charming aspect is that on the very same page as this product, Amazon suggests "Customers Who Bought This Product Also Bought": Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes, Refills, Case of 4 / 84s (336 ct). Obviously, "the special people" anticipate getting down with this cake. Six boxes of cake mix is bound to make a mess in the kitchen and later on, there will be cake crumbs on lips and chins and fingers.<br /><br />A few Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Wipes could come in handy!<br /><br />Smart!
