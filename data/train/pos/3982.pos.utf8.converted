I like a good cup of Joe and when our friends turned us on to Kona coffee we were instant fans.  But the cost was killing us.  So when I saw that Amazon had their new grocery line I was on it checking out their price.  This is a great cup of Kona for the price.  I hate bitter coffee - this is smooth.
