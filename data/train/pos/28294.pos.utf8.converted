I am not an expert pizza maker by any means but I have heard about the great results from using this "00" flour. I followed the "perfect pizza dough" recipe and was very impressed with the awesome thin - slightly chewy pizza crust I made using dough from this "00" flour. The flour makes a thinner more Naples style crust. This flour rocks compared with standard AP flour. Highly recommened for Naples thin crust pizza's - My pizza crust was similar to a Grimaldi's Brooklyn pizza - ENJOY !!
