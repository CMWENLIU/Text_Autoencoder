This tea is the best energy drink I have tried!  The flavor could be described as "earthy," and may take some getting used to for some people, but with a little added sweetener it would be pretty good.  I prefer it plain. I have tried the regular yerba mate, but the "Pure Endurance" far surpasses that one as far as giving me good energy.  It puts me in a very good mood. It's worth every penny as far as I'm concerned!
