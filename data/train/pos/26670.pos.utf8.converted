This is, by far, the best pb made. I can only get the 'creamy' honey roasted by Skippy where I live. Makes no sense to me. I've even asked the Von's I shop to please stock this item with no luck. I'm with the other reviewers. It's so worth it to buy it online. No other pb tastes this good. Try it once, and you'll be hooked!
