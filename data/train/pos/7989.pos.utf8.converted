Wow! I love this coconut oil! I have read about the wonders of coconut oil (increases metabolism, antiviral/antifungal/antibacterial properties, etc) and decided to start adding it to my daily diet. This brand is superb -- taste soooooo good and smells divine. I have used it on my toast and it could easily replace butter because the taste is buttery smooth and with very slight sweetness. The smell is not overwhelming and it's just very mild.<br />Another plus is the price -- such a great deal for 32 ounces! I have looked around at different online and local stores for high quality coconut oil and the price cannot touch this, the only thing cheaper would be the low quality, rancid-smelling coconut oil being sold at local stores.<br />Coconut oil will melt at 76 degrees, so I kept mine in the refrigerator to keep it solid.  I've also used this as a moisturizer for my itchy and dry spots and works like a charm, easily melts when applied. I've divided mine for kitchen and body use -- simply wonderful!<br />Highly recommended!
