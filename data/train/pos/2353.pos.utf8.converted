I received this tree this week.  I have purchased Bonsai trees from other online vendors, but none have compared to this starting with the packing of the tree, you could tell it was packed with great care, it arrived in perfect shape.  The tree is healthy and beautiful, far more beautiful than the picture shown on Amazon. The tree has a wonderful aroma, it smells like your in a forest, on a fall morning.<br />I could tell it was healthy immediately.  Sometimes when you order things on line your disappointed, but not enough to go through the trouble of sending the item back.  The minute I saw this tree I had wished I had ordered more.  I will order other items from this company, I hope they are as fine as this purchase was.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGG22">Brussel's Dawn Redwood Outdoor Bonsai Tree</a>
