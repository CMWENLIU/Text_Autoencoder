I have tried several organic baking premixes. By far, this is the best. Follow the directions and the end product is terrific. What is really terrific about it, is that you can use this mix as a starting point and make some minor modifications to turbo charge the recipe. I use butter instead of oil. I also use two egg whites whipped into soft peaks.<br />I add two tablespoons of natural vanilla extract. You could add more chocolate. Just melt some bitter sweet chocolate (melted) into the liquid ingredients.<br /><br />After I have mixed the wet and dry ingredients, I gently fold in the two whipped egg whites. This adds more rise to the cake and makes it more tender.<br /><br />I do use commercial canned frosting, but you could make your own.<br /><br />You could feed this to your kids for breakfast. Honest. Think about it. If you use organic eggs, organic milk, organic butter...you have a real breakfast treat. Much better than a chocolate chip store bought muffing.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6IDY">Arrowhead Mills Chocolate Cake Mix Organic, 18.6 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>
