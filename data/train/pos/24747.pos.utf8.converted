I've been drinking Ruby Red Grapefruit almost everyday for years and I never get tired of the taste.  It's tart and tangy and just sweet enough.  I love real grapefruit juice but can't drink it with my medication so this is a great substitute and at only 5 calories per serving, it's guilt-free.  Kudos to Amazon for carrying this great drink, since my local stores no longer have it.
