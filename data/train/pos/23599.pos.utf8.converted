Some of the other Yogi green teas, like the one with echinacea, taste kind of bad to me, but I really like the antioxidant one. Not sure if it's actually anti-aging...that's a pretty bold claim...but it's nice! Mildly caffeinated so it gives me some energy without making me wired. And it's good plain or with milk or even milk and sugar, if you want to make it more like a dessert.
