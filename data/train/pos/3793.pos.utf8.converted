I like to keep a bottle in my purse so I can order water in restaurants. We live near the beach, so the water is pretty bad. This stuff is wonderful.<br /><br />It does say to refrigerate "for freshness", but as far as I can tell that just means to keep the flavor strong. Usually after 6 months or so the flavor won't be as strong but I don't mind buying a new bottle a few times a year.
