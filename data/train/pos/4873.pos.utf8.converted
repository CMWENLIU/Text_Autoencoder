My kitties, that is, when I bring out the catnip! All I have to do is make one tiny sound of my roll-down desk board and they come running--from anywhere! How they hear one crack of that unroll and know it is catnip time, I don't know, but fun, fun, fun is about to begin!<br /><br />Roll, rub, twist, and again, roll, rub, twist. Relax. Push each other off the double scratching pad where I sprinkle the catnip. Two kitties vie for their dose of catnip om, or wherever they go. Munch, munch, then roll again.<br /><br />I'm such their goddess for bringing on such delight. What little to make so much happiness. Crazy Kitty Catnip! Ahhhhhh.
