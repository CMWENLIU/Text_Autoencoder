I've been a chocoholic for about 50 years. I've tried every brand at every percentage level. I've traveled all over the world and tried the best foreign brands. Hands down Ghirardelli is the best! It wins professional taste testings consistantly and has the deepest most complex chocolate flavor. I buy this by the case and eat a piece everyday and never tire of it's intense rich taste. And I am most proud that this world class chocolate is from my home city of San Francisco.
