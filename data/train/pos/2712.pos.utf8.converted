I had my first ramen noodles when I was about 12.  A family from down south moved close by and I became friends with their son.  One night I had dinner with them and unknowingly was eating ramen noodles (we called them worms).  They were the super cheap kind you'd find in most American stores.  That night was also the first (and only) time I'd eaten ribs, which was a traumatic experience (I hated bones in my food).  I didn't really eat ramen much until late high school and college years after that.  I still only knew this as worm noodles until I started buying my own food.  That's when I learned what ramen really was.  I really enjoyed the stuff Campbell's or whoever had with the line of baked ramen.  I ate that stuff like crazy.  Today, I'm a vegetarian so much of the ramen in stores is not for me.  I used to buy the mushroom kind just for the noodles and instead of using the sodium packet I'd put a little butter and dash of salt and pepper.  But I haven't really done that since the baked ramen was discontinued.  The other day I decided to search Amazon for vegetarian ramen and discovered this stuff from Koyo.  I wasn't familiar with the company but the reviews were decent.  I especially liked the part of being vegetarian friendly.  So I bought a case and was eager for its arrival.  The first thing I noticed was the nutritional label.  There was only 193 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 0.5 gram saturated fat in a brick of noodles.  I was surprised because I was expecting something like 6 to 8 grams of fat like the stuff on most supermarket shelves.  I also noticed it said it was a product of China but then realize I was eating ramen after all.  That's like not buying Mandarin orange because they're from China.  I had my first bowl of it which I used half of a packet of flavoring with.  It was very good and I was happy.  I've since been altering between the half of a seasoning packet (which is loaded with sodium just like the cheap ramen) or the butter/salt/pepper mix.  I prefer the latter but the former is no doubt good too.  I wasn't half way through that first box of Koyo ramen before I had three more cases on the way.  Now my cabinets are stocked full of Koyo ramen.
