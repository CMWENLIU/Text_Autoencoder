I have a 12 yr old lab who for the last five years or so has had hot spots, ear infections, a dull, thinning, coarse coat with constant shedding, hot spots and episodic vomiting. I tried IAMS, Eukanuba and other high priced foods. The vet said cook eggs, boil hamburg, try hypo-allergenic shampoos, even steroids. No change. I fell upon this at Walmart and began using it 8 months ago. She looks great! Her coat especially is thick & soft & huggable. No more hot spots, no ear problems, and she's even welcome in our bed again. The only time she vomits is when I cheat and give her table foods. I even think her hearing is improved.
