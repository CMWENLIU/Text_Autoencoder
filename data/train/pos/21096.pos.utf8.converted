Absolutely great taste. 100% Natural, no other additives, just dry roasted almonds. Great source of protein (7g per serving), healthy fats (10g of monounsaturated and 4g of polyunsaturated), 4g of fiber, only 2g of sugar, 0mg of sodium, 180 cal per 2 tablespoons. I like it more than peanut butter, great with celery, great with flat bread and high fiber crackers, great on whole wheat toast, perfect on top of slice of an apple. However, price of this product on Amazon is 3 times the price you pay at Costco (only $5.69 there).
