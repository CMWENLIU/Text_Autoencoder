I originally tried Wild Planet tuna back in 2006 when Amazon carried their "minimal mercury" products, and I was extremely impressed by the taste and the quality of the tuna.  I was never a fan of tuna in the past, but I thought their canned tuna was outstanding.  They stopped selling tuna with the "minimal mercury" label, and I drifted away from buying tuna until recently.  I decided to try Wild Planet again.  I don't know if their "low mercury" label is any different or perhaps the standard definitions have changed, but the online discussions make be believe that the mercury content in this product is really quite low.<br /><br />The taste is still excellent, and I'm happy to see that the product is still like it was over three years ago - in that the chunks of tuna are large and nothing is added (besides salt in some versions).  The natural juices from the fish keep it very moist and taste great.<br /><br />I also believe that their fishing practices are more sustainable and have less collateral damage (i.e. killing other animals) than other methods.  That makes me feel much better about buying their products.  Few things make me as upset as needless death or outright cruelty, and so while I enjoy eating meat and seafood, I look for people and brands that strive to avoid those things.
