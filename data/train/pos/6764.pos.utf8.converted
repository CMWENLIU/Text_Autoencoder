I don't have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that's another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat.  With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc.  Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn't similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds.  Annie's does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese.  What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac & cheese I have ever had.  Also, it's real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.<br /><br />For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):<br /><br />Kraft Mac & Cheese:<br />Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.<br /><br />Annie's Rice Pasta & Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.<br /><br />*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.<br /><br />Annie's also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.<br /><br />Also, Annie's does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it's a deluxe box.  This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there.  It's the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker.  Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn't as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta & Cheddar.  But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn't ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta.  I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake.  My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn't do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)<br /><br />It's a bit more pricey, I'll give you that.  But for a hint - do check Target occasionally.  They sell Annie's pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta & Cheddar for $1 a box!)  If only the prices were always so kind;)
