Boy, this is the way to use pectin!  If you're like me, and are a canner of jams and jellies, you dislike the obscene amounts of sugar required when you use regular pectins - it's just nuts.  You may also object to the high price of the stuff, and the fact that you can't use less (or more!) pectin than the recipe calls for - and then your efforts may -or may not- be successful - regular pectin is touchy stuff!<br /><br />Well, if you are annoyed by the same pectin issues as I, this stuff is the answer.  Make as little or as much jam or jelly as you wish - and never worry about whether it will work or not - this is stable stuff - use the right amount, and your results will always be the same.  Really, this stuff will change the way you do canning!<br /><br />If you buy it in bulk, the cost will be much less than regular pectin - and it has a long shelf life too.  I don't know why I waited so long to try it.
