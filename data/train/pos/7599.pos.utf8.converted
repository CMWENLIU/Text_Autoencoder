It has a slight coconut taste, but not overpowering.  I originally first tried the stuff at Walmart, and it had no flavor to it at all, very bland.<br /><br />To combat some of the poor reviews I read on this oil, I think a lot of those are just due to people not doing their research before buying, and thus they're just being snippity pickeys.  Obviously since it has a coconut taste, you may not want to use it for all your cooking needs.  When I cook Italian foods, I use olive oil.  When making something like mayonaise, I use canola oil.  A little common sense doesn't hurt most folks.  (It tastes great on toast with a little cinnamon sprinkled on it.)<br /><br />As for it being hard as a rock....I haven't noticed that.  Scoops out very easily. But again, a little research, and you'll find that it is a solid until the temperature reaches approximately 76-78
