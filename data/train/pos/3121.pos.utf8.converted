I love this tea. I found it by accident at a grocery store near me while i was searching for "Wild sweet orange". The minute I openned the packet I smell a rose scent similar to that found with Rose essential oil.  (not the scent of rosewater, not the cloying scent of rose perfume nor even the perfumey sweetness of fresh roses, but a scent that is the true essence of roses.) The fragrance flooded me with pleasant memories. I see one reviewer didn't like it. I guess it is not for everyone. I love it. It is truly unique. I have never had a tea like this. After finishing half a box in 3 days, I have been in search of somewhere else to buy it.<br /><br />The tea itself is more subtle than the aromatics that are released when the packet is openned. That is much harder to discribe . slight smell of rose with a hint of woodiness. It is more subtle than a lot of their teas. Too bad everyone can't try a sample before committing to an entire box.<br /><br />Edit 12/12/10 OK maybe it is not so much the roses that give the strong scent. maybe it is the geranium oil. Whatever it is, it reminds me of a spa not a chinese herbalist.
