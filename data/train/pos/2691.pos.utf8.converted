I saw the advertisements for these Kashi Bars on the back of my cereal boxes and knew I had to try them.<br /><br />I decided to buy one of each flavors at my local grocery store before I buy a pack of 12 here on amazon. In my opinion, the Chocolate Turtle ones are the best tasting and closest to an actually candy bar.<br /><br />The toasted pecans on the outside are what makes this bar my favorite. And its good for you health wise!! 6g of Fiber and 12g of Protein.<br /><br />Total Fat = 5g = 8%<br /><br />Sat. Fat = 1.5g = 8%<br /><br />Trans Fat = 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol = 0mg<br /><br />Sodium = 200mg = 8%<br /><br />Potassium = 60mg = 2%<br /><br />Total Carb. = 28g = 9%<br /><br />Fiber = 6g = 24%<br /><br />Soluble Fiber 3g<br /><br />Insoluble Fiber 3g<br /><br />Sugars 14g<br /><br />Protein = 12g = 20%<br /><br />190 Calories<br /><br />Everything based on a 2000 Calorie Diet, just so you guys know. Finally, no High Fructose Corn Syrup or Partially Hydrogenated Oils. Can't go wrong!!!!  My local grocery store charges $1.79 for each of these, so great deal here.<br /><br />Hope that helps and enjoy!!!!!
