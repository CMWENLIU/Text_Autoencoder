Great Product. I have one jar in the kitchen. It doesn't spoil so one less thing in the fridge. I use it as a high heat oil for saute veggies. It works well and leaves a very light coconut flavor.<br /><br />The other jar is in my bathroom. I use it on my skin instead of body lotion. Best ever! A little goes a long way. Can also be used on your hair - condition with some oil, then wash and rinse.<br /><br />I love it
