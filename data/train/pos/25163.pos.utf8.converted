My wife and I love strawberry cereals. We have tried every single strawberry cereal with flakes on the market. Our favorite used to be 'Kellogg's Special K Red Berries' cereal but after trying 'FlaxPlus Red Berry Crunch' by Nature's Path, we our hooked! There are a number of things that make this cereal great. First is the abundance of berries: strawberries and raspberries. Now I am not a huge fan of raspberries but the combination with the strawberries really enhances the flavor. I really enjoy the fact that it's not just flakes but also oats and flax seeds. It really gives a more wholesome and full taste.<br /><br />So not only does this cereal taste great, but it's also certified organic. We also tried another organic cereal by Kashi called Strawberry Fields. We still prefer FlaxPlus Red Berry Crunch because the Kashi cereal's flakes are just too crunchy and don't absorb milk really well. It makes the whole cereal much too crunchy, plus it doesn't taste as "full" as Nature's Path because it just has flakes and not the added bonus of oats and multiple grains including: whole wheat meal, rolled oats, wheat bran, brown rice flour, oat bran, etc.
