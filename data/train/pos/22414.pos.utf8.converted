I was a Veterinary Technician for 12 years and my Vets have recommended this food to me for my own dogs. The Vets I worked for don't sell dog food like a lot of Vets do and this is the food they fed their own personal dogs. My dog has been on it his entire life (10 years old), he was on the puppy formula as a pup, then adult formula from 1-8 years old, and now he's on the senior formula which adds Glucosamine/Chondroiton in the food. He truly is the picture of health. He's a Yellow Labrador and he's in remarkably great physical condition, he even jogs 5 miles a day with me every single day. I have never had any problems with this food and my dog loves it. I love their ingredients (Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Salmon, etc.) most of which is their first ingredients and their quality is second to none, can't beat it for the price.
