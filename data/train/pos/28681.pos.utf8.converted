Our little 15 pounder, AbiGirl the wonder BOM (beagle/pomeranian), is a VERY picky eater, and we search the world over for quality ingredients that have added nutritional value. While they might seem pricey, you get what you pay for- We feel the value is fair for the quality of the product. We'd rather feed quality raw foods to keep her healthy- because health is priceless... Stella and Chewy's understands the importance of a raw diet that is easy to handle and dispense... these little freeze dried steaks make AWESOME treats if broken into pieces, as well as a nice easy dinner if served whole. Terrific for traveling, convenient, really nutritious, and - most importantly- Abi loves them... no turned up nose EVER when we hand her a Stella and Chewy's steak!
