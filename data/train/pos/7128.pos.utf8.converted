I am so glad I bought these.  With an online coupon and subscribing, the price was comparable to what I would pay per bag of regular pasta Rotelli at the store but these are organic and have more flavor.  I love having the bulk box, as whenever I need to make a quick dinner for my kids, I know that I can always use these.  My kids favorite dish is a pasta mixture but many times in the past they've asked me to make it and I couldn't without making a trip to the store.
