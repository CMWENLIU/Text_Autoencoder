I was looking for a night time snack for myself that would satisfy my sugar cravings but not have a ton of calories.  Well this certainly fit the bill.<br /><br />These are so good and the small bags are just the right size.  Yes I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting but that kind of defeats the purpose.  But because these are low in calorie I don't feel guilty if I eat two packs.<br /><br />I didn't even look at expiration dates since I don't care and they're not going to last the month.<br /><br />I do wish they had this in all chocolate but the cinnamon is really good also.<br /><br />I'm really glad I got in on the subscribe and save before they closed it but the price went up.  I saw K-mart has these for $5.99/box which is better but it's worth it to have them delivered.  I don't know why the price hike.<br /><br />All I can say is Yum Yum!
