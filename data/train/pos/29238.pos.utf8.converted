I'm a self-professed popcorn junkie, and am pretty much addicted to the stuff.  Over the years, I've tried a lot of different popcorn; from microwave popcorn, to air-popped.  A little over a year ago, I happened across the "Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper" here on Amazon.  Very cool gadget, let me tell ya!  Since then, I've been on a quest for the perfect popcorn to compliment the Whirley Pop.  As I get older, I'm beginning to appreciate the more "natural" popcorn varieties, and I suppose that's what attracted me to the Arrowhead Mills Organic Yellow Popcorn.<br /><br />I'm no "organic" food expert.  I just wanted some good tasting popcorn.  And, I feel like that's what I got.  Using the Whirley Pop, with a very small amount of oil, I've had great results.  I was concerned by some of the reviews stating they were seeing a substantial number of unpopped kernels.  This hasn't been my experience to-date.  I'd say the pop-rate is on par or better than any other variety of corn I've tried.<br /><br />As for taste, it tastes like what you'd think "plain" popcorn should taste like.  Light, fluffy, and very good.  I think, perhaps, a lot of folks associate "natural" popcorn with air-popped popcorn, and I don't know that that's a fair comparison.  Air-popped popcorn has always tasted sort of...rubbery, to me.  Using the Whirly-pop, you still get that great popcorn "CRUNCH", but without the extra fat, salt, and who know's what is added to microwave popcorns.<br /><br />Perhaps that's the beauty of Arrowhead Mills popcorn.  All natural out of the box.  The sky is the limit when it comes to "fancying" it up.  Want butter, and salt?  No problem!  Prefer your popcorn plain?  Easy as pie.  The point is, you are in total control of what, if anything, is added to your popcorn.  As someone who likes to occasionally indulge in some *real* butter on my popcorn, this is a nice change of pace as compared to the sickly "butter" that many big-name manufactures use.<br /><br />Give this stuff a try.  For the money, I think it's a good, healthy choice.
