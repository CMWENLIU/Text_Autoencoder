I had originally bought this product for hot coffee, but I heard that it dissolves in cold water and since I love iced coffee I thought I'd give it a try.  It works great for iced coffee and I no longer have to spend money on mediocre iced coffee from coffee shops.<br /><br />I just put about a tablespoon of the espresso powder in a cup and add about 12 ounces of cold water.  After stirring for a minute or two, the espresso dissolves perfectly.  I add a little liquid creamer (I like to use the flavored kind so I don't have to sweeten), stir, and I have the most delicious (and easiest!) iced coffee ever.  I keep a jar of this at work and make it at the water cooler.  You may want to adjust the amounts of espresso, water, and creamer for your taste.
