I first had this tea at a convention several years ago and took a few samples, Then my mother-in-law ordered it for me for Christmas. And now I am ordering for myself. Its really smooth and light tasting and fruity and much better then the Herbal Lipton that I purchased by mistake. This one is really good and I make it each night before bed. You can also put a little Splenda or Honey in it as well. I tend to drink it plain, but sometimes I add the Honey or the Splenda. Enjoy !!!
