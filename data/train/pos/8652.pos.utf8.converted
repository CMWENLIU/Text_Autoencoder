This is the irst bottle of hempseed oil I ever purchased after hearing about the health benefits of it on tv. It seems like a good price for the amount you get and the taste of this oil is delicious. Something I really like about this Nutiva hempseed oil is the bottle they send it in. Its basically spill proof. You can turn the bottle upside down, hold it over a spoon, and nothing will come out until you squeeze the bottle. You have incredibly fine control over the amount you wish to get out of the bottle. After having just purchased a bottle of flax seed oil which pours straight down the side of the bottle instead of onto the spoon like it is supposed to, I was very impressed with this product. Both the taste and spill-proof bottle design are great.
