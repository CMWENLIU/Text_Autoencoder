I've been buying various brands of tahini for decades, and this stuff is by far the best tasting I've ever found.  It's delicious even before adding anything.<br /><br />In shipping, one bottle developed a crack and leaked tahini all over the other bottles, as well as the box it was in.  Tahini being what it is, the result was quite a spectacular mess! However, as soon as I informed Amazon they immediately overnighted a replacement shipment.  And with some cleanup the three other bottles were fine. :)<br /><br />Gotta love that.
