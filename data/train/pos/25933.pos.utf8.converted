At first I substituted only a dash, perhaps 1:5 (Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix:Flour) in a recipe. I was worried the mix would change the outcome. Now, unless making something like a light fluffy cake, I make a 100% substitution. Great for casseroles, corn bread, home made granola bars (my repetoire). Great purchase.
