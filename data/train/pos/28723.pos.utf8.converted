My baby, Ryan, was born with a heart defect that required major surgery to correct. The doctor that performed his surgery recommended I mix formula with breast milk to suppliment his caloric intake. The hospital started him on Infamil but he didn't like it and spit up a lot. I started using Nestle Good Start With Natural Cultures when my baby was around one month old. I have never had a problem with the formula not mixing up well, but I always use filtered water that is room temperature or above. My baby has thrived on this formula and is so healthy the doctors can hardly believe it. Usually children born with heart problems have trouble gaining weight and are more prone to being sick; that has not been the case with my child, Ryan. He is 6 months old and is 19lbs, 28" tall, and  very strong and healthy.
