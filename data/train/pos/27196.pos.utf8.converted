I love these quinoa flakes...they are relatively easy to make (I just cook them in the microwave.  They have a very unique, kind of nutty taste (I guess like quinoa) and can be made thick or thin.  It has the texture of grits or cream of wheat and, like quinoa, is a great source of protein...and it's gluten free.  I have served this for friends at a brunch and they loved it.  I sometimes put warmed fruit (microwaved frozen berries) in it...and it is a great treat.  Highly recommended and a great deal.  Also, the boxes came with a very long shelf life, but I am sure that they will be gobbled up fairly soon.
