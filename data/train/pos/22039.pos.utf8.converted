These bars are delicious and as a vegan it is difficult for me to find energy bars that I can say that about.  I understand other's concerns about the product being manufactured in China, but we have been mass consuming products from China for decades.  I think their time would be better spent consdering the damage to our envoironment created by consuming animal products that are produced here in the US.  Animal welfare and methane gas emissions in this country is less of a concern in general that nuts that come from China?  I don't get it!!!!!  Try these bars, they are amazing, you will not be disappointed!
