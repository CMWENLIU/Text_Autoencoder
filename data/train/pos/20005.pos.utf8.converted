I've eaten one full box of these and didn't experience a single bit of stem. Maybe because these golden raisins are moister and tenderer than the dark ones, the stems separate more readily in processing. These are a little sweeter than raisins I'm used to eating, but with a slightly less distinct flavor. I hope my first box was typical . . . they are delightful to eat by the fistful.
