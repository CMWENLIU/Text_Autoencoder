Navitas notes that their Maca is slow dried and not irradiated.  The product arrived to my mailbox in perfect condition within a few days of my order.  The powder comes in a resealable package.  The flavor isn't bad at all - a little pungent (kinda like dried yams).  I noted increased energy almost immediately but will have to give it a few weeks to rule out a "placebo effect" or other variables that might be at play.
