I like this product and love inventing new ways of using it.  I make some wonderful dip with it and the cat and dog love it cut into small cubes and given as treats.  The only problem I have is the price.  I cannot believe I am paying this much for this stuff!  I cannot give this product less than five stars because I do like it and use it, but who ever is the cause of the price being so high should be horse whipped.
