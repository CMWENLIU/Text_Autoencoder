I love nuts and dark chocolate, so for me this was a no brainer. These aren't big enough for a meal replacement for me personally, but for some dieting or trying to do whats right and eat a breakfast in a hurry these are a great option. If you still eating those chewy granola bars, don't you think it time for an adult bar? The taste on this is great as you get the crunch from the nuts, the sweet and smooth from the chocolate, and sweets favorite companion salty. The only negative thing I could say is these do cost a good bit, but in my opinion it is worth it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Natural ingredients<br />-Minimal sugar<br />-Great taste<br />-Healthy fat, protein and fiber<br /><br />Con:<br />-Cost<br />-Not filling enough for a meal replacement.<br /><br />Overall five stars as it is a great product and I will continue to use it as a morning snack.
