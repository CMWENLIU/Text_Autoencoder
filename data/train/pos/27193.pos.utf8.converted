Whether you are diabetic, eating low carb, or just want great pasta, this product is perfect in every way.  I have served dreamfields pasta to over twenty people, told them I was trying a new brand of pasta, and asked them what they thought.  Every last person said it was wonderful, and not one person guessed that it was not "regular" pasta.  Most said it was better than the pasta they use.  Try it...you'll love it.
