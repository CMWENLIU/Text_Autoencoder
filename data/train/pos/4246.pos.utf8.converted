Fleur de Sel gives more intensity to salad dressings and is the moist, caviar of salt that is hand raked from the surface of salt ponds on the coast of France during July and August. You will need a mortar and pestle to grind the salt if you use it in recipes, but it is so worth your time.<br /><br />This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste in comparison to this highly prized salt.<br /><br />French chefs have known this secret forever and when I found this salt, I told everyone I knew about the flavor. Sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />Want to taste the best caramels ever? Look for Fleur de Sel Caramels. They will not last long.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
