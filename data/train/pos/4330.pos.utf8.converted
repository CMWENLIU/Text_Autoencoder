I can drink a couple of these a day! I am glad the 17oz comes with a cap.  Easier to store them once you open a pack.  I've ordered VitaCoco, One and Zico.  I find VitaCoco brand to have the best flavor.  Best served chilled.<br />I bought three cases of these on Fri and it was at my door step today (Monday) with my prime account.  Had a problem with one of the box.  Upon opening the amazon box, I see that one of the case was already opened and few of packs were damaged and leaking.  I called Amazon right away and they resolved it right away.<br />As the title says, great product and great service! thanks amazon.
