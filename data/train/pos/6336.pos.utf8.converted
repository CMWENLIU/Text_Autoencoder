AMAZING! On my skin, it's like heaven! On my hair, (I have very dry, relaxed hair) it was AMAZING! prevents breakage and is a great deep conditioner or you can mix it in with other conditioners! Also, its quite yummy! Make sure to always go ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN! My mother bought another type of Virgin Coconut oil from a store and it was NOT the same. I don't really like writing reviews but I just HAD to do this one!
