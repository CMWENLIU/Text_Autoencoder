I tried some cooking with this but my kids didn't care for it, but just because the cooking thing didn't work out I surely did not throw this away! This is by far the best coconut oil I have been able to find and cooking is the very least important thing on my list!<br /><br />Our 3 year old son suffers from Eczema and this stuff is like a wonder oil!! I cover him from head to toe when he gets out of the bath. He smells lovely and it keeps his Eczema under control much better than any other (including perscription) lotions and meds ever have!!! That is a reason to have it forever right there.<br /><br />I use it for shaving my legs! It is amazing for this. I apply it to my legs before I get in the shower, get in, shave them and ohhh la la! No razor burn, no bumps, and oh so soft! It works so wonderful.<br />I also use it as hand cream when my hands are dry, eye makeup remover, and lip balm.<br /><br />There are so many uses! I highly recommend this product to everyone!!!
