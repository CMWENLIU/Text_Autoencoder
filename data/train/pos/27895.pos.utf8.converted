I had bought some roasted teriyaki seaweed from the asian food grocer, and because amazon has fast shipping I decided to see if there was some here. Well, there is and it is delicious. You get a lot of seaweed in this thing; 100 packs in each bottle, and each pack has 5 pieces of seaweed. The seaweed had a crisp, thin texture and taste like teriyaki. It smells like fish, but honestly its not a bad smell and is to be expected since it is seaweed.
