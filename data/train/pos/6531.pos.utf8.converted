Cardia Salt is the best thing I've done for myself in years! And it's delicious!! Over the last 3 months I've lost weight, am not bloated and feel great - and the only dietary change I've made is switching to Cardia Salt. I use it for everything. It's delicious - and I'm a salt freak - salting cream cheese and toast and cheesecake for example. My friends would give me flavored and exotic salts for Christmas. Now cardia salt is all I use. I filled my salt dish with it and use it for cooking and all salt uses.<br /><br />I discovered Cardia Salt in a New York Times article that stated that it's not the sodium that's bad for you, it's when the sodium/potassium ratio gets out of whack, and that in the US we use way too much salt and get far too little potassium, which is in all whole foods, but not in processed foods we eat too much of. In Finland they call it Pan Salt, and I read in the Times article that they put the whole country of Finland on Pan Salt and reduced their cardiac disease by 60%!!!<br /><br />Try Cardia Salt, you will love it. Be sure to take a kelp pill to get your iodine.<br /><br />A note to the manufacturers - please package it in bulk like sugar or salt instead of the individual little shakers that are hard to break into. You'd save a bundle on packaging and customers would be less frustrated trying to open the shakers.<br />Cardia Salt (3-Pack)Cardia Salt (6-Pack)
