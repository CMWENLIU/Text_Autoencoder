I purchased this item to spruce up my desk and bring a little life to my office.<br /><br />I was QUITE impressed with the shipping. I thought since the item was coming from a vendor outside of Amazon, it would take longer to get here. However the item was shipped and delivered within a few days.<br /><br />The item came in a small box, well wrapped and secured. There was no mess opening the package and the tree was carefully protected inside the box. Along with the tree came instructions on how to care for the tree.<br /><br />If you're going to buy a Bonzai tree, get this one!! I was impressed with the company, expediency, and care of the tree. I have had it for several months now and it is healthy and growing!
