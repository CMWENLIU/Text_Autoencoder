Ok, i'm not really sure about that one. In January I adopted my very first cat. I haven't had one since I was 10! This is mainly due to living in apartments and allergies. My cat is a 2 1/2 year old Maine Coon. It's REALLY fat and weighs about 14lbs. He has a belly that hangs down to the floor almost.<br /><br />After hearing about all those bad pet foods a few years back, I did some research into what pet foods were the best. Decided to try this. I'll admit that it's NOT cheap at all, but it doesn't bother me. Why? It costs me the amazon price, but one bag can last me months!<br /><br />I did some research into weight loss for cats and tried to feed him the correct amount, but unfortunately after nearly a year, he hasn't lost any weight on this food. I think he just doesn't get enough exercise. He does have a ton of energy and is always running around it seems, but he still likes to sleep a LOT. Due to this food (i'd imagine) his fur is shiny and soft. Other than the weight problem he seems like a healthy cat.<br /><br />Sadly, I had to switch pet foods. This might sound really silly and gross to admit, but this food makes his poo extremely stinky! It stinks up the entire house when he "goes". No cat litter on earth will stop it. I've tried different litters and boxes, not even thinking it was the food. It most definitely was. I clear the litter box every single day, but being "bombed out" is not fun. Somedays it really made me ALMOST not want a cat!<br /><br />I switched to Wellness Healthy Weight Cat Food (which seems even more expensive) and the problem went away.<br /><br />I also did a taste test on my cat. I sat out a bowl of EVO and Wellness Cat foods and he preferred the wellness brand. He actually told me this. Seriously though, he would eat the Wellness, take a few bites of the EVO and then leave it alone. This doesn't really mean anything. The best tasting cat food is not always the best for a cat.<br /><br />The EVO food is probably of a higher quality, but i'm not sure. I'd imagine either brand is good.
