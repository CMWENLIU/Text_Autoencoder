When I first received my order I was a little disappointed with the barley size, they all kind of small.  But after I cooked it, the size actually doesn't matter.  I ususlly make barley soup or mix with rice.  It's good for making risotto too.  When I cook it with rice, I take 3cups of rice, 1cup of barley and use water for cooking 4cups of rice, set my rice cooker for at least 2~3 hours timer.  The taste is great and I love the texture of barley.  My kids will eat this rice mix without complain.  It gives you a lot more fiber compares with just eating rice. I keep my barley in freezer.
