I bought these as soon as I saw them, because organic candy is rare and scarce.  I wasn't sure on the taste, but as soon as I ate them, I was blown away.  They are so delicious!  I love it when they are "harder" and chewier.  These are the best gummy bears I've ever tasted period.  I am so glad that this company exists!  Family loves these as well, and the bags don't last long in our household.  Love them!
