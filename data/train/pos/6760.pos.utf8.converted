This has become one of my favorite teas for afterdinner.  I've never been a big fan of tea until I traveled through parts of asia.  One of the best parts of this tea is the aroma from the roasted brown rice.  It's a very subtle tea with a nutty flavor (roasted brown rice).  Definitely not a sweet tea, nor is it bitter.  Just so people don't get this confused.  This is not a soup.  Don't expect to be "eating" anything.  Just steep it up and enjoy.
