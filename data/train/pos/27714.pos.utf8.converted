My hope is that someday amazon starts adding the ingredients to these products.  I hate having to search to find the info so I can figure out if the product has something I can't eat, so here is the ingredient list:<br /><br />Enriched Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflaving, folic acid), Corn Flour, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate), Malt Powder, Salt, Sugar, Buttermilk, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />CONTAINS: WHEAT AND MILK.<br /><br />ALright, now that that is out of the way, these are great, and easy to make, you just add butter, eggs and water for waffles (I've not tried it for pancakes).  You can also halve the recipe on the container to make a half batch, which is nice when you aren't feeding a whole family.<br /><br />The texture and flavor are excellent for something that mixes together so quickly (2 minutes tops), and the picky eaters in my house love eating these, including the super picky toddler.<br /><br />I've also found that the mix is easy to customize.  I have replaced the butter with flax seed oil and added a cup of froze blueberries for tasty blueberry waffles.  I've also mashed up two bananas and mixed those in for banana waffles.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with the produce and I will be buying again.  It has made waffles a regular treat rather than a sometimes treat, and completely justified owning a waffle iron.
