I recently heard about Manitoba Harvest Hemp on an interview with Riley Cote (former Philadelphia Flyer)- He boasted about the health benefits of hemp (and how he has got a lot of NHL players taken it for a natural supplement), so I needed to do a little more research myself.<br />After researching, I saw he was right one! This is a great supplement for adding Omega 3/6 into you diet.<br />It tastes like shelled, unsalted sunflower seeds. So they actually add more texture to food than a taste.<br />I usually add it to my cereal or yogurt in the morning - and I generally try to throw a tablespoon of it into whatever I am eating.<br />If you have high cholesterol, Omega 3/6 are good to add to your diet, this is also a great source of fiber for you too.<br />There are lots of sellers, but what draws me to Manitoba is that they seem to be the most pure and freshest you can get. I like the Raw organic for the freshness and also to get a more pure product (why have unneeded additives in my supplements?)
