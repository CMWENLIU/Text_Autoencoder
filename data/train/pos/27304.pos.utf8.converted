A couple of years ago Barbara halted production of the Peanut Butter flavor Puffin.<br />I fell into a medium-deep depression (possibly withdrawal symptoms), sensing that my reason for rising was gone, impossible to replace.<br />To my relief, the company saw the error of its way, and it was back, albeit, sporting new packaging, and what seems to be a variable, Ounces per Box concept, (I have seen 11 and 15oz boxes.)<br /><br />The ONLY complaint I can register with this wonderful product is, of course, the intensity of the peanut butter flavor has dimminished quite noticeably.  This is NOT GOOD.  I would love to taste the taste, once again.<br /><br />Please bring back the peanut butter... go a little stronger.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is the finest breakfast cereal money can buy.  Thank you, Barbara!<br /><br />Richard Anderson  PS.  I fill a bowl half full with fresh-frozen blueberries, fill the rest of the<br />  bowl with B's PB P C, and moisturize with Organic Vanilla Soy Milk or<br />  Vanilla Rice Dream.  Mmmmmmmmm, crunch.
