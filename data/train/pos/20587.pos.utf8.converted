Talk about wonderful chocolate!<br /><br />This is some of the best you will ever have. Leonidas sends it out fresh, overnight. They don't add paraffin, so the chocolate does melt in your hands, as well as on your tongue.<br /><br />Each piece is small, with light, buttery, creamy fillings. Each piece is better than the last.  They're not as famous as Godiva - but they're better. Much better than Sees, or Ethel M's (which also happen to be pretty good).<br /><br />I am so glad that Amazon added Leonidas to their selections.
