I buy this product for my husband.  It's the only hard candy he likes, and local stores have discontinued it.  I finally found it here at Amazon.com at a very reasonable price.  I was so happy to find it, and it's very convenient to order it online and have it delivered to my house in a reasonable length of time. Hopefully, I will be able to continue to get the Brach's Sugar Free Butterscotch hard candy from Amazon.com for a very long time.
