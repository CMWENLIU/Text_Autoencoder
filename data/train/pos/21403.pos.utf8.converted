My terrier mix is a very picky eater, so we have tried almost every one of the higher quality dog foods out there and my dog likes this best. This is also one of the best made dog foods in my opinion. 70% meat and zero grain. The only thing was figuring out the correct amount to feed her each day. As this is a very high protein food(42%), the portions we feed are half of "normal" protein food. My dog is very active, so she has no problem burning off the high calorie count of this food(almost 500 cal per cup). So even though the cost per bag is high, it is really no more expensive than "normal" brands in the long run. Watch for weight gain in larger dogs, my friend tried this stuff with his big Lab mix and he put on to much weight. My only complaint would be that my dogs coat doesnt seem to shine like it did with some other brands. I now top this food off with a squirt of salmon oil and her coat really shines. The best thing about this food is that my dog just loves the taste. I would recommend trying.
