This is a spectacular cheese but I would not buy from this seller again. The reason? I ordered 3 pounds for christmas but was sent 2 1/2 pounds of small discards, including pieces of rind, all shrink wrapped in a ton of plastic. They refuse to respond to emails and are difficult to contact or deal with if you have a problem. As a refund they refused to reimburse me the $31.78 for shipping.<br /><br />As the saying goes....Buyer Beware
