I have purchased Wakame from a well-known largely organic food store.  When I received this shipment from Amazon I was pleasantly surprised how fresh the seaweed was.  I didn't know it should NOT be dry and brittle (store purchase) and accepted it as a quality of dried seaweed.<br /><br />It is much easier to cut strips for homemade seaweed salad and much less expensive.  Overall, an excellent buy at nearly $2 per pkg cheaper.<br /><br />Update March 10, 2011*****<br /><br />I find if you cut it along the short way (width) before hydrating, instead of trying to cut it in long strips, it is almost the quality size that you can get from a restaurant when using Cuisanart kitchen shears.<br /><br />If you can, read/purchase a book called Seaweed- Nature's Secret to Balancing Your Metabolism, Fighting Disease, and Revitalizing Body & Soul By Valerie Gennari Cooksley, RN.  It is awesome!  You'll find yourself eating a greater variety of the greens. I found my copy at Half Price Books in Orland Park, IL<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584795387">Seaweed: Nature's Secret to Balancing Your Metabolism, Fighting Disease, and Revitalizing Body and Soul</a>
