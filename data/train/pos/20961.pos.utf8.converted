This product arrived three days after i placed the order! For a good price, you get the most realistic can safe available. This one is bigger than the cheap pepci can, allowing you to be able to fit a lot more in it. We bought a real arizona tea can, and found no difference at all, down to the serial codes. The fact that it is weighed to feel more real is awesome, and makes it impossible to break apart or dent. There is no sceme where you unscrew the cap, and when you look inside, you see two layers of aluminum, the outside layer filled with some rubbery like substance, to protect the contents from shock, and it makes the can feel pressurized like a normal soda can would. in the middle is a big empty cavity where you store whatever.<br /><br />Overall, excellent product, amazing shipping, my money well spent.
