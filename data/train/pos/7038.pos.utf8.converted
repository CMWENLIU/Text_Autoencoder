My three year old son loves this and drinks about three glasses a day.<br />We both have malnourishment issues so I try to make sure any food we eat<br />is as healthy as possible. This drink mix has made it possible for my son<br />to not need supplement in a pill form. It does not taste like Hershey syrup,<br />but my son doesn't mind because he has never had Hershey syrup. It is hard to dissolve in cold milk so I mix it with warm water first then add the dissolved "syrup" into the milk. I make it in a shaker cup and I make enough for at least one day and that works well. Oh and once it's open it needs to be kept in the refrigerator. You can buy it at Whole Foods and some Vitamin stores but it's cheaper on Amazon. We have been using this for about two years.
