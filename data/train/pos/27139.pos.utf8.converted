I believe it was the esteemed Neil Patrick Harris who, eons ago, said "Suit up. It's going to be legendary!" Mr. Harris would never admit it because he never was one for product endorsements, but I'mma blow the lid off this mystery: He was talking about Coffee-mate's Pumpkin Spice Creamer.<br /><br />Upon hearing that this product existed, I promptly began to hyperventilate and had to be awakened by smelling salts. To say that I love anything pumpkin-flavored would be the biggest understatement since... well... I'm looking for historical precedents here, but I'm really not well-versed in the history of understatements. Anyway, I digress; after being awakened, I promptly drove 107 mph the entire way to the store, causing 7 minor traffic accidents, a stampede of antelope, and at least one unplanned pregnancy. I then sprinted to the Dairy section, mind racked with anticipation and apprehension; would they truly have the Holy Grail of coffee creamers, or would I be left utterly disappointed, like that time when I was seven and my parents ate my entire birthday cake right in front of me, laughing the whole time?<br /><br />And then, I saw it: A fully-stocked shelf of Coffee-mate Pumpkin Spice Creamer. I gasped in delight as I grabbed the nearest bottle off of the shelf, passionately ripped off the lid, clawed desperately at that Godforsaken plastic freshness seal, and chugged the entire bottle on the spot. For what seemed like hours, I collapsed on the floor of the supermarket, chest heaving in pure ecstasy as a subtle afterglow began to emanate from every pore of my skin.<br /><br />Long story short, I'm serving a lengthy prison sentence now for not only my incredibly lewd public display (I don't even REMEMBER taking my pants off), but also my inadvertent destruction of the entire Dairy section. And you know something? I'd do it ALL again. And I will, as soon as I'm out. Be prepared.<br /><br />Also, it's now January, so if you want in on this, RUN to your nearest grocery store and get some, or else you will live in regret until October when it comes out again. Cheers!
