To begin with I am a vegetarian and do not have eggs. My review will be in 2 parts<br /><br />1. For the seller: When I received my first package, it was damaged and the product spilled. On raising a complaint I was promptly provided a replacement and the overall service was courteous. Full marks to VitaCost<br /><br />2. For the product: Ener-G Egg Replacer is a blessing for all those who don't eat or bake eggs. I have already used it for chocolate cookies and cake and the results are far superior than anything else I have used so far. Definitely recommend this product.
