I was away from almost all civilization and wanted chrysanthemum tea so amazon.com saved me by selling it online. I received it in great strong packaging (perhaps too much since it was a box with the product and filler within another box). The flowers looked clean and fresh and when brewed it produced a nice light yellow tea. It tastes just as good or better than the usual Chinese chrysanthemum tea I'm used to, so I'm very happy with this product. I would also highly recommend buying loose leaf or loose flower teas so you can adjust it to your own or guest's tastes!
