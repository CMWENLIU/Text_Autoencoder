Recently I've taken to trying out different brands of coconut water whenever I get a chance. Been through Goya, Taste Nirvana, Zico, and One, then I found Mira Azul which is my favorite. It is the perfect level of sweetness that the others didn't have. I would say De Mi Pais, an obscure brand I found in a latino grocery store in Brooklyn, is close, but borders on too sweet.<br /><br />I found Azul at my supermarket in a glass bottle (like Orangina) and was addicted. It should be known that the water in this can tastes not as good as in the glass.. less sweet.. but it's still a great enough taste that I don't mind it.
