Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water is my favorite coconut water by a long shot, and I've tried all the major brands. A lot of them have an offputting, chemical or metallic taste (hard to describe it exactly), but Taste Nirvana has the only one that to me truly tastes like the coconut water I've had straight from the coconut! There are no additives, it's pure 100% coconut water. This version is the one without pulp, which I imagine is the one that most people will enjoy (since pulp can be a problem for some people, texturally speaking).<br /><br />As I write this, these 16-oz cans are not yet available on Amazon, but you can find this coconut water at most Whole Foods, PCC, and other organic-type grocery retailers (as well as other places). As soon as they make this available on Amazon on a regular basis, I'm putting in a monthly subscription!
