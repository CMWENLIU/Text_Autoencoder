The first time i tasted this it reminded me of a malt shake.  I mix it with my protien shake and its tolerable.  I have tried sprinkling it over food and the taste is overbearing.  Smoothie seems to be the best way to have this powder.<br /><br />As far as energy and health benefits that remains to be seen.  I does have a tendancy to cause insomnia.  I drank some in a smoothie before going to bed and I had trouble sleeping that day.  Alertness and clarity is what I have noticed from using this product.<br /><br />It is by no means sweet. Bitter/malty/nutty flavor is what I would use to describe.  Navitas is definately the best value.<br /><br />If anybody knows what the recommended dosage/amount per day please comment.
