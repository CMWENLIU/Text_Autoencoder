I lived in Asia for 3 years and one of my favorite cuisines was Indonesian/Malaysian.  Both countries serve-up slightly different versions of Beef Rendang, which is one of my all-time favorites.  When I first moved back to Chicago I didn't know of any restaurants that served this dish (I've since found two) so I attempted to make my own sauce, from scratch, following a recipe I'd found on-line.  I don't know what I did wrong, but what came out didn't very closely resemble true Beef Rendang.  A little later on I purchased a sauce packet in an asian grocery. No... it didn't quite have the same flavor either.  Well,  it's been 6 or 7 years since those failed attempts and low and behold, I stumbled upon the Prima Rendang Curry.  De-licious! I followed the simple instructions and ... I have to say. It's pretty darn good!
