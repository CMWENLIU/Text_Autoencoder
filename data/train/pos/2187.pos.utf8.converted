I was between the Girardelli (I don't know if that's how you spell it) and this Hershey's Cocoa Special Dark.  I had tried Girardelli's powdered cocoa before and remember the first time I tried it as hot chocolate I thought to myself it's ok but nothing amazing so this time I bought the Hersheys.  The first thing I noticed is the almost black-gray color when you mix it into the hot milk with barely a trace of brown.  That didn't seem too appetizing but I prefer it to having artificial colors added.  From the first sip the taste was amazing!  One of those situations where you just can't put the cup down and keep taking small sips even though this liquid was steaming hot.  I made it with powdered milk (0 fat) raw sugar, and a quarter teaspoon of salt.  The dark chocolate taste is amazingly full and satisfying.  When I started to drink this I thought I might get a stomach-ache since it looked so dark but not at all (Used a very heaping teaspoon)
