Much has already be said about this fine product and it would be hard to<br />add  to all the existing great  reviews. I find this excellent product<br />to be complementary to Yerba Mate as well. I combine the two mates by<br />making strong yerba mate  sun tea and then steeping the coca tea bags in the first sun tea ( once again in the sun ) making  Cocayerb Mate. For my tastes the two work well in concert, I find that the properties of both mates combine nicely.<br />  I add a small amount of sugar to my cocayerb mate because I drink it as a dark tea. Cocayerb might be a little intense for those people that don't like coffee due to it's stimulating effects. The speed and efficiency of the Amazon ordering and delivery process is very  commendable as  well.
