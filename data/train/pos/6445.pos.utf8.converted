I have tried a lot of olive oils in the past, and being on a tight budget, I try to stay in the lower price range category. As you can imagine, I've ended up with some really lacking oils. Not so with Zoe Organic! This olive oil is light and mild with an excellent clean taste that doesn't overpower the flavor of what you're cooking (I like that in an olive oil!). Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the size, no more trying to find a cabinet space tall enough for a tall bottle of oil. I've finally found an affordable winner!
