Nutiva Coconut Oil is the best brand and it is better than Olive Oil as far as frying. Not only that but you can use it in your hair and body. I will Never purchase lotion again for my skin.I am placed on the automatic delievery every 6 months.You can Never go back to using other oils again. The body becomes adjusted to it and it makes all the difference in the world. You will NEVER shop again in the stores. Thank God for Amazon !!!!<br /><br />Bernia' Walker
