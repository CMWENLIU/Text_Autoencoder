This product just came out in my local grocery/health food store. I have bought the original Annie's Homegrown Gluten Free Mac&Cheese for my son who is Gluten intolerant. He has always enjoyed it and we as a family ate it as well. We would just add extra cheese to make it creamier but now we don't have to do that with this new product. It is very creamy and taste as close to regular Mac&Cheese that you can get from a box. It's also great because it contains almost twice as much as the other kind and since it's not a powder mix the ease allows a simple,quick dinner for my always,ever so demanding four-year old. So this gets a thumbs up from a spunky toddler. Also,we like to add things like left over taco meat or tuna to add varity to the dish. We love Annie's products!
