I've purchased this product multiple times and have never been disappointed.  I don't use it for cooking or baking, only for eating just as it is.  (LADIES ONLY:  I had heard that ginger helps reduce hot flashes.  I can't recommend it for others, but it does work for me.)  When I open a new package I put it into a colander and shake vigorously to remove excess sugar, then put the ginger in a covered Tupperware to keep it handy on the counter-top.  A few pieces twice a day, and I'm a happy lady!
