Never found a dog that didn't like this item.  My cats too, but I have to break them up for them.<br /><br />Perfect for a quick little reward or treat.  Great for training also.  Easy to carry a handful. Perfect bite size.  A good company that ships fast.<br /><br />UPDATED, SEPT 29, 2009..I would use caution with any Smokehouse product if it's made in China.<br /><br />The Smokehouse Chicken Strips are the likely cause of the sudden, acute kidney failure in my beloved Kio.  Several days after ingesting the strips he was rushed to the vet. He is dying.<br /><br />Check the web Vet sites and Google Smokehouse.  You will find very negative feedback and info. Several stores pulled them from the shelves and won't sell them. I don't know if it includes any other Smokehouse product, but there's too many treats made in America, not China that I can feed my pets without poisoning/killing them.
