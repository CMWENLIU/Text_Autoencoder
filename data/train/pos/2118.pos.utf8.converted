The Endangered Species bars are immensely popular due to their environmental consciousness,as well as being vegan. As chocolate bars,they're a mixed bunch. The peanut butter bar tastes more like cardboard,but the one with cherry essence is PERFECT! The koala bar not only has facts about Australia's favorite animal (along with the kangaroo),but it tastes great. It has a pleasant fruity flavor. Endangered Species bars give part of their profits to save the environment, so it tastes good and does good too!
