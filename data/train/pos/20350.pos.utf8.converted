I bought this bowl for a black lab who inhales his food.  It's definitely slowed him down.  After hearing sad stories of dogs who died from the Bloat I was anxious to find a bowl that would slow my dog down.  What I like about this particular bowl is that it's not made of lightweight plastic, the weight of the stainless steel helps it to stay put, along with a non-slip rubber grip on the base of the bowl.  It stays in place and doesn't end up tipped over or pushed under the cabinet toe-kick. Plastic bowls get scratched up on the inside after so much use, you don't have that problem with stainless steel.  And you never really know if there's bacteria on the plastic, with stainless steel it's easy to steralize.
