The product is very light in texture and has a deep, rich Hickory wood aroma. It is very dense. I have used it to enrich sauces and condiments, as well as in meat (primarily chicken) marinades prior to roasting in the oven.<br /><br />As long as you don't care about the product's bulk-looking package, this is a very high-quality product that consistently creates great results every time it is used.
