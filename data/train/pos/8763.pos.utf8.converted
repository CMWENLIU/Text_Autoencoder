I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend in 2009.  I was a bit nervous purchasing something so fragile..didn't know how the shipping and handling would treat it.  It arrived on time and very securely wrapped/packaged leaving no room for ruin.  Most importantly, it looked great- very similar to the picture.  This is our first experience with a bonsai tree and it continues to be a very healthy little plant.  Perfect for starters I'd say.
