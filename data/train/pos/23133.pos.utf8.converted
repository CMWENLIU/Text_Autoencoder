If you are new to the Numi Flowering Tea, it is a must try. Unlike one of the previous reviewer, I find the tea to have plenty of flavor the first three pots before fading in taste and aroma in the subsequent pots. The blooming flower, the aroma, and the smoothness of the tea really gives a relaxing feel and is wonderful to have after a long day. I typically add 2 sugar cubes along with a bit of milk in every cup and it really enhances the taste. I highly recommend this tea.<br /><br />The main objective of this review is to let prospective buyers know just what pedals are included inside since the product description fails to list them. The following is what you will find in the box.<br /><br />Jade Fortune x 2<br />Starlight Rose x 1<br />Golden Jasmine x 1<br />Black Beauty x 1<br />Midnight Peony x 1<br /><br />The flavors listed above isn't the best from Numi, but this box seems to be a bit more reasonable in price as well. Give it a try and judge for yourself ;)
