I first encountered Shock coffee while deployed to Iraq and it's absolutely wonderful (much better taste than Doubleshot)!  When I couldn't find it where I was living in Iraq, I emailed the company asking where I could find it and they sent me a free case (24)!!  I would drink one of these before going into some really boring briefings and had no problem staying awake.  Overall, great drink (much more oomph than Frappacinos and fewer calories!)....and a wonderful company who made many deployed troops pretty happy.
