I did a lot of research looking for the best reviewed stevia and chose this of the 2 (I like the liquid extract, I make a lot of cold drinks and didn't want to deal with dissolving anything). I have used stevia for 3 years now and have always had good, but not great stevia. Higher quality stevia, more pure that is, doesnt give that aftertaste of bitter liquorish. I didn't taste that at all in this stevia, and I definitely looked for it. Could be the flavoring they add to this, but either way the aftertaste isnt there. In my "research" I found out that SweetLeaf and NuNaturals have some of the highest concentrations of stevioside in them, meaning more sweet and less sour (the point of a sweetener...). If you like this flavour go with it, if not choose another. Either way you will be happy. Just a note, the flavor is there, but is slight, don't expect much with it in something like coffee, though one of the reviews on here talks about using it in seltzer water. That might let the flavor come through better since coffee, especially mine, is so strong....
