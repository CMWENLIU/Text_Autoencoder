We've never bought raw honey before; so we were a little nervous about how it would look and taste(would it have lumps of honeycomb in it?) We received it in three days from Fed Ex in very good shape.  When we tried the honey it was excellent.  It was light colored and smooth(not lumpy). It was sweet but not the extremely sweet honey taste you get from the grocery store.  We use it on our peanut butter sandwiches instead of jelly and last night we spread a little on our baked yams with some butter, yum. So we would recommend this honey to anyone.  We will be getting some more when this is gone.
