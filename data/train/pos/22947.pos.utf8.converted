thank the Creator for this ketchup!  its the only *organic* ketchup i could find that DIDNT have a source of monosodium gluatmate like the other brands (under different names of course, like autolyzed yeast extract, natural flavors, or malt syrup).<br /><br /> im really pleased with this product, and i try to buy from the annies naturals brand because theyre one of the very few out there that have a great deal products that are organic AND MSG-free.
