I had the pleasure of trying this bar for the first time in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1999.  Now, whenever I am outside of the United States, I specifically look for these candy bars (I have eaten it in Europe in a couple of places).  I found a Asian Food Store locally that surprisingly carries it (2 weeks ago).  I am surprised that this is not sold widely on the US Market.<br /><br />This is a chocolate covered honeycombed bar with toffee undertones.  The bar lives up to its name, Crunchy!  The taste is so good it's worth traveling outside of the country for!<br /><br />Cadbury, are your executives reading this?  You need to market this in the United States.  What are you guys waiting for?<br /><br />This is a great candy bar.  You have to try it!<br /><br />Highly recommend!
