this is great for taking to work or to eat in the car, but dont try to use it as a meal replacement at home unless you got really great will power! i am the last guy to give in to cravings, but the last time i tried it as a meal replacement i ended up eating 10 of them, and that 180 cal meal replacement turned into a 1800 cal meal... so from now on i only take one or two with me to work
