I only see a single 3 star review for this product currently, and that simply doesn't do it justice. It exists as a way to sweeten Teas (and other beverages) without having a strong effect on the flavor itself. I am primarily a Fruit-based Tea Drinker, and its fantastic for sweetening a batch of Tea, Iced or hot, and has no trouble being turned into a simple syrup for later application. It is indeed on the pricey side, but its well worth it for what it brings to the drink. A fine product, through and through.
