What a fun way to finish a dinner ~ with or without guests.  My set arrived just hours before I had guests scheduled for dinner ~ we had a delightful tasting-time following dessert with tiny demi-tasse cups and spoons coming out of seclusion for the event.  The package arrived well-cushioned to avoid breakage, and the little teapot is charming ~ one could not buy cups of tea at a restaurant for much less than this whole set cost (at the half-price proffered by Amazon), and it can be used for multiple meals as well.  Delightful choice!
