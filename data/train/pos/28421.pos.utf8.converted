I've bought this sausage casing. It was a great product. It's easy to cook and you don't need to find sausage casing at supermarket anymore. Sometime, it rarely to find them. Here I recommend this product if you're looking for sausage casing to make any kind of sausages that you want.<br />By the way, I'd like to thankful for this product owner that responsed immediately when I ordered. I got this product before estimate time of shipment.<br />I will order this product for sure whenever I want to make sausages.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Karen
