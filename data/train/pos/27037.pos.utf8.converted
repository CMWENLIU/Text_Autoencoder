I was leary of an instant waffle mix, REALLY leary, so I read the reveiws here and made my decision to give this a try, so glad I did! Not only were they easy to prepare, they were great!  Oh I had a problem with the first few since my waffle maker is a bit old and the teflon coating was pretty much shot, so I sprayed the griddle with Pam, they are now perfect, and if my boyfriend loved them then you just KNOW they're great, (he's very picky...)  Highly recommended.  I freeze up the extras too and toast them when we want "instant" waffles.  Just recently purchased a new waffle maker (of course, from Amazon), can't wait to try this mix on that!
