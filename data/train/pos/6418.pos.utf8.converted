This is a delicious kombu kelp. Soak it in tepid water for a half hour and it's ready to use, with an aroma that will bring back memories of any coastline. I use mine in making dashi stock as well as for eating directly.<br /><br />Be careful with the packaging, though. This comes as two separate sealed packages of seaweed bundled together with tape and cellophane; you don't want to pierce both inner packages until you're ready to use them, of course.
