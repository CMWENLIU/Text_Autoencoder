My lab mix has a very sensitive tummy. He had recurrent bouts of diarrhea, vomiting and constant wretched gas. I had given him pedigree for awhile but realized that was no good for him. Then we tried science diet, but his gas seemed to get worse and his tummy would gurgle all day.<br /><br />I read about this dog food and its natural ingredients. There's no corn meal or other fillers. He's been on this food for about 2 weeks now and his gas has disappeared! He has not had a single bout of diarrhea or vomiting. I'm impressed. Yes it's pricey and I normally wouldn't buy something so expensive, but it is well worth it for the health of my dog.<br /><br />*Updated* to say that he has been on this food for a few months now and has continued to be free of tummy troubles and wretched gas. He hasn't vomited at all or had diarrhea. His coat has gotten so much shinier and he seems to be a much happier dog without all the tummy issues!
