I have been a tea drinker since I was a baby. In fact, I cannot remember a day of my life without at least one hot cup of tea... And so, it is no wander that I am continuously on a quest for a better tasting leaf.<br /><br />As of lately, my choice has been the Black Pearl. Its fairly recent appearance on supermaket shelves has saved me from frequent trips to a not-so-local tea boutique. The Black Prearl is en excellent choice for those who, like myself, enjoy the brew without the addition of taste masking ingredients, such as lemon, sugar, or milk.<br /><br />The leaves are large (tea dust in the bag is an indicatour of inferiour quality). They brew a liquid that is golden in color (make sure your tea cup is white to enable you to admire it), strong but sweet in taste (unlike most Lipton brands that brew too dark and bitter for my liking), and an aroma that is true to the taste (be patient and allow it to develop; too short a brew=no aroma; too long=bitter taste).<br /><br />The Black Pearl presentation, a fabric piramid, is an added bonus, especially if you are brewing directly in a cup, or a transparent tea pot. My suggestion is to always use a tea pot as it lengthens the experience and allows for a better water to leaf ratio manipulation (quick tip regarding water: OVERboiling removes oxygen and prevents the maximization of flavour!).<br /><br />Sip and enjoy!<br /><br />PS: The price I have paid for this product on Amazon thru Subscribe and Save is HALF of what the supermarket charges! Go, Amazon!
