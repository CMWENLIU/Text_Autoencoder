Received these and made a stir fry dish the same night.  Noodles have a texture all their own and I LOVE them (husband likes them, too).  They are basically tasteless on their own and they pick up flavors from the dish they are in so spicy dishes are the perfect place for these noodles.  So far I've used them in stir-frys and soups.  These noodles have No calories and zero carbs after you minus the fiber, how wonderful is that !!!!!  If you're looking for this noodle to taste just like regular pasta, it won't. BUT if you like trying new things and learning to use new foods, these noodles are the way to go.  Besides, knowing these have no calories and zero net carbs makes me a happy "dieting" camper.
