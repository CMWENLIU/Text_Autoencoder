I like flavored coffees but not my husband. That's part of why we got Keurig maker. Have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert-y kind of flavor I'm looking for (and my other top favorite so far is Green Mountain's Caramel Vanilla Cream). Been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine!
