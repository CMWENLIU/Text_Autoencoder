This natural little concoction is a lovely tea tasting of licorice which soothes the most unhappy tummy. I have tried so many "medicines" that the doctors gave me, all of which had terrible side effects that in desperation I started to explore alternative remedies. For some folks digestive enzymes do the trick, but for my bloaty feeling belly, it's this tea, and all better. No more tums, maalox, prevacid, etc. I just drink this tea, and feel much better. It's also mild on the body with no side effects. Make sure to steep ten minutes as directed. I am so happy I found this!
