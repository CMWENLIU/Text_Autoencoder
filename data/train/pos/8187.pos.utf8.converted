Say that 10 times fast! It's true though. They really put just enough kernels in the bag to satisfy you without feeling like you should have made 2! I love the Kettle Korn flavor too! If you've never tried it, you don't know what you're missing. It can be very addictive so maybe you better not try. Neah! Go right ahead! It's popcorn - a great healthy snacking alternative to chips, candy, and other junk food.<br /><br />Tip: It says not to use the popcorn button on your microwave which is good advice but if you check that booklet thingy that came with yours (if you can remember which drawer it's buried in) you might find that your popcorn button has multiple size settings like my Samsung model does. All it takes for me is to press the popcorn button 3 times to select "Snack size" and it comes out perfect every time - none burnt or scorched and only a few kernels unpopped.
