Why, oh why, oh WHY?! Don't we have such great tasting crisp like these in the USA!!! Walkers produce AMAZING crisps! 'Lays' can't stand up to the deliciousness that is Walkers. Please Walkers, start importing these into America! At least teach your parent company PepsiCo how to make great snacks so they can in turn teach the Americans how to make a great crisps!<br /><br />Seriously this has got to be one of the best tasting S&V products that I've ever tasted! Far superior compared to Lays.
