Scrumptious! Especially knowing that these cookies have no saturated fat, no cholesterol, and a good amount of "untastable" fiber and flaxseed.<br />Soft, granular, cookie dough like texture with a subtle brown sugar flavor. Almost like eating a fluffy sugar cookie without all the "bad" indgredients.
