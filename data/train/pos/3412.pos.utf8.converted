I have just bought this tea yesterday and made a traditional "chai", as I normally do. I've used other brands and types of bagged chai tea before, and they were decent, but nothing like this. I absolutely love my chai to be extremely spicy, and this is it. No other varieties of Stash Chai or even their other teas can compare to this. This is simply delicious when made with milk and sugar. Save the money you spend on a Starbucks Chai latte and buy a box instead. It's MUCH better and less expensive when made right.<br /><br />I usually make chai from scratch, but this is definetely a time saver and tastes amazing. Highly recommended.
