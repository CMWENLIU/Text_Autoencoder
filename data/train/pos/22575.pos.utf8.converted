This is simple.  If you're going to have canned chili, I've spent about 60 years determining that this is the best canned chili.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that Wolf's beats most the homemade chili I've tasted in its meatiness (not always flavor) and that includes my time living here in "semi-Mexico" on the Rio Grande.<br /><br />And then all you need to do is add some seasoning the ladies here use.  This probably is a better base.  A little this, a little that and you'll be in ChiliLand.  Though I never bother.<br /><br />Need I mention this is "without beans"?  Makes a big difference, Podner.  Better to add a tamale or two than a bunch of beans.
