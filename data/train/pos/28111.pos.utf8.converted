I enjoyed my Lindor assorted truffles very much, but I regret<br />to tell you that it cost me about $10.00 more than if I had<br />purchased the same truffles at my local Walgreen's drug store.<br />so I will know for next time that impulse in line shopping<br />is not always the right thing to do.
