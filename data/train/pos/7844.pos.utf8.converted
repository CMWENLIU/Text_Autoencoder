Most dry milk tastes pretty dry after its reconstituted :-)  nido still has the fat in it, and a load of usable protein, so it makes a great backup for real whole milk, for survival, for your nuke shelter , or just cause your to lasy to go to the store and buy a gallon :-).<br /><br />I use it specifically to make a Cocoa mix that isnt using "partially hydroginated vegtiable oil" whatever that is.<br /><br />Shelf time is not as long as dry milks or cocoas, but the taste difference is all the difference in the world.
