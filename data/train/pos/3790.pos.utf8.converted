The bottle use to say 'Dark Chocolate'... so I don't know if this is the same.<br />I don't like stevia usually, but when you add the cacao... it is sooooo yummy.<br />I can get kids who (seriously) won't drink water at all, to drink it all day long when I add a few drops of this.<br />Or totally get rid of 'chocolate milk'... just add a few drops of this stuff and whalaa.<br />I put it in my health-smoothies to make them taste delicious.<br />I carry a bottle in my purse everywhere.<br />Trying to cut down on sweets, but want to totally quench your sweet-tooth?  Just put this in your water and you'll be satiated.
