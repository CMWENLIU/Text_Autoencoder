I have used this honey for paper cuts, sore throats, acid reflux. As a mask for my face. Leaves the skin feeling super soft and helps with acne break outs. I tell anyone who will listen about the many uses for this honey. It is a little pricey but I figure its better than the stuff in the pharmacy thats just as costly because you have to keep buying it over and over because it really doesn't work as well.
