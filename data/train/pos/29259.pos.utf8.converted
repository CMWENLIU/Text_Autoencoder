Hela Curry is used in Holland to eat with snacks like fries and deep fried meat. It's a ketchup with special herbs and spices.<br />I personally like to add it to my tomato soup, to give the soup a little extra flavour. Or in a egg salad or so called 'filled eggs'<br /><br />Filled Eggs with Hela Curry<br />You can make the filled eggs by boiling them, peel the egg shell off, cut the eggs over the length in two, take out the (hard) egg yolk. Put the egg white halfs on a plate (they will be filled later on). The egg yolks go in a bowl, add some mayonaise, Hela Curry, salt and pepper and mix this untill it becomes smooth. This mixture will go in the spot where the egg yolks used to be! You can use a piping bag with star nozzle for a nice effect!
