These were the only Whole Wheat Oven Ready noodles I could find and they are organic too! The price is great and they shipped very fast. They seem to take a little longer to cook but it's not a big deal. You can't even tell they are whole wheat once the lasagna is ready. My husband doesn't like whole wheat pasta too much and he has no idea he's been eating these for the past year!
