I really enjoy these Illy Issimo Cappuccino drinks.  If you love coffee like I do, you'll find the taste to be rich and delicious.  It's a terrific blend of "Italian espresso style coffee", lowfat milk, cocoa and sugar.  The cocoa flavor is very subtle.  It's there, but you might not know it if you weren't looking for it.<br /><br />Nutritionally, each 200ml (8.45 ounce) can is 100 calories, 15 of which come from fat.  It has 19 grams of carbs, 1 gram of fiber and 5 grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this is health food, but I think it's a lot better for you then a soda and definitely gives you a bit of an energy boost, although I wouldn't consider it to be an energy drink.<br /><br />Illy is renown for producing some of the finest espresso in the world and the quality of this product is exactly what you would expect from a name that is almost synonymous with espresso.  This product is made from 100% Arabica beans which seem to be roasted to a full city roast, or thereabouts.  Illy Issimo is produced in Denmark under a collaboration between illy and Coca Cola.<br /><br />Let me also be clear that my rating has nothing to do with the cost of this item.  You'll have to make a value determination on your own.  While I do a lot of shopping at Amazon, I purchased this item at Big Lots for less than a third of the current price at Amazon.  I've also seen the price fluctuate substantially here at Amazon.<br /><br />I really look forward to having a can of illy Issimo cappuccino at almost any time of the day.  I highly recommend it and I think you'll enjoy it too!
