I stumbled across the maple sugar chunks while looking for maple products. I ordered a bottle and then tried to decide how to use them.  My first thought was to try them in chocolate chip cookies instead of chocolate chips.  But I settled on an oatmeal cookie recipe.  People who usually didn't like oatmeal cookies loved the maple flavor.  Now my friends ask me to bring my maple oatmeal cookies when we get together.  I've even given several bottles, along with sample cookies, to my friends and family.<br /><br />I'm hooked on the Shady Maple Farms Maple Sugar Chunks, they make my oatmeal cookie recipe taste fantastic.
