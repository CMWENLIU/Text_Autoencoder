I really bought this tea thinking the placebo effect would work on me - mostly because I have little faith in marketers promises now-a-days. The results? I really don't think this was a placebo.... It did exactly what it said on the description.<br /><br />I noticed it calmed me down when I was stressed or even worse, depressed. And while I didn't like the taste initially -smells like strong curry with licorice- I soon found myself craving it whenever I needed it and the taste wasn't so bad anymore. Actually I started to like it.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for relief from depression. As a sufferer, I know how much a moments relief feels like glorious heaven.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />::EDIT:: I left this on the counter and my younger, 15 y/o sister who ISN'T depressed tried this, not knowing what it was. She said she suddenly started feeling giddy and happy inside and that's when she asked me what this tea was. So I'm guessing it really does work...
