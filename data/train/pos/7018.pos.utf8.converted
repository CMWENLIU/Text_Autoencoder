These are a staple - I always have some made and keep them in the freezer.  If you add an extra egg they are more fluffy.  If you leave out the sugar, they make a great substitute for english muffins in eggs benedict.  I am very sorry amazon quit carrying these - I go through the 6 pack in 6 to 8 weeks.
