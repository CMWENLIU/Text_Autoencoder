I was delighted to know that you stock this, or have access to it, since I have been told in the past that the Government no longer allows its importation,because of some alleged deficiency in the "food coloring"; this being a natural product, I was unaware that such an ingrediaant existed. Now all my friends love me again! Please stock the "thick Cut" Variety too, and you will have a lifetime customer
