I ordered this product because I use Savory Choice's chicken broth concentrate regularly. I was not disappointed! The vegetable broth has a rich, exotic flavor. I used it to cook asparagus and had rave reviews around the table. Now, I use it as often as possible to put new life into familiar foods.  I am very happy with every aspect of the product - the unique flavor, elegant packaging, convenient single-serve stick pouches, and the value for the money. The product packs nicely for camping and backpacking as well. Glad I found this hidden gem!
