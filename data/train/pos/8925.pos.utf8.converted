Bigelow Chamomile Herbal Tea helps me relax and unwind at the end of a long, stressful day. I occasionally drink it right before bedtime to help me fall asleep. If you have insomnia, it's a natural remedy worth looking into.<br /><br />I have tried the Celestial Seasonings brand of chamomile tea (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E671X4">Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime Herb Tea</a>), which is a blend of Chamomile Flowers, Spearmint Leaves, Lemon Grass, Tilia Flowers, Blackberry Leaves, Orange Blossoms, Hawthorn Berries, and Rosebuds. Although I really like its flavor, I don't find it as potent or as effective as the Bigelow brand of chamomile tea.<br /><br />Each box of Bigelow Cozy Chamomile comes with 20 individually-wrapped tea bags. This order ships with 6 boxes, for a total of 6 x 20 = 120 tea bags. With free shipping, it's the best deal you'll find anywhere!
