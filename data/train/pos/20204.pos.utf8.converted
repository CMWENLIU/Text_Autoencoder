Since being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I have been on a quest for low carb, no sugar snacks. Joesph's Sugar Free Cookies are a real find!<br /><br />A pack of about 10 cookies has more than 150 calories, and upwards of 20 or so net carbs so you do have to be aware that these can have a glycemic impact. I usually ration myself to 4 or 5 cookies per serving for less than 100 calories and 8 or 10 carbs.<br /><br />All of the flavors in this assortment are good, but I really liked the Lemon and Chocolate Walnut best.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
