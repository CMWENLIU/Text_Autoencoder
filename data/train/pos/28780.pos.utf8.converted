How often can you say that a product is a better value in a SMALLER package than in a large one? Well, at $16.20 for a 12-pack of 3 oz shakers (that's about $5.40 for 12 oz of product) this product is cheaper than No Salt's larger 11 oz size for $5.75 and up. Plus, I agree with my fellow reviewers: the smaller size is more convenient for travel and dining out. The shakers close tight and can be snuck into a restaurant (or a relative's home at the holidays...!) stuffed in a pocket for use at the table. I highly recommend this product for anyone on a salt-free or low-sodium diet.
