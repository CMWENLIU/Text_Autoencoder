This is my favorite cake and muffin mix.  It makes a very nice dense cake that no one would guess is gluten-free!  I feel most oils are a more nutritious alternative to dairy-free margine, so I always use a different oil (walnut, almond, grapeseed, etc) and they all turn out delicious.  I also substitute different sweeteners for the sugar such as maple syrup, honey, yacon syrup, date sugar, and coconut sugar and have been consistently very pleased.  The bag also offers variations to make:  pineapple upside-down cake, coconut cake, orange cake, lemon cake, ginger spice cake (one of my favorites!), marble cake, pumpkin cake, carrot cake, zucchini cake, banana cake, applesauce cake, snicker doodles, mexican wedding cookies, thumbprint cookies and pie crust.
