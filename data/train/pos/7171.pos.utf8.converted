This blend of espresso roast beans is one of the best, if not -the- best for the money.  I've purchased countless blends of beans in the Texas area (many were fantastic), but given the shipping cost and the settling of the beans, I found myself adjusting my grinder(s) more than simply pulling shots and enjoying the coffee.  With these beans I simply grind, tamp, pull, and enjoy.  With a proper grind, tamp, and properly setup machine, the consistency of the espresso as it is being extracted looks like warm honey and "tigers" perfectly.<br /><br />**Some of the reviews/comments here state that you must use expensive equipment to enjoy this coffee.  Though the term "expensive" is relative, you do not need equipment in the $2,000 range to enjoy this coffee.  A basic, pump-driven espresso machine with an accompanying burr grinder (no blades!) will produce an enjoyable shot.  Will a $3,000 espresso machine produce better shots than a $300 machine?  Of course.  Will a $300 machine produce a better shot than a steam-driven machine?  Oh, most definitely, but this is all irrelevant as the focus here is the quality of Lavazza espresso beans, and that quality is superb.**<br /><br />For reference, here is the equipment I've used with this coffee:<br /><br />Solis Crema SL70 - Stock - broken.<br />Gaggia Baby Class - Stock.<br />Rancilio Silvia (V3) - With 3-shot La Marzocco basket and bottomless portafilter - no PID.<br />Expobar Brewtus IV - Stock.<br />La Marzocco GS/3 - Stock.<br />Gaggia MDF Grinder - Stock.<br />Mazzer Mini Grinder - Stock.
