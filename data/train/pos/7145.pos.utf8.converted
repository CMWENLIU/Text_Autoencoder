I have been using this product for over a year to increase calorie intake for my preemie. It's easy to digest and I add a scoop to her bottle of milk, to her oatmeal, cream of wheat, anything I can add a spoon to - I do. The product is from Holland which one other reviewer noted. This is important because of the European restrictions on hormons given to livestock. It's a known way to add calories to diet without increasing amount of food that a child takes in. Same goes for coconut oil (which Amazon also sells and a great, organic version too). Since starting to add this to my child's diet, she has been steadily gaining weight and is now average for her age group. Long way to go from 3 pounds at birth and this product definitely helped move things in the right direction.
