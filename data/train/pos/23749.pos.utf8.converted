I was very pleasantly surprised by these nut.  I've been getting a lot of basil lately from my CSA and needed an inexpensive supply of pine nuts to make all that pesto.  I couldn't face buying them by the 4 oz jar at the supermarket.  I figured that as cheap as these nuts were they may be low grade but good enough for pesto.  I tried them and they were delicious all by themselves, very strong flavor and not the least bit stale.
