This coffee is called Maui. My favorite has always been Kona. I can't tell you what the difference is between Maui & Kona coffees. But both coffee beans are grown in Hawaii. This Maui tastes just like Kona but much less expensive. It's all I drink at home. When you drink coffee black, as I do, the true taste of coffee is not masked by cream &/or sugar. This coffee is mild & mellow but still has an incredibly full flavor. Everyone I've served it to loves it...even people who don't particularly like coffee. Bon Apetit!!
