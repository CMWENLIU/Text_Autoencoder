So aspartame gives me migraines; I'm alergic to corn so corn sweetners are out; splenda tastes flat; and sugar is about the only reasonable choices except that it's -- well -- sugar -- and has calories galore in exchange for not much nutrition.  Stevia, however, (expecially the way Sweet Leaf does it) gives a cup of coffee just the right hint of sweetness without tasting like artificial and pretend pink, yellow, or blue packets.<br /><br />The flavored stevia drops are so far (I've tried the vanilla and the choc. raspberry -- but there are 4 more) the best addition to the menu I've had in years -- and are portable enough to carry with me anywhere.  I've been carrying the "Stevia Plus" packets for over 2 years now -- you can't beat a little green packet that gives you a teaspoon's worth of sweet plus a whole gram of fiber.  By the time I've been sitting in a cafe for an hour with a bottomless cup of decaf, I've had my day's fiber and great coffee to boot!<br /><br />Bravo!
