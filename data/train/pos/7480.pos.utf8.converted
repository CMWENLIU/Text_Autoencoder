I bought several items from Barry Farms, all of which were very fairly priced and arrived promptly.  It is not always easy to find pumpkin seeds that are shelled, ready to consume. Pumpkin seeds are chewier than sunflower kernels and can be tough or stale, but Barry's are crisp-chewy.  Because I snack on them and toss them in the nightly salad, I haven't added them to homemade crackers, breads and muffins as planned, but I think they'll be ideal for those projects when I order more.
