I have 4 cats and they love this food. My oldest is 10 and the youngest is 1 1 1/2. The oldest has more energy and a softer coat then when he ate meat and actually has the energy to play agian. If you are interseted in your cats becoming vegetarian I would first read obligate carnivor. This book has opened my eyes. I read that if you turn your cats vegetarian they will kill birds and mice and eat them to get thier protien. The 7 year old that used to kill birds still kills the birds and brings them to me as a gift and does not eat them. Then comes inside to eat. This food is great and they first had two different flavor. Original and chreeze. The liked this one best so i am glad they kept this flavor. They also like this brand of wet cat food.<br /><br />Read obligate carnivor. There will be no better option than to chioce a healthier lifestyle for your pets too!
