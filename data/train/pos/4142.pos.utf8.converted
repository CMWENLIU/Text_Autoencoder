I'm thrilled with this extract. I ordered it on a Tuesday night and had it by Friday afternoon. It came wrapped nicely in plenty of bubble wrap and tissue paper and was accompanied by a nice little note from the seller thanking me for my order.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. It smells just like cocoa powder, and I use it in all my baked goods and even savory foods. Added to gravy it gives it that little something extra, and it's phenomenal in whipped cream, cookies, brownies, sweetbreads, cakes, even coffee and hot chocolate. It's not a sweet extract so it gives some depth to foods without adding additiona sugar. I will definitely be ordering this in the future and definitely ordering from this merchant again. I am very impressed with the quality and the customer service provided!
