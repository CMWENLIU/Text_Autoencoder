I love this raw cacao. This is a really good value. This is so much more expensive in Whole Foods.<br /><br />I make a banana ice cream/pudding with it that tastes amazing. 3-4 frozen bananas pureed with 1-2 teaspoons of raw cacao and a pinch of salt. I place it in the freezer for a bit to set. Simple, Healthy and toddler approved.
