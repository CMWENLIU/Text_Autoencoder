A friend recommended this tea, saying that it basically knocked her out at bedtime. I have two small kids so that really isn't a problem, but I liked the idea of a nice relaxing tea to enjoy during a little quiet time at night.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. I brewed it up, enjoying the vapors, then drank it in a leisurely fashion (while watching "Scrubs", but that's neither here nor there). It is very tasty. My cat wanted to eat the teabag in a big way, which was charming. Then she climbed up on my lap to smell my breath, which was just adorable.<br /><br />I didn't doze off on the couch, which I half-expected based on what my friend had said, but I was verrrry melllooooooow. In a good way. A very good way.<br /><br />If you love tea but can't drink the caffeinated stuff at night, try this. It is yum.
