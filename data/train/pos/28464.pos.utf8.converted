Great to eat even as is -- just pour from can to dish.<br /><br />Try adding this to pancake or corn bread batter, Indian Pudding and even.... for the more adventurous -- bread pudding. Also wonderful in stews and soups.<br /><br />Del Monte canned Corn has always had, for me, a distinctive, recognizable flavor that I enjoy coming back to year after year.<br /><br />If sodium is a problem, there is always the low sodium version, which, to me, has even more crispness and crunchiness.
