we made the tea in individual glass irish coffee cups (some of the flowers had trouble fitting).<br /><br />It turned out really nice, our guests loved it. we each added boiling water two or three times with the same flower and the tea tasted great each time.<br /><br />You really need to make it in a group in a glass teapot or cup or you lose a lot of the effect.
