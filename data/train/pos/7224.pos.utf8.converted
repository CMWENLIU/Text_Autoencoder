I'm not sure what the other reviewers expected when they ordered an unsweeted bottle of tea, but the taste is exactly what you'd get if you brewed a cup of tea at home. Use a bit of sweetener (sugar or substitute) if you don't care for unsweetened tea, but don't bash the product because it doesn't taste like Pepsi!<br /><br />Anteadote is a very convenient way to get tea into my daily routine. I always keep a few bottles at work in case I forget to drink a bit in the morning! I've never ordered from Amazon before, but I will now that they offer free shipping with Amazon Prime. I've purchased other products from Adagio, including loose leaf tea and their teapot, and I've always been very, very satisfied.<br /><br />Love Anteadote!
