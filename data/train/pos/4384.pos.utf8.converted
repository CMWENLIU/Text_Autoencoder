We have lived in Belgium for 8 of the last 24 months.  There is no question that the cheapest Belgian chocolate is better than anything you can buy in America.  It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore.  They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up.<br /><br />Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is "best".  They don't always agree, but more Belgians said Leonida's was the best than any other single brand we heard.  This is not something you eat. You savor and treasure every piece.  The price is good and you will not be disappointed.
