If you make bread at home, you've noticed that some loaves don't hold their shape very well.  Vital Wheat Gluten solves that problem.  Use one teaspoon per cup of all purpose flour, and your bread will hold its shape better during rising and baking.  No other changes to the recipe are required.  This product does not alter the flavor of the bread in any way.  I make bread every day, and am much happier with my results wince I've begun using gluten powder in it.
