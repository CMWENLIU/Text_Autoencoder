When I first tried this product, I wasn't thrilled...the sauce was a bit gritty and clumpy...and REALLY strong.<br /><br />But I've found the solution.  Add extra dairy substitute (I use unsweetened rice milk) to thin the sauce out a bit and stir CONSTANTLY to prevent clumping.  Add 1/2 a bag of frozen peas to the pasta when cooking...and then once it's completed...refrigerate it overnight, and microwave the next day.  That is the secret.  The sauce has time to rest and becomes creamy and develop a mild, cheesy flavor.  I really recommend this!
