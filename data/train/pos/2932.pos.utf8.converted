. . . you are missing out on a true baker's secret--magically moister, richer baked goodies. Plus, you'll be adding protein. Almond meal works great in bread machine breads. I use 1/2 cup as a substitute for the same amount of wheat flour.<br /><br />The downside is this stuff is pricey. NOW Vitamins has it for less, though Bob's is gourmet and elegant in the simplicity with which he crafts his foods. Trader Joe's used to carry almond meal but hasn't lately, at least at our local store.<br /><br />Wherever you purchase it, do give almond meal/flour a try. I think it's a bakers blessing and good for all.
