I love strong, smooth tea, and this fits the bill completely.  Only suggestion I'd make is if you are able buy the loose tea in this brand and flavor, it is believe it or not even better.  A friend of mine told me for years that the loose tea was better than bags and I dismissed that bit of information.  Wrong!<br />I drink it strong and black.  Lovely.<br />Highly recommended.
