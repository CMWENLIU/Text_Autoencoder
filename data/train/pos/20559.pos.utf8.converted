This is the best whole wheat past I have had and I've tried all the different brands sold at my local grocer. I have been looking for organic whole wheat pasta for months and didn't care for any of them. This pasta doesn't get that gummy texture that so many whole wheat pastas do. I was a bit nervous to purchase 6 bags at one time but am so happy I did. This is absolutely my favorite and I definitely will order more.
