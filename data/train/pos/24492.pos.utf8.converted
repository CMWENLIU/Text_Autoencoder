I was surprised to see several reviewers who said, "salt is salt is salt, right?".  WRONG!  That refined salt in the grocery store is extremely damaging to your body, causing many problems like high blood pressure for one.<br /><br />Your body desperately needs natural salt, but the refined versions most of us grew up with have had all the nutrients processed out of them.  There are something like 70 or 80 trace elements in a good sea salt that are essential for your body's health. Under ideal conditions, we would receive these from our food we eat.  But in today's world, the soil is depleted of these critical nutrients - so that even if you try to eat good natural food, it no longer contains what you need.  So sea salt to the rescue.<br /><br />Having learned all this a few years back, I bought some Redmond's and gave it a try - and promptly went into shock.  I knew it would be good for me, but I still expected it to taste the same as all salt - but it was, "OMG! THIS IS WHAT SALT IS SUPPOSED TO TASTE LIKE??!!!"  It was a delightful bouquet of flavors and so satisfying to the taste buds.  Even if regular salt wasn't so bad for you, I could never go back just because of the taste - there is no comparison.<br /><br />And don't be fooled by most grocery store brands - even Morton's sells sea salt - and it tastes just like the same old crap that's been in our salt shakers all these years.<br /><br />One other tip to try:  I noticed another review mentioned that it helps with dehydration.  I also found out that if you become dehydrated - it is not a simple matter of just drinking lots of pure water to get re-hydrated.  I recently had a health professional suggest drinking a pinch of good sea salt in a glass of water before going to bed at night to help remedy the problem.
