I will never again settle for a dirt tasting green mix. Not only delicious, it is chock full of important nutrients. Mix with juice if you desire, though I prefer it in water. I place it in a mixing container and drink it on my way to work (like many drink a cup of coffee). Quite simply, the best greens I have yet come across (and I have tried MANY greens powders).<br />Thanks Amazing Grass - keep up the great work!!
