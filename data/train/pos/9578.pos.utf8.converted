This is one of those nice things that you rarely find: a consumer product that does exactly what it advertises it will do. It's trivial to set up, requires almost no maintenance, and rapidly grows plants without you having to know anything about how to grow plants: just follow the very simple directions and the plants grow.<br /><br />I started mine with the Salad Greens kit instead of the included herbs kit, as honestly I don't cook with a lot of fresh herbs but I do like a nice salad. It's growing very rapidly and I'm pleased.<br /><br />The hardware seems sturdy.<br /><br />One important factor to understand before buying is that it's really, incredibly bright. Photos make it look like the unit emits a cheery glow... more like it emits bright daylight that fills the entire room about 17 hours a day. It's a bit like having the sun on your table. It's rather startling at first and takes a little getting used to, but after a day or two it's okay, as long as you've placed it somewhere that it won't bother you to have very bright light. I notice that they sell wall units on which you can place up to three Aerogardens. I can barely imagine how bright the room would be after installing three of these things in one place. I certainly wouldn't want any more lighting in the room. I might even put a screen in front of it to soften the light.
