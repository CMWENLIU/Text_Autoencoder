Excellent taste and quality with just enough powdered salt.<br />They are also grown and processed in California and not some<br />Third-World country that is still using dangerous chemicals<br />for insect control along with far better cleanliness in the USA.<br />Highly Recommended.  Only problem is that I can't stop eating<br />them once I start because they are wonderful.<br />My dog also LOVES them once I remove the salt.
