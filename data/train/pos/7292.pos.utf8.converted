Wellness is among the best cat foods out there.  It is grain-free and it has ingredients of high quality. There are no meat by-products.  My only caveat is that Wellness' products with fish are not so good.  Quite frankly, cats don't eat fish in the wild, so their digestive systems are not designed for consumption of fish.  That being said, this is a fantastic specific product.  The meat is fresh, and I know my cat loves it.  I adopted my cat (he is five), and within weeks his coat was softer, the colors more vivid and I began seeing markings and colors I never saw before.<br /><br />On another note, I can't help but take a dig at one of the worst, if not THE worst, foods out there...Science Diet.  Take a read on the ingredients.  In doing so, you will the natural, very high grade, pure ingredients of Wellness contrasted with the low grade, artificial, even mysterious ingredients of Science Diet food.  Hill's chooses the name "Science Diet" to lend it credibility that it just doesn't have.  Finally, cats can't digest grains and soy.  Hill's food is riddled with that stuff.  Bottom line:  stay WITH Wellness; stay AWAY from Science Diet.
