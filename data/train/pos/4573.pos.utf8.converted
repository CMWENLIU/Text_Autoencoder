I have had a desire for Sticky Rice for many years, ever since my time in South East Asia in the early 60s. Until I came on this product, and the rice from Import Foods, I had almost forgot how it was supposed to taste. This kit brought all the memories back from those days, and the food taste from that region that I really love. I can see no other way to make rice taste like it should.
