My two year old absolutely LOVES the Gerber Spinach Pasta Pick-Ups. But they are only $1.39 each at Walmart and even lower at Publix for $1.25 each. So why is it that Amazon has a 12 pack for $35 (making it $2.91 each)? I'm very disappointed in the price, but this product is great. I wish Amazon would lower the price so we can buy in bulk at a discount.
