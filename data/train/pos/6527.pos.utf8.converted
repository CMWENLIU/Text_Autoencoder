I've been on a diet that involves drinking a lot of tea for about the past month. -14 pounds :)  English number one is is my most popular black Ahmad tea flavor. The other teas I've been drinking are green Jasmine tea very good flavor, and my most popular, blackcurrant fruity and fun, original green, green mint two thumbs up, green lemon I like this because it's convenient, but I'd rather use fresh lemon juice and put it in plain green tea.have also been drinking Earl Grey. I find Ahmad flavors are consistent and without an overpowering bitter taste that I find in some other brands. I use word bitter in describing some other teas, because I cannot describe the flavor. That's why I say Ahmad has a clean flavor, a smooth flavor, not a contort your face flavor. I think any tea would work on my diet. My diet has consisted of no white flour, no hydrogenated oils, no sugar. Pretty easy to follow.
