Igourmet's Favorites is just as good as being in another country in person. Sampling the generous sized cheese's with a San Francisco sourdough and a glass of fabulous California wine, and never having to leave the comfort of my own home is the best.  Go ahead and treat yourself to a pleasant worldly experience.
