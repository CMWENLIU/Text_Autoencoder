I began using Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed several months ago for the added omega and protein.  I had changed my diet, or I would rather call it a lifestyle, and continue to eat mostly steamed veggies and fresh fruits.  I add the hemp seed to my fruit and it is especially good with oatmeal and salads.  It can also be added to baked goods and most anything you are cooking.  I love the nutty texture and flavor it adds to foods.<br /><br />I have tried other brands, but prefer Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed.  I have purchased it at health food stores, but found it was so much easier and less expensive to order online.  As recommended it can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, so I buy a case at a time.<br /><br />Enjoy healthy eating!
