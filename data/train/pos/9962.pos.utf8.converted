this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall, and my first review here at amazon as well... these matcha candies get better and better with each one- i can see how they could become quite addictive! individually wrapped and matcha powder coated, this flavor takes some getting used... the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder, and then the inside is all chewy and decadent- YUMMY - actually, i think i'm already addicted!! also, nice to travel with or put in your bag- these won't melt or make a mess.
