Why, oh why, oh WHY?! Don't we have such great tasting crisp like these in the USA!!! Walkers produce AMAZING crisps! 'Lays' can't stand up to the deliciousness that is Walkers. Please Walkers, start importing these into America! At least teach your parent company PepsiCo how to make great snacks so they can in turn teach the Americans how to make a great crisps!<br /><br />Half my life has been in the UK the other half is in America.. I have NEVER eaten a crisp so tasty as these, and I have NEVER eaten anything similar! Makes me wanna fly to London just to get a bag just looking at the picture lol!
