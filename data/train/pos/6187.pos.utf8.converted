When I first purchased this, I thought I was buying 100 tea bags for the $20 something dollars it cost.  This being because when I have bought organic green tea at the store, I remember paying $4-5 for 16 tea bags (why I rarely bought organic green tea).<br /><br />When the package arrived, and there were FIVE boxes, totaling 500 tea bags, I couldn't believe it!!  This is such a great deal!  The flavor is wonderful and the value and quality is to be expected of Newman's Own.
