These are freeze dried blackberries and just what I was looking for so I could use them in cereal.<br /><br />They are large, so I use kitchen scissors to easily cut each berry into 2 or 3 pieces.<br /><br />The ratio of fruit to seeds can be particularly low in dried blackberries and while these have noticeable seeds, the ratio of fruit to seed is good.<br /><br />All dried blackberries seem to have an aromatic floral, slightly spicy taste that is not so familiar in fresh blackberries.  While the aroma is there, the effect on taste is relatively mild in these blackberries.<br /><br />They are tart and have a very good flavor.<br /><br />If you are looking for freeze dried blackberries for use in cereal these are great.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I have since tried the Just Tomatoes brand of freeze dried blackberries, sold as Just Blackberries.  The Just Blackberries brand are a little smaller and a couple of notches sweeter than the Harmony House.  They have a little less floral spicy aroma.<br /><br />For use in cereal, the Just Blackberries brand is my current favorite, just barely edging out Harmony House.<br /><br />It's really a matter of taste, if you want large and tart, then Harmony House is the way to go.<br /><br />If you want medium sized and sweet, then Just Blackberries is the way to go.
