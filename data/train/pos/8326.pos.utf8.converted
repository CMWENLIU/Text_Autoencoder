I saw three cans of this in T.J. Maxx.  On a whim I bought two of the cans.  I haven't eaten this since I was a child under 8.<br /><br />Therefore, I couldn't remember the taste.  But when I opened the can and started eating, it is heavenly. I went back to the store to get some more, but of course they had none.  Luckily I found the same brand at Amazon.com.  I don't know about other brands, but I sure can recommend this one.  It is a treat!not to be overlooked.
