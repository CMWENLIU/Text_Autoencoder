I have been using matcha tea for about a year now.  Stash Japanese Matcha Powdered Green Tea is the third brand that I've tried.  It is my favorite thus far.  The color is exquisite and the flavor is pure matcha.  Being able to pick this up as a subscribe and save adds to its attraction.<br /><br />I have begun adding matcha to my morning smoothie on those mornings when I don't make it hot to ensure that I get all those lovely bioflavinoids.  It is actually a nice addition to the vanilla flavored smoothie.  One piece of advise:  if you are adding the green to a vanilla drink, don't add colorful fruit.  It makes a dreadful gray color which is far from appetizing.
