My wife has been getting this from Korea for years. She has used in marinades and salads as a replacement for vinegar and sugar. But the best use of this is to relieve an upset stomach!  Just have to mix a teaspoon of extract in a small glass with water. Typically within a few minutes I feel great again.  It is incredible how fast it works!  Will always keep a bottle in the house just for that reason. Fantastic to see Amazon start carrying this product it makes it much easier to get.
