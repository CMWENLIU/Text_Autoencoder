Annie's Creamy Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is made with all vegetarian ingredients and even organic pasta. The sauce is made from cheddar cheese, cream, whey, dry milk, natural flavors and annatto for color.<br /><br />The 12-ounce box is enough for two to six people depending on how hungry you are at the time. We serve this as a side dish with many meals and normally can get about four to six servings from one box.<br /><br />When making the pasta, use a large stockpot filled halfway with water because if you even use a medium to large saucepan, it might boil over. The instructions say to use a medium saucepan, but I can't recommend that personally as it always boils over. Once you have the pasta cooked, all you do is add the packet of creamy delish cheese sauce.<br /><br />This is probably the only box of macaroni and cheese with information on where to get a "Be Green" bumper sticker. I also like the cute "Rabbit of Approval" sticker on the Annie's Homegrown products. They are all delicious and you feel good eating such a healthy product.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
