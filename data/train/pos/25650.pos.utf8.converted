I'm so happy to find a salt that is good for me, Celtic Sea Salt taste so much better than table salt and is actually healthy for you.<br /><br />"For humans to survive, salt is essential to regulate the water content in our body. Table salt, because it is refined, is unhealthy and toxic. But what our body really requires is natural pure salt.<br /><br />Hence the confusion in the minds of many. There are two forms of salt - bad salt and good salt. Eating table salt will actually deprive your body of the real salt and minerals that you need for healthy living."<br /><br />"Celtic Sea Salt is the moist salt that has been harvested from the Atlantic sea water off the coast of Brittany in France. It is harvested using the Celtic method of wooden rakes. No metal touches the salt. It is then naturally aired and sun-dried in clay ponds and gathered by wooden tools to preserve its living enzymes. Because of its unrefined nature it contains all of the 84 beneficial live elements found in the sea water. No chemicals and preservatives or additives are contained within Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Among the live minerals and trace elements found in Celtic sea salt are iodine, iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and zinc.  The 84 trace minerals provide the necessary nutrients and protect the body from the harshness of sodium chloride that we consume from commercial salt. The appropriate magnesium content ensures that unused sodium is quickly and completely eliminated from the body through the kidneys to prevent harm."
