I bake bread every week, and this yeast is fantastic!  It's just like the kind I used to buy in packets, just way more economical - I use 2 teaspoons to recipes that call for one packet.<br /><br />I've stored mine in it's original bag, inside a sealed ziploc freezer bag, in the refrigerator.  It's lasted a little over a year but is now starting to go (I'm noticing my bread isn't rising very well.)  I'll be ordering another bag today.  I've heard a better way to store it is to keep a small amount in a small jar in the refrigerator, and the rest a sealed bag in the freezer.  I'll try that with this next batch!
