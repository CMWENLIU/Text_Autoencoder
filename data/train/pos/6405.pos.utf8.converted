I have enjoyed Twinings teas for, oh, more than 20 years now. I was immediately suspicious of this new blend, if only because Twinings seemed to be attempting to capitalize on people's renewed appreciation for the tradition of afternoon tea. Too often, especially in America, this meal is referred to as "high tea" to make it sound like a fancy event, even though high tea and afternoon tea differ in ways that have nothing to do with elegance. English Afternoon Tea sounded a little quaint, and Twinings already offers so many varieties of tea that it was hard to believe there could be anything new that would be worthwhile.<br /><br />As it happens, this tea is my new favorite. It doesn't have the dainty flavorings or fragrance of Earl Grey or Lady Grey, my former favorites, nor does it contain the thundering levels of caffeine in English or Irish Breakfast Tea. Instead, it includes elements from both ends of the spectrum. Like the Lady and the Earl, it has little enough caffeine that I can toss back cup after cup without getting jumpy. And like the breakfast teas, it has more of a bold black-tea edge that in this case isn't masked by bergamot or citrus notes. But with English Afternoon Tea, this edge is mellower and more refined than in the breakfast teas. It has more interest and character than a simple orange pekoe (the baseline for black tea) but without resorting to bitter or acerbic flavors.<br /><br />Any tea drinker should enjoy English Afternoon Tea. It's surprisingly good, and despite the name, it's a fine way to start the day. I only wonder why Twinings didn't come up with it sooner!<br /><br />One final thought: Adding a little milk to tea--never cream, although at afternoon tea, it's properly called cream--causes the tannins in the tea to attack the milk proteins. As a result, the tannins are neutralized and won't attack your tongue. What this means for you is that the tea will cause less of the dry, mouth-puckering sensation you might have encountered eating walnuts or drinking dry red wine. If you've never tried milk in your tea, I recommend adding just a little.<br /><br />For a fascinating little blurb about how tea led to urbanization (who knew?), click here. This brief book excerpt is interesting, and not only because it includes the wonderful phrase "microbial holocaust"!<br /><br />http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2007/07/did_tea_drinking_lead_to_urban.php
