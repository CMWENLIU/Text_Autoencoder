I am not a great chef, but I can follow directions.  I have gotten good results from my bread machine with plain white bread (on the basic setting with light crust), but I wanted something more interesting.  When I saw the reviews for the Prepared Pantry breads, I ordered several, including this english muffin bread mix.  When the directions said "use a thermometer", I listened.  I used a meat thermometer (which worked just fine) and made sure the water was within a few degrees of 80.  The bread came out perfectly (again on the basic setting with the light crust).  When I went back to write this review, I looked at the picture posted with this mix, and my bread came out exactly the same (after being sliced and toasted for about four minutes).  I am very satisfied with this product, and am looking forward to testing the other mixes I bought, including Black Russian and two different cinnamon breads.  I would definitely recommend this bread!
