You'd think it'd be fairly simple, you order 6" bully sticks, you get 6" bully sticks...that seems to be the exception though and luckily Shadow River is that exception.  They are honest about what they are advertising and send you exactly what you bought, 6" bully sticks.  So many other bully stick sellers on Amazon advertise 6" and send you 4" instead, others advertise "thick" and just take hollowed out ones that make them look thick and send to you when there's actually less to it than a regular bully stick.  I'm glad to have finally found a company who is reliable, honest and fair.  I will be buying my bully sticks from you every time now.  Thank you Shadow River for being the exception!!!
