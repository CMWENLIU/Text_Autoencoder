These let you make a baked apple in the microwave in 4 minutes or less with no mess.  Yummy warm treat for breakfast, dessert, whenever...<br />I used the one I got all the time and then decided to get them as a cute small holiday gift for the teachers at my kids' school (an apple for the teacher, ha ha).  I included a baked apple that I made that morning in tupperware, and a little recipe tag along with this apple baker.
