Yes, they are delicious. There is no doubt that the chocolate, peanut butter, and crisp, blend to make the most irresistible flavor ever invented, but to package them in 2 packs! Amazing. This would get a 4 star rating if they were individually packaged, but because of the pairing, this earns a full 5 star review.<br /><br />I wish that the bars would hold up to heat a little bit better. Even my immense body heat melts the chocolate on my fingers, forcing me to have to lick them off. Possible infection to airborne pathogens can occur, causing vomiting, sickness or dizziness.<br /><br />I also feel that they could have made the bars a little smaller; maybe bite size. Unfortunately, when you break the bar in half, you get crumbs. This can lead to ants on your floor, carpet or cement basement floor. Also, despite the risk of fireants, can pose a health risk to your dog, which we all know should not ingest chocolate in any way.<br /><br />In the end, I think the bars are a well rounded treat that are made in everyone's favorite math shape, the rectangle; or, when looked at on an angle, the parallelogram.
