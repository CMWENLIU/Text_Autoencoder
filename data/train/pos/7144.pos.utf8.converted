I started buying this product when the price of powdered milk at the grocery store went up and it tasted terrible.  I used the powdered milk in my homemade bread and sometimes the granules wouldn't dissolve.  Nido is a fine powder and dissolves instantly. It works great in bread and other baking,plus it works great as an instant milk for regular drinking. I also like the fact that now the Nido from Holland is available. I use to buy the Nido from Mexico in my local supermarket, but it has not been available for almost a year now.  If you don't like powdered milk, try this one, I think you will be impressed.
