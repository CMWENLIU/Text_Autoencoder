My Husband and I went to a Farm Dinner in Boulder, CO in the middle of mosquito season.  I bought this Repel Sportsmen Max Deet Lotion at Target as a "just in case" back up.  The OFF spray the farm provided didn't help at all!  But this lotion, you'd literally see a mosquito land on us, then jump off immediately within seconds -- The whole table of 35 people ended up passing it around.  WE WERE SAVED!!!<br /><br /> - Not a strong odor (unlike the spray)<br /> - Lotion doesn't last 10 hrs but long enough to relax and reapply about 3 or 4 hrs later<br /> - OK to put on face<br /> - OK on clothes -- Just rub it on your palms before applying to clothing (It didn't leave any stains or ruin the material when we did that at the Farm Dinner)
