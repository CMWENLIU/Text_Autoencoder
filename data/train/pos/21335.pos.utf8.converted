I strongly disagree with the review that said that this soup was horribly bland.  I found this soup to be absolutely delicious! Plain black bean soup can be very earthy tasting, but this soup was the perfect blend of the black beans and a variety of organic vegetables, including onions, carrots, celery, leeks, potatoes and corn. It's high in protein and fiber, *extremely* low in fat, and the sodium level is not as bad as a lot of other soups. It is such a delight to be able to find a canned soup that is not only fresh-tasting and delicious, but also totally organic.<br /><br />I plan to buy a case of this soup...Amazon's price ends up being $1.72 per can for the case of 12 cans, with no tax or shipping charges. Our local grocery stores charge $2.19 per can + sales tax, so buying it by the case at Amazon saves me $6.00 for the 12 cans.<br /><br />You should buy a single can of this soup first (in your local grocery store) to try it. Then if you love it as much as I do, you can buy the case (of 12 cans) at Amazon and save yourself some money.
