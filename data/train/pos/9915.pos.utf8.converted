I'm a new mom and so obviously to get rid of the baby weight going sugar free is a good start.  I'm not going to kid myself... does anything sugar free/healthier for us ever taste exactly as good as the real deal... probably not. This syrup, however, is VERY deelish!  I used to be addicted to a certain chain coffee place's pumpkin spice lattes, but this is a great alternative!  Make a latte with the syrup put a little fat free whip cream on top with sprinkled cinnamon and who need that "other place"?!  I would definitely recommend this syrup to a friend!
