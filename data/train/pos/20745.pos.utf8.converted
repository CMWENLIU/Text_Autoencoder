After trying MANY other foods I finally found this one!  I've found the food for us!  It's LESS expensive than most the other "premium" dog foods, and has better or equivalent ingredients!  My Black Lab Jade just would stick her nose up at other foods, but she goes crazy over this stuff, even has turned down canned food for it!  Both she and our four month old Golden Retriever's coats are softer than ever, and after two months time they still love the taste.  Never had a problem with their stools or throwing up.  AND, what I like best, is it's ALL stages of life, I can have both puppy and adult on the same food without worry!  Talk about saving out of pocket!  As y ou all can imagine, puppy wouldn't stay at his dish, he had to go to the other's dish, and vice versa.  Which concerned me, as adults eating puppy food, is not healthy.  Less money, taste tested, and great results in the coat/stool testings....  THANK YOU TOTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />And to think, we don't even get bison or venison every day!!!!!!!!!!  They eat better than most folks!
