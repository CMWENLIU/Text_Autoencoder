Amaranth flour has a very earthy and nutty flavor.  The flavor is stronger than many other whole grains.  It pairs nicely with other assertive flavors but may be too much on its own.  I used it in a recipe for corn fritters (lots of spices and served over black beans) and it was excellent (even my three year old loved it).  Amaranth is a grain with a lot of fat (heart healthy fat) so it needs to be stored in the fridge or freezer or it will go rancid.  Amaranth is an excellent source of protein, calcium, and iron.  Its considered a super grain because of its high nutrional content.<br /><br />If you are looking for ways to add whole grains to your diet I would suggest trying this grain. Bob's Red Mill is usually a good bet for these types of products.  I have always had very good luck with this brand (always high quality).
