This vinegar is wonderful.  It's a huge bottle and the taste is beyond compare.  When Sherry vinegar is called for in a recipe, there is no alternative for its sweet, pungy flavor.  However, I use this vinegar for salad dressings and in place of red wine vinegar.  I purchased it only a few weeks ago and it is half gone.  I will be ordering again.
