Sriracha is a chili garlic sauce. Any good Sriracha should have a very short list of ingredients (Chili, sugar, garlic, salt, distilled vinegar, potassium sorbate and sodium disulfite as preservaties, and xanthan gum). As far as many are concerned Huy Fong (with the distinctive rooster label) is the best of the best. It has a crazy good fresh chili taste, with a good bite of garlic and a sweet background. This is not "heat" for "heat's" sake. You eat this sauce for the flavor and either enjoy, or deal with, the heat. If you're a chili head this sauce rates about a medium. For everyone else it is quite hot.
