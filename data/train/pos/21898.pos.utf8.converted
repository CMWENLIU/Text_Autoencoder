I chew an inordinate amount of gum-- I have a dry mouth from medication, and I'm also losing weight--so no munching--and this is great stuff. It does hold a nice flavor for a long time (not as long as spearmint, but longer than any other peppermint gum I know of), and it has a nice springy texture that doesn't get hard or stick to my teeth, and it's a nice sized piece, too--not too big and not too small. I have ordered several "cases" of this from Amazon--it's hard to find in bulk in stores, and Amazon's price is excellent!
