I love this tea so much! It makes me feel just like Captain Picard when I drink it. I like Captain Picard. I want to be just like him (except not bald because that's kinda not cool). Anyway, I like to heat up this tea in my microwave oven, and I say to it "Tea, Earl Grey, hot" and it's just like I'm talking to the replicator on the Enterprise! It even beeps! It's so cool. It makes me feel like I'm really in Star Trek. The only problem is that I can't talk as cool as Captain Picard so I sound kinda dumb when I say it. But I still do. When I buy this tea from the store, I like to ask the clerk to get me "Tea, Earl Grey, Bigelow". I think that's pretty funny. I make sure to use the English accent because if I didn't it wouldn't be right. Then I sit in front of the TV, and say "engage" as I press the button on my remote! I LOVE this tea!
