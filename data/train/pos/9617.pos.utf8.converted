I've been branching out into various grains in the past year and amaranth is one of the newer ones for me. I think it tastes great (seems a little "nutty" tasting), but like others here, I don't know what I can do with it. What I DO though, is cook it up as a cereal according to the package directions, then put about 1 t Vietnamese Ground Cinnamon (this is the BEST cinnamon ever!!) for a topping. Yum!<br /><br />As for Bob's Red Mill, they get five stars for sure... I like their company quite a lot and use other grains they sell besides the amaranth. I highly recommend them.
