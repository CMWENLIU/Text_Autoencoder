I was crossing my fingers when these arrived that they wouldn't be like gummy bears.  They weren't.  They are like tuff dots.  Like licorice should be.  I really had to do a double take at the package to make sure they were indeed sugar free.  I just couldn't tell.  I haven't eaten them in great amounts maybe 10 at a time and haven't had any intestinal problems like some other sugar free candy does.  This is my new favorite candy.
