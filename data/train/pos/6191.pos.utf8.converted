Who ever the person is that said this stuff tastes like nail polish must have just swallowed a bottle of it then taken a bite of the peanut butter because there is not other reason that I can think of for them to make that assessment.<br /><br />This stuff is fabulous!  If your looking for chunky, this is not for you.  It has a nice sweet flavor, which makes it extra nice if your out of jelly or jam because it can work nicely on it's own.  :)  It's also very smooth and soft and extremely spreadable.  I have been very into PB&J lately and am just flying through my jars.<br /><br />I live by this stuff and recomend that everyone give it a try but PLEASE realize that it's okay if you don't love it.  You must remember that it's not your old school basic Jif.  It's low cal and just different, but that doesn't make it bad.  Oh, it's so good and I can't wait to have my PB&J tomorrow....maybe I'll have one for dinner, my mouth is watering for it right now.  :)
