To reiterate what M. Collins stated in his/her review "People please keep in mind that the Mocha means Indonesian and Ethiopian bean blended coffee. It is not a Mocha Chocolate as some are used to. It is usually named MOKA JAVA" Thank for that great tip.<br /><br />For a medium blend this is a smooth full bodied coffee with little acidity and after taste. I don't like a coffee that stays on your palate and with you most of the day. I drink my coffee with Liquid creamer and a sugar Substitute. Great flavor if you don't like a coffee that "bites Back"
