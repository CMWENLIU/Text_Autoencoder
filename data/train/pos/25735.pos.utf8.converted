Numi is the best tea on the planet! This is indefinitely the only tea brand that I drink! If I cannot find it in the stores, I will wait it out until my order comes. This Puerh tea works! I used to wear a size 8 and within 1 or 2 months I am now a size 6. I expect to be down to my initial size 3 or 4 but I am happy with a 6! However, I will have you know that I cut out driving and am now a happy public transit rider and an avid walker. The taste is wonderful and it does give you energy! WARNING: Do not drink after 9pm; it kept me up until 2am. LOL!
