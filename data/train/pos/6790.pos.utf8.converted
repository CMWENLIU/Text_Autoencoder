So I was looking around the internet for reviews on this and I noticed there really are none.  This drink is not a necessary need for a Gears of War fan, but it is funny to have.  Imulsion, in Gears of War, is alternative fuel that gives humans a horrible lung disease and turns Locust into horrible mutated monsters.  That, and the fact that no nutritional information or taste-reviews for this product lead me to believe that anyone who has tried it has died.  Cheers!
