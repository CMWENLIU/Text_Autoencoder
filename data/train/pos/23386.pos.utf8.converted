The Good Health Humbles product line of their Natural Products is an excellent, tasty, potato chip alternative for consumers interested in eating more consciously to maintain good health.  I tried a single bag, purchased at a natural foods co-op, before deciding to splurge the 12-pack offered here on Amazon.com, and I was deliciously impressed by the taste and flavor of these chips!  This line of all natural snacks offers three taste sensations: Sesame Garlic, Olive Oil Lemon & Feta, and Roasted Red Pepper, as offered here.<br /><br />As soon as I bit into one of these chips, I knew there was no going back to regular grocery store offerings.  As someone who is trying to improve my diet, while also leaving a little wiggle room for eating healthier versions of the foods I love, Good Health Humbles fits in nicely, offering me a snack with 60% less fat than ordinary potato chips, with no cholesterol, and 3 grams of protein per serving!  When a crunchy-food craving hits, this product is something you can feel good about eating.<br /><br />For those concerned specifically about the nutritional value, I assure you this line of products is a healthier choice than your typical bag of chips: with only 4 grams of fat per serving, and 120 calories with no saturated or trans fats, this product also offers 1 gram of fiber per serving, with a only a small amount of sugar (1 gram), and a low amount of sodium (125 mg).<br /><br />Amazon.com offers a great value on these products.  As compared to the Good Health Natural Products website, Amazon.com's price is a huge enticement to shop here, when you compare it to the $30.95 you would pay for the same order directly through the company.<br /><br />After trying multiple so-called "healthier" chip options, I feel I have finally found one I fill good about eating, even when I devour the whole bag in one sitting!  ***Warning - this is  a likely occurrence once you've tasted one of these chips!***
