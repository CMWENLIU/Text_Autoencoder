This product is a great substitute for sugar in drinks.  It doesn't have a funny aftertaste or change the taste of the drinks I put it in.  Obviously, it's a good alternative for sugar, but another reason I purchased it was because of it's benefit on teeth.  Xylitol is used in other countries (I've read) to fight tooth decay and improve oral health in adults and children alike (You must used 8-10 grams daily for this benefit).  My husband and I both use the toothpaste (also excellent) and gum.  Last week I saw a dentist on primetime TV doing a show on oral health, and he strongly recommended Xylitol for children also.
