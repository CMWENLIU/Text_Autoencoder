Unlike other so-called honey powders, this one is 100% granulated honey with no fillers. Because it is granulated instead of powdered it does not lump. It is easily poured, measured, and spooned. It dissolves quickly and completely. We like it in tea and on cereal. We haven't tried it in baking yet, but intend to. Organic is an added bonus.<br /><br />The package is plastic/foil with a zipper closure so it stays dry. For me, it's worth the premium price.
