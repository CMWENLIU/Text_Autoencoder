Have purchased some Bar Harbor Herring on Amazon, found Look's sardines at Big Lots for $2/can. Fantastic, both in the normal smoked, cracked pepper, and ground mustard versions. If you have any inclination at all toward this type of food, it is probably the best around, buy them here or there or anywhere!! Look's is the parent company of Bar Harbor and maybe others. I'm pretty sure this is the same thing. They are juicy, tender, meaty, delicious, and good for you. IMHO.<br /><br />BTW, after a bit of research, I've found that Sardines and Herring can be the same thing! Seems a moderate number of related fish fit either category. One interesting yet not surprising fact is that some companies cut off just the part with the tail and sell them as sardines. Nothing like the middle part IMHO.<br /><br />See also Woody Allen's 'love and death.'<br /><br />Mike
