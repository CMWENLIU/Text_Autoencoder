Although the Sun Brand Madras curry powder tastes a little different from other brands that were listed on Amazon a couple of years ago, this stuff is still excellent! It has a slightly deeper orange hue than other Madras curries I've come across, so don't be too surprised if your curry isn't as yellow. If you purchased the Roland curries (red, cylindrical container; also in 1 pound lots), be aware that the Sun Brand is a little saltier and spicier so you won't need to use as much!<br /><br />I love making curried chicken legs with an apple jelly-based sauce, and this brand of powder goes just as well as the others I've tried. If you plan on following recipes from Cuisine at Home and other similar publications, you're going to need a *lot* of curry, and purchasing through Amazon is the best (and cheapest) method available. I typically purchase between 4 and 8 pounds every year or two from Amazon, and nothing makes for a better method of entertaining guests than an exotic (but not quite Indian) dish with an American twist!<br /><br />Edit: It seems some other reviews mention the strong, salty flavor of this curry. I don't notice it so much for what I use it for, but if you're trying to watch your sodium intake, be aware that this curry might contain FAR more sodium than you'd expect. I'd strongly recommend looking for the Roland Madras curry (you can search for that exact term--but be aware that it isn't often listed because it's VERY popular stuff) as it is of superior quality and flavor. This stuff makes an excellent substitute, though.<br /><br />Also, I neglected to notice a comment to my review some one year ago requesting the recipe I mentioned. Assuming I don't get slapped with a DMCA take down by the magazine I borrowed it from (and modified), I've attached it in the comments to this review.<br /><br />Enjoy!
