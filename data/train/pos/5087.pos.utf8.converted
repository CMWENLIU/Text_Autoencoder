I try to drink 1-3 cups of green tea everyday and this was a great way to try out so many different Stash green teas at once.<br /><br />The varieties included were (ordered May 2010):<br /><br />Chai Green - Very good chai, one of my favorites. Better than Celestial<br />Fusion Breakfast - Too much going on- mix of Indian Assam, Indonesian Black, Chinese Green, Japanese Green, African Black, and Japanese Matcha<br />Fusion Green & White - Good if you can't decide to have white tea or green tea, which happens every so often to me<br />Ginger Peach - not my cuppa, too much ginger and difficult to find the peach flavor<br />Organic Premium Green - very good<br />Moroccan Mint - Excellent, not quite as minty as peppermint herbal tea, but a nice balance of mint and green flavors<br />Pomegranate Raspberry - meh, okay when you're craving fruity but I wouldn't invest in a case of this<br />Premium Green - very good<br />Decaf Premium Green - Excellent, my kids drink this often<br /><br />After drinking tea for years with or without sweetener (no milk) I made a mistake one morning and put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC">Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup</a> into my tea with some cream (thinking it was coffee!) and I was blown away with the smooth, mellow taste. I now drink my tea with a little vanilla syrup and cream (less than I would use in coffee) and it's such an amazing flavor - like dessert. My daughter thinks it tastes like Yoplait vanilla yogurt. I highly recommend this!!!
