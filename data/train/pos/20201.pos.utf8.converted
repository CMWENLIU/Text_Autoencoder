I've bought other products, like Macho Stix, and my Bernese Mountain Dog--young, slightly hyper-active and a very aggressive chewer--makes short work of them.  Even a "long" macho stick would only last him about 15 minutes. Alas, he's completely indifferent to all plastic bones, sterilized cooked bones, and other substitutes for rawhide.<br /><br />A single Green Cow bone lasts him about a hour and half.  Great entertainment and mental exercise--when he's done, he plops down very contentedly for a nice long rest, all hyper-activity expended.  He's in no danger of choking because there are no "knots" on the end that he can swallow whole.  (We watched  him very carefully the first 10 times we gave him one, but he chews the pieces up very carefully and slowly).<br /><br />He ADORES these bones! He gets three a week and we make the most of them--makes him very motivated when we do obedience training, for he'll jump through hoops to get one of these!  Highly recommend.
