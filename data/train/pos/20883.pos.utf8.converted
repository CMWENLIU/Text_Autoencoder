These are excellent.  Sweet and just a tad tart.  They are sweet cause they inject them with concentrated apple juice.  No added sugar.  They are soft without being sticky.  I buy a lot of dried fruit from freeze dried to "soft" dried and these are by far the best of all of them.  I only received 3 pouches in the pack (description says 4) and I emailed customer service.  They immediately reshipped the product for free and I only received 3 again (I am not complaining as I now got 6 for the price of 4), but beware that you may only receive 3.
