I have had many different kinds of grits and these are superior to all.  They are "slow-cooking" grits, which are the best in my opinion.  The texture is amazing and it is hard to eat any other brand after having these.  Now, since they are slow-cooking grits, the directions say they take 1 hour to cook.  That is easily remedied by simply pre-soaking the grits the night before you cook them.  After 8 hours of soaking overnight, they take a mere 15-20 minutes to cook.  Not to mention if you need them to be ready for dinner, the grits "pre-soaking time" can be dramatically reduced to 3-4 hours if you soak them in HOT water.<br /><br />All that being said, I noticed for several different kinds of grits sold on Amazon that many reviewers claim those grits to be the best they had.  It begs the question, what is so distinctive about Carolina Plantation grits?  Simple put: the texture.  Unlike most grits (especially quick cooking grits), Carolina Plantation grits have a nutty texture to them.  It is the difference between regular oatmeal vs steel cut oats.  These grits are robust and you can taste all the tiny "kernals" as you eat a mouthful.<br /><br />Thus if you prefer the more "porridge" texture for grits, then do not get these.  However, if you like a more nutty texture, Carolina Plantation grits are unsurpassed!<br /><br />UPDATE:  As of 2-23-11, the grits are "currently unavailable".  Just type in "CAROLINA PLANTATION" in Google and their website pulls up easily.  The prices on their website is still reasonable.  Enjoy!
