I'm on a low-carb diet that involves eating lots of fat-free yogurt, which gets boring with just vanilla flavoring. While these flavors are probably more suitable for baking, I've found them an enjoyable addition to yogurt and soy. My collection included hazelnut and raspberry instead of coconut and rose. For me, the standouts were the hazelnut, coffee, raspberry and mango (which has a surprising natural, fresh flavor). The only real loser was lime, which has a weak, Lifesaver-type flavor. The rum and chocolate aren't to my taste, but I imagine those flavors are very difficult to mimic. Overall, I'm pleased and will be ordered a couple of flavors individually when my little 1-ounce bottles are empty.
