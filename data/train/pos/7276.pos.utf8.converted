This product is evidently produced in Canada, probably in New Brunswick, from wild herring harvested in or about the Bay of Fundy or the Gulf of Maine.<br /><br />The herring are filleted and then lightly smoked before canning. The result is a delicious, healthy and wholesome<br />food item that mates well with warm, crusty French bread or multi-grain crackers. Highly recommended.
