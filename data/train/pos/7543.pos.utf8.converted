I like to consider myself an expert on dirty martinis. Most people<br />think just buying a good vodka or gin is the answer. They are sorely<br />mistaken. The olive juice is what you need to perfect. Fortunately,<br />it has been done for all of us.  Dirty Sue is by far the best olive<br />juice on the market. I was introduced to it at a party and it is<br />fantastic. Most other brands (and I've tried them all) are basically<br />salt water with a hint of olive. Dirty Sue is the perfect blend. It<br />actually has a very nice olive flavor with a subtle bite of salt. I<br />don't know how they do it, but please, keep doing it!
