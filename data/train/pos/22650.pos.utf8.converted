We're suffering a heat wave, and it was a sweltering 103 degrees here yesterday. Since my air conditioner went out and the repairman couldn't come until Monday, my daughter Allie decided to get me out of the heat ... a drive to see some friends, followed by a nice dinner in a cool, relaxing restaurant.<br /><br />The ac in her car felt like Heaven, so after I got comfortable, I reached for my water bottle.  When I did, Allie handed me this tiny packet (resembled an elongated version of those packets of salt in fast-food places), instructing me to pour it into my water. She knew I liked Crystal Light lemonade, so thought I would like this too. My bottle held 16.9 ounces of water and since I had already drunk half, it was perfect for eight ounces of this delicious drink. I tapped the powder into the water, swirled the bottle to mix it well, then took a sample sip. I liked it so well, I gulped with gusto.<br /><br />I've always appreciated the health benefits of green tea and the flavor of mangos, so it was a no-brainer that I'd like this tasty beverage. How well my daughter knows me!<br /><br />Allie nodded when I told her I had never seen these tiny packets, since the lemonade had come in small tubs that made an entire pitcher, and she laughed when I raved over the convenience and ease of use, marveling at the genius of the manufacturer.<br /><br />When I came on-line to order this viitamin-enhanced green tea peach mango mixture and the lemonade for the kids, I did some quick math, realizing that when mixed with filtered tap water, the price per eight ounces is thirty-two and one-quarter cents a bottle. I prefer the 16-oz. bottles, so I use two of these packets, which figures to be sixty-four and a-half cents. ... Much cheaper than soda--and decidedly tastier and healthier!<br /><br />I ordered this mixture for myself and lemonade flavor for my grandchildren. Johnny doesn't like water too much, so hogs every bottle of soda that we buy. I plan to give him his own supply to take to school because they fit so easily into his pocket and are so easy to mix on the run.<br /><br />One final tip Allie passed on: Some of her friends simply add a half- or fourth-packet, preferring a milder refreshing.  Sounds good to me!  Thanks, Allie ... not only for treating me to dinner but for introducing me to a healthy new taste treat, one that I can mix on the go!<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: Millennium Babe: The Prophecy
