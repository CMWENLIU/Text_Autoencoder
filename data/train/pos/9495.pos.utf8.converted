Half the usual retail price and you get top quality.  This is a time-tested breakfast blend available at a good price in a reasonable quanity.  And that's not all, you get a cute little tin box easily converted to a piggy bank or treasure chest.  I use it straight and also blend it with other teas.  But, don't overdo, this tea packs a respectable caffein punch.  Best with plenty of milk and sugar to start your engine.
