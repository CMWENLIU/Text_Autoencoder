I don't see how anyone couldn't like this food. Our cat, a male about seven years old, hated any canned food. This is the only one he will touch! Our new kitten loves it also--she is about a year old. She eats a can per day. She was undernourished and had been viciously attacked out in the wild and on top of that had had a litter of kittens, even though she was still a kitten herself. This food has helped her so much. She is bright eyed and plays and looks like a different cat since we started her on this.
