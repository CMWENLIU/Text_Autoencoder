Has anyone noticed that none of the Betty Crocker Gluten Free mixes have gotten any negative feedback from anyone who has actually TRIED the product?  Just a lot of whining from people who complain about how hard it is to research a gluten free diet but then don't even know enough to call Betty Crocker if they have a question.  I have Celiac disease too and am just thankful the disease is getting enough attention that a mainstream manufacturer will invest huge $$$ in developing products for us.  Pick up a phone if you have any questions for pete's sake!
