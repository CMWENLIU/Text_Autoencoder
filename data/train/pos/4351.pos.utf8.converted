i first tasted this in my school's cafe. Im crazy about everything in this tea! sage is on my favorite herb list and blackberry is on my favorite fruit list. The tea steeps pretty strong, and is flavorful enough to consume without sweetner. This is my favorite tea at the moment next to anything green tea or chamomile. good stuff!
