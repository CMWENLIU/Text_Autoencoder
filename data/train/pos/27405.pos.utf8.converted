If you have a Shih Tzu this is the dog food for him or her. Our little Shih Tzu (Tasha) is around 13 years old, had dry skin and was overweight. We've gone through two 10 lb bags and her condition has completely changed. Her skin is not dry any more and she is losing weight. We are feeding her the recommended amount which is 1 cup a day divided into two 1/2 cup meals. She acts better and as I said her skin is no longer dried out and she doesn't sit there and scratch and lick like she normally does during this dry Northeast Winter. She is losing weight which we are thrilled about and is more active.<br />Compare the ingredients in this to an off the shelf brand like Pur--- F-t & Tr-m. What you will find is staggering and unhealthy for your little pooch. Switching to Royal Canin has made a real healthy difference for our Tasha. Yes, it does cost more per bag, but when you use it in the amounts recommended it lasts longer.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9WUG0">Royal Canin Dry Dog Food, Shih Tzu 24 Formula, 10-Pound Bag</a>
