I've been eating this wild rice for years. I order it directly from the native American community that hand harvests and dries the wild rice. Now it's much more convenient to order from Amazon. I first bought the rice because my grandmother could no longer send me the two or three pounds of native wild rice she gave me each year for holiday meals...so I ordered a pound of Bineshii wild rice.<br /><br />What a surprise! This natural grown wild rice is far superior to the varieties grown on gigantic agribusiness farms in California. It is one of the very best Native American harvested products I've ever tasted. It cooks much more quickly and reliably than agribusiness wild rice, and the taste and texture is very nutty and so delicious. Bineshii wild rice does cost more than mass produced rice, but this is the real thing, and the real thing tastes so much better. My family is spoiled now, they notice if the wild rice isn't Bineshii, and complain if I put anything else on the table! Try a pound, you won't be disappointed.
