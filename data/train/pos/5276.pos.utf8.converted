If you are walking in Rome and you see a Bar that brews Illy coffee to their customers, I would suggest that you walk in and have your espresso there. You won't regret it. It is just a better espresso!! I can now say the same for american coffee. Since I started drinking coffee in the US, I was curious to try all the different brands: the affordable ones and the very expensive ones. Illy Medium Roast for drip coffeemaker is the best I have ever had. I use a very cheap coffeemaker and the coffee still comes out good. My only objection to Mr. Illy is that he should try to lower the price. [...] bucks for 8 oz. is a little to expensive for everyday coffee!!
