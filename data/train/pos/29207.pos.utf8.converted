i know there are finer beans out there at a greater cost, but at anywhere near this price you would be hard pressed to beat this coffee.  even though at this time there is only one other review, i tried out coffee bean direct based on the strength of reviews here on amazon on several of their other varieties - if you do a search, you will see that amazon carries many other beans by this company.<br /><br />before ordering, i also googled the company, i suggest you do the same to see all the different varieties they have to offer at coffee bean direct dot com (it's still cheaper to order through amazon due to no shipping cost).  i chose this particular bean because the roast is medium - we've been using a darker roast in the past because my wife typically likes her coffee beans heavily roasted.  however, we recently got a new coffee maker as an anniversary gift from my parents (the capresso coffee team gs - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EVOVPI">Capresso 464.05 CoffeeTeam GS 10-Cup Digital Coffeemaker with Conical Burr Grinder</a> - a very nice grinder/brewer combo with which we are quite pleased) that is more versatile than our cheap burr grinder and french press combo of the past.  anyway, that's a long story, the point of which is that i wanted a coffee that i could grind on the fine setting on our new coffee maker, and this one seemed like it would produce a nice brew on the finest grind - and now that we've lived with this coffee for a few days, i'm happy to report that you grind this up nice and fine and squeeze all the subtle flavors out of that way if you so choose.<br /><br />this coffee is as the way coffee bean direct describes it on their website description and accompanying roast/acidity/body chart - it is a nice bodied coffee with medium acidity and a lot of flavor (my wife and i both think it has fruit notes in it, especially as it nears room temperature).  i'm quite pleased with it, and i plan to try another of their beans as soon as we go through these five pounds we have now.
