My 2-year old cat Ezekiel, adopted from a shelter 3 months ago, will eat NOTHING but Taste of the Wild dry food.  My first choice would be a raw-food diet, but I'm too lazy to keep that up except for supplementing. However, Ezekiel won't eat fresh salmon, chicken, chicken liver, beef, or anything fresh.  He won't eat any other high-quality cat food dry or wet.  He won't eat any cheap store brand.<br /><br />It's Taste of the Wild or starve.  I am comfortable with this formula because of what I have read, and because he is thriving, healthy, and has an especially shiny coat and is in altogether top-notch shape.<br /><br />Yet, since I believe wet or raw food is best for cats (I had a cat who required a PU after repeated bladder infections and who re-blocked whenever he had any dry food), no matter how high quality the dry food, I was eager to buy the canned food.<br /><br />At first, Ezekiel turned up his nose at it as he does at all food except Taste of the Wild Dry.  Then, we got a new 12-week old girl kitten, Ariel.  She is teaching him all sorts of adventurous things.  Is she does it, he does it (and vice-versa). She LOVES it, ergo HE loves it.<br /><br />Now they both lap it up quickly, and I'm thrilled that they are eating good food.<br /><br />So, I give both products several thumbs up.
