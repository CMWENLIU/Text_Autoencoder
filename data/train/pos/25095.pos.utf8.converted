We eat lentils about once a week as they are one of the more nutritious foods in existence. I have fewer 'rejects' than with other brands and they cook up quickly nice and tender without turning to mush. I sautee my veggies first: all small dice: a couple of serranos (since we eat spicy--this is optional), a large onion, a couple of carrots, lots of celery, a whole garlic fist, tomatoes (I often just use a can of organic diced tomatoes, sometimes fire-roasted), sometimes leeks (although i put those in later or they will disappear) with whole cumin seed, oregano, turmeric and curry powder (I use the Simply Organic brand which I like the best after much exploration). Seasonings can vary. Coarse grind black pepper. A little trocomare or herbamare depending if I make my own stock, use prepackaged or just water. Sometimes add leftover chicken or lamb. After the veggies are quite sauteed add the liquid and lentils and bring to slow simmer. Do not let them boil hard but they need to slow simmer to cook. Hmmmm. I may need to go make some now. Especially delicious the second and third days. I add fresh parsley just as serving or sometimes serve over fresh spinach to just slightly cook it. Pita or cornbread goes well. My family enjoys different types of cheese as topping.<br /><br />I am on my third order of these and have yet to find a stone.<br /><br />Update: When I really did just go make these I realized that those unused to using bulk products may not know you need to sort through any product like this. I just pour them into a container and then have another container to slowly pour them into as I sort through them. My new shipment are the BEST lentils I have EVER used in about fifty years anywhere. Only had about ten discards (any lentil that I would not want to eat and I am very picky--broken, dirty, etc.)<br /><br />Also, I just read the instructions on the package which do not make clear that you need to sort through and then rinse the lentils before using. Do not salt any bean-type product until the end or they will be tough.<br /><br />I don't use recipes so I realize that my seasoning amounts are unclear. The only thing you need to add right away to the saute is if you use cumin seed. You can always add more of everything else later. If you want it spicier you can also add something like cayenne, even after serving. I forgot to mention that I sautee all my veggies in a bit of coconut oil for health reasons (it is the only stable oil). You do not taste this later and I finish it at the end of cooking with some good olive oil.<br /><br />When I mentioned the fist of garlic: this must be minced. I use a meat cleaver to smash the cloves to peal more easily and then fine dice. Wait ten more minutes to allow the allicin to develop DONT WAIT LONGER. Allicin is the anticarcinogenic property of garlic and must be exposed to oxygen to develop, but it will start to diminish after about fourteen minutes.<br /><br />OK--there is my novel on cooking lentils! Hope this is useful to someone.
