I have tried several Kashi TLC bars... I like most of them, but this is by far my favorite flavor, and at 120 calories per bar I don't feel like I'm "breaking the bank."  They are satisfying and good for a quick snack when you're on the go.  A smooth layer of chocolate adorns the top, with nuts and coconut.  The chocolate is mixed with dates and other fruits to make it sweeter.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say about these bars - except they're delicious and you should try them.  Hope this helps!
