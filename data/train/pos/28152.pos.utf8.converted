I love having a cup of Dandelion Root Tea to start my day.  I have fibroid and needed to give up my coffee habit.  This tea is slightly bitter but with a teaspoon of honey, it is nice and smooth.  It is relaxing to sip on and ease into your day.<br /><br />I do a routine of this tea for 3 to 4 weeks and then switch over to Red Raspberry tea.  This routine plus some other natural remedies have resulted in decreased complications from my fibroid.<br /><br />I am an Amazon Prime member and this item was delivered in 1 day.
