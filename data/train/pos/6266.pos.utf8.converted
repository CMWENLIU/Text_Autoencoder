I've been eating Familia since I was in college in the late 60's (it was just the red box then). The taste and quality have never declined. The "no added sugar" version is even better than the original. The price Amazon offers with a subscription is awesome. Mix 1/2 cup Familia with 3/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt, take your shower, and come back to a wonderful breakfast.
