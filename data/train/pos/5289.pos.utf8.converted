So far, I've grown lettuce and gourmet herbs in the Aerogarden. The herbs had one failure (the cilantro) and the lettuce grew like gangbusters but didn't seem worth the trouble. Then I planted the French herb garden, wanting to have chervil and savory, among other herbs not commonly available at the grocery.<br /><br />The kit has chervil, sorrel, savory, parsley, Marseilles basil, sage and chives. All of these are quite useful. I might have substituted thyme for the parsley--parsley grows pretty slowly and I think it is a waste in the Aerogarden as it's commonly available in huge bunches at the market. But it is convenient to have this essential herb at your fingertips. Sad to say, one can't have rosemary or tarragon in the Aerogarden. Both of these are woody herbs and don't really grow from seeds. But one can often find pots in the garden center. Maybe with an additional grow-light, I can add them to the kitchen garden. I wonder if the Aerogarden pods could someday be adapted to grow slips of plants like tarragon (shipped live.)<br /><br />All the pods germinated before the estimated time, including chervil which has the longest (3 week) germination. The herbs are growing healthily and quickly. So far, this looks to be the most versatile of the sets I've grown. My previous herb garden resides in a flower pot and is more or less humming along--the basils and mint and chives are doing quite well in soil rather than hydroponics, though they were sulky when transplanted. I may keep this French garden growing indefinitely unless something more interesting crops up.
