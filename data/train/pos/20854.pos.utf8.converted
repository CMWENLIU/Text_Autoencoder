I have almost finished my 1st 10lb bag, and am getting ready to buy at least one more. You just can't beat the value - what a great hedge against rising food prices! I'm not sure the description mentions it, but this is red quinoa. It has a slightly stronger flavor than the golden quinoa I have purchased in grocery stores, but rinsing it in a wire-mesh strainer before cooking removes any bitterness.
