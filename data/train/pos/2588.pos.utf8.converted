All I can say is that I've had the complete opposite experience of the only other reviewer so far... the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino we've made with our machine has been excellent and has not had any of the chemical taste that the other reviewer mentioned.  I don't know why our experiences are so divergent, but we are very happy with our unit and with all of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto capsules we've tried thus far.
