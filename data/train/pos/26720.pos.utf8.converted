I can't believe there aren't any other reviews here yet. These are hands down the best. I bake them a little under done and they are like molten chocolate cakes. Would be great with low carb ice cream. Thrifty's makes some very good ones (even a peanut butter fudge swirl). I swirl almond butter, or splenda sweetened cream cheese, or both into these before baking.  I make some type of low carb dessert whenever we're faced with a holiday or birthday so that we have a legal treat. It helps us to avoid the "illegal" ones. Don't hesitate to try these if you're a low carber and need a treat.
