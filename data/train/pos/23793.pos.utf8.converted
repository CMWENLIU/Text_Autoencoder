This is my first nut milk bag and it works well for me. I usually use a cheese cloth for straining my Almond milk and it was a little more work. I had to be careful the cheese cloth did not slip and create a mess. When I make almond milk, I use a large strainer first, then I use the milk bag to get a smooth, silky almond milk. If you initially pour the almond milk directly from the blender into the milk bag, you would need to squeeze the bag to get your milk. When you squeeze the bag with a large amount of the pulverized almond, the bag could come apart at the seam. If you don't have a strainer, pour small amounts at a time into the milk bag and squeeze to get all the milk. If you are making your own nut milk, it's best to get a large strainer, it's inexpensive. After blending the almond, pour it through the strainer and then through the milk bag. You will get smooth milk with no gritty taste and your nut bag will last longer.
