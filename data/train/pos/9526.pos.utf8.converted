My doctor recommended using coconut oil for cooking.  He said it's better than olive oil at high temperatures and it's good for you.<br />I couldn't find coconut oil anywhere, but purchased on Amazon and this particular one based on the reviews.<br />It does smell good.  It's very easy to use in cooking.  I have used it mostly for scrambled eggs so far.  It melts easily and doesn't taste like coconut eggs!
