This glorious cheese has changed my life for the better.  My mutton, which has been purified in the waters of Lake Minatonka (located in an 18th century cave south of Jerez), will perfectly with a glass of delicious 2003 Buttonwood Farm Winery Savignon Blanc.  This is the perfect jacuzzi cheese, only Humboldt Fog attracts the opposite sex with more vigor and vitality.  Tres mangnifique!
