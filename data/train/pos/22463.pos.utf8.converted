The oats arrived on time and in great condition.  I am going to freeze half of them to keep them out of harm's way while we eat the rest.  If anyone is interested, I put a cup of oats, 4 cups of water, a pinch of salt and a pinch of cinnamon in an over safe casserole.  I place this into the oven at 350' for about 35 minutes, stirring occasionally.I sometimes add a little more water, if I feel it is too thick.  When it is cooled I put the container into the refrigerator.  Both my husband and I eat oatmeal for breakfast.  When he is hungry for his, he scoops out one cup of oatmeal and warms it up in the microwave. He likes to add raisins and brown sugar.  I like mine plain. There is no need to stand over the pot of oatmeal stirring on the stove!  This is a wonderful way to eat healthy and delicious steel cut oats!
