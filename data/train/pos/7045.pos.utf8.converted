i would like to share an afficionado's take on this specific item. through the years i have tried several brands of espresso coffee which i prepare as 'caf&eacute; con leche', espresso with frothed milk and sweetener. (i use honey). caf&eacute; bustelo, consider i, as one of the best. had i my druthers, i would have purchased the decaffeinated version. this, however, was not available at a reasonable price. incidentally, decaffeinated coffee isn't: it simply contains one half the usual amount of caffeine, while preserving the full bouquet of taste and aroma, if properly roasted. i had ordered, through amazon, the 4 ten-ounce bricks, not the cans, which, for some reason, are currently shown as unavailable. they arrived in a timely manner, with a 'best by' date one year and eleven months into the future. to my taste, another top brand is 'el aguilar'. i don't like 'pilon'. there are quite a few other brands of cuban or espresso coffee on the market which i am yet to sample. maybe you'll be the one to try them as well.<br />enjoy!
