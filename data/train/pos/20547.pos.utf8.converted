Eaten cold, this no-sugar-added cereal has a crunchy texture and a pleasantly sweet, subtle flavor, like a more sophisticated twist on Grape-Nuts. But it's when this cereal is served hot that it really shines. In addition to packing far more flavor than oatmeal, it also has the perfect consistency for cooking; somehow, it never seems to stick to the bottom of the pot. And it takes just a few minutes.<br /><br />Every person I've ever served this to has been impressed. "This is the most delicious oatmeal I've ever tasted," they say. There's no need for any sweetener, though raisins and sliced banana are always a welcome addition. Chopped walnuts are also great for adding protein and some extra crunch.<br /><br />I like all of Ezekiel 4:9's cereal varieties about equally well, and would pick any of them over any other kind of cereal. And Amazon's prices beat those at my local grocery store. It's a great way to stock up on a truly amazing breakfast food.
