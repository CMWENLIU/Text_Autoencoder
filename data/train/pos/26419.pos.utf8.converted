This tuna is very flavorful and I like that the product only contains tuna and salt.  No water or oil or additives similar to MSG and it is not pulverized mushy little pieces like most supermarket tuna.  The tuna is in big pieces that I flake into large chunks and mix with the juice in the can.  I prefer this skipjack to the albacore, as it is more flavorful and moister.  Great for pasta salads, pasta main dishes, on a lettuce salad, sandwiches, tuna patties or for quick appetizer dips, etc, etc.  Even good just eating plain out of the can.  I highly recommend the excellent recipe from Triscuit box by Rachael Ray - Tuna and White Bean Salad - can Google to find it online.  This tuna is a good value for the price.
