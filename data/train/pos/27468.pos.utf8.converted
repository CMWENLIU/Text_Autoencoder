My cat got into "nip" and now listens to The Grateful Dead, stopped hunting mice, started borrowing mice from other cats, was beat up by a common gray squirrel when he broke into its house to steal its nuts to sell to get more "nip."  This product is terrible I am therefore giving it 5 stars.  Yes, I highly recommend this product to anyone who has a cat.  I gotta go, I think the cat got stoned and fell into the toilet again.
