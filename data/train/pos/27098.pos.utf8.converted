First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"! [Note: DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces!]<br /><br />Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money. The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around the dog's medication). Do a little research, and you'll save money. BTW, the multi-bag deals online at Amazon are not necessarily a good deal, be sure to divide the total cost by the number of bags you receive to see if you're saving $$.<br /><br />NOTE: The size listed on the Pill Pocket's bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small or a piece of a large pill pocket. These things are great, and go down my dogs easily.
