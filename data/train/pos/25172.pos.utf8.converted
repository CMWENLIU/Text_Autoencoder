I don't know much about gelatin but use it a lot and this one stirs in an instant.  I boil the hot water, and only use a half a cup and about 4 tablespoons of gelatin.  Then I put in pomegranate juice and fill up the glass<br />for a strong flavored drink.<br /><br />I was using raspberry flavored diet mix and it tasted really super good, just like black cherry jello.  Alas they are so down on aspartame, I switched.  I'd love to find flavor like that and mix it up with stevia for a sweetener.<br /><br />You can also mix it with orange pulp from the freezed cans for some flavor and with this you can actually tolerate<br />mixing it with chlorella or spirulina.<br /><br />I like to make dried apricot pie and other pies like apple and gelatin helps it stick together.<br /><br />I sure wish I knew how to prove there is protein in it. It really seems to work and makes expensive protein<br />drinks seem pretty stupid.  Especially for old people without teeth.  Ensure keeps a lot of the old or anorexic's<br />alive but it costs a lot.  So I don't know who lives on gelatin instead.  I'd love to know.<br /><br />You do have to drink it before it gels and that's not hard. If you do leave it sit you would have to chew pretty hard to get it down.  Once I cut it up into candy sized squares.<br /><br />If jello didn't get a bad review for health because it has some chemical in it...I would do this more often,<br />but black cherry jello mixed with a few tablespoons of this is a very tasty hot drink.<br /><br />Cheers to your health.  Email me if you know anything real important about this, ouivalerie@yahoo.com.<br /><br /> I'm going to try the<br />5 lb. Now Food Gelatin, although you have to stir a LOT longer....it tastes the same.<br /><br />What is really in gelatin?  I can't find anything online, no books, no factory tour.  Is it ground toenails<br />from cows?  It's so gross what it's said to be secretly made up of, but it works like settles down my appetite so I don't overeat.<br /><br />It's missing something live so I have to eat a lot of fresh stuff too.<br /><br />Soup...that's nice but it's a hot drink I seek and this is a sweet hot drink sometimes, so I don't need the soup. Just gelatin, fruit and vegetables....<br /><br />I might recommend also a pineapple smoothie.  Pineapple in the juicer and some tablespoons of hot gelatin<br />mixed in a half cup of boiling water and maybe some icecream.  It's even known that fresh pineapple stops gelatin from getting hard so you can keep it cold and drink it whenever.  :)
