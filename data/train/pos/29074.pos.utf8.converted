Slim Jims have been around for what seems forever. If you are the type of person who is obsessed with what you eat,why even buy these and then complain? What did you expect,tofu?<br />However, if you like a decadent snack occasionally, by all means get these.<br />They are greasy, chewy and go great with beer. They are what they are, with no apologies.
