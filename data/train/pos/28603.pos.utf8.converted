We first sampled Kwazulu tea on a visit to one of Taylor's tearooms in York, England in 2005.  We brought some back with us, but were unable to find it locally. Was glad to see that Amazon now carries it.  For tea lovers who like a strong, English tea, you will like this one. It has a very distinctive flavor, that is stronger than an English Breakfast variety. It has a pretty copper color.  (The loose tea is in little nuggets, not black leaves like you would expect.)  A great way to start off your day, and though the English would quite disapprove, it is also excellent iced as its strong flavor doesn't get watered down so easily. For people with the Senseo machines, if you buy one of the reusable and refillable Eco-Pad podfilters, you can fill it with this loose tea and it works perfectly!  Just don't pack the tea in too tightly, as it expands quite a bit.
