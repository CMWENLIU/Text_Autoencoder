I am a bit of a hot chocolate snob... I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate (not too sweet, not too bitter), and have found myself searching for a good hot chocolate brand I can make at home.  I've tried so many different brands (Harry and David, William Sonoma, Ghirardelli, etc..) but nothing could satisfy  my hot chocolate cravings at home until I received a Tassimo for my birthday and tried this hot chocolate.  Its delicious, with some of my own modifications.  I don't really like it with the milk it comes with- instead, I warm up regular milk in my mug before running the chocolate into my mug.  Its an extra step, but definately worth it!
