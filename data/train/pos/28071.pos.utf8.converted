I tried this when I first started avoiding high fructose corn syrup. I NEEDED my Coke fix, so I tried the Mexi-Coke and didn't care for it much at the time. Fast forward a few months with NO soda...I tried Mexi-Coke again and fell in love. I really enjoy it a lot now and if I ever happen to drink regular Coke with HFCS, it tastes nasty in comparison (like dirt or something).<br /><br />That having been said, I cannot believe the price here on Amazon!! I can get a case of 24 for around $20 at my local warehouse store. Or, I could go to one of many tiendas or coffee shops and buy single Mexi-Cokes for $2-$2.50. What a rip off, Amazon! Not cool at all.
