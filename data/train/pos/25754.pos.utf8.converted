Monster Energy gives you the buzz and kick you need to keep you going. I have been drinking these for almost 3 years now and they are great. I ordered my first 24-pack case of these yesterday on Amazon with $3.99 Prime overnight shipping and now they're in my fridge cooled and ready to drink :D<br /><br />Just a word of advice, though. Drink these energy drinks in moderation. Even though the label states to limit 3 cans per day.. just drink 1. Really, you'll feel a lot better drinking one for the day instead of going all out and chugging half the case. There is 80mg of caffeine per serving, 160mg if you drink the entire 16oz can. If you really need two, spread them out hours apart.. one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. The maximum caffeine any person should take in a day is 300mg, but try to keep it at 200mg and lower at most occasions. And if you can, drink one every 2-3 days.. be strong of yourself and avoid the addiction of caffeine this product brings you. This way, you can still enjoy the biggest, baddest energy drink on the planet without risking you with health effects that occur when taken in excess.<br /><br />Don't believe all the hype that energy drinks are truly bad for you. I call any energy drink a "neutral beverage", because it's not good for you, but it's also not bad for you. You'll get it :)<br /><br />Also, if you're looking on cutting down on sugar and carbs, try the Lo-Carb Monster (blue)... it has a more sweet taste than the regular one and you'll feel guiltless drinking one. I believe it doesn't contain the evil "aspartame" from diet sodas and such, so try it :)<br /><br />Unleash the Beast!!!
