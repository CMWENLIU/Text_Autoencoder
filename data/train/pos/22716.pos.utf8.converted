This is NOT super hot pepper paste. It's more sweet than hot but it's got a tiny bite to it and a lovely zing.<br /><br />This is a fermented pepper paste and it is so addictive!<br /><br />This does not have MSG but it does have [wheat derived] glucose.<br /><br />Fermented foods take food to another notch and not only do they taste better but they are highly digestible and actually help regulate your gut flora (I know that sounds gross in print).<br /><br />This IS a product of Korea.<br /><br />Anyway, this pepper paste coupled with the Korean soybean paste is manna from heaven!<br /><br />Ingredients in this Yummy Gochujang:<br />Red Pepper Powder<br />Wheat Flour Starch Syrup<br />Liquefied Glucose
