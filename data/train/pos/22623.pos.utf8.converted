If you don't like very dark chocolate, I doubt you'll like this - it's very dark and far more bitter than sweet.<br /><br />However, I DO like dark chocolate, and I love coffee, so I thought these bars were amazing.  You pop a piece in your mouth and get an immediate burst of espresso - the dark, strong coffee taste is outstanding.  As the chocolate starts to melt, the coffee flavor is replaced with bitter, decadent chocolate.<br /><br />This is a great deal, especially if you're planning on keeping all 10 bars to yourself (like I do).  A little piece of one bar goes a very long way.  I should warn you, though - these bars are definitely caffeinated!  If I ate a whole one, I'd be lit up for a week (and I drink coffee like it's my job, so it takes more than a little caffeine to get me going).<br /><br />I would definitely get these again.
