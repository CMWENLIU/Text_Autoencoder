I began sprouting in the 70's with a glass jar and cheesecloth.<br />Having used a few sprout gadgets over the years, I can say without hesitation that this Sproutmaster sprouter is simply the best.<br />It has worked well with seeds, nuts and legumes.<br />It cleans up easily.<br />Because sprouts are kept in the dark during sprouting, I leave the lid off on the last day for the chlorophyll action to green them up even more.<br />I have been using the Sproutmaster now for 10 years.<br />Three trays are ample for a family of five. You'll learn seed selection & timing rotation as you go.<br />It is worth every cent I paid for it.<br /><br />To Your Health!<br /><br />{{* *}}
