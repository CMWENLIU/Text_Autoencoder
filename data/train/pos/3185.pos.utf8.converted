Several years ago a friend and I had lunch in a Thai restaurant. It was my first introduction to the cuisine, which I loved. One of the things I greatly indulged in however, was the iced tea. (partly because it was tasty and unusual, partly because I'd gotten my Pad Thai extra spicy!)<br /><br />I'm a bit of a tea snob, I don't do lipton, I like to fresh brew loose leaf estate teas, etc....and have hunted for that particular "blend" if tea from the thai restaurant for years. When I got this package I was skeptical, it looked suspiciously like nasty instant tea. I brewed it up however and to my delight, found it WAS the excellent ceylon black tea blended with a delightful mix of spices that give it a sweet tang that is wonderful to drink hot or cold. (tip, stew an apple in it with a little honey, oh my.)<br /><br />You will find some "sludge" at the bottom of the pan after brewing, as delightful as the brewed liquid is, avoid the tea fannings sludge, it's a bit gritty. Otherwise, this is that wonderful tea they serve in the restaurants. They often serve it as a dessert with cream or sweetened evaporated milk added, though I personally enjoy it just iced.
