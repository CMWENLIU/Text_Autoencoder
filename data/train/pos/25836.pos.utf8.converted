Having used Beyond Gourmet unbleached parchment paper for years, I was unhappy when the price got so high and began purchasing the white parchment which our grocery store carries.  The white parchment was several inches wider than Beyond Gourmet so I often had more waste than when using the unbleached product.  Further, I wasn't particularly happy with it as it tended to scorch more easily than the unbleached, brown paper.  The last drawback for me was that the white paper was not as easy to "mold" into the shape of the pan.<br /><br />When I saw this four-pack of unbleached parchment paper, I decided to give it a try.  Even though each roll held the same square footage of paper, the cost was significantly less than Beyond Gourmet.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The paper works very well; it is heavy enough to use several times, but flexible enough to be molded easily to the baking pan.  Product releases easily and the paper can be wiped off for more uses.<br /><br />Yes, the box is too flimsy and has no metal cutting edge, but that seems to be a drawback with all unbleached parchment papers.  So, "If You Care" receives five stars for the paper and one star for the box.
