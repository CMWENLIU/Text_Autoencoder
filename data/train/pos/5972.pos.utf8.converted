__________________________________________________________________________________<br />NOTE: I have left an update on my eczema condition in the comments section of this review. To summarize the update: I tried applying the oil topically to the affected area and it stopped the itch and burn completely! Applying the hemp seed oil directly to the area will cure eczema!!! (8/15/2011)<br />__________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with this hemp seed oil. The delicious nutty flavor makes it easy to take this as a daily supplement. The texture will take some getting used to if you're taking it straight as a supplement (it is oil after all). And you can't beat the price here on Amazon. The original price is $20 and here it's half that!<br /><br />I actually decided to get this because I heard an omega6 deficiency causes eczema (a skin disease that I have). I've been taking it for about a week and my skin is showing improvement. I itch less and my skin doesn't inflame as badly. I'm thinking I need to up the dose a little bit. Maybe I'll start taking 1 full tablespoon instead of 2 teaspoons that I'm taking daily. I understand this probably won't be of use to most people simply looking for hemp seed oil, but I will update in the comments of this review about how my eczema curing progress is going. Maybe this can help someone.<br /><br />Nutiva is obviously very passionate and dedicated to the products they sell. The label on this oil is informative and their website is even more informative. By quality of this oil alone I can say I trust this company, and I'll be buying from them in the future.
