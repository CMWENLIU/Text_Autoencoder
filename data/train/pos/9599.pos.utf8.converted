I do love to cook. Therefore we always did have several herbs in the freezer. I also tried with some potted herbs but after a couple weeks they just died. I guess not enough light, or to much / less water.<br /><br />With AeroGarden I do now have always fresh herbs around. My wife says we have now to "much" herbs. These herbs are growing like crazy. If they do get to big then we cut them and store them in the freezer.  It should be a must for every kitchen !
