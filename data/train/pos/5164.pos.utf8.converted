My dogs have been raised on Blue. It is all I will feed them because of quality, ingredients, method of cooking (cold-formed bits), and smell/flavor.<br />I do keep it in an airtight container so it stays fresh longer but I recommend you buy the size that will last a month or so. After a month of being open, it loses it's 'oomph'. The food is still good, but it won't smell as strongly (I'm not sure how smell and flavor diminish but I know every time we open a new bag my dogs act very happy and jump around)<br /><br />I have two doxies, one is 10 lbs and one is 8 lbs. This bag lasts me a month and I feed them each 3 oz. a day.
