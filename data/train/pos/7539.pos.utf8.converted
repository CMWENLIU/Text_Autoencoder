OK, I have to admit that I was leery about ordering nuts online since I'd never ordered any food item online before. Amazon dispelled any doubts I had. First of all, they're Diamond - can't go wrong there, plus they're good for you. Not only did they arrive quicker than I thought (with free shipping), they were fresh (long expiration date), came in a resealable bag, and not a single one was broken. Toss in the facts they taste great and come at a great price and it's a no-brainer. Thanks, Amazon!
