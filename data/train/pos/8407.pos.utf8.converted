It's been over two months since my original review in june...I was turned on to the benefits of acai back in december. As part of my new years resolution, I am drinking at least one spinach/fruit smoothie DAILY. For the last five months, I add one scoop of the Sambazon acai powder along with Green Vibrance powder to my smoothie. I am on my fifth jar of this stuff.<br /><br />I haven't felt this great since my 20's! My body has transformed dramatically, but NOT overnight. If you are looking for a miracle potion, it doesn't exist. However, I highly recommend acai powder with sensible diet/exercise. I have been using the Sambazon brand because it's not overpriced like Monavie, and is easy to add to my smoothie. The slightly bitter taste doesn't bother me and is not even noticable when mixed w/ fresh spinach, banana, mango, blueberry, strawberry, and rasberry.<br /><br />Results speak for themself: it is now early august...in 7 months I went from 165lbs to 140lbs of lean muscle. My skin has cleared up completely and I feel great. Remember, gradual change will come with patience and lifestyle change.
