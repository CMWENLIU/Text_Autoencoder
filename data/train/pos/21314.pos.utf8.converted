I've been giving The Missing Link Super Food Supplement to my cat 3 year old Kaya for over six months and coincidentally ever since, the tiny bumps on her ears that itched her and caused her fur to missing on the tips of her ears has COMPLETELY gone away.  She has never seemed healthier and last week at the vet, for her wellness check, the vet claimed she was in great condition for a cat her age.  The price is great from this vendor and I would definitely purchase again from them- I buy enough to keep a stock, so my supply is good for the next year.  Highly recommend.
