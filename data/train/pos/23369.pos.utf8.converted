Ever since I returned from Spain, I have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas. These are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful. If you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza, you are missing a great treat. I highly recommend these, and even if you only eat them occasionally, they will remain fresh in the glass jars.
