An excellent tasting chocolate. It seems to strike a near perfect balance between (traditional) milk chocolate and dark chocolate thanks to its higher than "usual" cacao percentage. I'd describe it as a very flavorful chocolate with quite a few interesting flavor "notes". I like the fact that Scharffen Berger doesn't rely on sugar alone with their milk chocolates to try and create a good taste. The sweetness is just right for what I'd look for in a milk chocolate; it's not over the top but not lacking either.  I really enjoy it.
