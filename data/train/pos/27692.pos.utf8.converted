Living in Tejas, we love  our spicy southwest foods. A bottle of hot sauce is never far from hand at meal time. One of my favorites is the Chipotle tobasco sauce.<br /><br />Only slightly ironically, I first sampled Chipotle tobasco at a Chipotle's restaurant several years ago. I was instantly hooked. Regular tobasco adds a lot of heat to any meal, but relatively little enjoyable flavor. Not so with this little bottle.<br /><br />The chipotle tobasco is all about the wonderful smoky flavor, with only a relatively small level of heat and unpleasantness. My sons (both under 10) even enjoy its flavor, not finding it too harsh or pungent.<br /><br />If all you're interested in is showing off your manliness by eating outrageous sauces, then pass this bottle by. If you're interested in making simple meals a little more exciting, then this is the condiment for you!
