I truly use a lot of cinnamon and want a strong cinnamon flavor so can use the amount the recipe calls for.  This is a very good cinnamon and gives me the flavor I want.  Incidental, since I have been using this frontier cinnamon in my oatmeal, my blood sugars have gone down over the morning before lunch.  Ask your doctor, but this cinnamon is lowering my glucose levels which is desirable for a diabetic.  Highly recommend their cinnamon.
