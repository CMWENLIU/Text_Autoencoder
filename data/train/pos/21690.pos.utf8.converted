I have new 72lb mixed 1.5 year old pup, who was losing hair at age 1. I read on the internet that he may be allergic to his food and may need more protein in his diet. So I started him on this food, and one 3mg melatonin, and 1 salmon fish oil tablet and he is absolutely beautiful now. His hair is shinny and he is real healthy. Now my old 15 year old dog Grizzly is a 100 lb Rottweiler & Golden Retriever mix, he is the best dog I ever had. The vet said he has lived more then twice the normal age for his breeds. Well Grizzly is also on this food and his hair is shinny, I also give him 2 to 3 Dasuquin tablets a day, and he can still get up 2 steps in to our house.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.
