I was thrilled when I came across "S'MOREABLES" graham style crackers.They are great with butter and peanut butter. They make a great graham cracker crust. It is hard living without foods we once loved so even though these aren't perfect they are close enough to make me feel like I've come to my loving family. What more could I want?<br />  I love this product and I use it but I have one complaint,as with so many substitutes they have little food value. Perhaps what we need is new products that do not mimic our past loves.<br /><br />  INGREDIENTS: Pea starch,non hydrogen0ated shortening(palm fruit and canola). potato starch, brown rice flour,brown sugar, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, water, rice bran, sugar, blackstrap molasses, honey, glucose, vanilla, salt, sodium bicarbonate, pea protein, pea fiber, gaur gum, inulin, soy lecithin, mono calcium phosphate.<br /><br />  NUTRITION FACTS:serving size 1 cracker (12g)<br />  8 servings per container<br />  Calories 60 calories from fat 20<br />  total fat 2g 3%<br />  saturated fat 0.5+trans far0g 4%<br />  cholesterol 0mg<br />  sodium 60mg 3%<br />  dietary fiber 0g<br />  sugars 2g<br />  protein 0g<br /><br />  vitamin A 0%<br />  Vitamin C o%<br />  calcium 0%<br />  iron 0%<br /><br />I do like the product and will continue to use it but not every day.
