These beans are the best.  Full of flavor and spices (not hot).  I wish I had these when I worked all those late hours.  Be aware that they are on the salty side, so watch your portions if you're on a salt control diet.  I made a triple recipe according to the measurements of the other review on this page, enough for a few days, and they are just as delicious today.  These 3 bags will make a LOT of meals.  You'll like them.
