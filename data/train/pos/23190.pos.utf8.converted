I got very spoiled when I lived in a big city having access to this brand of canned tuna packed in olive oil.  The flavor and quality truly canot be beat! Recently, I moved to the country where there are no grocery/specialty stores that carry this product or anything close. I was so happy when I found that I could order it on line.  Everyone that I serve this tuna to agrees that it is the best!!  You can literally eat it right out of the can with a fork!
