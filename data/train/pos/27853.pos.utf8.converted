This kit has almost everything you need (including yeast and directions) to make a stout that equals Guinness and exceeds the quality of some stuff sold as stout. You add plain old store-bought sugar and water. The kit includes directions, but the directions actually make it sound as if making brew is harder than it really is. I combined the contents of the can with five gallons of pure bottled water, added sugar and the yeast that came with the kit, and mixed thoroughly (emphasize "mix thoroughly"); The directions call for hot or boiled water, but room temperature water works just as well as long as you mix sugar, yeast, and the contents of the can thoroughly. Then I allowed it to ferment at room temperature for a week. The result was a tasty, satisfying brew. You could bottle the brew after fermentation, but I pour it right out of the gallon jugs it was brewed in. The dregs stay reliably on the bottom of the bottle.  Cheers! (P.S.--no, I do not work for the company that sells this stuff. I'm just an old hippie who likes his booze.)
