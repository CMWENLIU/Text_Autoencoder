This is a great product that works.  We rarely had any roach trouble until lately due to an infested house next door.  Do not expect total elimination of your bug problem.  You will have to use it in combination with other roach treatments and practices like the other reviewer said.  But this item will greatly help in reducing the number of pest you have to deal with.
