I snack a lot, and I don't always have time to brush my teeth afterwards, so I'm trying to chew this gum after eating.  It has a nice flavor, not too sweet. I'm not chewing it for long periods of time, but the flavor lasts long enough for me.  The larger size is more cost effective, and I'm keeping one at my desk and one in my car.
