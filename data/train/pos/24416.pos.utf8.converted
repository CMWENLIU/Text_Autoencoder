Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing.  Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly.  To prepare:  drain and then rinse VERY well.  At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit.  Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough.  Pat dry and add your favorite sauce.<br /><br />These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories.  This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said.  This is a food for health-conscious consumers.  For me, this has been the find of a lifetime.  There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic.  In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?).<br /><br />I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl.  On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...]<br /><br />For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try.  Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling.  The scent will vanish.  Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery.  Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup!  The options are limitless.  This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product.
