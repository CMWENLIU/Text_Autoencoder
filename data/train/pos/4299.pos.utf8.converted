I got this for a friend for his 50th birthday.  It really took you back in time.  It was a lot of fun going through all of the different candies and letting them take you back to your childhood.  Pop rocks, burlap bag of gum nuggets, candy necklace, bit o honey, candy cigarettes, even the Hersheys candy bar had the old wrapper on it.  It was fun.
