I bought the Wilton version of these to decorate my truffles (Hello Kitty).  They were dreadful.  I then found out that THESE were the ones that I needed, and that is absolutely correct.  These are fantastic!  They write on chocolate with no effort at all.  A nice clean line, with little pressure required at all.  And once it is on, it doesn't rub off with the tip of the pen like the Wilton ones did.<br /><br />If you are looking for edible food pens, this is the product for you!<br /><br />(and they shipped very quickly).
