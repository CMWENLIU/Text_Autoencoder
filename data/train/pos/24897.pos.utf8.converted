This is my sixth large bag of Eight O'Clock whole bean coffee that I have ordered from Amazon over the past five months, and I have tried four different kinds, or flavors. All, except for the Hazelnut flavored coffee beans, were great.<br /><br />This bag of coffee beans is excellent, as were four of the other two lb. bags of Eight O'Clock coffee. It has a very smooth flavor with no bitter aftertaste. I am now a regular Eight O'Clock whole bean coffee lover of almost all of their different coffee beans. It is consistently good and is as good, or better, than other coffee beans that I've paid twice as much for.
