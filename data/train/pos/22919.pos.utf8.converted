I use these twice a year on my two live oaks.  My neighbor had two live oaks planted at the same time I did.  After 6 years, the difference is incredible.  Our tree trunks are almost twice the circumference as the neighbors and the tips all have leaves.  Their trees tend to shed their leaves at the tips during the winter.  The only drawback is the bright green grass that appears in patches where they are in the ground. Looks weird compared to the rest of my yard... Maybe I will put them all over the yard to minimize the effect.  Also would recommend getting some sort of easy plugging tool to pull out a plug of earth before dropping them in the ground.
