I usually buy this at my neighborhood grocery story - where it costs over $4. Whole Foods stocks it in the dairy case and their price is better. The price here is even better than that!<br />  This is like a tart smooth yogurt. Tart, not milky. Greek style yogurt has become very popular lately because it is tart and thick, not milky and thickened with gelatin, etc.<br />  By those standards, everyone should be drinking kefir because if you like that taste, and I do, you'll love this.<br />  I usually can't keep the bottle in the fridge. I just drink at least half of it as soon as I get it. It's as refreshing and cooling as buttermilk in the summer. It has lots of healthy probiotics (helpful bacillus) that are good for your health but I'd drink it just for the taste and nothing else!
