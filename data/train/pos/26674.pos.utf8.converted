This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold. When making it by the glass I take a tall iced tea glass, fill it with very cold spring water and add 2 Raspberry Zinger tea bags. In a couple of minutes I have iced raspberry tea! I drink it unsweetened sometimes but other times I add a little bit of liquid stevia (a natural sweetener found in health food stores that does not have any calories & does not affect your blood sugar) and it is delicious. I sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice. Sometimes I add 6-8 tea bags to a gallon of spring water and make the tea in the fridge. I love to bring a gallon of it to the homes of friends and family when we visit. My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too. Everyone has their own tastes, but everyone that I give it to iced thinks it tastes really good.<br />I have even used it to dye some doll's clothes for an antiqie doll some years ago. Teas can be used as a natural dye source.
