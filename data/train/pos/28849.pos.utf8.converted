I work for a large pharma company who sells their over-the-counter products to employees at their Company Store. I was surprised when the store started carrying this dog food as we have no affiliation to it. I was currently using Iams which at the time was going thru tainted ingredient issues. So I did some investigative work on some dog food review/rating websites and was pleasantly surprised by the positive reviews for this product.<br /><br />You can also go to [...] website for details on the holistic benefits. I switched my dogs to this food around 3-4 years ago and am so glad that I did. I just read an article on [...] which rated this brand as one of the top 4 dog foods and a "best buy" compared to other premium brands.
