This barley is totally free of any inedible hulls. It cooks easily in a steamer set to 75 minutes and left to sit for an additional 30 after that. Once cooked it stores nicely in the refrigerator without losing it's flavor or texture. I find the texture to comfortably chewy with a faint nutlike taste similar to brown rice. The grains of barley do tend to be sticky so you're not going to get a one grain at the time Minute Rice experience, a good thing in my estimation.
