I ordered these because I have been deprived of tiramisu since going gluten free :-)  I did not use the recipe on the package;  I used another from a magazine.  The lady fingers held up well and tasted great.  I made it in an 8x8 glass dish but did not go all the way to the sides, a little smaller dish would've been better.  I will order these again, it was just enough to hit the spot!
