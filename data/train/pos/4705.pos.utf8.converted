This is a healthier alternative to those high-calorie, carbonated cans of caffeine that pass for energy drinks. I first tried Ukon Energy in Japan, where I spent roughly seven years living and working in both Yokohama and Tokyo. The drink is known as morning, hangover cure for Japanese businessmen. It is slightly sweet (but only 30 calories per serving) and earthy with no carbonation. This tastes better than Red Bull or the other energy drinks ubiquitous in the United States.<br /><br />The active ingredient in tumeric root is curcumin. Tumeric root is widely used in Asia, where it is prized as a detoxifier. Claims are that it provides health benefits for stomach irritation, heartburn, inhibiting the formation of gallstones (the body more easily digests fats) and ulcers. Tumeric root is also used to treat liver and skin conditions, including cirrhosis, jaundice, eczema, psoriasis and acne.<br /><br />Ukon Energy contains vitamins E and B, has only 30 calories per serving and is caffeine-free. Sold in a conveniently compact bottle, this herbal drink is especially popular among Japanese businessmen, who see it as the ideal beverage for their on-the-go lifestyle.<br /><br />BTW: House Foods previewed its turmeric-based Ukon Energy beverage at the 2010 Korean Music Festival in Hollywood last May. More than 120 million Ukon Energy bottles were sold in Japan in 2009.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.
