These tast good and even FEEL good in your mouth! I crisp them in the oven with spices and cooking spray, and use them for snacks, diet pizzas, and with all kinds of toppings from hummus or cottage cheese to guacamole, and they make great chips to pair with salsa.  My daughter and I like them better than bread for most things. They are kind of pricey where I live, so it is a real help being able to buy them at Amazon's reasonable price.
