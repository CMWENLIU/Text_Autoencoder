I SPENT WEEKS RESEARCHING DOG FOODS.IT HAD TO BE FREE OF WHEAT AND CORN,CAUSE SOME GRAINS DON'T AGREE WITH DOGS, IF YOUR DOG HAS A AWFUL SMELL TO HIM, TRY TO ELIMINATE WHEAT AND CORN FROM THIER DIET AND YOU SHOULD NOTICE A DIFFERENCE. SINCE I HAVE THREE DOGS IT HAD TO BE REASONABLY PRICED.DIAMOND NATURALS IS A PREMIUM DOG FOOD MUCH BETTER THAN SOME HIGHER PRICED WELL KNOWN DOG FOODS. MY DOGS LOVE THIS FOOD, THIER COATS ARE SHINY, THEY HAVE MORE ENERGY AND NO LONGER HAVE THAT FUNKY SMELL!!!!!!
