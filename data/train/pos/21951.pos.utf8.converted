I have been feeding my german shepherd this food ever since I discovered it. I cannot tell about the amazon customer service since I buy it in my local store. However, I can tell about the food itself:<br /><br />Cons:<br />Expensive<br /><br />Pros:<br />My dog will eat it any time - despite being the picky eater.<br />Smells good<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good for skin and coat<br />Good for sensitive stomach<br />Easy to make a quick switch<br />Easy to store if you do not have food container - has zip pack lock<br />Easy to contact the company and have your questions answred by owners<br />Website offers feeding guidelines - which is pretty awesome - tells you how to combine different types of food.<br /><br />Giving this food to my dog makes me feel good. I never see leftovers in his dish anymore.<br />Finally, the food ranked 5 stars in most of the websites I reasearched (and i spent a lot of time looking for quality dog food) so it gives me piece of mind.<br /><br />Finally - you get what you pay for.
