I was shocked to see what some other reviewers said- This is an awesome product!!! You need to rinse well- it is NOT the noodle that has the odor it is the liquid it ferments in- anyhow- I followed the other instructions- rinse well microwave about 3 min then add any type of sauce etc- Tastes like pasta and NO calories to speak of at all my children and husband have no idea yet they are eating an alternative think its a brown wheat pasta!!! i will eventually tell them
