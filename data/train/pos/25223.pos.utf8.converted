If you're considering using Apple Cider Vinegar for health purposes, then it MUST be Bragg's!<br /><br />After researching ACV for about a week I decided on Bragg's Organic unfiltered with the "mother".  Simply type into any search engine "benefits of apple cider vinegar" and you can see for yourself.<br /><br />I tried Heinz while awaiting the delivery of Bragg's.  The "distilled" ACV has virtually ZERO nutrient/health benefit...so go ORGANIC :)<br /><br />Concotion 3x/day:<br />Mix 2 tablespoons of Bragg's ACV with 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  Add to 8-12 oz of water.  Stir and drink.  It tastes like a very light champagne or ale.  I can already see the benefits from ACV.  Pants already fit better after one week. The "dark circles" under my eyes are almost cleared up and hemorrhoids are clear as well.  The most striking benefit is that I now have regular bowel movements.  Before I would go 2-4 days, so this product is definitely aiding in digestion!  Also, I haven't taken a Prilosec OTC or antacid in over a month.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Aids in digestion by helping breakdown of fat<br />*Helps remove dark circles underneath your eyes<br />*Good for varicose veins<br />*Proven to help with Acid Reflux (GERD)<br />*Help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol<br />*Lowers blood pressure<br />*Cures hemorrhoids (from inside via drink, outside via applying to cotton ball)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*More expensive than "grocery store" ACV<br />*Not readily available at local rural supermarkets (leaving larger carbon footprint to have delivered to your home)<br /><br />Buy it by the GALLON if you're on the fence.  It will save you time and money.  1 quart was $5.68 ($22.72/gallon) v/s $14.99 for the gallon jug.<br /><br />Enjoy!
