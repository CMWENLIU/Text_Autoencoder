My big kitty loves mackrel and sardines, but they are hard to find.  I got a can of this to try because he loved salmon, as well--and he got one sniff of it and started howling for it! I could hardly get it from the can onto his plate fast enough!  These are very large cans and too much for one cat or one meal, but I just use a couple tablespoons at a time, and then slip the unused portion into a ziplock baggie and pop it in the fridge.  I take it out about one hour before serving again--still get the same response--the big guy LOVES it!  I always leave extra on his plate so that he can go back to it if he likes, and so far, he has not eaten more of it than his other varieties, just seems to enjoy it the most.  It is healthy and low calorie due to its purer contents, and so I am hoping it will help him to lose a pound or two.  He still eats just a bit at a time, but with so much more gusto--and from the amount of washing up after his meal of this, I can tell that he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Happy cat, happy human!  I am now buying it by the case!
