This Spam with cheese is such a versitle product. I cook it with eggs in the morning, can use it by heating in the microwave for super sanwiches on bread with mustard and dill pickles at lunch and also use it to make wonderful vegetable soup. I add some Liptons, onion and beef dip mix and start my tasty soup by adding all kinds of vegetables.  All my Grankids love my soups. I also use this Spam to give my elderly dog his medicine with just a little chunk--I hide his pill and he gobbles it all down. What more can you ask for---OH--I almost forgot--I can chop this in a shredder and add onions , pickles and mayonnaise and hooray for a fine ham tasting salad for sanwiches. It is also great to add to any pasta dishes... I will always have this in my kitchen.
