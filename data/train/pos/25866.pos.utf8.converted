Dr. McDougall's Spicy Kung Pao Noodle entree has 220 calories in the 56g cup. Only 20 calories are from fat.<br /><br />The sodium content is 480 mg, with 42g carbs and 8g of protein.  It is very easy to make in the microwave but can be made with just boiling water.<br /><br />Hot is such a subjective description but, to my taste, this product is more spicy than hot.  It's one of my favorite Dr. McDougall vegan products.
