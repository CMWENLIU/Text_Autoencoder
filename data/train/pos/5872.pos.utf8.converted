I think the berry flavor is far better than the veggie powder as far as taste goes but I don't mind either one. The nutrition seems the same for either the veggie or the fruit so I would experiement with all of them with flavor.  I add this to some juice, kefir, some coconut oil whatever, but I always add stevia with it.  I think this is a very cheap insurance to staying or getting healthy.  I battled with my health my whole life.  I try now to stay as natural as I can with my health care now.  It leads me to `well' a lot quicker. I was one of those DES babies you may or may not have heard about.  Our mothers took DES which was a drug to prevent a miscarriage but what happened was it caused problems with the baby and left a compromised immune system.  This is why my whole life it has been one thing after another.  Well, THIS powder is fantastic.  When I take this consistently I have far more energy and I just seem to stay well.  When I get lazy about it and stop taking it I have no energy, I get foggy brained, down in the dumps.  Big difference. I figure if I take this in the morning, the rest of the day is covered as far as my fruits and veggies are concerned.  What I do eat on top of this is a bonus!  If you `really' really can't stand the taste then add the stevia, add fruit, juice whatever, it so worth taking this powder!!  Personally I have no problem with the flavor. I have the super foods on auto-ship.  That is a great program to save money when you know you will use the product all the time.  I like that you can cancel anytime if you want to.  Five starts from me!
