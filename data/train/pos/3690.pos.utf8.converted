Our cat is over 20 people years old. We thought she was going to die, She wouldn't eat and only drank a little.I thought cat sure was like people sure and tried it. We freeze the whole can in Ice cube trays and give her one a day. She loves it. She seemed to come alive again. Shaking it in the can dosen't mix it well. We use a can opener and pour a bit out and use a small electric mixer to mix it (A lot of it settles on the bottom)  But she loves it.
