These strips are delicious. I just bought my second pack and received in in about 4 or 5 business days(ordered it on saturday and got it on wednesday).takes longer to ship it here than it does for me to eat it. Stuff is almost too good. I'm glad it goods for you though, makes me feel better about eating 5 strips in an hour. It's much easier to chew if you cut it up into smaller strips and put that in a bag or something. The only thing i wish was different about this product is that i would like to see a zipper on the packaging, but from the looks of things, this product seems to have been put through a food-saver. Awesome all around. I will never be ripped off at a gas station for their bs jerky again.
