This fruit tray arrived on time and in excellent condition.  It was even more attractive than I expected and was festive and appealing.  This was a gift for my boss, who expressed gratitude and appreciation for such a thoughtful gift - one that required no refrigeration or special serving plates (it came pleasantly arranged in its own tray), and could be consumed throughout the holidays, and beyond.  I will certainly purchase this item in the future for those 'hard to buy for' people on my list.
