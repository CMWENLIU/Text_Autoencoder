I discovered this great tea in Harrowgate, England. It is smooth, not bitter, and is great hot or cold. The bags are for a pot of tea, not a cup. I can find the tea in a local specialty tea store but pay three times as much for it. Amazon got it to me within 3 days, making it comparable in price to other teas, but so much better. There "gold" tea has also won multiple awards. Give it a try.
