I love the Einkorn pasta in general and this is easy for me to just have it shipped in bulk to my house. I make a whole box at a time, toss it with olive oil and salt for keeping. I can parcel it out and add it to pesto, marinara or any sauce for lunches. The flavor is really nice, it is NOT Gluten free... how could anyone think that about this pasta?
