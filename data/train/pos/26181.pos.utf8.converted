These are so good! I bought them for my husband, thinking they would be chunks of fish, but no, *Happily* they are filets, great!!! My husband loves them, he frys them in a little butter and has them for breakfast along with a good peice of french bread and butter. We will be buying these again and again. Best part is that they do not have to be refrigerated and you can have them anytime you want.
