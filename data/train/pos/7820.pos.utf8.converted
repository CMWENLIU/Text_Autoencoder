Bottom line: buy this gum....in bulk....because you will love it!!<br /><br />I am a dedicated patron of Juicy Fruit, but saw this gum at the gas station the other day.  As with the previous reviewers, I was skepical at first, assuming that this was just a marketing ploy and that it would taste like any of the many peppermint or spearmint gums already on the market (which I don't particularly love). But the picture of the ice cream on the front of the box was compelling, so I decided to risk it.  It SERIOUSLY DOES taste like mint chocolate chip ice cream.  No kidding, it is just like eating a bowl of ice cream (I also think the flavor is somewhat reminiscent of Thin Mints).  Now, I feel like I'm eating 3 or 4 bowls of ice cream per day, for a grand total of 20 calories.  And do not just take my word for it: I recently was at a gathering of a few co-workers and all of them tried it and were quite impressed as well.  I'm sure they will be posting a review any day also.<br /><br />And now I leave a challenge for Extra: Make a French Silk Pie gum!!!!
