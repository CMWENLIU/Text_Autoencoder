These truffles are absolutely decadent! I am coming back for more after already ordering 5 boxes. After tasting them, I am going to hand them out at Christmas to everyone I know. I am not real crazy about the packaging(nothing wrong with packaging- just my personal preferance), so I am going to fancy them up a bit in some nicely decorated canisters (this way I can sneak a few out for myself). The truffles themselves look and taste as if they were bought in a high end chocolatier shop.
