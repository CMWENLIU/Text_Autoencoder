One day my husband came home with this little bottle of spice....Okay, says I...I'll try it.  All I can say is Wow! It has been a couple of years now, and I am STILL not bored with it. It is still my favorite spice to reach for. My favorite combo being a dash of celtic sea salt, and a big shake of Bragg Sprinkles!<br /><br />The grind size is just right...not so fine that it is like tiny "sand". Rather, it's just large enough that you can actually get little tastes of various flavors....rosemary, thyme, sweet basil, a smidge of dill, oregano, etc. Even though it contains about 25 different spices, it doesn't blend away to "anonymous" when it hits your mouth. You're gonna love it!<br /><br />Oh, and we usually have it right on the table, for that last sprinkle on top, right before we eat it. Mmmmmmmmmm.
