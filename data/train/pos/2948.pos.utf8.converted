When one reconstitutes this milk powder with purified water to remove the herbicides and other pest controls building up from Genetically Modified herbicide tolerant crops, they will find this tastes just like the fresh milk from Organic Valley's family of small farmers across the country.<br /><br />Reconstitution means a good job blending in a blender, not just stirred, because this is non instant powdered milk. It will take a bit longer to prepare, but the taste is worth it.<br /><br />I will not purchase herbicide tolerant crops for my family.  Yet, the USDA and the Obama Monsanto Administration has deregulated soy, corn, cotton, canola, sugar beets, and alfalfa (the latter of which needed no herbicides previously) to be incessantly sprayed with Roundup and other dangerous weed killers.  This means that the crop fed to dairy cows, horses, and other livestock will be contaminated with foreign organisms (not plants unlike hybrids) to make a patentable plant which Monsanto owns for the purpose of forcing farmers to spray more Roundup, so more money can be made by Monsanto.  Less than 7 percent of all alfalfa had been sprayed with herbicides previously. But, all that will change if the dairy industry purchases GMO seeds for alfalfa.<br /><br />Our potable water supplies all over the country are becoming contaminated, although studies have been blocked by Monsanto.  Where studies were done in other countries, like Denmark, it was found that extremely high levels of Roundup (or Glyphosate, the trademark for the active ingredient) were building up in the potable groundwater.  AND, they are not planting GMO seeds, unlike the USA. Because of their studies, they have instructed the Danish farmers not to spray with Roundup for at least 3 years.  But, in the USA, farmers are instructed to read labels and are taught to use chemical intensive agriculture; studies are blocked from being published, and even physicians are not given the right to know.<br /><br />In Taiwan, a study was done on 93 persons who tried to commit suicide by ingesting Roundup. The symptoms were very much like gastrointestinal reflux disease that has affected people all over the USA who have consumed heavily sprayed Roundup Ready (and GMO) crops.  Even babies have GERD and the causes are unknown because studies have been blocked by Monsanto.<br /><br />Monsanto's presence has been at the USDA, and Michael Taylor, first a lobbyist, then the company's Vice President, was appointed to the US-FDA by the first President Bush and has been there ever since. Myriad Monsanto employees are at the FDA and EPA making policy and their policy only benefits their company, not our health or the health of our children.<br /><br />Where studies have been done outside the USA, researchers and physicians have found growing levels of new allergens, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems with GMO plants.<br /><br />Organic Valley is committed to growing the best alfalfa for their cows and for that reason, and since organic agriculture prohibits use of GMO seeds, I'm buying all the Organic Valley powdered nonfat dry skim milk I can find with its long shelf life.  I will not give my family GMO milk. We will stop drinking and eating dairy products, once all milk contains GMO's because pollinators carry them from crop to crop or the wind blows the pollen well beyond the six mile limit claimed by the USDA.  We will buy Organic Valley but not heavily sprayed herbicide tolerant GMO alfafa fed dairy products.
