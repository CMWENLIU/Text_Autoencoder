Oh, boy! I could tell these were going to be good when I cracked open the bag. What a nice aroma! I was right. They're excellent! Well, I usually buy pistachios in the shell, but I passed by these bags in the nut section of my local Costco store, and I just couldn't resist trying them. They're great. Nice and fresh. Salted to perfection with the potassium content still almost double the sodium content. Lots of fiber and unsaturated fat. What more could you ask? Did I mention that they're delicious? Wonderful, indeed!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
