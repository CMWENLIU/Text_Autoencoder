I love lemon lime Gatorade, I use it when I lift weights and it helps me to stay focused and move through sets.<br /><br />But I agree with one of the other reviewers. This specific product (Gatorade 76oz G Series Lemon Lime powder) is hideously overpriced. I love Amazon and normally find great deals here. But, in the case of this product, I went to Smart & Final last night and bought 2 (TWO) of these for $20 +tax. That's $9.99 each. Seriously. Sellers on ebay are also overcharging for this product.
