In my quest for the best dog food, I started out with the best that our local pet store had, Innova. I knew that I wanted a wheat free top of the line dog food, and Innova fit the bill.  Our puppy's coat was perfectly soft and he took to the food instantly with no transition from the wet food he was eating at the shelter.  When I finally found the time to do some real research into the best dog food I was surprised to find that Innova dog food is not one of the ten best dog foods on the market.  Innova's top of the line food is their product line EVO, but was out of my price range.  I then identified the top dog foods from independent websites that rate dog food, and went through each until I found one that I could afford, without making any sacrifice in quality, and that was Taste of the Wild.  The variety of meats in this food is impressive, and what really put me over the top was that it contains fish meal so that our puppy will get the essential omega fatty acids that are absent from the vast majority of dog foods.<br /><br />To give our puppy a gradual transition we have been putting half Innova and half Taste of the Wild in his bowl, and he has been eating out all of the Taste of the Wild first, and coming back later to finish the Innova.  So we have been happy to know our puppy is getting one of the best dog foods on the market, we are saving $13 a month, and he likes it better.  The only issue we have had with Taste of the Wild is kind of gross to write about, but he has been defecating more and hasn't seemed as hungry at meal times. This was a small concern until we realized it was because the food is so tasty that he has been eating out of the bag whenever he wants to.  (which he never did with Innova)<br /><br />Pros:  Top notch food, cheaper than lower quality foods, puppy approved.<br />Cons: Tastes so good that you will really have to keep the bag out of reach.
