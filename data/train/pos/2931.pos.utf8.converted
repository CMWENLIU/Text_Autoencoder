I USE THIS PRODUCT TO BAKE COOKIES FOR MY HUSBAND.  HE HAS TO HAVE LOW SUGARS AND ALMOND MEAL FLOUR IS THE BEST FOR DIABETIC BAKING.  IT TAKES TIME TO WORK WITH IT BECAUSE OF THE CONSISTENCY, BUT THE FLAVOR IS GREAT.  THE PACKAGING KEEPS IT FRESH.  THIS IS THE SECOND BATCH I HAVE PURCHASED FROM BOB'S RED MILL.  I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM THEM AGAIN AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED BOB'S RED MILL TO SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS WHO BAKE AS WELL.  THANK YOU.  C. CIACCIO
