Personally, I'd love a bowl of miso soup any day. I first tried it in a very nice sushi restaurant, and then again in a less-fancy one. A few months later, I discovered that Price Chopper sells these exact packets (they're a bit more expensive there than here on Amazon).<br /><br />Miso soup is hard to describe. I think of it as having a taste that you kind of have to acquire...It took me a few bowls to really get used to it. But once you do, it's great! I suggest this for anyone who's interested in Japanese culture and food.
