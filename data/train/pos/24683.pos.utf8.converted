How do you say DELICIOUS with 2 words? Circus Peanut. The artificial banana flavoring always makes my mouth water. If you are lucky you'll get a peanut from the original batch made in the 1800's! I like to give these out to the ungrateful neighborhood cretins at Halloween, but they just repay my kind gesture by egging my house.
