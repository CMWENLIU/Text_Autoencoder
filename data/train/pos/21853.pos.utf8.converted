I honestly think of all the candy bars available, this one is hands down the best, with Reese's Peanut butter cups tied with this.  If you're starving but can't eat just yet, these guys do a great job in keeping you from fainting with all the nuts/protein they contain.  But, included in all this marvel is wondeful gooey caramel and awesome milk chocolate, not to mention the marshmallow center.  My grandma could down a whole bag of these things in one sitting so I guess it's a gene pool thing.  Be sure to try these if you haven't - they're just awesome.  Highly recommend!
