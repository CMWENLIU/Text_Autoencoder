In the morning I am typically in a rush and so it had been difficult to make breakfast, yet alone a healthy one.  I started combining Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muelsi with a 6oz container of plain yogurt.  The Muesli has just enough sweetness to make the combination enjoyable.  I now have this every morning and it gives me a good start to the day, it's quick, tasty and economical too.<br />I also tried the recipe that is printed on the package for Bob's Chocolate Chip Muesli Cookies and that is a yummy treat.
