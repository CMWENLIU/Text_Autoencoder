If you are considering ordering a 12 pack of the Lindt Excellence Intense Orange Dark Chocolate Bars, you probably already know they are extremely tasty and very satisfying. They are my favorite decadent treat right now. I've ordered several of the 12 packs over time because my local stores in Upstate New York keep going out of stock on this item.<br /><br />The 12-pack is well shipped in box that is suitable to break open for display in a retail setting and it works great for home use too. I've never had a broken candy bar in my orders from Amazon and the bars are dated almost a year in the future so they are fresh and will keep for a long time to come. I've been ordering in the fall and winter this year with no problems. If you order in the summer just keep a look out so the box doesn't sit out on a hot doorstep in the sun where the candy might get too soft.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with ordering these bars from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future as long as the conditions remain the same. Highly recommended!!!
