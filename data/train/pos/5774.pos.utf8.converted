These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever.
