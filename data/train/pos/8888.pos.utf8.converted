Celtic Sea Salt itself is wonderful. We have used it for years. I was very, very unhappy that I clicked on purchasing a 5# bag of salt as you can see for yourself. What I received was a half pound bag of salt. The company was willing to refund my money, but it would have cost me even more to return it than would have been refunded. I would never, ever trust this company again! Shopper beware!
