Dear Amazon.com,<br />Please list the ingredients of products such as this, so that those of us with food allergies can purchase wisely.  What kind of oil is used? Is there dairy in the product?  I would love to try this product, but must know what is in it before I make a purchase of six boxes. Therefore, I am unqualified to rate the product since I have not tried it.<br />Many thanks!
