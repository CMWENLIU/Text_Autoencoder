the tripe was absolutely disgusting smelling, and consequently my dog couldn't gobble it up fast enough! must be love....I have a 100 lb shepherd who LOVES the tripe product. And he is used to raw bones and raw meat, so by dog standards, it must be good stuff.  I will buy more.  How about a large volume better priced unit for us with big dogs?
