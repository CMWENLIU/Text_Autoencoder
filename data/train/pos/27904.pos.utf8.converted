This animal is not for children! I got this for my 10-year-old niece, but I ended up having to take care of it after she nearly lost her finger feeding it its daily bucket of chum. The peels it constantly sheds around the house are also starting to smell. However, I cannot bring myself to take it to the pound, given all of this animal's majestic adorableness and utility.<br />PS: Make sure you get yours fixed, or watch where you leave your fruit lying around...
