This is a delicious oil. The walnut flavor really stands out. We keep this oil in the refrigerator, to preserve freshness and taste. Definitely shake it well before each use. Everyone comments on how good it tastes whenever we use it. So, it's pretty universal in its appeal.<br /><br />We make a salad dressing using this walnut oil, blood orange vinegar and honey. The ratio of all ingredients is 1:1. E.g.:<br />- 1/4 cup blood orange vinegar<br />- 1/4 cup roasted walnut oil<br />- 1/4 cup honey<br />(adjust to your taste buds)<br />Mix with a blender or hand blender (or by shaking the jar, but a blender mixes much better, especially with the thick honey). Wow, is this a wonderful salad dressing!<br /><br />By the way, we use this blood orange vinegar: "Cuisine Perel Blood Orange Vinegar", which is available via Amazon. It has a wonderful flavor.
