Let ME preface MY review by saying that I actually HAVE tried it and it is well worth the price! The grind is perfect for my Solofill and tastes better than any K-cup I've ever used. But here's something I do not get at all! Did that reviewer really just say "It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can"?  I don't get it... the logic I mean. I buy a 2 liter bottle of soda when there's a birthday party or office party, picnic, etc. I KNOW that the bottle will be gone and it's cheaper by the ounce. But that doesn't keep me from buying a 12 oz. can of the same brand of soda!!! Ounce for ounce a can of soda costs FIVE times as much as a 2 liter bottle.  But it doesn't take a coffee snob to figure out after a few days that the ground coffee in that can is losing its flavor the same way a bottle of coke loses its fizz after a few days. If you don't want to spend money on Ekojava coffee packets, then at least buy whole bean coffee and grind it as you use it.<br /><br />But then I suppose someone would say "Why not just buy K-cups then?". Good question - easy answer (in my world anyway).<br /><br />These little sticks of coffee that are ground nicely, weighed out perfectly (instead of the freaking mess you make scooping coffee out of a can or bag), and FRESH! So far, sounds like a K-cup. BUT... I use other things to brew coffee other than a Keurig. The packets work in the Melitta I have in my office. I gave a handful of sticks to my neighbor who tried it in his drip coffeemaker. After trying it a few times, he found that one packet in a drip coffeemaker using a paper filter makes 5 cups of awesome drip coffee! Try that with a K-cup! AND JUST out of curiosity, I stopped by a very cool coffee shop in Boise, Idaho (Salt Tears... VERY cool place!) They have a pour over bar and use the Coava Kone filters instead of paper. I asked him if I could use my coffee packet instead of there DOMA coffee (one of a few roasters in Idaho I would recommend). The water was at 206 degrees and he expertly poured about a third of the water in. The coffee began to de-gas (yeah... ain't gonna happen with ground coffee from a can) and then finished off the pour and we waited. We were both pretty blown away. It was awesome.<br /><br />Bottom line? Not sure I'd recommend this to people who are happy with coffee from a can. And I am NOT knocking those who do. My father scooped Folgers from a can when I was a kid and for years I thought that was the epitome of great coffee (but then, I also used to think hamburger was the highest quality beef). But I confess... that sounds a bit condescending and I realize that many people truly enjoy simple store brand ground coffee in their Keurig. My point it, just because you own a Keurig and a Solofill, doesn't qualify you to write a review for something you've never even tried. Dude... At least try something before you review it. C'mon... really? Okay, I sound like a snob. But I guess that's my point. If you are happy with ground coffee from a can, this probably doesn't make sense. If you are more discriminating than that, and you need something to take with you that is a high quality, one cup solution, is fresh, and you want to use it anywhere in almost anything, then heck yeah... this is a great buy!!!
