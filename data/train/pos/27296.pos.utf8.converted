The Tiptree brand is second to none, in my opinion. Those folks have been making jams and marmalades for decades in Essex. They are very well known in the UK.<br /><br />I consider myself to be a bit of a marmalade freak. I have tried many different varieties and this is the second best marmalade in the world. (The very best is my Mum's home brew variety - but unfortunately you can't buy that!).<br /><br />The tiny jars are a bit odd, but that just means you'll have to keep opening jars all the time to get more of this delicious marmalade. Please Amazon, get some normal-sized jars of this stuff!<br /><br />The ingredients of this marmalade are very simple - oranges and sugar and maybe a bit of citric acid. No corn syrup!! You can tell. This stuff is heavenly. Did I mention that I love this marmalade?? 5 stars seems too low.<br /><br />By the way, Tiptree make other jams such as raspberry, strawberry and blackcurrant. Have you ever seen blackcurrant jam in the US? I haven't. Black jam ("jelly") in the US typically means grape. But try the Tiptree blackcurrant if you can find some, it is extremely good as are all the Tiptree jams. And no, I don't work for Tiptree.<br /><br />Oh, one other thing: if you are going to eat this marmalade, do yourself a favor and spread it on some decent bread. If you use it on Wonderbread you might as well throw it out the window. Bread by Turano (they have it in the Chicagoland area, don't know how easy it is to get hold of elsewhere) is a very good choice. Enjoy!
