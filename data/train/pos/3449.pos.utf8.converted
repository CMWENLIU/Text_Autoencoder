Years ago Heinz provoked national outrage in Britain by threatening to discontinue this classic dressing.<br /><br />As you can see, the upshot is that they still offer it! It's a less thick and gloopy mayonnaise type dressing, with a tang of mustard.<br /><br />It's really lovely with fries, veggies, chicken fingers, on a sandwich...or even with salad! ;)<br /><br />You can't beat this deal for 6 bottles in the US, and it will last for a long time. Enjoy!
