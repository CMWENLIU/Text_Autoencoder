Bought this for $5 a bag off Amazon. It reminds me a lot of Eight O'Clock Columbian. Not as winey but a nice nutty taste. As it cools, what wine essence it has, is revealed. Great Joe for the price.<br /><br />Update 12-07-2010:<br />Liked it so much I just bought 3 more bags. If you like Columbian Coffee this is hard to beat.
