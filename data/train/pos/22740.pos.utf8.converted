We don't have the best water on tap at work (it has a taste I can detect and don't like). I have several bottles of bottled water stashed away in my office in case I forget to bring fresh tap water from home.  I purchased Nestle Pure Life Bottled water because it got the highest marks from the Consumer Reports.<br /><br />Nestle has no flavor and Consumer reports gives it high marks for disclosing where the water came from and how it was treated.  Some brands do not disclose this information, because it is Environmental protection Agency does not require it.  This disclosure is voluntary (with exception of California).  Full disclosure seems like a good idea so you know what you are getting, so that's why Nestle Pure Life is my choice.
