I have been feeding TOTW to my Italian Greyhound-Terrier mix for over a year now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. First, for all of those wanting to feed their dog grain-free, but struggling to pay Orijen prices, TOTW is the solution. TOTW is definitely the most cost-effective grain-free food I've been able to find.<br /><br />For all of those fearful of the use of fish meal and the possible threat of ethoxyquin, it appears that TOTW customer service have confirmed that the particular ocean fish meal used in TOTW is, in fact, ethoxyquin-free. Here is the link to that information and a step-by-step analysis of the ingredient list.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />After getting my dog from a rescue, feeding him TOTW has helped him reach a healthy weight and an active lifestyle. The vet has repeatedly noted how good his weight is, how great his coat looks and how well muscled he is.<br /><br />TOTW, with its high protein and fat content (fat is an essential part of a healthy diet for our four-legged friends) is a great, cost-effective grain-free option. However, those switching from grain kibbles need to be slow about switching their dogs to this kibble. TOTW and other grain-free foods are much richer and a 5 to 7 days slow transition will yield the best result.<br /><br />Is TOTW for every dog? Probably not, every dog reacts differently to different food and if you have a small breed, I would tend to focus on the lower protein content of the Pacific Stream formula rather than the High Prairie or Wetlands Formulas. I do, however, think TOTW can be a great option for a lot of dog owners. If you're interested in starting to feed grain-free and holistic dog food, TOTW has worked great for me and my dog.
