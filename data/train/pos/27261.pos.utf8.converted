My doctor advised me I should stay away from caffeine due to medical reasons- not hypertension. I was horrified! I love coffee, and not only do I need it for a morning pick me up but I love the taste. I was so upset, and started the grieving process. I started to do some research and found this stuff. I placed the order fully expecting it to suck and got my sneakers ready to stomp on the packets in my yard (Still withdrawing and grieving). I just made a pot....I LOVE IT! O.K. it's not coffee, but not that far from it. Not sure if it has a energy boost because I'm drinking it as we speak. Tastes a little smokey, but nice. So happy, now when I make someone coffee (regular), they don't have to endure the sight of me practically sticking my nose in their cup, inhaling the scent, as I take it to them( pathetic I know). I bid my fellow coffee junkies fair well and hope you try this stuff...ok gotta go, drinking my Orzo.
