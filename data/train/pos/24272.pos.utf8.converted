These are all natural, gluten free, low in fat and calories (130 calories and 3 grams of fat per serving) and they taste great.  Simply put I love everything about these chips.  The only problem with them is that they're definitely addicting and I want to eat them all the time.  I guess it's a good thing they're such a good deal here on Amazon (much cheaper than at my local grocery store).<br /><br />The texture is somewhat similar to a rice cake, except that it's much thinner so it has a better crunch to it.  They taste like salted popcorn minus the annoying hulls and un-popped kernels.
