I first saw Kadoya Hot Sesame Oil sitting on the shelves and  I was attracted to the bright yellow top.  I was looking for hot sesame oil and it looked so enticing.<br />I bought it, took it home, and it was just what I had been looking for all my life!!  I have tried other hot sesame oil's and they do not hold a candle to Kadoya.  It<br />seduced me and I have remained faithful all these years.  So glad you can order and have it shipped to  me....Thanks...........
