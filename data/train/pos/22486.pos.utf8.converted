I love my 85 lb yellow lab, Jake, and wanted to feed him something he loved but kept him from gaining weight since he has been fixed yet gave him all the nutrients needed.  This food seems to fit the requirements. And I must say, after switching from the regular grocery store brands I have noticed that he passes less gas and his stools are a lot easier to pick up on our walkies (sorry for the TMI).  I highly recommend Blue Buffalo foods, looks like the hype is well deserved.
