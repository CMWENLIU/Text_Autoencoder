I'm not sure about the validity of the "scientific" research the maker claims, but this is what I do know about this salt.  This product although expensive is superior to grocery store salt.  This is mined from deep in the earth before we started trashing the planet.  Regular sea salt is from sources that can't help but be at least a little polluted.  The popular pollution free option in these modern days is to make table salt.  This manmade salt is pure sodium and chloride, and lacks the minerals that makes salt nutritious leaving only negatives and no, "salt of the earth" left.  It's a sad state that we live in that it costs so much to buy a quality salt that has the natural trace minerals we need for good health.  (these minerals are available from plant sources, but you have to eat tons to get the same amount)  On a positive side, a big bag of this lasts my two person household about a year using only this to salt food or cook.
