I bought grains from the Amazon seller "Drybyma Treasures" about a month and a half ago. I received them in 3 days, and they took about 3 days to recover from their ordeal in the mail, producing some very nasty sour-milk-tasting stuff the first day and some very yeasty-tasting stuff the second two days. But their fourth attempt was delicious and by now they've fully recovered and are reproducing like mad. Drybyma sent about 2 tablespoons of grains in the original package, but in a couple of weeks I had half a cup and a week after that I had almost a full cup of grains. I've had to give some grains away and eat some in order to keep the population down.<br /><br />The grains looked like cottage cheese curds when they first arrived. But then they started producing noodle-like shapes and recently began producing tiny cauliflower shapes. It's interesting how they develop.<br /><br />The kefir they produce tastes similar to the kefir I used to buy at my neighborhood Whole Foods store. Sometimes it's more tart than other times, and thickness also varies. I've used both Jersey milk and goat's milk. The thickest, mildest kefir I've made was with raw light cream.<br /><br />Unfortunately Drybyma doesn't seem to be selling kefir grains at the moment. Perhaps they sold out and need to rebuild their stock. Hopefully they'll return so other shoppers can enjoy their product. I can't really rate any other seller's kefir grains because quality can vary.
