This looks like real food! The chicken is actual chicken shreds, not some amorphous grey paste. The other TikiCat varieties are similar - the fish looks like fish, you can see pieces of leafy greens, etc.<br /><br />My cats love this. They also love the salmon, chicken+salmon, ahi tuna, and all the "tuna on rice with ___" varieties. I calculated the % calories from protein (vs. from fat/carbs), because I'm looking for the cat food that has the highest %cals from protein. Of the five TikiCat varieties I checked out, Hawaiian grill has the highest %cal from protein, followed by Napili Luau and PukaPuka Luau. The "tuna on rice with __" do have some carbs, since they have rice in them, but I still feed them to my cats every now and then for variety (and because they're less expensive!). My cats love all the TikiCat varieties I've given them, and I feel comfortable feeding this brand of cat food to my cats, since I can see what it's made of, there's no weirdness on the ingredients panel, and everything I've heard about the company (Petropics) makes it sound like they're really environmentally conscious.<br /><br />GreenLittleCat did a review of TikiCat, including a picture of what's inside the can. They also did a "natural cat food showdown" where they compared a bunch of natural cat food companies' environmental practices, and TikiCat won! Google them, since I feel uncomfortable linking to an outside site. (I have no affiliation with GreenLittleCat)
