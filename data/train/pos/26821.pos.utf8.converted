I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market.
