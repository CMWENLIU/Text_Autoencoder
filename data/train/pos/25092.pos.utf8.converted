Tho the picture shows "pure maple syrup" on the bottle, the jugs that you get DO say "Vermont Maple Syrup." This Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Syrup is made in Vermont, USA, and is the finest quality! It is Grade A dark amber, which is tastier and has a deeper maple flavor than the lighter Grade A's, but it is NOT strong like the Grade B is. In fact, its JUST RIGHT, whether you use it on hot cereal, hot cakes, waffles, ice cream, or whatever. This is a pint jug and it goes pretty fast around our house, so you might want to buy a couple! Recommended!
