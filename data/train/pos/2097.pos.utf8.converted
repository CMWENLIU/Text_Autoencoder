Heat these up in the microwave for about 15-25 seconds and they're ready. Too bad there's NO MEAT inside! Mince pie (or mincemeat pies) are a traditional festive British sweet pastry, usually consumed during the Christmas and New Year period. Mince Pies normally have a pastry top, but versions may also be found without the top in which case they are known as a mince tart.<br /><br />The name 'mincemeat' comes from the original recipe. Up to the Victorian era the mince(meat) pie would actually have been a spiced meat pie with some dried fruit. Today the only remnant of the original meat is (sometimes) the inclusion of suet. Typically fillings today consist entirely of fruit-based mincemeat containing dried fruit such as raisins, currants, glace cherries, apricot, candied peel; spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg; nuts such as walnuts or chopped almonds; suet; and some kind of alcohol, usually either brandy or rum.<br /><br />Walkers Mince pies are suitable for vegetarians because the suet is replaced by vegetable oil. The pie is often finished off with a delicate dusting of either castor sugar or icing sugar on top.
