This makes by far the yummiest veggie broth I've ever tasted.  I'd describe it as similar to chicken broth - very rich and herby.<br /><br />Tips: It's a little salty so you may want to reduce the amount of added salt when you cook with it.  The cube is also sort of moist so you can cut it in half if you just need one cup of veg broth.
