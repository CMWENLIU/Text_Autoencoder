This is excellent green tea and I am grateful I could find it on Amazon as none of the grocery stores around here carry it, nor does Walmart. It make a superior iced green tea for those of us that prefer green tea. It also work well hot. Luzianne has another winner of a product in this one and Amazon's price for a whole case of family size tea bags beats what I would have to spend at a grocery store anyway.  Thanks Amazon!
