Bought this dark chocolate mainly because of the German study of 20,000 people that showed people who ate 6 grams of dark chocolate a day had a 39% less chance of getting a stroke or heart attack.  Because of the Flavanols.  Since I bought this, I have had neither! Oh, yeah; it tastes pretty good, too.
