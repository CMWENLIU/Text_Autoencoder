It is almost too good to be true, but the stix (Atkins followers will know what I mean) don't lie:  Dreamfields pasta won't mess with your low-carbing (or your lipolysis).<br /><br />I've low-carbed for the better part of 9 years, and this is one of the few low-carb products that not only delivers, it does so without any concessions.  The taste & texture are spot-on, and the non-dieters in your family won't raise an eyebrow.  Of course, keep it in moderation, but do give it a try.
