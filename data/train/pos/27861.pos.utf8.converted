Wow!  This little bottle of hot sauce packs a punch.  I first bought this product when I was in college and boy oh boy it was fun.  This is really hot! HOT! HOT! HOT!  Here's what you don't want to do:<br /><br />WARNING!  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRY THIS AT HOME.  READ THE WARNING LABEL ON THE BOTTLE.<br /><br />DO NOT:<br />1.  Heat up a frying pan in your friend Boot's house and drop a little "DA BOMB" hot sauce in the pan!  All of the guests will flee from the house as if mustard gas was just released.<br /><br />2.  Put "DA BOMB" hot sauce in somone's lotion, toothbrush, or phone receiver as it spreads like wild fire.  It's worse when it gets close to your eyes.<br /><br />3.  Throw a house party and dare party-goers to try "DA BOMB" hot suace on the end of toothpick, and when he needs something to take the hot away, hand him a piece of bread with more "DA BOMB" hot sauce on it.  Your party will be over quick.<br /><br />4.  Sneakily drop "DA BOMB" hot sauce on your friends pizza when he walks away from the room.  After his first bite, he will look directly at you with anger!<br /><br />Again, these are tales from the "Underside".
