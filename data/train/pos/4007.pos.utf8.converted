Will this drink give you good health, great longevity, inner serenity and incisive mental clarity?  No, no, no and no.  Does it contain live organisms?  It is pasteurized, so again no.  Is is manufactured and canned by special mystical people high in the Himalayas?  No.  Isn't cane juice just sugar?  Yes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a funky tasting beverage where the taste horrifies yet refreshes and leaves you wanting more then give this a try.  The citrus/vinegar combo is weird at first but now I'm hooked.  As I am on a diet I like that the cans are small so I can get my taste fix yet not go crazy on the calories.
