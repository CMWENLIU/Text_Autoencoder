I ordered this Wissotzky Tea Box for a business associate (and close friend)who lives in another state.  Not only did it arrive early (thank you), but following is the email I received directly from my friend: "The wooden box is beautiful and I am going to save it always for my tea-even when the tea runs out. It has a beautiful latch and hinges and great art work. It is perfect. I love the tea selection. I am going to use the tea and box for my Christmas brunch for my family."  It is so reassuring to send a gift (without seeing it) and know it will be a quality purchase.
