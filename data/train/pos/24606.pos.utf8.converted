Essentially the price is 2.65/lb. This is a really good deal. I bought 24 of this earlier (to take advantage of free shipping) and I love it. It's full of the healthy saturated fat that the Weston A. Price Foundation praises. I go through each package in about 3 days, sometimes 2. I just sprinkle it on my meat and vegetables.<br /><br />The product itself has a nice natural sweetness to it. It doesn't taste too much different from sweetened coconut. It's nice to finally purchase a quality functional food that's cheap.
