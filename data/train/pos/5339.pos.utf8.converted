Soy sauce isn't just soy sauce.  There are many different styles of quality and flavor, and just like any other condiment people are going to have their preferences.<br /><br />Personally, I love pure tamari soy sauce.  This is the original stuff, darker and more flavorful; it is the traditional recipe for Japanese soy sauce as it was originally introduced from China.  Made as a by-product of miso production, tamari soy sauce has far more nutrients and health benefits than the mass-produced flavoring agent that can be found in any supermarket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to production techniques and quality, tamari soy sauce is often considerably more expensive than the standard commercial variety.  Even though I love it, I confess that I don't use it when recipes call for large amounts, or when the richer flavor of tamari is just going to be lost in the blend.  However, whenever I use pure soy sauce, such as with sushi or sashimi, then I absolutely dish out the extra cash for the better flavor.  Tamari soy sauce and some real wasabi make a huge difference.
