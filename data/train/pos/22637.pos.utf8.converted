Wow, I was stunned to see the color of the tea after brewing. I used just 1 teaspoonful of tea leaves in my tea pot and added hot water just enough to fill up to regular-sized coffee cup that I use for 12 oz of coffee. The leaves produced unbelievably sparky fresh green color that green tea should look like, but I forgot how it should be as not many green teas sold can achieve this color! It was strong enough to add some more hot water later on to make a full 12 oz cup full of green tea. But one caution is that real green tea is very easy and fast to be oxidized if left in the air. Once it oxidized, you can see it as the color of green changes to brown, and it has reverse effect of the benefit of green tea in that case. SO, make sure to keep your tin can as tight all the time, and close the lid as soon as possible. After brewing the tea, drink it as soon as possible but of course don't force yourself to manage burn to your mouth!!
