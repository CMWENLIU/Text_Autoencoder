When diagnosed with Celiac Disease I really missed eating good tasting cereals.  I tried a lot of other gluten free cereals and they were not filling, would get soggy, and often were so full of sweeteners, they even left my mouth feeling raw.  Perky's Nutty Flax is awesome!  It is filling, not too sweet, tastes great on yogurt or can be eaten alone.  And it stays crunchy for a long time, an added bonus for a busy mom in the mornings.  I highly recommend this cereal for anyone with Celiac Disese that used to love cereal.  In fact, I need to start buying this in bulk since the rest of my family discovered it and loves it.  I is so nice that my kids, who do not have Celiac Disease, eat a healthy cereal like this.
