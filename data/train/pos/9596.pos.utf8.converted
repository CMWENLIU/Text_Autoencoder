10 Stars. I can't say enough about the quality of this product. I started with lettuce. I know I will buy at least a second unit to grow herbs and will probably buy a third to grow strawberries when they come out.  I may even go for a 4th for tomatoes if I could figure out where to put it.  This company worked very hard to build a product that is as fail proof as possible and it couldn't be any easier. I am so grateful that someone took the time to bring this technology to the public.  I look forward to the future and all the products yet to be developed. I'd love to have a whole room of these things.
