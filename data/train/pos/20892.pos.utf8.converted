I regularly make flax muffins and also mix ground flaxmeal in my Greek yogurt or use it in my meatball recipe, etc.  Bob's Red Mill Golden Flaxseed Meal is a very consistently fine meal, with a delicate taste, and an extended expiration date.  And there is no better price out there than on amazon.com--will definitely continue to buy it here.
