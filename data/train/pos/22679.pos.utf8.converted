I eat a lot of rice, so I am always buying different kinds to try out. Most frequently, I eat sushi rice seasoned with only salt and sesame seeds.  This rice is my favorite so far!  Just the fragrance of this rice cooking in the rice cooker will get people to ask where the wonderful smell is coming from. The taste is just as nice, clean, and with flavorful toasty notes.  This rice is also almost as nutritious as brown rice, just without as much fiber. the germ is intact, so you need to wash it gently in order to keep the germ intact on the grain. This is what gives this rice the beautiful aroma, taste and nutrition.<br /><br />This rice cooks best if you follow the washing and soaking directions on the package. Just 30 minutes of soaking and this rice will yield the same texture as polished white sushi rice. I have found that all sushi rice works best when cooked in a rice cooker, so I can't say how this rice would fare if cooked in a pot with a tight fitting lid. The texture maybe slightly more firm if done in a pot, so you may want to increase soaking time OR add a few extra tablespoons of water at the start of cooking.<br /><br />This rice would make an excellent breakfast rice with an egg and kurobata sausage, or any grilled fish. Nice and sticky enough for any kind of sushi as well.
