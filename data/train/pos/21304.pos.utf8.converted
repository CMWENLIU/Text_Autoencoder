Bought this at Babies R Us.  They are perfect for feeding baby on the go directly from the pouched baby food.  Although it says it was designed for Plum, it indeed fits most pouched brands including Plum, HappyBaby, and Ella's Kitchen).  The dispensing hole is bigger than some of squeeze top feeder so you can feed meals that are a little bit chunkier than puree food.  Pouched baby food is already easier to pack than jarred food, with this spoon, pouched food is the way to go for traveling with babies!!!
