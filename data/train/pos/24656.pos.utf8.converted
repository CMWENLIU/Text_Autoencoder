Had my first experience cooking and eating Eden's millet and both my husband and I liked it very much. He's not a fan of couscous, but this he liked. It has more texture, resembles rice but is more compact. Like rice, millet is a blank canvas. You can mix it with orzo pasta and create a pilaf w/fresh herbs and/or veggies, add it to soups, for stuffed peppers, or eat just as a side dish seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and perhaps a dab of butter.  It cooks in less than 30 minutes, has 4 grams of fiber for 1/4 cup uncooked, and contains all the essential amino acids. A healthy and interesting addition to one's diet.
