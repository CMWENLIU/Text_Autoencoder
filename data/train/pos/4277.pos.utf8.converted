I went to Africa and when we were leaving made sure to bring back 2 Peak containers home.  We ran out and I knew that i must replace it immediately.  I went to the Caribbean stores ad they had it on say for $20.  Checked on Amazon and it was $12.  Perfect price!  I no longer need to buy from overseas.
