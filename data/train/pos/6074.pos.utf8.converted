I've been using Nopalina for over 3 years and it is great at regulating the digestive tract and keeping down those intestinal bulges that show in the stomach area. It is not a weight loss product per se, you will lose weight with initial 2 week use because you are flushing your intestinal tract and you will maintain weight by keeping your tract flowing. In addition to balanced food intake and moderate exercise, you can lose weight.
