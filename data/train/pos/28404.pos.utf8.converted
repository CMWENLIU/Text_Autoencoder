I love this product, but I also love Coconut. After reading several of the online reviews about the consistency I decided to offer my routine.<br />I have also purchased Nutiva Coconut Manna which I also like a lot. However this product does seems a bit more moist then the other one. I do still purchase both. The whole thing about these items is getting them to where the oil and the raw fibers are really well blended and if you fail to do that it could really be the difference between loving it or vowing never to eat it again.<br />When I get a new jar I remove the plastic around the rim, then I put it in about a half inch of water in a pan (place the whole jar)...on a medium simmer. Watch it a few minutes and use an oven mitt to remove it when you really see it melt down. I then take it out of the water open it up and take a butter knife and slowly stir the oils into the fibers. This can take a few minutes but once it is done it is fabulous. You will see it transform and become really smooth,... at this point I take out what I am going to use then replace the cover tightly and put it upside down and leave in on my counter as I use it everyday. It stays mixed and smooth when I need it after I've mixed it the initial first time. It is a great source of energy, however I do understand that it is not for everyone. I will say that I use it on old fashioned oatmeal with a touch of maple syrup and a tablespoon of natural applesauce and the flavor combination and energy derived from this is  incredible. Hope that this helps someone.
