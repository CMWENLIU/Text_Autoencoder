I'm no tea expert, but I've sampled quite a few of the Bigelow varieties.  English Breakfast is a great basic black tea, much more full than the flavor in a black tea bag from a generic or major brand 100-bag box.  I don't find it to be bitter at all, unlike some black tea varieties.  I try to let it steep for no more than 2 minutes in the cup (the package suggests 1 to 2 minutes), as additional time seems to introduce a bitter component that increases with time.  If you want a stronger flavor, you might experiment with 2 bags, rather than 1 bag for longer time.  However, this is a fairly strong tea, and I'm happy with the strength from one bag.  I consider English Breakfast to be my "standard" tea for when I'm not looking for some variety.<br /><br />Don't confuse English Breakfast (pink bag) with another Bigelow black tea variety called English TeaTime (deep blue bag).  There's quite a difference, with the English TeaTime being much weaker.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.
