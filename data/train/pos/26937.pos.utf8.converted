I'm very happy with the traps.  I put them out all over and<br />got the one cockroach that somehow snuck into the house<br />on the very first night that I set the traps out.  I also caught<br />two silverfish.  The trap gets five stars just for the cockroach.<br /><br />The neighborhood I'm in has these huge vw bug cockroaches<br />with dark shells.  I have to be careful to keep doors closed<br />at night so they won't sneak in.  I hate them because they<br />run when you scream or when you're about to smash them<br />with a shoe on the trash can.<br /><br />Anyways, first thing this morning after having the trap set up<br />last night I see this big cockroach was stuck in the trap and<br />still moving.  I panicked because I couldn't smash it with<br />anything since it was 3/4 in the trap and its head was sticking<br />out and I had nothing to smash with handy.  I squirted maybe 1/4<br />cup of dish detergent onto it because I remembered reading<br />somewhere on internet that cockroaches breathe through their<br />skin.  After it got coated in soap I then was afraid the soap<br />would dissolve the sticky stuff in the trap and set the bugger<br />loose, but happily it struggled and died in the trap.<br />I only had to clean soap off that I squirted but that's okay<br />because cockroaches leave scent trails that need to be washed<br />off to prevent other buggers from following the trail.<br />If you don't squirt the cockroach, the trap and surrounding<br />area will be nice and clean and dry.  The sticky stuff inside<br />the traps stays inside.<br /><br />The traps are a bit hard to separate since you are tearing along<br />a perforation in cardboard after removing a divider strip to<br />separate two traps, but once you get the hang of how to do it,<br />it is okay. I was able to easily handle the traps and not get any<br />of the sticky stuff from inside the traps onto my hands.  Its<br />great that there is no toxic poisonous stuff in the traps.
