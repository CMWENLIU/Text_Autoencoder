I think maybe there's a Skinner's Raisin Bran cult.  For about the last 30 years, I've been searching out this cereal in local supermarkets, but it keeps disappearing. When I found it on Amazon, I was overjoyed told all my fellow Skinner's fans.  As other people here are saying, the flakes are completely different from the processed fake flakes of almost all packaged cereals because they are rolled out and you can see the grain of the wheat kernel. They taste like real wheat, not cardboard! The raisins aren't sugared, but naturally sweet.  I was outraged when Consumer Reports gave Skinner's a low score about 15 years back.  People must be too programmed to feel that cereal has to be fake and sweet.
