This is the only Lucuma I have ever tasted in my whole life before so I can't compare it to a different product.  However it's hard to imagine that Lucuma could be more delightful and delicious than this!  I have mixed it into raw chocolates with coconut butter, cacao butter and cacao powder.  I have made a smoothie with bananas, hemp seeds, and vanilla.  I also mixed it into a strawberry pudding with chia seeds and raw honey.  Yum!
