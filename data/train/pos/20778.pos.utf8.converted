Mind you, this is my first excursion into the Yerba Mate world so I have nothing to compare it against, but I am quite happy with this product. It tasts good hot (especially with a little honey and some frothed soy milk like the comapny's website suggests) and I love throwing a bag into my water bottle. It steeps cold, so I can just toss one in and I have flavored beverage to enjoy during my day.
