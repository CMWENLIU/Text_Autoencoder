My boyfriend went to Germany over the summer and brought back a bag of these. Aside from the German writing/packaging, he had no idea they were any different from what we normally purchase. The German flavors are SO much better than the US version. We are thrilled to have found an importer of these gummy bears. They are the best in the world, hands down.
