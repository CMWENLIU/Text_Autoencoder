These little creamers are a lifesaver ... even better that they need no refrigeration ... of course I acquired them in the winter, so I can't speak about how well they hold up in the summer yet ... but I'm hopeful :)<br /><br />They're handy, the sixty-day expiration date is fine, and they are easy to store to boot. Though the trash generated bothers me a little (the little portion-control cups add up over time), but since I have no space for a small refrigerator in my office at this point, the convenience outweighs my conscience (so far!).<br /><br />My first case will last me over a month, so in the long run, it's even economical. I have nothing bad to say about this product ... really!
