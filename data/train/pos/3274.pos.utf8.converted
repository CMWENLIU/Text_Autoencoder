Our poor little pooch (ok, ok ... a big ol slobbery mess) had some serious stomach issues since we moved to the city from 4 acres of freedom. We tried everything to help her adjust, including altering her diet. Adding small amounts of oatmeal and rice to her regular food helped, but we kept having to increase the portions. Eventually, she was eating too much people food, and not enough dog food. We knew it was doubtful that it was a medical problem because of prior history of stress induced digestive issues. Not only that, she always had a fussy stomach to begin with (already vet checked). Nonetheless, we were beginning to get worried.<br /><br />Finally, on a hunch, I visited a local family owned pet store down the street. The kid there obviously knew his stuff, and the products. I explained the situation, and he recommended California Natural. I never wanted to try this brand because of the price but I decided to trust him.<br /><br />Well, the problem cleared up completely in less than 2 days. There was very little, if any, transition period between her old food and California Natural. The, ahem, results (if you will) are now normal, occur less frequently, and compact (sorry to be gross.)<br /><br />At first, I was worried about the cost. I realize now, a resulting vet bill could cost far more. I am now looking at this as a preventative measure; an investment into her health and longevity. If we had started her on California Natural at the beginning, she probably wouldn't have the "fussy stomach" I mentioned earlier. Not only that, we might have saved countless dollars, hassle, discomfort, and emotional distress by avoiding trips to the vet.<br /><br />The food satisfies her, she loves it, and it is gentle on her stomach. And, I am told, it is healthy stuff. All I can say is - hallelujah!<br /><br />Thanks guys -<br /><br />- from Sandy the pooch<br /><br />(and us)<br /><br /> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XLVBU">California Natural Lamb Meal and Rice Adult Dry Dog Food</a>
