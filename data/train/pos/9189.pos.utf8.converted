Teff is a relative of millet but has a more interesting taste, it smelled a bit like hazlenuts when I opened the package.  I bought this to use in a recipe for a tart crust.  It substitutes for about half of the all-purpose flour.  It was absolutely delicious!  It acted more like a pastry flour in this recipe (but with a lot more calcium and iron- this grain is a nutrient powerhouse).  The crust was unbelievably light and moist (almost like freshly made shortbread) and was much better tasting than the typical tart crust .<br /><br />I have always been very happy with the quality of Bob's Red Mill products and this one was no exception.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!
