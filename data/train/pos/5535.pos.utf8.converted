This much I am certain: This stuff is great tasting goo. Agave enhances food items just right and makes for a yummy iced coffee.<br /><br />It doesn't spike your blood sugar, or skyrocket your glycemic index the way sugar does.  With sugar-laden foods I have to fight off coming back for seconds, thirds, and so forth.  In our household if we're about to run out we hit the panic button, and order another case.<br /><br />This Agave product comes as advertised.
