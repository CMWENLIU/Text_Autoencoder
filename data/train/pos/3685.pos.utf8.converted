I like a lot of crap in my coffee, and yet I still like the flavor of coffee. Generally, with as much crap as I put in it (think half and half, flavored creamer, truvia and flavored syrup), I can no longer taste the coffee. *DUH* I bet you are saying, "well clearly she doesn't like the taste of coffee" but really I do! So I am usually left thinking "why did I put so much crap in my coffee??" Well, problem solved with this Dark Magic. The [great] coffee flavor comes through loud and clear, even with all my additions. I can only imagine that if I DIDN'T put all this crap in it I might singe my nose hairs because boy is it strong! You people who drink it without diluting it, a lot, are my heroes.
