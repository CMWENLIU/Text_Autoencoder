When you compare the zesty Limonata Sparkling Lemon Beverage to other sparkly lemon beverages, you begin to realize the sheer perfection of the Limonata beverage by San Pellegrino. The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
