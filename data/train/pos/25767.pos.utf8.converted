The sauce that comes in the bag makes the cooked ramen "pretty" spicy. However, if you don't like extra hot, then you can add veggies, such as, onions, green onions, egg, and even beef/other meats, and it will become pretty mild. There are a lot of Korean noodles, but Shin Ramyun is one of my favorites! If you don't enjoy spicy food (or msg - some mentioned it), then don't bother.
