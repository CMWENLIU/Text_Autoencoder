I am 8 weeks pregnant and suffering from all day sickness and nausea.  I don't want drugs and looked for a natural remidy to take the edge off long enought to eat some toast.<br /><br />I saw the Preggo Pop Drops on Amazon.com and read that they are basically just tart hard candies with a larger price tag.  I wanted something a little healthier and decided to give these a try.  THEY ARE AMAZING!!!!<br /><br />I am currently enjoying the grapefruit from the sample pack and my nausea is gone.  All the flavors work wonderfully.  They are lightly sweet, nicely tart and discreetly small for stashing all over for instant relief.<br /><br />If I were not pregnant I would enjoy these just as much.  Such a nice burst of fresh fruit flavor to give you a little pick-me-up!
