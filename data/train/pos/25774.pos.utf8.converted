This is the best hot sauce I've tasted in some time.  The first listed ingredients:  mandarin oranges, honey and mangos, give this sauce a strong sweet barbeque sauce flavor.  Indeed, you don't notice the heat for the first half second or so that it hits your tounge.  Then wham!  A fairly potent heat wave hits, courtesy of the fourth listed ingredient, habanero peppers.<br /><br />This sauce is not for everyone.  On the one hand, a significantly large portion of the population thinks Tabasco sauce is hot.  At 11,000 scoville units, this is about 5.5 times hotter.  On the other hand, purists will find this sauce way too mild.  If your idea of hot begins with Blair's 'After Death' (97,000 scoville units, or almost 50 times hotter than Tabasco) then Crazy Jerry will seem positively sane.  But if you are like me, and want some flavor to go along with your pain, then this is a nice sauce.  In the last week I have used it on tri tip steak, rice, eggs, chicken, and of course chips and found it added a real zest to my menu.  A tasty treat, it's worth a try.
