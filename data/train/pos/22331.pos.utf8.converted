Just wanted to respond to the person below who was warning people about the dangers of "excitotoxins". Glutamic acid, one of the product's ingredients, is a completely naturally occuring amino acid that everyone's body makes in the course of metabolism. Yes, you probably do not want to drink a gallon of it in one day, but that counts for pretty much everything. Please don't pay any attention to that reviewer, the product is great, especially for people who don't tolerate ingredients in traditional soy sauce (like gluten).
