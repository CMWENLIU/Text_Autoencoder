This is a great product!  It is the best protein shake I've ever come across.  Here's why:<br />-Only 180 calories.  So many protein shakes on the market have 300 + calories.  That's great if you're looking to turn into the next Arnold, but if you're like me and just want to get in better shape and tone your muscles than it's nice to not consume so many calories.<br />-There's only like 1 g of sugar.<br />-Unlike most protein shakes/meal replacement shakes I've had, you really truly can make this one with water.  Most other shakes are so funky that you have to use milk or soymilk.  Not this one.  It literally works with water.  I use 8 oz of water, a few cubes of ice, and blend.<br />-It's THICK.  Really thick.  It's like a thick milkshake, so it's really filling.  Fills me up as much as a meal if not more.<br />-Tastes GREAT.  I love the taste!
