Cameron's is a great tasting coffee and a great value for the price.  This particular favorite--along with the toasted pecan--is my favorite.  I'm a picky coffee drinker, and I'm impressed by the quality of this coffee.  The smell is intoxicating and the flavor is unmatched.  I often buy several of these 32-ounce bags and keep them in the freezer.  They stay fresh for several months.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't grind it until you're about to use it and toss in a French Press for best results.
