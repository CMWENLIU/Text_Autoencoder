I've been extremely impressed with Amy & Brian's coconut juices.  If you take a look at the ingredients, it's just young coconut juice and lime juice.  How could it be any purer than that?<br /><br />I thought this flavor tasted a little funny at first, but I think I didn't shake it.  After shaking it before subsequent experiences, it had a very refreshing lime taste along with the coconut juice.<br /><br />Amy & Brian coconut juices are fantastic energizers and a great pick-me-up during the day.
