I have a pitbull 3years old and my wife has 2 pugs 7months and a 1 year old, they are all best friends. I bought the dental Dinosaur, because my pitbull will chew up any toy in 5 minutes and they were made of a very hard plastic.I am very amazed how long they have lasted and all 3 dogs love to chew on them.
