I won't lie... I like my tea strong. So strong I often use 3xs what I should for high quality stuff... you could say I'm a bit of a tea junkie... so could the 120+ kinds of teas in my home. This is one of those kinds of teas that you don't want to call tea (and that is strong enough to drink 1 bag to 1 cup!)... especially since it IS best served with a little less water and a little more milk... I like to drink a LOT of tea at once, so I tend to take 2xs the water with 3 bags... told you a lot... and then add milk. The milk MAKES this tea... I guess some could use soy stuff, but I like mine straight from the mama cow's udder, thanks.<br /><br />Yogi tea definitely gets an award for consistency... the box look changed over time, but the tea... has remained consistent... they are precise. I like that in a tea maker.
