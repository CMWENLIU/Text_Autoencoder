I have a little garden in my backyard and I love to grow my own vegetables ( weather permitting).  This year I watered some of my plants with Trivedi Water (only twice by mixing with regular tap water in 1:5 ratio).  I was amazed to see those plants which received this water had much better growth, color of leaves was greener, and the vegetables( in this case Okra) were delicious.  By the way no chemicals were sprayed on these plants.
