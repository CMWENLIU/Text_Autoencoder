I don't quite know what to rate? The product was fine, the packaging was fine and there was nothing wrong with the fruit so I gave it 5 out of 5 since I don't think the taste should count in this instance. I ordered mine from ebay for much cheaper (totalling $7). The package arrived today. I had tried to get a whiff of the infamouse sewer-like smell from other Durian products I've ordered online. I tried Durian fruit chips off of ebay (HeyHah brand totalling around $3) and gleefully tore open the bag in hopes of getting a  knock-out decay smell only to not smell anything but fruit chips that didn't even taste that different from other fruit chips like banana. So I ordered this product in hopes that it would be different. It surely was, upon opening the bag I smelt a skunk scent that seemed to take over my eating space. Due to the smell I was being an avoidant procrastinator by putting it aside and focusing on something else until I built up enough of a hunger to try it. But then a chip fell out onto my desk and not wanting to toss it I bit into it spontaneously. The taste wasn't bad. It tasted like ordinary fruit with a musky background after swallowing. Don't eat this before a date. It is sort of like fruity garlic though not as strong as garlic and the taste surely doesn't last that long in your mouth. The fruit was sort of good with a somewhat creamy taste. Try it if you like to try new and different foods!
