I was always scared away from trying these things from all the bad reviews complaining about the smell and texture. However, a local grocer recently started stocking them so I couldn't resist paying the few dollars for a package.<br /><br />I was shocked - no smell but I boiled them up to warm them up anyways. They went great with a simple tomato sauce and grated cheese. You get a good size bowl of mild flavored noodles that may be slighty more slippery than regular pasta, but nothing that bother my tastes. For 40 calories its a good thing to add to dishes when you need to eat light - soups would be really ideal with this type of noodle.
