Supposedly freeze-dried Acai powder is the best and most potent form of Acai.  If you take a scoop a day of this stuff a day it will last you over a month - this is more powder per serving than what's offered in the capsule forms of Acai.  When compare the value - the amount of powder in a jar versus how much you pay for it, plus how much powder you get in a scoop... this is hands down the best!  I mix mine in milk - to me it tastes like malted milk.  I've had a lot more energy since I started taking this stuff and every time I drink my glass of Acai milk it seems to have a balancing effect on my stomach and body.<br /><br />Sambazon sounds like a great company too.  If you are going to take an antioxidant to help purify your body, then why wouldn't you take organic?  Also, they are a member of fair trade and so forth.  The company was begun by two environmentally-minded surfers.  So there's the added benefit (besides getting the best deal) of knowing that I am supporting a good company.
