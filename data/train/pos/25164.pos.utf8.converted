I LOVE this cereal. I am glad to find it on Amazon with more of the Nature's Path Cereals. I probably will purchase this particular one at Costco (NO Others Available there) because it was $5.99 for a box with 2, 13.2 oz bags in it. Excellent Product. I will have to buy the others here at a slightly higher price because No Others were available from Costco. Worth the cost at either place.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of about 12/1/09 Costco no longer has this brand, I bought some of the last double packs of the Red Berry Crunch for $3.97, 26 ozs. IT WAS GOOD! No More Left. Amazon probably has the next best price. I did not see this one at Trader Joe's.
