While I lamented the lack of Eagle Mills San Francisco Sourdough Bread Machine Mixes on Amazon, someone had commented that the company had been acquired by Krusteaz and that I should try that mix instead.  Being unable to find it anywhere in my local stores and feeling like I had to have an alternative to homemade sourdough, I finally relented and ordered the boxes.  Whoever originally told me to do it, THANK YOU!  The Krusteaz mix IS just like the Eagle Mills was.  Taste is the same, instructions are the same, the only thing that isn't the same is the amount of the mix in the box - 14 oz for Krusteaz vs. 15 oz for Eagle Mills.  I don't miss the extra ounce too much.  While it isn't like home made sourdough, it does make a nice quick substitute when one does not have 15 hours to devote to bread.  Thank you!
