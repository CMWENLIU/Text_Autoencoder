As another reviewer said, these are pulverized in our house.  Once the can is opened, somehow that aroma waifs through the air on the back of a gnat and they're by my side in 1/2 a millisecond! My only suggestion is that if you have a cat that doesn't like pates, be careful on these grilled varieties.  They're supposed to all be shredded but they do have a couple that are actually pates and well, up went the nose on those!  I pay about six dollars less for this loaf pack at my local grocery, so keep that in mind with the pricetag.  I think it's high.  Other than that, highly recommend!
