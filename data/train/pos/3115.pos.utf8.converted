I've tried many brands of canned cat food. This one was the winner! All 10 cats gobble this up, and I have seen an amazing improvement in their vitality. They are more playful, their coats are so soft and shiny. I like that it is natural, the texture is smooth and moist, and the ingredients are nutritious. Unlike some other canned foods, this one seems easily digested as not one cat has vomited after eating it. The price I paid with free prime shipping was just 68-cents per can. The food does not have a strong odor. They don't have 'cat breath' after eating this food either! I hope that Amazon gets this back in stock, and puts it on subscribe-and-save!
