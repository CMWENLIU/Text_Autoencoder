UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.
