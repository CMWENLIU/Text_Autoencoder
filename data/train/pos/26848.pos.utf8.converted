I recently bought this box of Oolong tea a few weeks ago.  Generally I drink it at least twice a day.  Most of the time at room temperature.  It is an excellent tea with a very nice and smooth flavor.  Although it is free of caffeine I have found myself feeling more awake after drinking it.  At the same time I feel more energy I also feel as though I am able to think clearer.  It may not be a wonder tea that some people claim but it can do more for mind, body, and spirit than most vitamin pills claim to do.
