I figured my supply may need a boost. After looking at my choices, I purchased Yogi. It really is the best tea I've tasted so far. I admit that I drink alot simply because I love the taste. I don't know how well it helped my supply, but I have been nursing my 10mo every 3-4 hrs without problems.<br /><br />I think that just taking in the extra fluids helps. If you are having a big dip in your milk supply I would suggest taking Fenugreek capsules. Makes you smell like maple syrup, but really works. Fenugreek in combination with this tea should help supply issues. I'd continue drinking the tea long after supply is back to normal, sort of insurance. Oatmeal has been said to help too.<br /><br />If your supply is causing nursing problems or concerning you, please contact your lactation consultant or midwife. With help a low supply really can be fixed.<br /><br />Good luck and happy nursing!
