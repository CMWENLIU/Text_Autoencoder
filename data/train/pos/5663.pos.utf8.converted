I have two girls.. One of them is allergic to peanut and another one misses to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwich. So, after try a sample from its company, my daughter ate it without any problem. She didn't know that it was soybutter. :) But yes, you can tell the difference. It's way better than I ever try with other soy butter. This is BEST ONE. So, I decided to order the package through amazon. I am pleased with it. Shipping is GREAT. Will order it again when we run out of soybutter.
