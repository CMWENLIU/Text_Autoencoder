With all the publicity regarding health benefits of dark chocolate, Vivani is one of the best I've tried. It has a creamy, full-bodied taste that is definitly chocolate. The ingredients are organic and each bar has 72% cacao. For someone who enjoys dark chocolate, Vivani tastes too good to believe that it provides health benefits.
