<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G17Y0C">Pacific Chai Decaffeinated Vanilla Chai Latte Mix, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a> : This Chai Tea is excellent - just as good, actually better than Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf made at the store!  I like it hot, but it is excellent iced also.
