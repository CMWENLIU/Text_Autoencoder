This is a great teapot. It's attractive, well-balanced, and truly doesn't drip.<br /><br />The lid fits on with a plastic seal that is pushed onto the pot, which prevents drips even when the pot is tilted at an extreme angle.<br /><br />Inevitably, there's some sort of spillage involved with teapots, whether from the teapot itself (though not in this case), or by putting things into the water or taking them out. In order to deal with this, there's a channel around the lid that catches the water and holds it there, instead of all over the sides or the table.<br /><br />As a whole, it's very well designed and I'm pleased with the teapot.<br /><br />The only downside was that the Tuffy Steeper, which is stated in the product description as included, was not when I purchased this item from Amazon. I got a slight  refund from Amazon, though not enough to buy the Steeper (which only comes in three-packs on Amazon, a fact which the customer service representative at Amazon couldn't seem to understand). Amazon's issues isn't the teapot's, however, so I would still recommend the teapot, especially if they've fixed the issue.
