I will be brief:  I have tried probably 25 or more different coffee pods since I got my Bunn My Cafe for my office.  I am a bit of a coffee snob, so it took a lot of pride swallowing to go from grinding my own beans at work to a pod brewer.<br /><br />Having said that, Baronet has some real garbage out there, but they make up for all that with this little cheesy named gem.  BEST. POD. EVER.  It's bold, it's dark, BUT it's smooth as my one year old's butt!  True sign of good coffee?  Let it get completely cold in your cup, then drink.  This one passes that test with flying colors (dark, rich brown to be exact).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />I am taking time to praise this pod only because finally FINALLY I have found one that can actually beat my very messy, very time consuming, grind + measure + brew, traditional method I was using before.  Most pods out there are way wayyyy too weak for me, or have so little coffee in them that you have to brew only half a cup to get some decent flavor.  Not so here, boys and girls...this is the real deal... a full 12g of coffee in every pod!<br /><br />If you are a strong coffee freak like me, and have given in to compromise for the convenience of pods, also check out Coffee Artisan's new 12g pods...some of them are almost as good as this Blast.  Their "Dark Side" "Extra Bold" pod is very similar to Blast, though not QUITE as good IMO).
