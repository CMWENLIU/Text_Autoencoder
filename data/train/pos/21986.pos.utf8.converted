Wonderful!! Wonderful!!  Wonderful!!  Elderberry jelly is one of my and my husband's favorite jellies.  When I lived in Ohio, I was able to make it myself.  But there are no Elderberries growing in Arizona so I was extremely happy to find some before my husband passed away.  Mrs. Miller's tastes just like I had picked the berries and made the jelly myself.  Thankyou soooo much!
