I'm sick of scads of nasty toothpicks all over my counter when I'm tinting icings;  the squeeze-bottle concept is one that is long overdue and exceptionally welcome.  The colors are vibrant, do not have an offensive taste, and blend, in my opinion, more smoothly than the Wilton pastes.  You'll need to experiment a bit to get hues right at first, but it's well worth it.
