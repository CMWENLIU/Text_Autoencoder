(Because we tried all three, I wanted to post these on each pouch page.)<br /><br />YUM! Our 17 month old daughter loves them. When we heard about these new pouches, they were a _must try_. We couldnt decide on a fruit combination, so we ordered a case of each. This worked out well, because the order qualified for amazons free shipping. They arrived very quickly in easy to open cases.<br /><br />We consolidated them to a box in the pantry so we could get to them faster and because those pouches can kind of slide around. :) Our daughter is all about choices right now and so we let her decide which one she'd like to try first. She looked carefully at each of them then said "NANA! ARN! BUH-NEE! HOP! HOP!" and so chose the Mango, Banana and Orange...and it remains her favorite of the three (although, she would never give up the others if offered).<br /><br />Now, the plane ride...we recently took a trip to visit grandma from San Jose to Austin - a 4+ hour airflight that we were somewhat nervous about. We packed our fruit pouches and other goodies. It became a special treat as we rolled out to the tarmac and then took off into the sky. She happily ate and when she was done, sat quietly and contently looking at the pouch...pointing at the bunny and the orange and the banana, (we told/showed her there was a mango too).<br /><br />When we ran out of pouches, we went to the whole foods - but they were not yet available there. They did have another brand, which we reluctantly purchased because unlike the peter rabbit pouches - the cap was so tiny, it could be a serious choking hazzard should it get into the hands (or mouth) of our little lady. The combination was also different and she didnt really care for the other kind as much.<br /><br />Though she cant say alot of words, she does sign quite a few and she runs to the pantry, points and signs "more, please...more please!! please!!" Which is pretty funny to see.<br /><br />We took some video the day they arrived, I'll have to see if I can find it and post as part of the review.<br /><br />All the best!
