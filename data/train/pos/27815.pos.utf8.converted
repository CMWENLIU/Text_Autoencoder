This is like the other reviewer said  better than Knorr,and they make some of the best flavorings. I just don't know how they managed to get the browned beef bone exact taste. Almost all of the beef bouillon I have tried all tasted the same untill I tried this brand. Even when you open it up you can smell that wonderful rib bone and you just want to take a bite out of it so good.....
