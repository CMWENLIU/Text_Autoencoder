I used to buy this seasoning mixture at Sam's a couple years ago and then they discontinued it, at least at the stores around here.  I was so glad to see it finally offered on Amazon, at a higher price, but then 21 ounces is a big bottle of the spice that lasts a really long time even if you use it often.  I used it in all kinds of dishes since I like a little fire and spice in my food, but mostly I use it on kidney beans.  I know it sounds weird, but years ago when trying to add more fiber to my diet I discovered that a can of kidney beans with a little vinegar and a few shakes of this seasoning tastes really good.  The calorie content isn't too bad, it's really filling, and you're getting a good dose of fiber.  And best of all, it's really easy and fast if you use canned beans.<br /><br />I like the seasoning because it's just enough heat without being over the top and it has sort of a smokey flavor to it that reminds me of chipotle peppers.  The ingredients are:  Salt, Chili Pepper, and Other Spices, Dehydrated Red Bell Pepper, Dehydrated Onion, Sugar, Dehydrated Garlic, Spice Extractives, and Extractives of Paprika (as color).  It doesn't contain any MSG as far as I can tell from the label (You never know what they hide under other terminology though).  I've tried all kinds of other brands of similar type seasonings and could never find one that's just like this.  I'm hooked.
