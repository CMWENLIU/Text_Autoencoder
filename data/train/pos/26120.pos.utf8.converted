This product can be very useful for anyone who prepares low calorie sweetened drinks in larger than single-serving amounts.<br /><br />My family and I drink a lot of iced tea. Bottled teas cost a lot and powdered tea mixes taste pretty awful, so I began to brew fresh tea one gallon at a time. Because we also prefer to avoid empty sugar calories, I was tearing open 20 little packets of Equal for each pitcher of lemon iced tea. That was tedious and I didn't like throwing away a zillion little blue paper shreds either.<br /><br />My solution? I bought this one pound bulk package of Equal. Now I just pour 20 grams of Equal into a gallon of tea (I use my kitchen scale to get the sweetness just right) and add lemon juice. Bingo! I like it better than bottled teas -- fresher-tasting, not so sweet -- and it's much cheaper, there are no empty bottles to throw away/recycle and I can serve as much tea as I want at the moment.<br /><br />One pound of Equal sounded like an awful lot for home use until I realized that we were already buying boxes of 800 Equal packets from the local big box store -- there's more than a pound of Equal in each of those boxes. One pound of bulk Equal is enough for 23 gallons of iced tea sweetened to my taste -- about 4 months worth, though obviously Your Mileage May Vary.<br /><br />Now I'm even thinking of buying Amazon.com's bulk Equal in six-packs. That would get me a better price per pound plus free shipping -- a 60% drop in price for buying a two year supply of Equal. Hmmm...
