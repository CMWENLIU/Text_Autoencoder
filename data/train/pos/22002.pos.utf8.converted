I purchased this product to make fudge with. I reasoned that I could make partial batches of specialty fudges by weighing out the sweetened condensed milk. WELL, the dispenser top on the container made this product just tooooooooo accessible. Reviewer "Paisleymonsoon" made it quite clear that this product had a sinister nature and that it could prove unholy to have it in your home. SO, I said to myself, "Self, you know you don't have an addictive personality, that is for weak people, and you've never been weak." Reviewer "Just Smile" also tried to warn potential buyers, but did I listen? NO! My husband is not into sweetened condensed milk (actually I have not asked him, I decided that I wanted, in this case, to assume) and I have not offered any to our pets either. You cannot share this with an animal that will eat anything, that would border on sacrilege. SO, since there is no one else to partake, and the lid bears a remarkable similarity to a delivery device, I have found that direct hits from a refrigerated bottle of it is as good as any a way to consume the mandatory amount necessary to sate my ferocious addiction. I suggest that sane, refined, civilized persons pass this product by, for the good of their own self-esteem, and for the good of their sane reputations. (NOTE: If they make the Fat Free version in these bottles instead of cans I will personally be in very big trouble!)
