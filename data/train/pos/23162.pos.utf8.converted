I discovered black licorice tea several years ago and have been an addict ever since!  When my local store stopped stocking it recently, I panicked briefly but relaxed when I found it at Amazon and subscribed to it.  My first box arrived yesterday and I had to try it out right away.  It is a different brand than I am used to, but the tea is just as delicious.  Buying a case of six at a time means I can keep some at home and some at work so I will never be without.  My only complaint is that each box contains only 16 bags, but overall the price is very affordable - less than I was used to paying - so I'll just have to get used to going through a box a little faster.
