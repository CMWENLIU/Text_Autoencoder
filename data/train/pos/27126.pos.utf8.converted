Have been a vegan for a while and tried some other vegan brands and didn't like them. These are awesome! Taste just like regular marshmallows, have a great texture, they melt perfectly, you can cook with them, and all without the nasty gelatin! I can't wait for amazon to get them in. Wish I could order them today!  :) Definitely try these!!!! You won't be sorry :)
