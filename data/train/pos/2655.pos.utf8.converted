Been using this at home and getting some fantastic results!  It really does make a lot of new things possible with meat if you get creative with it.  I recreated Wiley Dufresne's shrimp noodles and a couple of other recipes from david changs momofuku cookbook.  I'm suprised by some of the reviews here, some of these people seem to not really have a clue what this stuff is all about!
