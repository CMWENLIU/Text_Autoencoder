This oil has a lot of health benefits and I have definitely noticed a difference in my cholesterol readings since I started using it as my primary oil for stir fry and so on.  It has a high smoke point and an extremely light flavor that doesn't interfere with even delicate foods like scallops.  I now use olive oil as my cold oil and exclusively Tophe rice bran oil for all cooking.  The company also ships very fast.
