All three of my dogs get VERY excited about these, even my one super-finicky dog! The ingredients on the bag are: corn starch, glycerin, soya proteins, rice flour, palatable agent (Saccaromyces cerevisiae), sorbitol, corn derivatives, water, potassium sorbate, chlorhexidine digluconate. The bag says they are made in Vietnam. They can be broken in half if they are too big for your dog. Compared to other similar dog chews/treats on the market, these seem like a pretty good value to me.
