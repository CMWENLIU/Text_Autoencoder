Senseo Dark Roast is a wonderfully flavored coffee designed for use in the Senseo machine - unfortunately this machine is almost never sold in brick and mortar stores anymore and Amazon is about the last place you can buy one.  In fact, we bought a backup when we realized this was occurring so we would always have access.  AND we THOUGHT surely Amazon would continue to at least sell the coffee since it's so difficult to find in local stores - but about two weeks ago Amazon's Subscribe and Save service notified us Dark Roast would no longer be available and recommended another brand of Dark Roast - which was awful.  Senseo Dark Roast coffee is incredible - best coffee we've ever drank and I'm 62 years old and have been drinking coffee for nearly 50 years - honestly, if I have to purchase it from European suppliers, I guess I will because there is no other real substitute for this wonderfully delicious coffee.  I've even written to Senseo on their web site and they don't respond - so something is happening here, not sure what.  But if you can find this Dark Roast, buy it - because you will not be disappointed.  It is THE best pod coffee out there.<br /><br />Why would Amazon stop selling this coffee? Dark Roast has a very loyal following and comments on every blog or review site are almost all favorable - PLEASE - BRING IT BACK!  If enough of us indicate an interest, perhaps Amazon will reconsider - after all, the continue to sell the other flavors (for now?) but not Dark Roast - which is hands down the best.<br /><br />UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2012:  Senseo Dark Roast is BACK! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Finally, after I had to switch to alternative pods, Senseo finally got their act together and started production at their new facility - I don't know all the details, but basically they shut down their production of this particular line (perhaps others) and sold the product line to another retailer - so we had a down period of several months when it was all but impossible to find this product on line (and it will never, I'm told, be in the brick and mortars again) - WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is THE best coffee out there, bar none.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, while we were anxiously waiting for our first shipment of Senseo Dark Roast in months our Senseo Supreme coffee maker broke down (probably due to using alternative pods that don't fit!)  So our shipment arrived and no coffee maker (we love the froth on top, so their new machine by Hamilton Beach I think it is, does not produce "froth" so not a viable option) - anyway, we reached out to Senseo Customer Service - we are many years out of warranty and Philips no longer makes the Senseo Supreme machine - OH NO!  Now what.  CS rep says there is nothing they can do to help.  So I clicked on the Corporate Relations link on their site and shot off an email to the big cheese.  GUESS WHAT?  A nice lady (Dolores) wrote me back and said she would get me a refurbished machine, no problem.  We thought great - and waited, and waited - and waited - almost a month and no machine came - so I wrote her back and ask for tracking - she checked and the order was still in the system; seems she forgot to click the submit button to the fulfillment center so it was just sitting there in limbo.  She corrected this and apologized, machine came a few days later.  Just like a new machine, could not tell that it was in any way refurbished - even included a bag of dark roast!! (stale, out of date by 9 months, but was still drinkable, just a little more bold than normal.)<br /><br />Senseo came through for us - they know they have very loyal customers and appreciate them - and while the disruption in supply was annoying, we are just thankful we can still buy this product on Amazon - although the price did go up by $13 a case (or $2 a bag) and there is no more Subscribe and Save capability (please Amazon, restore this savings and if possible, please lower the price back to a more competitive level with other pods - under or about $4/bag!?!?)
