These are basically applesauce with a grape twist to the flavor.  They taste a lot like grape fruit bars. We've tried several flavors, and each person has a different favorite, but they're all good. They taste different enough that they would take longer to get boring.<br /><br />The cap twists off, you suck out the applesauce through the tube, and you can put the cap back on if you need to finish later.  These are perfect for lunches or even in the car.  The size is about the same as a snack cup of applesauce.<br /><br />My baby can eat from it easily if I hold it, and it's much less messy than a jar.  The texture is not as pureed as stage 1 babyfood, but not as thick as a regular jar of applesauce.<br /><br />Shelf life is about 1 year on the ones I got.
