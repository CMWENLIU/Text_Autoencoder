While searching for saguaro cactus honey I found the HiBee Cactus Honey Powder. Researched and ordered. Within three days from placing my order I was substituting the powdered honey for sugar. Excellent in hot drinks, instantly soluable. Great sprinkled on homemade breads. Sweetens that second bite of tart fruits. Stores in its own convenient re-sealable packaging. Pure, no discernable foriegn particles, even after disolving in clear liquids. My wife has made claim to her own package. We love honey and delight in nature's sweetener. Do not order just a single package, you'll wish you'd had more.  The shipping service was superior.
