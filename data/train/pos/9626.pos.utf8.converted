This is by far the best instant soup I have ever ate. It only takes 3 min to prepare. The best soup in less time than it would take to boil your water for ramen. Bonus only 290 calories for the whole bowl. If you like udon you'll love this.<br /><br />I hope amazon will start carrying the version with KATSUO!
