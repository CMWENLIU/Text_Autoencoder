I have always enjoyed wine gums. I am from Canada where they are widely available and I always brought home a few kilos of Maynards to last me through the time to my next visit. On a whim, I searched Amazon and noted these well-rated wine gums and decided to give them a try. They are excellent! Different in flavor and texture than Maynard's but I find them better. The flavors are more distinct and intense. I am so thrilled! I hope Amazon keeps these on the stock list for a long time. As other have mentioned, there is no alcohol in these candies. There is no fat either, and comparatively low sugar levels. Enjoy them, if you have been looking for wine gums, these are it, and a great buy to boot!!!
