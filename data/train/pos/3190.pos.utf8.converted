I've been browsing amazon and other tea sellers for authentic restaurant style Thai Tea.  This one is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />Amazing taste and extremely easy to make.  Instructions that are provided show easy ways to make the tea, and the traditional long boil.<br /><br />However, in my morning rush, I simply use some of the tea in a coffee machine (1/2 tbsp per cup of water) and it comes out excellent with some cream and sugar.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
