I start every morning with a cup of this tea.  Then I drink it before every meal.  I heard it raises you metabolism rate.  I have lost several pounds in a few months since I started drinking it.  I am hoping it's the tea because I have not changed my eating and I have no time for additional exercise.  The tea is a is something I can definitely stick to.
