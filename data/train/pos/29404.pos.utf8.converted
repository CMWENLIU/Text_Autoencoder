I bought this on the recommendation of the other reviewers on Amazon.<br /><br />It is easy to use and tastes just like what you buy in a good Thai restaurant.  I highly recommend this Yellow Curry Paste.<br /><br />I love Yellow Curry in Thai restaurants, but did not want the hassle of making it myself.<br /><br />I bought this curry paste, and mixed<br />-2 Tablespoons of Yellow Curry Paste<br />-1 can of Thai Coconut Milk (13.66 oz)<br />-1 Cup of water<br /><br />Heated in a saucepan and then put in carrots, cauliflower, snow peace, onions and cooked for 20-30 minutes.  I put in enough vegetables to serve 2 people.<br /><br />Then cooked 2 salmon fillets in a frying pan w/ olive oil on the bottom at low heat for 8 minutes w/ the lid on frying pan.  Cooked the salmon w/ the skin on the bottom touching the frying pan.<br /><br />Once Salmon and veggies were cooked, put vegetables and yellow curry sauce in a big bowl, and gently placed the salmon fillet on top (took skin off after being cooked thoroughly). Garnished with Cilantro and squeezed a little lime juice in for extra kick.<br /><br />Very delicious and fast and easy to do.  I love this curry paste and it tastes as good as what you would find in an authtentic Thai restaurant.
