I bought this food on sale on a whim since a while ago, Amazon was selling this kind of cat food for ~$15 for 5 3-lb bags (I wish it still cost that much!). Long story short, I wasn't expected much from this pet food. I have two young cats (both ~7.6 months) who typically never ate their dry food unless I mixed wet food in with it or soaked it in Cat Milk. However, my cats LOVE the Castor & Pollux Ultramix. They happily eat it (including the little fruity bits),even in meals where I don't mix in wet food, and they've have so much fewer digestive issues. They've never had any hairballs and the size of the little bits is perfect for young animals making the transition to adult foods.
