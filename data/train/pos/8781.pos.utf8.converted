I ordered this and have enjoyed eating it over the past few months. The ingredients are very healthy and pure, and best of all i love how simple they are! I am very health conscious, and avoid high fructose corn syrup found in most store bought breads. This bread has great ingredients, and not a very high sugar content either. I compared the ingredients to all the other bread mixes i could possibly find on the internet.. well, i spent all day researching, and I didn't like how others had high sugar contents (such as the number 3 ingredient being 'cane sugar' or the number 4 and 5 ingredients being sugar and brown sugar, etc). I also wanted a bread packed with whole grains, and 9 grain is great!<br /><br />And of course i looked for something easy on the wallet. I originally made my own bread and tried buying whole grain flours from health food stores but i just couldn't match 9 grains, and it got pricey. Obviously just plain white flour bread making will be cheaper than buying this boxed stuff, but i wanted whole grain bread. It turned out to be difficult exactly comparing the price of this compared with baking from scratch since all the flours are by the ounce, etc, but i decided that this price is very good. Compared to other brands of bread mix, this price is pretty much the lowest I have found with the free shipping.<br /><br />In terms of taste, honestly I really don't care as long as it's healthy, I will basically like it or learn to like it, but I will say that I love the taste of this bread and have been making sandwiches almost every weekday for the past couple months. If I want to be real nit-picky i would say the milled flaxseed SLIGHTLY gives it a bad smell, but its subtle and overall the bread still tastes great. Besides, its super healthy! I should also mention that I bake this bread using a very nice bread maker, so I would take that under consideration when reading this review. And for those that care, I bake it with some earth balance butter substitute. Lastly, if your bread is coming out a little dense, add more water and yeast and it will come out great! If you need to spice it up you can throw in some dried cherries and/or walnuts, and other things I'm sure will work too I'm sure. It was even more delicious when I did this.
