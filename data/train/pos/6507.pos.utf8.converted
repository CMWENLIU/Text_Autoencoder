This candy bar is absolutely amazing!  I have not eaten candy bars in years but when I saw this I had to try it as I adore caramel and chocolate.  I like to cut it into 6 slices and freeze them in a container.  I suck on 1 or 2 in the evening as a splendid treat; lasting longer because it's frozen.  In addition, if your watching your weight you can still indulge.  Each slice is only 1 Weight Watcher point; and well worth it!<br /><br />If I could rate it a 10 I would.  You will not be disappointed; I highly recommend it to all.  Cudos to Milky Way.
