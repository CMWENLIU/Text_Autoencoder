I am a huge fan of Tasty Bite premade food. I am a vegan and these are super simple meals that I can take with me to work. So far this is my favorite. It has a nice flavor, you get alot of eggplant with not too much spice. This is a bit more calories than their other meals and it is more mushy, is the best word to say. They suggest using this as a spread or dip or something to add to another dish. I agree. I used it with rice and snowpeas. If you arent into softer food then don't try this as a main course by itself.<br /> Texture aside the taste is on point. It is not really indian food but it sure is a good cheap subsitute.
