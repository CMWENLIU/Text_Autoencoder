Not sure how to review the pasta as I order for my wife and son's and every time I try to cook some it is normally gone. I got it originally becuase my wife is on Weight Watchers and my son's were interested in the hight fiber. So far from the leftovers they have left me the pasta is very tastful. We have gotten the sampler but will buy something different next time and I'll have it delivered at work instead of home and maybe I will be able to try it.
