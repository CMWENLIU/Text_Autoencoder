Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the "English Breakfast" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label.
