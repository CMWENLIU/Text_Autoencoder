I got my first box of this cereal at Target. it was on sale, 3 dollars and 4 cents. I'm kind of a health food freak, I saw "flax plus" and the USDA organic symbol and tossed it in the cart along with my recycled toilet paper and organic zBars.<br />Did I know I was carrying around a slice of heaven? Had I known, I would have bought all the boxes in my local Target. But I didn't find this out until the next morning.<br /><br />Every morning I slid out of bed at 6 am and go get my breakfast. Warm oatmeal with bananas usually perks me up a bit, but that day I decided to try my new cereal. I added vanilla almond milk and sliced banana. I took one bite and I danced. It was so good. It is so good. I eat handfuls of it and then cry for the beauty of the moment and the taste of the cereal. it's just so good! How do they do it? It's just so good. Now in the mornings I jump out of bed and fly down the stairs so I can eat Organic Flax Plus Granola. It's just that good.<br /><br />Are you an on-the-fencer, unsure if you want to bound through the lush meadow that is this granola? Do it. You won't regret it.<br /><br />It makes me dance.
