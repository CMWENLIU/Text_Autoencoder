For many years, I have been buying this tea from Amazon.  The quality, freshness and price are excellent.  At home, I boil 3 gallons of water and drop 14 bags into it and let it steep.  It would probably be better to pour the water into the tea bags, but it would be too inconvenient.  After it cools a bit, I pour the tea into approximately 18 clean Arizona Iced Tea bottles, Snapple bottles, Nantucket Nectar bottles, and a collection of other bottles that I have collected for this purpose.  I place the bottles in the refrigerator, and enjoy the tea as I want it.  I always have a cold bottle ready, and friends often stop over looking for iced decaf green tea.  After trying many brands, I find that Celestial Seasonings has the best taste.  In my office, I brew one or two bottles at a time.  Although I often drink the tea hot, my drink of choice is iced Celestial Seasonings decaf green tea (with Sweet & Low added).  I highly recommend this tea.
