When brewed properly, Maui Coffee Company's 100% Kona is a fantastic coffee.  Incredibly smooth, with that classic kona red color and awesome floral aroma, there is no doubt that a lot of care went into creating this coffee. One word of advice when brewing it: brew it strong. The coffee is so incredibly smooth that you may think it's a bit weak until you up the strength a tad, but then you will be rewarded with an amazing cup of coffee, no doubt. -Ryan West
