I was very much satistied with this product. If it weren't for the reviews, I might not have ordered it though. It arrives absolutely fresh, tasty, crunchy, not too sweet, and delicious. I love granola and I'm now hooked on this gluten free (just about everything free)product. I've had friends and co-workers try it who also agree that it's tasty. I mix the "Extreme Fruit" granola with some yogurt for breakfeast just about every morning. You have got to try this product. I think it's great.
