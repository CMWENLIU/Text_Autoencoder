I like strong coffee that doesn't taste like dishwater. This is the one for me. It actually rivals my home brew choices of Starbuck's Espresso and Gold Coast beans. I bought this one for me, because my coworkers like their coffee a bit on the lighter side. This is so good ... I need to get one of these brewers for my house so I can drink it on the weekends!
