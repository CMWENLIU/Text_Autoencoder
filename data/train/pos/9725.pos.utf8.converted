This product is great, it tastes good and removes harmful sugar and artificial sweeteners from something that we all love to enjoy.  But do not buy it here, unless you just love to throw you money out the window. Head over to Josephslitecookies.com and find it there for only 2.99 a bottle! I don't know how these people are getting away with charging this much. Perhaps if you live over seas and Josephs wont ship to you then you would pay extra but otherwise there's no need! As far as causing gas problems, well that depends on each individual. Some may have no discomfort what so ever, while others may need to avoid all sugar alcohols(because they all CAN cause gastrointestinal problems)
