Anyone that has lived in Germany knows the Asbach Uralt brand and they make the very best cordial cherries in the world! I purchased the box for mom. Her comment is "they're delicious and go too quickly!" As a former resident of Germany I can highly recommend these delicious brandy filled cordial cherries to anyone in need of a cool gift idea. Any Asbach Uralt product makes a great gift.<br /><br />I used to be able to purchase these in a German grocery store in Orlando, but was unable to locate them anywhere, and the store is now closed.<br /><br />Even in the holiday mail rush, and using standard shipping, the box from Niche Imports arrived quickly. I ordered on December 5th and it arrived on December 10th packaged perfectly in a larger box and cushioned with styrofoam pieces.
