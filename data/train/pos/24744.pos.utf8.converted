I've been ordering this rice and also the Bob's Red Mill Organic White Rice Flour through Amazon's subscription for several months now. I couldn't be more pleased.  Bob's Rice flours are finely milled so there isn't that gritty taste in your foods.  I order at least 2 cases of each a month and I've never had a problem with any of my flours and all those I've received have been labeled "organic".  Would love to see Amazon offer Bob's Sweet Rice Flour and their White Bean Flour, too.
