Just wanted to say that this bread in taste and texture is closet in taste and texture with real bread. I use it to make grilled cheese, frenche toast and in lots of other sandwiches and it tastes great. There is nothing like being able to eat a cheeseburger on bread again after being Gluten intolerant the past two years.
