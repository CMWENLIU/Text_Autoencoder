I have been using Grass B Gone in and around my flower beds for years.  What a time saver!  The grass dies and the flowers bloom on.  For some reason I have not been able to find it in stock in town, and I see that the shipping from Amazon  is 1-3 months.  Hmmm- I might not need it then, but I'll order anyway for next year.  Normally, I use organic products and no herbicides, but this is so great that I have to make an exception.
