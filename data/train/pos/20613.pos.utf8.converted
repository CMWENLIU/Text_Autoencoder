Makes the best homemade vanilla ice cream.  I have bought 5 "mexican vanilla" brands in the last 6 months.  This is the only one with the great mexican vanilla flavor I remembered. I can't find this flavor locally, even in the specialty stores.<br />Claims to be 3-4 times stronger than regular vanilla.  It is smooth enough that you can use more than regular and really get a great strong flavor.<br />Ingredients:  water, alcohol, propylene glycol, sugar, pure vanilla, natural and artificial flavors, and caramel color.
