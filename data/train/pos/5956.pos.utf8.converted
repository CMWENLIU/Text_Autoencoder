I absolutely love falafel, and have tried a number of different falafel mixes, including Casbah, Ziyad, Swad, Nirav, and Manischewitz.<br /><br />Until I tried Casbah, I liked Ziyad brand the best.  Ziyad cooks well and tastes good, but is not as flavorful as Casbah (which has a stronger flavor than any of the brands I mentioned).<br /><br />Swad and Nirav are good (they taste good but are less flavorful than Ziyad), but do not purchase the Manischewitz.  It does not taste the way falafel is supposed to.  The ingredients indicate that it is made with matzo meal, which is probably why it tastes so vastly different.  It's not that it tastes bad, but it just doesn't taste like falafel.  The packaging is nice... the mix is divided into two separate sealed pouches.  Good for single people.  Quantity wise it is less than the other brands, though.<br /><br />I have not tried Near East or Fantastic Foods brand falafel mix, so cannot comment on the quality of those mixes.<br /><br />Casbah tastes *perfect*.  Spicy, crunchy, very flavorful, just the best.  If you eat this brand you will never eat any of the others again.<br /><br />UPDATE: September 2012: Ziyad has reformulated its falafel mix, and it tastes really yummy now!  So try a box of that if you don't want to spend the big bucks to buy Casbah.  Personally, I felt that Ziyad was so improved that I didn't need to spend the extra energy to hunt down the Casbah packages, or order in bulk from Amazon.  Try it, and see what works for you. ^^
