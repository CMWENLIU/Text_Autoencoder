I purchased this wheat to use for grinding into flour. I have been extremely pleased. The wheat came in a sturdy bucket, with a resealable lid. The bucket is something that can be kept and used again.<br /><br />I was impressed that the wheat was very clean, and made if nice, beautiful kernels. The wheat was clean enough to go directly from the bucket into the grinder.<br /><br />Paying the shipping was painful, but still a better deal than purchasing at local health food stores.
