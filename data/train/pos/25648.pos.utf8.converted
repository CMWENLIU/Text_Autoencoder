I love this product. I have been wanting to eat a smore with my kids for so long. This graham cracker style was perfect and tasty too!!! The directions are right on the package- if you want to make them in your toaster oven at home. I am so happy to finally eat graham crackers. I can't wait to make a cheesecake from the recipe that is on the box.
