It's hard to get schw*ppes bitter lemon in the US these days.  This is a good but expensive substitute.<br /><br />Just treat it like rich ice cream -- where you use a little spoon to get the flavor in small bites.<br />Sure, you could chugg this down in 3 gulps, but small sips give you all the flavor.<br /><br />Yeah I like it, I got another case...
