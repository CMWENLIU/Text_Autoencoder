I dont know how anyone can complain that this product is pricey.Walk into any healthfood store and be prepared to pay 14$ for the same size of xanthan gum.Also Barry Farms has the best selection of every imaginable food product,gluten-free or not and very good prices.I was very happy when I ordered from them previously.My little bag of xanthan gum has lasted me over a year and I bake alot.
