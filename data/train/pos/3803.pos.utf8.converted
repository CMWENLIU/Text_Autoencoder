I drink one to two of these K-Cups a day (have been doing so for 6 mos now).  Love it - perfect tea - not bitter not weak.  I have come across the occasional K-Cup with a bad lid seal (and it will blow the grinds into the cup then) but I choose not to get worked up over the failure of a 40 cent item when the others in the pack are fine.  2008 EDIT: Ok, , I have to agree with the other reviewer a little more - the quality of these K-cups is inconsistent and they do blow grinds more often then they should.  I am still drinking this tea as much as ever as the flavor is not replicated in any other brand.  2009 EDIT: It's June 2009 now and this is still my main drink.  The K-Cup blowout issues seems to have been resolved in the last few boxes.  They must have fixed the problem.  A great tea.
