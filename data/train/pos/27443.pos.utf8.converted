Hello.  My name is Carl Mundt and I am the President of the company that produces de la Estancia organic polenta in Argentina - I'm obviously biased so you can take my comments with a grain of salt if you want.<br /><br />A little more than 10 years ago, my wife and I decided to invest in the Argentine farming business.  We found two young Argentine farmers to be our partners and we began to grow different crops.  I also started to learn something about farming - I was especially interested in the crops themselves.  After a few years I realized that the corn we were growing was quite different from the corn I was used to seeing in the US and Europe.  Argentine corn is a subtropical corn called "long cycle" which meant that it grows in the fields for 6 months as opposed to the 3 month growing cycle of common corn.  It was also extremely happy corn because the nights in the foothills of the Andes are cool and, besides lots of rain and hot sunshine, corn likes cool nights.  This special type of corn is much harder, more vividly yellow and has both a much lower starch content and a higher protein level than corn from more temperate climates.<br /><br />Putting two and two together I realized that polenta made from Argentine corn would be far superior to polenta made from common corn.  It would be brighter yellow in color and it could be ground to a finer consistency.  But most important, the low starch level meant that our polenta would cook in just one minute.  It cooks so fast because there is basically no starch to incorporate into the cooking liquid.  That is what takes so long in cooking other polentas.<br /><br />I also want to emphasize that our polenta is not pre-cooked as is the case for the polenta in the tubes.  Nor it is partially pre-cooked and then reconstituted as is the case for the "instant" polentas.  De la Estancia polenta is pure ground corn that has never been processed or treated in any way.  It just cooks fast naturally.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoy preparing and serving our polenta as much as I have enjoyed bringing it to the US.
