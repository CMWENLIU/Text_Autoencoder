After exhaustively researching dry dog foods for our Great Dane and Black Lab, we decided on this one.  No by-products, fillers, or useless protien. Eagle Pack would possibly be a better choice, but not by much - and the price is significantly higher.  This food can be harder to find (the big box pet stores won't carry it) but you can locate stores in your area on the manufacturer's website if you'd rather not buy on-line.  I HIGHLY recommend this food.
