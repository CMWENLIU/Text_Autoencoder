I really LOVE the idea of this decaf sampler.  I am a new Keurig owner and a relatively new coffee drinker so I haven't tried a lot of different brands/flavors yet, and was really excited to get this sampler.  I read in other reviews that a few people received one or two expired K-cups in their sampler but because of the value and the opportunity to sample many brands I took my chances.  I was very surprised to receive SIX expired K-cups, that's 20% of my box that is undrinkable!!  Totally unacceptable to me (I would have been miffed if one or two were expired and could have lived with it-- but not six).  I hope this seller's customer service is spectacular and they make my order good.  I asked for a replacement of the six expired k-cups, and will update my review accordingly when they respond.  On the other hand, the few that I have tried were very good and am happy with the variety that was sent to me (and I double checked all of the expiration dates!  Most were 4 months out and beyond, FYI).  The packaging is sparse, they came loose in a paper bag that was stapled shut, and I'm OK with that since they are for me (I would think twice about purchasing this item if you were considering gifting it to someone).  I hope they replace the expired K-cups and maybe throw in an extra one or two to boot.  I'll probably even return to buy more if they take care of me, since I love this decaf variety so much.  More to come!!<br /><br />4/4 Update:<br />I heard back from the seller of the 30 kcup deal (Deals On Call LLC) and learned that Amazon fulfills the orders for them in the warehouse, so I contacted Amazon customer service to ask for a replacement of the 6 expired cups.  (I didn't request a return since I had already drank a couple of the cups that were within their expiration date).  As always, Amazon customer service is AWESOME. They refunded my entire purchase price and offered to send me another sampler (if I chose to repurchase) with free overnight delivery, and even sent a nice apology.  They also stated that they would review procedures for filling this order to prevent others from getting expired k-cups.  So, with that, I'm changing my review to five stars- as I said before, I love the variety and the opportunity to try so many different DECAF flavors in one purchase.  I can forgive the 'oopsy' in this case since Amazon went above and beyond to keep me happy.  Love Amazon!  Enjoy!
