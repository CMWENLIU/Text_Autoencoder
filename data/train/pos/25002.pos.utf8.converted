Ok, I admit it, I HATE the tase of fresh buttermilk!! yuck! BUT I love the flavor in many recipes where only the dreadful stuff will work. This is my answer! I keep this on hand at all times to make my buttermilk biscuits and pancakes. I never have to worry about running to the market to buy a quart for some recipe that I want to try. Handy, handy, handy!
