I've used Eden Foods Kombu for years to make Japanese soup stock for Miso Soup and as a natural flavor additive to any dish. It's very shelf stable and keeps for years, if you just want to have some in the pantry. I used it recently to flavor the stock for my standby Portuguese kale soup, with no fishy flavor at all unlike you get with nori -- my soup was delicious as ever.<br /><br />With the concerns about getting iodine in your diet naturally, I used this kombu to cook rice and make a meat chili with canned kidney beans and diced tomatoes. Adds more flavor to anything boiled (it does contain a natural MSG from the sea) and sea minerals like potassium and calcium to your food besides the big iodine boost -- I completely recommend it.
