These are great! My sister ordered some GFCF chocolate online for her son for Easter and when it didn't arrive in time, I was forced to find an alternative so he could have the same kind of Easter as his brothers. I found these chips and some Easter bunny and egg molds and made my own chocolates. They melt great and you would never know they were GFCF! They're a hit !
