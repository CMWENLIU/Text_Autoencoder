My wife loves this tea.  She even eats it (the blueberries are definitely edible and sweet), but she grew up drinking hibiscus tea all the time.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, bought it for the blueberries and green rooibos, which I assumed would be the predominant taste.  Truly, there are a lot of dried blueberries in this, and there is a lot of green rooibos, but it is the hibiscus that you taste the most (a rather bitter/sour taste when made too strong).  Sweetener definitely helps.  With Spring, a little goes a long way, so you get your money's worth of a healthy tea.<br /><br />The smell of this tea is truly mouth-watering, both dry and when steeping.  It is a very pretty tea, with beautiful light-blue tiny petals sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />My wife will definitely go through a lot of this tea, but as for myself, I will be grabbing this only as the mood hits me.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have grown to really like this tea and I'm moving my four stars to five stars as a result.
