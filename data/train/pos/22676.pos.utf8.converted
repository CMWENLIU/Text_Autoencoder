Taylor ham was part of my childhood growing up in New Jersey. Every diner on Route 9, 35 and 36 served it. I thought it was a national product. But NOOOOO. You can only get it on the east coast. For years I have had it sent to me in California from NJ family members.  For those who dont know, Taylor Ham is seasoned to perfection and is slightly salty. Fried with eggs it is remarkable. A three pound roll will last a long time as you only need a 1/2" disk to satisfy. Happy eating! g
