I keep ordering this and draining the boxes one after the other until I have none. This will be my fourth order and it absolutely won't be my last. Keep this cold in the back of the fridge and add some ice... so good. That said, sometimes I don't even bother with a glass, let alone ice. Other times I thin it with some water to extend the goodness.<br /><br />It tastes creamy, but the texture is thin. It's sweet, but not too sweet to drink down like it were water. The only problem here is that I have no desire to moderate my consumption of this stuff. I want it to come in gallon containers and I want to treat it as a replacement for water. Of course, at 32 ounces per each of the six containers, that gets costly. It's also good mixed with coke for a Pepsi and Milk replacement (no, really.)
