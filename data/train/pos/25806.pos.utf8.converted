I bought 2 dozen cans when it was on sale at my local natural food store.  I wound up eating it every single day for 24 days in a row!  It is very creamy with tons of chunks of mushroom soup.  I also chop up some fresh mushrooms, parsely and a little garlic to "pump it up".  The soup is just fine as it is from the can, but what can I say but that I am totally addicted to mushrooms since they are very low calorie, high in fiber and are a good source of Vitamin B! The soup has quite a high ratio of little mushroom bits, but I like to add some of my own fresh mushrooms to add to the texture.<br /><br />  On a cold winter day it makes a great "comfort food" Reminds me of homemade soup - very healthy ingredients.  This is a stape in my house and I order it regularly through Amazons "Super Saver" - can't beat this deal, 15% DISCOUNT plus free shipping - why bother to go to the market when it can be delivered to your door?<br /><br />Although the directions on the can say to add milk or cream it isn't at all necessary.  The soup in the can is really creamy already.<br /><br />I like to eat this soup with some whole wheat toast.  This makes a nice little healthy snack.
