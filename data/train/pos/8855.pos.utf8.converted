I was looking for a natural and cheap moisturizer and everyone started telling me coconut oil.  Me being me, I wanted to find the cheapest kind that was still extra virgin and organic.<br /><br />This stuff is great.  It's reminiscent of the pricy oil my uncle buys but so much better on my budget. I can't tell a difference.<br /><br />It's been a great moisturizer for me, mixes great with other oils, and leaves a nice little aroma when I use it for stir frys.<br /><br />For this amount and this price, this does everything coconut oil should do.
