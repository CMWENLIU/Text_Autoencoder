As the mom of a 7 year old daughter who is GFCF I know how hard it is to find good cookies!  These are great- we both love them!  They have a great texture- more like a butter cookie almost and taste wonderful!  No off taste from the flours, no gritty texture, and not sicky sweet- just right.  We tried these last summer on vacation and couldn't find them at home- then we found them on Amazon- try them- you won't be sorry!
