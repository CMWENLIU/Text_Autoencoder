Why in the world is such a delicious product so very hard to find?!  I first had this while on vacation in Costa Rica.  We brought home several bottles of it and and have really stretched to make it last, because we couldn't find it in any stores here in the U.S.  The flavors are unique and go well with anything you might want to marinate and grill...shrimp, chicken, beef, pork.  It is even tasty as a condiment, used like A-1 or Heinz 57.  A little goes a long way, so don't hesitate to give this great product a try.  And let's work on getting this in the stores so we can all buy it like ketchup, mayonaise, and mustard!!
