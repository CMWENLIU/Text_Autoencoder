My sister introduced me to vanilla chai several years ago, our favorite being Dunkin Donuts vanilla chai which is no longer available.  We, then, went on a quest to find another "favorite vanilla chai".  We definitely found it in Pacific Vanilla Chai.  While I liked it best when it was available in the striped bags rather than in the canisters (don't know why), it is excellent.  I recommend this beverage to anyone who enjoys tea.  As their slogan says, it really is "the taste of peace and quiet".  Enjoy!
