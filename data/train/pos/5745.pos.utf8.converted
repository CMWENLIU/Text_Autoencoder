I don't think she quite loves them as much as Pupperoni, but my dog still goes wild for these when I give them to her.  The nice thing about them is that they're quite a small size (just about bite-size for a small 15lb dog like mine) so my dog won't get full up on them or try to take them off to bury them (as she does with larger treats).  They're great for training and seem to be rather good value for money.
