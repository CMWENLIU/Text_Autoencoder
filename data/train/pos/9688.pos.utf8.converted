I am a Latte fan - Starbucks has been by favorite for years.  Lately I've been tired of spending $4 a cup and having to drive to my local shop to get my morning fix so I started to venture into making them with my K-Cups.  I've tried out a few different brands and have found that this Big Easy Bold is great.  It is strong enough to keep a good flavor after adding my milk and flavorings.<br /><br />Here is how I do it:<br /><br />1 K-Cup - Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />3 ounces of milk<br />1 tablespoon of cream<br />1 teaspoon  of sugar<br />optional: flavoring of your choice (cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, syrup etc.)<br /><br />In a microwaveable cup (at least 8 ounces)- warm the milk and cream for 30-45 seconds in the microwave on high.  In a large mug brew the K-Cup on the espresso setting.  Take a battery operated milk frother  like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002KZUNK">Aerolatte Milk Frother, Satin Finish</a> and spin the milk until it is to your liking.  Add the teaspoon of sugar to the milk mixture when you have it almost finished.  Pour the milk into the mug with the coffee - stir just a tiny bit and you are ready to enjoy.<br /><br />If you choose to add the optional flavoring add it to the coffee before combining it with the milk.<br /><br />Enjoy - you will be surprised that it is actually better than you have had in the store.
