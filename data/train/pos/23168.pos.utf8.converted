Includes Werthers Original, Arcor Fruitfuls (these are the candies with liquid centers), assorted Starlights (including Butterscotch and Cinnamon Brachs), A&W Rootbeer Barrels, and Jolly Ranchers. A little light on the Butterscotch, but other than that, seemed like a good assortment. Only 4 or 5 broken or miswrapped candies in the bag, even though it was delivered all the way to Africa.
