I used to buy caramels that tasted much like these when I lived in Europe.  I hadn't been able to find them here -- that is, until Amazon sent me samples of these.  They are light, buttery and amazing! My preference is for the original flavor, but I'm sure the honey variety will really please honey-lovers.  In a word: YUM!
