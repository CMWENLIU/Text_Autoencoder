My 11-year-old cat is very pioky. She will allow nothing to pass her lips except dry cat food and water...no canned cat food, milk, meat, cheese, treats...nada.  So it is almost impossible to give her any kind of medication.  She had developed a cough and showed some other signs of aging.  After reading about the benefits of a grain-free diet I got Wellness Core for her, which she enjoyed right from the beginning .  But I got too enthusiasitic about finding something she enjoyed so much, and increased the percentage of the new food too fast.  She got the first stomach upset of her life with diarrhea and vomiting and feeling bad for a day, but recovered after a 24-hour fast.  I backed up with the new food, and now, after about six weeks, I am up to about half the Wellness and the rest her old dry food.  She is doing fantasticly!  Her coat is lovely and silky, and she plays more than ever.  The coughing has stopped.  Her stools are great and there has been no vomiting except for two fur balls.  I am delighted with the results of the change to Wellness Core.
