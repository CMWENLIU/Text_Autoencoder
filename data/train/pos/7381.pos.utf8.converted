Nothing like white goat cheese, it's sweet and with a tiny hint of bitter. Being a norwegian-american family we eat it every day if we can get hold of it. I was surprised to see it listed as gourmet, its an everyday food over there. Like the picture on the wrapper, its sliced using a cheese slicer, a knife or wire cutter will cut too thick. bjorklund makes a good one. Most commonly served for breakfast or lunch on buttered rolls or bread. I like it on a sandwich with a layer of good jam under. Its good on toast and buttered waffles where the heat causes the slices to sweat and melt slightly, changing the texture, and making it delicious.
