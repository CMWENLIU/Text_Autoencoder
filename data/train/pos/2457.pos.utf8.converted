My puppy has had much better success tolerating and thriving on Science Diet compared with pricier "all natural" brands...you know...ingredients that people would also be happy to eat.  But she is a dog, not a human and so if ground up chicken beaks are one of the fillers, but she is healthy and happy, I don't worry about it period.  At the shelter where I got her they sell Science diet for half the price of what it is available elsewhere...gotta go get some more.  Why, because my dog loves it and is healthy and happy and seeing is believing.  Cheers!
