Okay, maybe it's not exactly unbelievable, because it is exactly what good maraschino cherries looked and tasted like when I was a kid. They are dark. The syrup is thick and dark. The aroma is the essence of cherries and their presence in a cocktail is magical -- taking cherries from a flavorless, if colorful, garnish, to another layer of delicious bouquet and taste.<br /><br />Unless you are over 45, it is quite possibly you never tasted a maraschino cherry like these<br /><br />While the price is not inexpensive, the value, in terms of what is added to any drink or recipe with these, is quite high. Two of these cherries will outpower a dozen of those bright red "things". And don't let cocktails be the only use. Your children deserve to experience what a "cherry" cola or other soft-drink "should" taste like, or an over-the-top sundae or banana split. Similarly, I believe I am going to get my wife to make a Bavarian Schwartzwalder Kirchtorte (Bavarian Black Forest Cherry Cake) with these to really experience the sublime bliss that is cherry and chocolate.<br /><br />They muddle in cocktails extremely well and infuse the entire drink with an exquisite hint of cherry. Old Fashionds and Manhattans become more sublime, and cherries suddenly hold their own with oranges, lemons and other fruits in a cocktail.
