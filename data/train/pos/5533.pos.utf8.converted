Vegan. Organic. Raw. Great flavor and consistency. Fantastic vegan substitute for honey. Can use to sweeten any cup of tea. Also great on Van's Blueberry Waffles (vegan) from your local grocer's freezer section. Raw alternative to high temp maple syrups. Organic natural alternative to processed corn syrups. Six stars. Best item "discovered" that I never heard of before trying. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.
