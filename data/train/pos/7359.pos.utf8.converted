I am not one to purchase store brand coffees, I usually buy more gourmet brands but Amazon had a great deal on Folgers coffee and I decided to go for it.  Am I glad I did!  I purchased 3 different flavors of the Folgers coffees and this is definitely my favorite.  It has a smooth rich coffee flavor with no bitterness and a slight taste of caramel.  It is not "fake" flavored and the caramel is not overpowering.  This one is just plain yummy!<br />The Chocolate and the Hazelnut are also very good but this is my favorite.
