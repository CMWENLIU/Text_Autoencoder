Fellow vegans will understand that though tofu scramble is DELICIOUS, it does't really taste like eggs. Garnish your tofu scramble with this sulfuric salt--it has the unmistakably strong taste of eggs. I've used this in vegan frittatas, omelets, and scrambles with great success. Also a little goes a long way, so you really get a good value for your money with this one.
