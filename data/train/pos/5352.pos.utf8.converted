I don't always have time or energy to do everything from scratch for dinner and these tomato flakes are fabulous! Great flavor, they rehydrate quickly and add tremendous depth and zest to recipes. So quick, I love them. They are much easier to use than typical sundried tomatoes because you don't have to get out scissors to cut them into bits. I highly recommend for soups, vegetable dishes, stews, just about anything.
