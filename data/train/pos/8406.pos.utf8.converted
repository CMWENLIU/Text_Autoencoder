The packaging isn't too sophisticated, and (as another review mentioned) it's more liquid than other kinds of tahini, but it really tastes great.<br /><br />This how I've used it:<br />A Goya package of dry chickpeas - dipped in water for 24 hours, then boiled for 3 hours<br />About 8 ounce Tahini<br />Half a cup water<br />Lemon juice<br />Salt<br />Garlic<br />Blend everything until smooth
