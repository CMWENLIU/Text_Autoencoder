On a recent stay at the Westin Kierland Resort in Scottsdale, I took part in a single malt scotch tasting sponsored by their Food and Beverage Department.  The beverage director used glasses of this shape and size, and talked about how the shape of the glass can enhance the single malt experience.  I was initially skeptical, but as soon as the tasting began I was convinced, and started looking to purchase a few for myself as soon as I returned home.  I only rarely drink single malt scotch (too expensive) but I've found my enjoyment of those rare moments increased by 100% as a result of these glasses.  They are pricey, but a wonderful way to help you enjoy your favorite single malt scotch, and I recommend them highly. Plus Amazon's prices were the best I could find when I purchased them.
