Have you ever just approached a vending machine and realized that everything inside of it isn't worthy of your hard earned dollar? Sunflower seeds? Please. Cheese Doodles?! Get a life.<br /><br />THEN!......there were Oreo Cakesters. Not only will you buy them every single time you are within 50 feet of such a vending machine, you will become irritated and Hulk-like when certain machines do not carry them. In rare cases, people have been known to resort to cannibalism in order to fuel their Cakester hunger.<br /><br />I'm sure you'd like to know details about the Cakester's composition, its preferred habitat, and its breeding habits, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />To put it simply, I have never met a real life person that does not enjoy Oreo Cakesters. Do not be fooled by the posers posting reviews about this lovely product. They are spies sent by Keebler to take down the competition. I wouldn't trust those elves. Would YOU?....<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering about the texture of this bite sized dyno-mite snack. Well, I assure you they are made from only the finest ingredients from only the most elegant factories across the planet. If you treat your Cakesters with love and respect, and keep them in proper temperatures, I promise you will be pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Honestly, Oreo Cakesters transform my mouth into a wonderful world where everything is safe and delicious. The people of this world don't commit crimes or act unjustly. They only care about making your taste buds the happiest they can be. Let Oreo Cakesters into your mouth and into your heart. You owe it to yourself to at least give them a chance. Disappointment is not an option.
