Pros: Endless list i.e. lack of grains, high quality protein, appeal to the dog's palate, lack of stool, vitamins and minerals, no by products, fillers, or possibly dangerous ingredients, availability at you local Petco. The list goes on and on.<br />Cons: As Expensive as dog food gets (Over $2 lb). Price is the only con for me, the protein content could be an issue for some less active breeds than Boxers. The largest bag size is 24 lb. I wish they had a 40lb bag at a lesser price per pound.<br /><br />First off, this is the highest rated, best quality food that can be purchased at Petco, without question. This is the only blue buffalo line (Wilderness) in that class as well. It is not advertised as an allergy free dog food, but it definitely is due to the fact there are ZERO grains. I thought the high protein content would be an issue for my dog based on issues with other high protein foods, but that is not the case with the Blue Buffalo Wilderness. When I change foods, I want to make sure I can buy it locally in the event I need some on the fly. I love a website called dogfoodanalysis.com, and this is the only 6 star rated food that Petco sells, and most every other food except a few (Wellness is one exception although my dog didn't like it) are rated 3 stars or less. For example, Natural Balance, regardless of the flavor is rated 3 stars. Brands like Iams, Science Diet, Eukanuba, Purina Pro Plan all get horrible 1 ratings at best because they are so full of garbage ingredients, unnecessary fillers and by-products. Many of the foods that cost as much as this or close are also rated 1-2 stars.<br /><br />I have a 2 Yr old Boxer, and owned 2 before that. All of them have had soft stools the majority of the time, and 2/3 had hot spots on the fur causing them to scratch themselves constantly. Over the years, I have tried a number of premium dog foods such as Solid Gold, Nature's Recipe, Natural Balance, as well as some cheaper foods such as Iams. My dogs really never loved or even liked most of these foods, and generally wouldn't start eating the food when the bowl was put on the floor unless I poured some low sodium chicken broth on the food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo Wilderness is like candy for my dog, but is the most healthy by far at the same time. With other foods that cost as much as this food, he has never looked forward to eating, and never had a proper stool.<br /><br />I am a very harsh critic of most things, and am great at playing devil's advocate. I have nothing bad to say about this food other than the price becasue it truly seems no corners were cut, and Blue Buffalo is offering the best quality dog food on the market. However, the price is probably justified unlike any of the other expensive , but not necessarily good quality dog foods. After 2 weeks eating this food, he is filling out, seems much less hyperactive, his hot spots are disappearing (I feel due to the lack of any grains from my research), he's pooping less and more solidly. Since the last food he was eating gave him the runs anyway, I never mixed the old food with the new, and the first time he pooped, it was more solid than ever before.<br /><br />If you can afford this food (I barely can), do not hesitate to go buy it now. There were no corners cut in the design of this food. It is truly top quality dog food that is the next best thing to making your own dog food which will cost even more.<br /><br />If you own a Boxer, you know how messy they are when eating! They love filling their mouth with kibble, then dropping half of it on the floor, and not eating all of the leftovers on the floor. My dog is so addicted to the Wilderness food that he will find every last piece of kibble that he scattered on the floor, and gobbles it up.<br /><br />I prefer the Salmon
