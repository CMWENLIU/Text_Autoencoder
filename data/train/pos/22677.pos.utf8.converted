Unique.  Without comparison.  Nothing like it out here on the Left Coast.  When friends come from The Islands, they want to take this stuff back to Oahu.  But WTF?  $200 for 4 rolls?  How can you not choke when you're paying $50 a roll for Taylor Ham?  That's like me bringing Spam from Hawaii, and charging $25 a can in Philly.  Now take a look at how much it cost to buy Scrapple on Amazon.  Are you kidding me with this?
