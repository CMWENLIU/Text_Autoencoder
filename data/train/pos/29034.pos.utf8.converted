Originally, I purchased a bottle of this hot sauce for my dad from a missionary that visited our church a couple of years ago.  My dad LOVED it.  He said that it was not only hot, but had the best flavor of any that he had tried (he's 71 yrs old).  When he got almost to the bottom of the bottle, he saved it.  He is retired and they travel a lot. He could not find it anywhere.  I started looking on the internet, found it and started comparing prices from different websites. Amazon had the best price.  I bought him 7 bottles.  All arrived safe and sound.  When he opened his present this past Christmas you would have thought we had given him bottles of gold!
