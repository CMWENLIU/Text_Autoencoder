This is one of the very few Gluten Free pastas that is so close to havng all the properties of "real" pasta that it's worth the extra expense. Most gf pastas can't be reheated without falling apart into a gluey mess. One that can be made into Mac/Cheese and not be a solid mass. At our house we even have been able to enjoy cold pasta salads again (though it needs to be eaten in a day or two). Have served this to non celiacs who have asked if it wasn't "real" and are amazed that it's not traditional wheat pastas. The texture is delicate but firm enough to hold it's shape. The taste is slightly different than traditional but with sauce (even a light one)you'd never know. Leave it to the Italians...they know their pasta...gf or not!
