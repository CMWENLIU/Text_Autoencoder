I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack.<br />For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.25, 7.25, 9.25oz), and I always use one K-cup for one 9.25oz cup, and I drink it black. I don't make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn't always mean "strong"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I've tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no "strong" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, "Wow, this is good coffee!"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn't have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.
