High price? Definitely! Is it worth it? Words are inadequate to describe this oral ecstasy ;-) One needs all their senses functioning properly to begin to appreciate what has gone over the lips onto the taste buds. The Value Proposition is definitely worth it, but then, that's a personal opinion. Would I buy it again? Absolutely - even have gone so far as to buy it for Family & Friends [have NOT lost any yet]. So, if your credit card will not melt, go ahead - "Make Your Day !" The flavors & dimensions are immense & INTENSE. Thank God, you can use this very sparingly.<br /><br />My stereotype of "vinegar" is irreparably damaged! This is like a 6oz bottle of very fine Ice Wine. It should be classified as a dessert! And any drops sliding down the exterior of the bottle, just lick it [you already paid for it], because no one is watching (hopefully). DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER TRYING TO CALCULATE THE COST / BITE!<br /><br />Thanks to the chef who said in an earlier review that this was his personal favorite. That sealed the deal for me. ENJOY! ;-)))
