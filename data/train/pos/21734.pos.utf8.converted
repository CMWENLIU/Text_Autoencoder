I was born and raised in Philadelphia. I have tasted only one version of Snapper soup that was better. That was a frozen version produced by Campbell Soups during the 1960s. Having said that, Bookbinders' Snapper Soup is the best-tasting Snapper now available. The label instructs you to cut the contents with one-half can of water; I prefer to open two cans and warm the contents straight. The result is rich and thick with a flavourable base, filled with turtle meat, cooked egg white, and just the right mix of seasonings. Probably the best snapper soup on the market.
