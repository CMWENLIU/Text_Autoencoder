I found a package of these berries first at Costco in Arvada, Colorado and found these to be the BEST dried fruit I've ever had.  I've since requested at my local Costco (Honolulu, Hawaii) that they carry these and I keep waiting and waiting.  I was thrilled to find these on the Amazon website and ordered four bags right away.<br /><br />Thank you for carrying it!
