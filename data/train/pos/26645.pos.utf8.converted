Taste/Texture: Like a Payday for grownups was my first thought eating this bar.  The nuts certainly take center stage and everything else is there to support it and transform it into a magical snack.  The cane juice and sea salt provides that fantastic salty/sweet combination.  I love the texture of this bar, it's crunchy without being too hard (it's also good that it forces you to chew instead of just inhale your food).  If you're curious about the fruit, I got the strawberry and it's more of a subtle flavor, definitely not in your face (yummy taste though), and I did taste a raisin, but only when I broke it apart and ate it slowly, have not noticed a date, so the other reviewer may be correct about it being part of the glue.<br /><br />Nutrition: This has a higher fat content than most bars, but that is because I'm really not kidding when I say this bar is wonderfully made up of nuts, so it's the kind of fat doctors tell you to eat.  I'm not kidding when I say this bar is sooo good and half easily fills me up when I'm just looking for something to tide me over.<br /><br />Bottom line, I bought this bar because it had a great price (subscribe and save plus an extra 25% off?  amazing), but I will keep buying because it has a FANTASTIC taste, which is so rare in these items.
