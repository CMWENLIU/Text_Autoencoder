The first thing you notice when you open up the tin is the aromatic floral scent of rose but it's not overpowering.  Once brewed, the tea is a deep red color and rosy tasting.  It makes for a mellow cup of tea and is easy drinking and light in caffeine.  You can enjoy a whole pot full here and this makes it great company with a long novel.  Definitely not a bracing breakfast style tea if that's what you're looking for but if you like subtle aromatic teas, this is a sure bet.  Doesn't get bitter even with oversteeping.  A real pleasure.  If you like this, try lychee congou if you can track it down.  Very aromatic and mellow as well.
