My wife and I love this k-cup. We've tested all the extra bold dark roasts out there. In fact, we did blind taste tests and pitted Timothy's Midnight Magic vs. Green Mountain EB Dark Magic, Gloria Jeans EB Black Gold, Van Houtte's Eclipse EB, Green Mountain EB Espresso Blend, Green Mountain EB Sumatran Reserve, Timothy's EB Parisian Nights, Coffee People EB Organic, Coffee People EB French Roast, Tully's EB French Roast and Tully's EB Italian Roast. Yes, we honestly tested them all. Many of the other contenders are fine coffees in their own right and without direct comparison to Midnight Magic, they'd be a fine k-cup. But when compared directly with Timothy's Midnight Magic, we found we chose it every time in blind taste tests. It amazed me when my wife picked it every single time.<br /><br />There is no way you'd be let down by this k-cup if you like extra bold, dark roasted coffee. It's just perfect!<br /><br />A must buy for Keurig owners!
