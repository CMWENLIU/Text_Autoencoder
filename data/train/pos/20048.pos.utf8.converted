I love this water so much, I just subscribed to get it once a month. I'm sort of amused/bewildered at some of the other reviewers claims that the fruit flavor in this water is too mild- the flavor of the blackberry, in particular, is a somewhat strong, almost jam-like taste. It's not overpowering, but I don't think it could be any stronger without negatively affecting the flavor of the water. My guess is that what most reviewers are actually missing in this water is the sweetener- there is NOT even a hint of that- just the taste of fruit and water. This is precisely what I've been looking for FOREVER in a flavored water, as I don't like artificial sweetener but I do sometimes prefer something beyond the plain taste of water.<br />My only possible complaint with this product is that it's ridiculously overpriced. But apparently not so much that I'm not willing to pay it. It's THAT good.
