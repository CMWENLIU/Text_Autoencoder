I was recently in St. Barths in a gourmet food store and needed mayonnaise.  All they had was the Delouis Fils so not wanting to make a stop at the local supermarket I decided to give it a try.  Before adding it to my tuna I took a taste.  It was so good I almost forgot the tuna and just ate it straight from the jar.  Imagine my surprise to find it available through Amazon!
