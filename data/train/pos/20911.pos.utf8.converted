Just as I was thinking about some iced coffee, the UPS guy shows up with my Cool Brew order. It was nicely packed with an insulated liner. I immediately opened it for a cup. Despite comments I read about the original flavor being bland or not very strong, I found it to be full of flavor and just what I was hoping it would taste like. I love coffee but don't drink hot things in the summer and don't have time to run to a coffee shop or McDonald's for a cup of iced coffee throughout the day. Judging from how big this 32 ounce bottle (1 liter) is, I'll be making myself many cups of iced coffee before I need to order again. And it's so fast! Pour a measured amount (measured area provided on the bottle) into a cup, add milk (my preference) and sweetener, ice and a straw and call it done. I'm much impressed.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MW6JXI">Cool Brew
