People are all writting these complex things about Chinotto.<br />It tastes exactly like a licorice flavored Dr. Pepper.<br />Personally the first time I had it I LOVED it.<br />My Mom says it tastes bitter but to me it's super sweet.<br />Remember people writting these reviews are trying their best to confuse.<br />It TASTES LIKE LICORICE FLAVOURED DR. PEPPER!!!!
