DO YOU THINK WE OWN BRACH'S.  YOU MAKE IT SO THAT<br />OUR CHILDREN AREN'T ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THIS CANDY<br />BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND THE UNAVAILABILITY IN OUR LOCAL STORES.  WHAT IS GOING ON???  WHO IS MINDING THE STORE??? --- (THE STOCKHOLDERS?)<br />7 OZ'S FOR OVER 9.00 PLUS SHIPPING???  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED.  WON'T BE BUYING BRACH'S CANDY THIS YEAR.
