5 stars, 10 if it were possible.<br />2 mini-doxies who ate homemade from birth to 2, then went onto 'natural' kibble (Holistic Blendz, Hund n Flocken) and developed urine crystals, then went to a vet kibble that got rid of the crystals but developed another crystal.  I needed a solution that wouldn't take all day to prepare, and without grain (dachshunds are better off with potatoes as their starch, no rice or corn).  First impressions - smells good helped by garlic and oh look! I can actually recognize the bits of potato, broccoli and carrots! - add water, so far pretty easy.  Add beef?  I can't bring myself to do the raw thing, but I get organic ground beef from Costco, poach it, and when it's cooled down I add it to the Europa.  Store 3-4 days worth in the frig, and it's done.  Doggies used to sniff at the kibble and swallow enough of it to sustain life.  Now they can't wait to eat.  They're down to healthy weights, which is key for doxie backs, and the vet proclaims the smooth is the "best looking dachshund" he has ever seen.  They're running and playing like puppies at the ripe old age of 7.  I give them Missing Link Plus supplements, Cosequin DS to keep joints in good shape.  I feel like I'm doing a good thing for them, and I want them around me for many more years to come. I can't thank Sojourner Farms enough for understanding the need for grain-free food, let alone the absolute purity of preparation and ingredients. Someone there actually thought about the dog first.  I'm sure it takes longer to prep and dehydrate the vegetables than to pulverize and kibble-ize something far less healthy, but Sojos is doing it anyway and I for one am grateful for the product.  Costly?  I can't even calculate the value when I see the difference it has made in my dogs after just 2 months.  They ship it free from the Sojos web site, and so does Amazon.  Friends, just do it.  You can make it in the time it takes you to cook supper. You'd do it for your kids.  And your dogs don't talk back!!
