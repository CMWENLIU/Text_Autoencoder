The AeroGarden is perfect for anyone without outdoor space or without the time or energy for growing vegetables.  The setup was easy and there is a minimal amount of effort required to grow vegetables.  My kit came with the salad greens, and I was amazed at how quickly the lettuce grew!  I was harvesting lettuce within 3 weeks!  I love picking lettuce for sandwiches or salads as I need it.
