These are so much better than Slim Jim's they don't have that weird fur texture when you bite it; and as far as biting goes you can actually bite these without fighting with it. They taste good, but have that typical meat stick flavor. These are also MUCH easier to open than a Slim Jim. Packed well, arrived quickly and fresh.
