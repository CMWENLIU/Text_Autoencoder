There are different levels of balsamic vinegar.  The "tradizionale" is consortium-approved and is generally over $100 for a four to five ounces and could be over $500 for a tiny amount.  The next level is the "condimento balsamico" which is not consortium approved, but is about half the price or less than the previous type.  The last level is "Aceto Balsamico di Modena", which can be really bad and there are no controls over what goes into it (artificial coloring, etc.).<br /><br />That being said, Fondo Carrate vinegar is producted from grapes grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides of any kind. Organically grown and produced exclusively from ancient D.O.C. Lambrusco varieties of the Mastri, Salamino and Sorbara grapes.  It is 12 years old and aged in oak.  Very smooth, sweet, but tangy.  It really is a fine vinegar, especially for the price.  You can get it for a bit less than $32 from other distributors, but I'm not sure how the shipping compares.  Check around -- it's definitely worth finding a supplier for this stuff.
