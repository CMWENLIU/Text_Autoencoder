I love Indian food and always carry flavor combinations in my mental book of go-to-recipes.  From my many (mis)adventures of spice shopping, I think this the best value deal so far. If you don't  cook Indian food on a daily basis, there is no use purchasing huge clumsy packets of turmeric, cumin seeds, chilli powder etc from Indian grocery stores that spill and stain all over your kitchen. Other manageable sizes and packaging available online and in Safeway or Whole Foods are super expensive.<br /><br />This is a great starter kit at an unbelievably affordable price for someone who wants to learn Indian dishes and have some fresh spices in their pantry for back-up in case there is a need to spike up your recipes!<br /><br />Shipping was super fast. Their double-sealed packaging is very good - because my mailbox doesn't smell like cumin! I liked it so much that I ordered 2 more as holiday gifts for my friends who have been harassing me for my Cucumber Raita salad and Rajma (kidney beans curry) recipes!
