I really do swear by this stuff.  I use it as my daytime moisturizer under makeup.  It is silky smooth, highly emollient, absorbs easily, and actually takes away puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly.  I'm not a coffee lover, but the scent is very light and actually reminds me more of chocolate than it does coffee. A little goes a long way, but don't worry if you use a bit too much as its equally effective on those fine lines across the bridge of the nose and around the lips. Don't waste it.  I don't use it for night as I'm not worried how puffy or wrinkled I look once I've washed off my makeup and would rather save it for daytime. So for those asking "Does this stuff really work?", I can honestly say YES!
