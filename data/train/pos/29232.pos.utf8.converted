I now have a happy Australian Shepherd with clean teeth.  This is a great product.  My veteranarian warned me about using dental bones that are too hard.  He said that dogs have such a strong jaw that they will actually crack their teeth on bones that are too hard.  This prodct is hard enough to clean the teeth but soft enough so as not to hurt the teeth--and, Aussie loves it.
