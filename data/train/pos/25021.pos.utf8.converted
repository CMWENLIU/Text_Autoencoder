I bought the mayo packets in Fat Free and they are working out okay. They come in a box, and each packet is wrapped in sturdy foil wrappers. The portion is just right for a sandwich (Its a lot bigger than the typical ketchup packet) and each is only 10 Calories. I have even put them out for a BBQ and people ate them and didn't even realize that they were Fat Free.......the flavor is smooth and good for those cutting back on calories. They don't need to be in the fridge.<br /><br />At first I was hesitant, because I was worried that they would come with a close expiration date, considering there are 200 packets. But they go fast if you eat a lot of sandwiches for lunch, and mine came fresh with a year +++ to spare.<br /><br />I have even considered taking them in my purse and substituting it in things like Fast Food Chicken sandwiches, since the mayo they use is "Heavy restaurant Mayo" and it totally busts the calorie load in just about anything. It's a quick 150 calorie cut to your meal.
