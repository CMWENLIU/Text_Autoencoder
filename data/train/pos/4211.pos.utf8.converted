I love this honey mainly for the packaging.  The bottle is super easy to use -it doesn't leak & the material is easier to squeeze compared to other containers.  You can even use the suction from squeezing it to pull the last drip of honey back into the nozzle. Perfect for keeping your bottle from getting sticky with unwanted/unseen drips.<br /><br />The taste is nice -It's perfect in my hot tea and it's also good plainly spread on toast.<br /><br />I see another commenter complained that they had a problem with it crystallizing, but the bottle description explains that this may happen due to the raw & unfiltered nature of the honey. The bottle also tells how you can easily reliquify by heating in a warm water bath.<br /><br />I highly recommend this honey!
