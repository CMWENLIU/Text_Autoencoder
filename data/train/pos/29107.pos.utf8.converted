I wanted to try something healthier than white rice and potatoes for my family and this variety pack looked intriguing and with the excellent reviews, I gave it a try. We LOVE it! My preschooler loves to choose the variety and it has made mealtime more exciting for her. It was a big surprise to us to see how much 1 cup dry and 1 cup water made all together! Very nice product.
