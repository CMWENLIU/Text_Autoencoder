I'm not much for fancy-flavored coffees,  so GMC Golden French Toast is the exception.  I was bummed when the box was empty, so I ran to my nearest chain store to pick up another, knowing I'd be paying a lot more than necessary for my "quick fix".  I was surprised to learn that it was CHEAPER in the chain store than on AMAZON!!!!!  What's going on with Amazon's coffee pricing lately?????
