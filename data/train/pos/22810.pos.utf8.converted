This is the best vinigar sprinkled on steamed cauliflower or any vegetable - great to deglaze a pan - it's extremely salty and slightly sweet - unusual fantastic flavor and i use it all the time. I bought a case when the Japanese nuclear explosion occurred, just in case I couldn't get it again ... Eden is one of the most honest and best companies to buy from.
