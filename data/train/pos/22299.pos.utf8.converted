If you are looking for flaked dehydrated coconut, look no further. I can't say that I've tried all the brands out there - mainly because I had all but given up on American coconut flakes, that always tastes like cardboard. Similar Brazilian products tend to be less dry, you bite into a flake and taste the coconut natural oils. Well, this is as close to that as I've ever tasted. The flakes might be dry outside, but are still juicy & flavorful. I eat these as a snack and a treat, straight out of the bag!
