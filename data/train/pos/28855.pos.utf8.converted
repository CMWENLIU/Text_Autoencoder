This ginger is dried perfectly - not too moist, not too dry.  It isn't stringy either in that gross cud-like way that some dried ginger/fruit can be.  If chopped/minced, it is a great addition to baked goods.  Tasty eaten on it's own too.<br /><br />Yes, it is covered in "decorative sugar", but I didn't find this to be a problem at all.  Not too sweet.  If you don't like the sugar though, you can just give the bag a good shake before take out the ginger.
