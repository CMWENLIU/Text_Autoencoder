I ordered this tea for my mom in NM. I live in Kansas. I got it shipped for her...there. But, she ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS TEA. She said the flavor was WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS. But...the main reason she wanted the Tea was because it SUPPOSEDLY LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE BY 7 POINTS. Now...for me, I really don't know what that means...but my mom was THRILLED.<br />AND...the shipment was quick...& fast... Before you know it, she was sipping her Hibiscus Tea...by the NM Mountains...lowering her BLOOD PRESSURE... Awww...I killed 2 birds with 1 stone...Made my mom happy, & lowered her blood pressure.. healthy...healthy...healthy.
