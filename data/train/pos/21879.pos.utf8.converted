This product has several uses.  My sister told me about coconut oil and I researched further.  Not all coconut oils are the same.  This one is great for me because I have used it to condition my hair as well as my skin.  Also you can eat and cook with this product.  It has the most delightful light natural coconut fragrance. It desolves quickly into the skin without oily residue.  Fast absorbtion.  Gentle too!
