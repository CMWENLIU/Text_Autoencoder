I have been lucky enough to taste the good stuff (10 year aged Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena) and I've been unlucky enough to taste a whole lot of the not-so-good stuff (supermarket balsamic vinegar), and a few of the ones in the middle (Condimento grade balsamic) and so I have a decently wide range of aceto balsamico experience and I can say that Villa Manodori is very good condimento grade and maybe as good as "real" aceto balsamico tradizionale.  It pours like good aceto balsamico - sort of like maple syrup - and it has a very nice color.  And the flavor is sweet and sour and the different flavors hit me like a wave as every time I struggle to separate all of the flavors.  But it's delicious and a special experience and I am very glad they have priced at the high side of what I'm willing to pay (as opposed to totally out of my reach).
