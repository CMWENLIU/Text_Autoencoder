This is the salt you want for your popcorn.  In the Air Force Squadron I was known and Captain Popcorn, now I am known as Dad Popcorn.  This salt is ground fine which is perfect for popcorn.  The bigger granules on table salt are to large and will make your popcorn to salty tasting.  With this salt and my Great Northern Popcorn machine, Orville Redenbacker corn (yes more expensive but I have yet to find a popcorn which pops up fluffier and with fewer 'old maids') and Louanna coconut oil you will be all set.  I have also found alternating batches  with coconut oil and vegetable oil seems to make a nicer overall taste as well.  I also salt each batch as it finishes with this salt and mix it around a bit with the scoop.  If you really want something special fresh grade parmesan cheese on your corn, I guarantee you will love it.
