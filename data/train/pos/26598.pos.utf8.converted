Love these beans! The chocolate coating is creamy and smooth, and a little more generous than most. It has a sweeter taste than the coating on some other varieties (sweet, but not cloying). That balances well with the sharp flavor of the espresso bean. The appearance of these is pleasing also. There is an even distribution of dark chocolate, white chocolate, and a pretty speckled milk-on-white that conceals a milk chocolate underlayer.<br /><br />I like the presentation of Dilettante Chocolates; on the label there are two short paragraphs about the history and practices of the company that incorporate that information charmingly and with a concise flair that is very modern.<br /><br />And the price for this somewhat decadent purchase, three pounds of chocolate covered espresso beans, is terrific even with shipping. Service was very good too. I received my order within three business days of placing it.
