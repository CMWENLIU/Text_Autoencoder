I was looking for Vanilla extract but found these beans at such a good price, I thought, why not make my own extract. All you need to do is soak a dozen beans in a 750 ml Vodka for a month. For the same price as good extract, I now have extract (a lot of)  plus plenty of beans left over for ice cream and other projects.
