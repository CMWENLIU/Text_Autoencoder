I bought this suet at a local bird store, and it worked well.  Decided to buy it in bulk from Amazon, and MAN I have not been disappointed!!  I watched the suet feeder for an hour a few days ago and saw TWENTY bird species.  No joke.  One was a Great Crested Flycatcher that I'm pretty sure only showed up because it heard all the bird commotion.  :)  This suet has attracted several families of birds this spring, including baby Red-Bellied Woodpeckers, Downy Woodpeckers, Bluebirds, Chickadees, Thrashers, Nuthatches, etc, etc..  Couldn't be more pleased.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />Squirrels investigate it every few days, but they don't stay long.  I guess this stuff has some serious kick.  ;)
