My family enjoys good dark rye.  I followed the package directions (just add three tablespoons of molasses and three tablespoons of powdered cocoa) and made the best dark rye we have ever eaten.  Three cheers for Hodgson Mill.  If you like rye bread, you will love this mix either way.  The bread mix works great in my bread machine and yields good volume, texture, color and flavor.
