Youki has a better chicken stock/base, however, it is near impossible to get it in the states or where my spouse shops when on business trips.<br /><br />That being said, this is still a very good product for cooking. I use it for Japanese recipes, Mabu-dofu, achiote rice, as a pure soup base, and as a supplemental flavoring to chicken & dumplings.<br /><br />The Lee Kum Kee USA Company makes the base here in the States, but doesn't add any flavoring that could alter the flavor of foods from other countries. A great basic stocking item for the kitchen pantry.
