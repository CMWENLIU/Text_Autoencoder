This cereal is so delicious, and I love that I can eat it without feeling too bad about the nutritional quality.  While there are healthier cereals out there, I love that this one makes me feel like I am cheating with some sugary fluffy cereal, and yet the nutritional profile is still pretty decent.  I definitely recommend it!  Oh, and of the flavors I have tried, peanut butter is the absolute best.  I won't buy any of the other flavors anymore because the peanut butter just hits the spot so well.
