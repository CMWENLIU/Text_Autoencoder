To allay any questions about whether this is decaf or not. It is indeed CAFFEINATED. The bag does have the "swiss water process decaf" words on the side but the bigger issue for me was that the bag I received was the ubiquitous decaf dark green color...not black/brown as shown on Amazon.com. Combined with the wording on the side...I too was curious.  Here are excerpts from my email exchange with Cafe Altura's customer service...<br /><br />From: Cindy Hernandez [mailto:cindy@cafealtura.com]<br />Subject: Re: Coffee Bean Caffeine Question...<br />Sent: Wednesday, September 03, 2008 10:06 AM<br /><br />Mark,<br />Be glad to know that it  is not, I repeat not decaf. To begin with, we do not have Columbian Decaf. So be assured. What is written on the side of the bags are just the different roasts we carry, and our decaf processing method, that's it. Maybe you can post a comment on the Amazon site, to let people know this......<br />Cindy<br /><br />...and the followup email to my suggestion to either remove the writing or change the color of the bag...<br /><br />From: Cindy Hernandez [mailto:cindy@cafealtura.com]<br />Sent: Wednesday, September 03, 2008 11:01 AM<br /><br />Mark,<br />Thanks for your input,and your support,  we are in the process of changing the bags at this time.<br />CH<br /><br />My synopsis: Superb coffee.  Great company. Responsive customer service.
