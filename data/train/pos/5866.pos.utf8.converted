This has been a great find.  Recommended to me by a friend.  It has given my husband and I noticeably more energy.  We have been drinking a scoop full in about 8 oz of juice/smoothie/whatever 2-3X a day for two weeks now.  Sure, there is some grit when mixing, and it does take a good stir to get it mixed.  I have a tiny whisk I use for just juice or water and it mixes it well.  We like it in OJ in the morning (it isn't pretty to look at, but just start drinking and its pretty good, and its good for you!) We think it tastes pretty good, considering its contents.  We are new parents, not health junkies by any means.  Early 30's, working full time, not exercising enough and this helps us get back some of the energy we need without extra caffeine or mid-day crash, and helps us hit the veggie count we want for a better diet.  No noticeable side effects-- no gas or stomach issues.  I am glad we found it.
