Teff replaces oatmeal as a hot breakfast cereal. Teff's pretty unique, its a tiny seed. It doesn't get mushy when cooked, but does stick together. To cook it boil it in water- use about 1/2C Teff to 2 1/2 C water- to serve two or one large guy. Add some salt too, say 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon and just boil until thick. Stir so it doesn't stick to the pan. Flavor is kind of nutty but mild and its really good. Its much higher in protein and complex carbs so you can feel the difference around noon- still with you. Its a definite must have for athletes and if you can afford it everyone else. You may also like grated orange peel, nutmeg, cinnamon or for us we add toasted anise seed as well for peak flavor. We serve it with milk and a pinch of sugar. Its excellent, if you prepare any dish like this you will probably find Teff is better than all of them. Take advantage of the shipping deal when you buy two boxes.
