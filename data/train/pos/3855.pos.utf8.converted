I love this stuff!  We make it at the 8oz setting on our Cuisinart K-cup machine, and then add frothed, steamed milk from the Aerochino frother.  Makes a wonderful hot-chocolate latte.  The chocolate is very good by itself, as well, although we like to add a least a splash of milk (or whipped cream) to thicken up the body a little.
