Kashi GoLean Crunch! is really good. Seriously, truly tasty. It's got a real "crunch!" to it, as the name makes clear -- but after the initial crunch, it's got this understated sweetness about it, a mixture of cinnamon and maybe a little honey. Mmmm. A bowl is very filling, and here's the amazing part: it actually KEEPS me full. For hours. As for the "clumps" that some people are complaining about, those are my favorite part! It's just a characteristic of the cereal -- kind of like how, sometimes, pizza will have a bubble of dough in it. Mmmm. Love the bubble, love the clumps.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
