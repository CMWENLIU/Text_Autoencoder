I recently obtained a young stray in shabby condition. Being my first cat, I asked the vet for a recommendation on cat food and her first pick was Innova EVO. There are three other cats in the house I live in and I put them all on Innova. The stray now looks like a brand new cat with shiny coat, LOTS of energy, and good muscle tone. He won't TOUCH other "junk food" brands now and even passes up wet food for his Innova. The other cats had no problems switching either. Their coats improved as well and they lost their dandruff problems. One of the three is 14 years old, very obese, and barfed daily; she lost the weight and no longer throws up.<br /><br />The vet warned that the food should be supplimented with an appropriate wet food if the cats do not drink enough water (the stray drinks plenty but the others do not) because the extra protein can further dehydrate a cat. Contrary to most recommendations that cats be put soley on wet food, I was told dry food helps keep their teeth in shape. So I guess at the very least, as far as dry food goes, this is the best I have heard of and the results show it for me. :)
