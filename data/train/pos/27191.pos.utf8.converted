Ok this is my first review so bear with. This product is so good I had to share my thoughts about it. First off let me say that I am Italian. I have chosen to go low carb in the past with much success. The only problem is, is no pasta. That's a really big thing for an Italian. I can go without the bread, potatoe, rice, and sweets no problem. But when it comes to pasta, that hit me really hard. So I go to Amazon to order it after hearing from a friend of mine how good it is. I am also one of those people who have tried every other low carb pasta on the market and thought they all tasted like cardboard. Yuk! I recieved Dreamfields and the same night made some to go with my dinner. To my surprise this stuff was heaven. I know other reviewers say to only eat this as a treat to yourself, but I eat it maybe 3 or 4 times a week. I am still loosing weight. Actually loosing at a faster rait than before for some reason. Now I am not diabetic so I do not have to watch my sugar spike levels.I don't even really watch my portion. I plate what I think will fill me and that is that.Probly 2 to 3 portions (1/2 cup is one portion). I never have that bloated feeling I used to get after eating a plate of normal pasta.And I never get the sugar carb crash 2 hours later. It has been almost 2 months of eating this pasta whenever I feel like it. The freedom is great.I have also made this pasta in several different ways. Macaroni and cheese, Alfredo style, garlic and butter with roasted veggies, you name it. Now I like my pasta "al dente" meaning almost cooked. They say you should not over cook the pasta because it will change the way it digests. Doesn't bother me I like it just on the chewy side of done. As far as reheating it, well just make sure you cook it al dente and when it comes time to reheating it should still be fine. Soups maybe a problem though since the pasta stays in the soup liquid and reheating to many time can cause the pasta to go mushy. So please do yourself a favor and either get Dreamfields from Amazon or from some of the local grocerie stores. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!
