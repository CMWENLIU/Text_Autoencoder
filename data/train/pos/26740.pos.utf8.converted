Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Lush, luxe dark chocolate. Very smooth. Dark chocolate flavor notes are very long and enjoyable. Not excessively bitter at all, but the taste of chocolate is not masked or overwhelmed with the added raw cane sweetness and is without other added oils or flavorings. Thick, long-lasting consistency. Well balanced and a good choice for chocolate purists. Great value for a high quality organic chocolate. Made with 72% organic cocoa and organic raw cane sugar only. 570 calories per 3.5oz/100g bar. One half (or less) of a whole bar is a nice serving. The remaining portion can be saved in an airtight container or ziplock bag for another day. Best stored at room [~70F/21C] temperature. Kosher "D" from processing on shared equipment. Product of Germany. [The ingredients list includes "cocoa liquor" and "cocoa butter" separately which are both derived from processing of raw cocoa beans. Both are just technical terms for cocoa components and are 100% plant-based from the cocoa bean only and contain no dairy or alcohol or fermentation.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
