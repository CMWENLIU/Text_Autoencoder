I've been making wine at home for a couple of years now and have over a dozen kits under my belt.  I buy all of my kits at a local brew/wine store and am also somewhat active on an on-line winemaking forum so I'm pretty familiar with the various wine kits available out there.<br /><br />When I ran across these Vino Italiano kits on Amazon I was a bit leery as I had never heard of them before.  They were having a great special at the time, though, so I couldn't afford not to give them a try.<br /><br />I am very pleasantly surprised! It's a small volume kit at 5.1 liters of concentrate, but still makes the typical 6 gallons of wine. The packaging is first class and while the wine is still young (clearing in my carboy) I have every indication it's going to make a nice, red table wine.  If you've come across these and have been hesitant to order, there's no need.  They are quality, small-volume kits AND the even come with labels, corks, and foil tops.  I will buy again in the near future.<br /><br />04-28-2010 Addendum: This wine has been in the bottle for a little over 6 months now and I thought I'd update my initial report.  In a nutshell - this is a very pleasant, medium-bodied, red table wine.  It finished very dry, not fruit forward at all, but at the same time it goes down very easily.  I'd almost refer to it as "gulpable".<br /><br />If you're looking for a big, full-bodied Cabernet or Bordeaux style of wine, this kit isn't for you (probably not any of the Vino Italiano kits for that matter).  But if you're looking for a lighter, nice drinking red, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd view this wine as food-friendly and it'll make a great pizza or picnic wine.<br /><br />I plan on making two more of these Vino Italiano kits and giving them a nice long rest in an oak barrel to see how good these kits can be given a little more patience and time.
