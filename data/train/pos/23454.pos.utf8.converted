I felt like I was taking a big risk ordering 12 cans from Amazon having never tried it, and I crossed my fingers I would like it.  Well, I don't just like it.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  This stuff is great.  I try to sneak it into all my meals.  Hamburger helper, spaghetti, stir-fry, regular hamburgers, stews, casseroles, lasagna, tacos, anything.  I even make very messy sandwiches with it.  It's AWESOME!  Tastes fabulous.  Sometimes I even eat it just by itself if I have leftovers.  Even cold out of the fridge with nothing with it, it's good.<br /><br />Best vegetarian product I've ever tried (and I've tried a lot of them).  I will be buying a lot of their other variations (the chicken, turkey, hot dogs, etc).  They even have fake scallops!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for carrying this wonderful brand!
