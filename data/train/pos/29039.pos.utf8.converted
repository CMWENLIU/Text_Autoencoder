I wanted to try this Callebaut Cocoa Powder after it was top-rated by America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated (they never let me down!).  It is great.  It is a very large bag so I wouldn't buy it if you just bake occasionally, but I'm guessing you wouldn't be here in that case anyway :)  It is also a lot messier than the old Hershey's cans because the side of the bag is coated with plastic so the chocolate sticks to it and all over the inside of the bag.  I just store my bag of cocoa powder inside of the storage bag it was shipped in (bag inside of a bag) and it keeps all chocolate off my cupboards and shelves.  I do get chocolate all over my hands every time I need to measure some out, though, and end up washing my hands multiple times to avoid transferring it to the outside of the bag and the rest of my kitchen.  However, I will still buy it again; it is worth the quality to me, if you can afford it.  Sorry to ramble about the mess; otherwise its great!!
