We heat it in the oven at 500 degrees for half an hour and then we place it in the center of the table. We gather round and put our own chosen beef, scallops, shrimp or chicken on it to quicly cook.  Of course, you would have to be old enough to understand it is hot enough to seriously burn you if you were to touch it so young children should not be allowed near it.  I find that thick Beef has to be prepared as thin strips or smaller pieces to be well done. It cleans up easy after it cools: just wipe it with a warm cloth of water and a little lemon juice and let it dry. The size slab you buy depends on the amount of food you want cooked at the same time.  We love it.
