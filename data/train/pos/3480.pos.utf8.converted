I used to buy daiquiris and margaritas already mixed in individual freezer bags and enjoyed the convenience very much. For some reason, I cannot find these anymore.  BTW: There are some made by Daily's, but they are made with wine, not liquour (but taste really good anyway!)<br /><br />Still, I was looking for my favorite cocktails in a portable bag. These were very good! They are very fruity (with real strawberry seeds) and creamy..not like kool aid. Also, they freeze really well, no big, sharp shards of ice, but with a squeeze or two, they were more like a slushy.<br /><br />To make: You open the twist cap, fill first with rum (to a premarked line), shake to mix, then fill the rest of the way with water and freeze.<br /><br />I made the first batch just this way, by pouring the liquor right in the bag up to the "fill line" on the packaging. I don't know if I had the bag set on the counter incorrectly or what, but the powder seemed to absorb the liquid and I ended up pouring too much rum in the bag and hadn't even reached the line! It didn't even freeze too well as it was too strong (we did drink them anyway!) With the second bag, I measured the rum in a measuring cup (1 1/2 cups...it is written on the bag, too.) They were better. You can vary the amount of liqour to your taste (or even use different kinds of alcohol...or I suppose none at all if you want.)<br /><br />One more fun tip: I mixed the entire bag, then poured individual servings into small ziploc freezer bags. I think I used about 5 or 6 little ziplocs per 1 Lt. Blender Bag (which makes 1/2 gallon.) Then I froze all the little bags. That way we could take only 1 when we wanted it, OR we could throw a few in our beach bags and they stayed slushy for hours. Plus, we didn't have to carry much garbage when we were done (like with cans or bottles.) Also, we didn't have to worry about doling out servings into cups or anything. Just slip a straw into a little opening in the zipper and enjoy!
