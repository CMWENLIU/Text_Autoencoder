This is a very nice popping oil made from soybean oil. Makes one of the best tasting popcorns I have made. A medium body oil. They say you can use it as a topping oil as well, but I like the popcorn just the way it comes out using the oil as a popper. Please, Hometown Favorites $36.50 for 4 bottles?? I can buy it at WalMart for $3.25 a bottle and sell it myself for 100% profit and it wouldn't cost nearly as much. Gotta love these greedy people. I can't believe these companies stay in  business charging these outrageous prices. Oh well, I guess you're not forced to buy from them, thank goodness.
