In response to a previous reviewer who questioned the potassium content of the coconut water, please see the product description: "High in potassium, fat free, cholesterol free, and low in acidity, no sugar, Contains five essential electrolytes--potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and phosphorous" -- which makes coconut water a superior pre- or post-workout drink compared to other popular sugar-laden, artificial color-added ones (you know who you are).  I drink my Vita Coco chilled either right from the box to quench my thirst after a long run or I mix it into a delicious, awesomely nutritious smoothie with frozen bananas, papayas, strawberries, mangoes...whatever fruit you have on hand.  You can also make a super-nutritious green smoothie by simply adding a tablespoon of Greener Grasses or Vitamineral Green to a cup of the coconut water and giving it a good whirl in the Vita-Mix.  Excellent!  And with Amazon's free shipping and subscription discounts, the value can't be beat.
