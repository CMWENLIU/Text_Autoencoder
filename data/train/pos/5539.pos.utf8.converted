I bought this after trying Stevia (which I really didn't like, too bitter) and was very pleased. I'm weaning myself off artificial sweeteners and anything with high fructose corn syrup or lots of regular sugar and needed an alternative. This worked out great. Tastes good with my coffee, a little different taste but not in a bad way at all, very important!
