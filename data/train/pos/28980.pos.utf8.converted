This is the best brand! [[ASIN:B000VUMSE0 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz]I have been using more and more coconut oil for the past for months. First it was for facial moisturizer than learned how great it is for a whole body moisturizer. Use as you would baby oil. The I tried for my baby who has eczema and is allergic to just about all the "pure" and "natural" products out there. His skin drinks it in and leaves it super moisturized and smooth. No more cracks and irritation. Great for all seasons. My husband uses after shaving as do I. I love it for cooking, No more olive and canola. If you do your research this should be your only cooking oil. Whether savory or sweet or deep frying and sauteing. Has a very mild taste, my husband doesn't even notice the difference. Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size. I put some in my smaller containers and leave one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, one in the baby room and the largest one in the kitchen. Can't get enough of coconut oil.
