I usually buy them at walmart because theyre MUCH MUCH cheaper than buying them at Starbucks.  You guys are kidding, right? This is just outright greed.  I shop amazon for EVERYTHING!! Because Amazon is usually cheaper than anywhere else and because I trust you guys with my credit card info.  I cant believe you guys are charging so much for these little drinks. Seriously, you need to come down off the price.
