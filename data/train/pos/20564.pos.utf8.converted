Food snobs, read no further.  Caught an Italian acquaintance (from Milan, no less) buying this stuff at the local Stop and Shop and he did not blush or break into hives when I saw him, simply said that it had an authentic taste and was dead easy to make.  He's spot on and when you want an easy, tasty, unusual side, it's the ticket.  Our boys who are meat and spud types, love it.  Not so keen on the preservatives, et al., but doubt that it will be the cause of anyone's death.
