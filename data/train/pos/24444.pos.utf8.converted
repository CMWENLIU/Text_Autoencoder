You can make a fantastically delicious meal using these fried eggplants. This is one brand, but there are several, the best being "Sera".  Fortunately they are all pretty similar. It's so striking that that foreign eggplants taste better than the ones available here. The exception might be the Asian variety which you can sample at some great US restaurants, e.g. Mark's Duckhouse (Dimsum shrimp-eggplant) in Northern Virginia close to Washington DC; Kim's Chinese Restaurant in South Beach (Miami Beach). Kim's sauteed eggplants  is a work of art. We always go there when we are in Miami. Anyways the recipe is just to take boneless chicken breasts, put on some spices and then put the fried eggplants evenly on top, Cook in oven at 365 for one hour. You will have a very special dish fit for company.
