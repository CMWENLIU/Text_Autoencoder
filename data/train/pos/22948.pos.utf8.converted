This particular foil cutter is the BEST!  It's flexible and will adapt to any shape or size neck of the bottle, and is easy to use and cuts 100% of the foil 100% of the time.  I recieved one as a gift and didn't appreciate how good it was until I thought I'd lost it.  I got another foil cutter (the rigid round kind) and hated it.  I got another foil cutter (the rigid oval kind that you have to juggle around the neck) and I hated it.  There was a foil cutting knife on one of my corkscrews but it was dangerous and erratic in my hands. I searched department stores, liquor stores, etc. and didn't have the good luck to find another one of these...having lost the one, I didn't know a brandname and the clerks looked at me like a madwoman when I tried to describe a "flexible horseshoe thingy" to them.<br /><br />To make a long story short: the happy ending is that I found my original foil cutter in a knapsack pocket and now I can live happily ever after.  But THIS is the make and model that I had searched and searched for:  in my humble opinion, the BEST.
