I had already done the math before looking at the reviews, and I was a bit surprised by the reviews that said this is over-priced. It works out to $7 per 33 oz. unit, and if using subscribe and save (getting a 15% discount) the cost per 33 oz. unit is $5.95, (.18 cents an ounce compared to .25 cents an ounce of another popular brand) and it's free shipping and you don't have to hope there's a sale when you need it. Now how can you complain about that? I'm adding it to my cart.
