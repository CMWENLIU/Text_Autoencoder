First off, I'd just like to state that most of the negative reviews of this product are unwarranted. The title says that this is 100% Chicory, and that's exactly what you get. There is no coffee in the mix, just "100% Chicory" meant for blending with the coffee of your choice. This is reiterated in the product description. If you feel misled, then you didn't take the time to read either.<br /><br />Now, as for the product itself, Community Coffee Private Reserve Medium-Dark Roast, 100% Chicory (that's a mouthful), it's good. It's 100% chicory root, which you blend with whatever coffee you'd like. Each person is going to have their own preferences, so experimentation with your coffee-to-chicory ratio is key. I've blended it with a few Community Coffee coffee varieties, as well as several other, cheaper coffees, and I've found that a 3-to-1 ratio is best (my wife prefers 4-to-1 or higher, if she's going to use chicory at all). We use a French press, but a drip coffee-maker will work as well. Don't use anything for making espresso, such as a moka pot. I don't know this from personal experience, but apparently the chicory is much more water-soluble than coffee is, and it will really gum-up the smaller holes in those devices.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a great product, especially at the Amazon Subscribe and Save price. At 6 bags per order, you'll probably want to share, as even after giving a couple of bags away, you're getting much more than if you bought it from Community Coffee directly (while they only charge $3 per bag, shipping kills it at around $7). Blending your own New Orleans-style coffee with chicory is a much more economical and better-tasting way to do it (brands like CDM are overpriced).
