This product was just what I was looking for.  I had to satisfy a taste for truffles after vacationing in Tuscany and going through withdrawl.  This truffle cream was great and the price was the best I could find.  It makes a fantastic base for bruschetta when topped with crispy fried fresh sage leaves and pecorino romano cheese.<br /><br />If you love truffles, you'll love this product.  If you haven't tried truffles then don't - because you'll become addicted.<br /><br />I must add a comment regarding the service as well.  In the first shipment I received, one of the jars got broken.  I emailed Amazon's customer service and within an hour I had a reply that they were sending out a replacement that same day.  In a world where customer service can sometimes be non-existant it is worth noting when a company stands behind what they sell and responds so efficiently.  Bravo Amazon.
