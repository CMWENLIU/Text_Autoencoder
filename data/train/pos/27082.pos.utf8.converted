LIPTON HERBAL PYRAMID TEA BAGS -- BLACKBERRY VANILLA<br /><br />I borrowed my title from a quote from author C.S. Lewis who hit the nail on the head --  what a way to spend an afternoon -- tea and reading!<br /><br />What an awesome concept!  I love the pyramid shaped tea bag; Lipton says that this unique shape allows more room for the fruit and herbs to infuse.  And they are correct!<br /><br />This tea smells divine and tastes great.  The flavor is mellow and sweet, but not over-powering.  I drink tea with sugar -- both when it is hot and cold -- I love a hot cup of sweet tea any day and the same goes for a chilling and refreshing icy cold glass on a hot afternoon.  Our family has been known to drink an entire pitcher of ice tea in less than an hour!<br /><br />This flavorful tea worked both hot and cold for me.  The aroma -- ah, the smell of vanilla is always welcomed and the vanilla flavor is hinted at with each sip. Blackberry is a new flavor discovery for me; I love the taste!  The blackberry and vanilla flavors together combine for one sweet brew.  I love this tea and it will become a staple in my pantry.<br /><br />Hats off to Lipton for providing us with a new tea, both in looks and taste.  Bravo!!!!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Pam
