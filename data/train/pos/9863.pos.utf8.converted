Christmas Stollen has been a tradition in our family for 30 years - recently my mother and father passed away - My sister and I wanted to keep the tradition alive - unfortunately - the Christmas chore of obtaining the Stollen had always been my father's task. I live in Minnesota and all my family lived in Washington, DC - I looked online and inquired around locally - the best I found was the Kuchenmeister Marzipan Christmas Stollen.<br /><br />My Sister and I were able to keep our family tradition going through our first Christmas without our parents. The occasion was poignant,  both happy and sad; full of remembrances. The stollen was the highlight of our Christmas morning. Keeping a happy holiday remembrance fresh and joyful in our hearts.<br /><br />We'll be customers for life...
