I switched to this from Innova EVO food, because honestly, the high meat content of the EVO stuff was making the litter box odor kind of a problem. Phew!<br /><br />Everybody loved this stuff from the beginning and ate it with a healthy appetite. They've eaten this exclusively for almost a year now with good results - glossy, soft coats and good health exams.<br /><br />Don't try the new flavor in the gold bag, though, the one with Trout and Salmon? It is disgusting and my cats wouldn't touch it. I couldn't blame them - stuff stunk and make their breath stink once they finally broke down and ate it for a few days. Stick with the venison and salmon flavor in the green bag.
