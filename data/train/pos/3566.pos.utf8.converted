It's one of the big things I miss most about New York, since having moved to Colorado in April of 2007 - Bakeries. And specifically a really good Coffee Cake. Unless you are living in the heart of Denver there are just no real bakeries to be found. King Soopers and Safeway do try but then I just don't think they really know just how good a good coffee cake should be.<br /><br />Grandma's definitely fills that void for us. This is just a scrumptious coffee cake.<br /><br />I have ordered this in the past from QVC but have found the quality of it different by ordering this from Amazon. The two times I ordered it from QVC - the cake and the sample cakes were wet and mushy and nearly inedible. From Amazon it was moist - as it should be - but not wet and well - simply delicious.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this again, although I wish that the shipping charges were less expensive. I get my head around it by defining it as a treat that anyone hankering for a good coffee cake should allow themselves the luxury of having at least once and a while.
