You know, I've been drinking Coke my entire life (50years), so when I first heard that you could still find original 1960's formula Coca Cola made with pure cane sugar vs. high fructose corn syrup, I was doubtful.  I had wondered if Coke was planning such an item after the success Pepsi has had with its "Throwback" line (As an aside, their Throwback Mountain Dew is amazing).  After discovering this product already existed south of the border, I immediately ordered a six-pack just to see if there was any difference.  The executives at CocaCola state there is no difference whatsoever in the taste of the two, and, well, while the great Coke taste is very similiar, the Mexican version has a much lighter, less syrupy aftertaste, which I would definitely prefer and could easily tell the difference in a blind taste test.  In conclusion, simply, if you love Coca Cola, do yourself a favor and order this version.  Now.  You won't be sorry.
