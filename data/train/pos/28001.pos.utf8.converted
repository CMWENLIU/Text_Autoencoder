The first time I ever tried morel mushrooms was at the famous Chez Panisse in Berkeley, CA, owned by Alice Waters.  WOW...it was so amazingly good, and I'll remember that meal for the rest of my life.<br /><br />If you're currently a vegetarian, but enjoyed beef steaks in a past life, you may never crave beef again, once you've had morel mushrooms.  They're a bit pricey, but worthwhile for that occasional splurge.  If you're a hard-core meat eater, you're gonna think that you're eating beef.  Morels have a great mouth feel, where it's more steak-like in texture, and not watery, like oyster or button mushrooms.<br /><br />If you're thinking about preparing a special meal, include some morels the next time.  If you already love various types of fungi, this is gonna be the BEST you've ever had.
