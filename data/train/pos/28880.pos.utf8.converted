Now I wouldn't consider myself a honey "fanatic"... but what the hell. I have traveled the world and tried honey from all over the world. Up until now, my last personal favorite came from a hive of a good buddy's back yard in southern france. Now one day I found myself in need of some honey. I had heard that wildflower honey is good and I went with the honey sticks because I can use it to mix right into my drink.<br />If you want to know my first impressions, it went as follows: "YUMMO"<br />I would recommend this honey to everyone.
