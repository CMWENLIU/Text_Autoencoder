Yogi is a wonderful brand for herbal teas. I've just started working my way through their tea product line but, so far, all have been well thought out blends.<br /><br />Egyptian Licorice is comprised of licorice root, cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, cardamon seed, black pepper, and clove bud. This is not like having licorice candy so even if you don't normally like licorice flavor, I think you would like this tea as it is a blend of flavors as you can see and is very mild.<br /><br />However, box contains a warning that it is not for use while pregnant or while nursing. Licorice root does have some considerations as to over consumption in general so be sure and read up on it and be aware.<br /><br />EDIT: Nov 2010 - The Dr. OZ TV show has recently recommended Licorice Tea specifically as a great way to soothe sore throats.
