These little things are shaped like balls -- of which there are six in the package -- and, with their light coconut coating and goji pieces, are reminiscent of a chewy macaroon. The cocoa chocolate-ness is good but doesn't smack you over the head (meaning it's not a candy bar), and the tiny hint of spice offers just the right little zing to make these satisfying. The ORAC (antioxidant activity) in this item, in total, is sky-high -- much higher than blueberries, etc. -- so I'm delighted to eat them and give them to my family. The order from Amazon arrived as three of these yellow bags in one plastic shrink-wrap-like bag. They are much less expensive on Amazon than in a specialty health store, where I have seen them for $11 a bag. Organic, raw, vegan, gluten-, wheat-, dairy-, corn-, rice-, and soy-free, a charitable company, AND biodegradable yet plastic-like packaging? This is a super environmental/health investment disguised as a treat.
