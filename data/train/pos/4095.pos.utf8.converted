believe all the 5-star reviews, this broth is restaurant quality...I'm thinking some restaurants are using this broth???<br /><br />Make sure you buy all the additions (greens, beef slices, bean sprouts, hot peppers, siracha, hoison sauce, etc...)<br /><br />Only thing I would modify is to add more water.  It's a little salty for my taste.  Water it down.  So, one package suggests 2 gallons of water...I would add an additional gallon of water.  Or whatever you like to get it just right.<br /><br />But it is awesome, it's got the aroma of Pho, it's semi-oily at the top of the broth...I mean...good, good, good!!!
