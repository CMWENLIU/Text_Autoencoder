When it comes to adding a little kick of heat to some wings, or seafood, pizza or even a burger I turn to a brand of hot sauce that has not let me down in over 20 years of using it.  TABASCO.  What makes me stick to TABASCO pepper sauce, for some added heat, is how it adds the heat.  This hot sauce does not come across overpowering which will destroy the natural flavor of the food.  Instead it adds a sweet "kick" to your food, giving it added flavor while spicing it up a few notches.<br /><br />This product contains Distilled Vinegar, Red Pepper and Salt.  It is a very simple product that is all natural.  TABASCO "Ages" their Hot Sauces in wooden barrels like one might age a wine.  They re-use the barrels after a batch is done so with each batch the flavor continues to stay bold and get better and better.<br /><br />Is TABASCO for everyone? Probably not as it does have some nice kick to it.  However if you are a fan of spicing up the food in your life there is no better brand to have sitting around the house.  It works for almost every food product out there and I personally would say it has about a "MEDIUM" heat to it(2500-5000 Scoville units).  5 stars for a product that has stood the test of time for over 150 years<br /><br />**NOTE: If you are looking for a more "MILD" spice you should try the Green Pepper sauce.  A nice sweet green pepper flavor with very little kick (600-1200 Scoville units)<br /><br />**NOTE: If you want a more smokey flavor with your spice, try the Chipotle pepper sauce.  It goes great with BBQ or meats with a soft kick.  "MILD-MEDIUM" heat (1500-2500 Scoville units)
