I was skeptical about this product until I was on my way home during a very long business day and felt sleepy at the wheel. I stopped for a soda and thought I might get one of the energy drinks that the kids seem to like so much. While the drinks are loaded with sugar (calories), 5 Hour Energy is not. It worked and without the calories. I used the whole bottle and returned home safely in about three hours of driving. I have since used it the same way and had the same results. I don't use it regularly -- typically while driving and feeling more tired than I prefer. I have had no side effects and the lack of calories is a major benefit.
