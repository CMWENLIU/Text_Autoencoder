I was recently told by the doctor that I must follow NO SALT diet,  I found this KCL in place of NaCL  and it is fine!  I use it mostly for recipes that call for salt, and truthfully I cannot tell the difference.  I did check with the doctor, and he said that it is fine to use it.<br />The small containers are nice, as you can easily take it with you to use when visiting, at work, at restaurants, etc.
