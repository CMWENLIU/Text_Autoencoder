We've already used the Wildnerness chicken-flavor for a couple months and decided to switch to the duck (salmon next). This duck flavor is the same high-quality as the chicken we've already used. We've much healthier appearing and active dogs with a noticeably smaller quantity of very solid waste as well as a marked decrease in odor. Excellent product and rated very highly on REPUTABLE dog food comparison websites(top 2 - BB Wildnerness and Orijen). I decided against Orijen as the product is produced in Canada (USA product patron) and the protein is unnecessarily high in my opinion. The Blue Buffalo Wilderness has the best balance of nutrients and availability is an important consideration for our family. I've also used other good kibbles in the past like Canidae (so-so with an unwelcomed and spontaneous ingredient change) and Wolf King by Diamond(better but not as high-quality as BB Wilderness) and we've noticed a great improvement in our dogs' overall health. Very pleased with this product although a bit pricey for the quantity.
