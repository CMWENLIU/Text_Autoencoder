I discovered this product years ago at a local asian market.  This is a miracle cure for an upset stomach, car sickness, seasickness, etc...My husband uses it when his IBS acts up.  When I go on a cruise, I bring one dose a day and I do not need to get the behind the ear tabs that I had used before.<br /><br />Before I found this, I would have to go get the ginger root, peel, slice, and steep to get a good tea for my stomachache, but this is tons more convenient.  Besides, who wants to do all that work when you are sick.<br /><br />The flavor is very strong so I found that I like it a little more watered down than it recommends but 1 or 2 "doses" when I am feeling queasy and it is gone.
