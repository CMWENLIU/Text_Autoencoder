This is the first and only iced tea I have purchase since owning my brewer for the past year.  I put off buying iced tea due to the expense and thought how much different could it be from those cheep container mixes you find at the grocery store.  Boy was I wrong.  For starters my favorite ice tea is the half and half lemonade, and I find that these deliver the right amount of flavor, sweetness and that freshely brewed flavor I would expect from a Keurig brewer.  I find myself hiding my k cups from the rest of my family and complaining when the ice tray hasn't been refilled.  Keep in mind everyone's tastes are different and I tend to like my drinks sweet, I find the smaller tea cup setting on my brewer to work the best for this, without having to add additional sweetner or sugar.
