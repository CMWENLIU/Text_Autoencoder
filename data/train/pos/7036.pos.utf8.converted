None of that super-sugared [candied] dried fruit or flat tasting candy [e.g., chocolate] chips to mess up a yummy, but healthy snack. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate--the darker the better--but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing. If I want candy, I'll buy the good stuff.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon. My local market no longer carries it.
