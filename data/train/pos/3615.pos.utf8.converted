My family and I truly enjoy these rice dishes.  They are so easy too.  I add a little shredded cheddar cheese sometimes.  They make a great snack for after school and are superb as a side-dish or as the main course. They go great with fruit, salads, vegetables, and even dinner rolls.  Try 'em!  Can't beat the price either.
