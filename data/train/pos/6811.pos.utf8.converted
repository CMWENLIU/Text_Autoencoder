I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.
