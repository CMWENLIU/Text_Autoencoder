You can keep your spicy, deli-style, French, dijon, honey, pomegranite, yellowy mustards. I want my mustard the way mustard was supposed to be--hot. It's supposed to clear the nostrils when you've got a cold; it's supposed to have a certain sensation as the vapors rise through the nasal membranes and spread to the eyes, the ears, and the rest of the face. And I've been sorely disappointed with many mustards that claimed to be three alarm, hot, spicy, or all three and didn't even ring my bell a tiny-teeny.<br /><br />But then I discovered this little yellow heat in an unassuming bottle. Ahhhhhh! My search had ended. Mustard is as mustard does--or something like that. It seems to activate on ham and bread. A gentle aroma becomes more pungent as the mustard hits the taste buds on your tongue and in your mouth. That's when it's gustatory brilliance takes over making the ham or cheese come alive with flavor. Colman's is the way mustard was intended, to awaken the senses and jolt the central nervous system.  It might not be for everyone though. If you prefer that strange yellow sauce, honey spread, or a bottle in which you can make funny designs on your hot dog, this is probably not for you. And being a Yankee born and bred, I can almost understand how people below the Mason/Dixon line spread it on their hamburgers. I said--almost. Besides, what they put on ain't Colman's.<br /><br />It's the big mustard in the little bottle. It's made for wings, sandwiches, dips, tenders, and clearing your sinuses.<br /><br />Be gentle with it because it won't be gentle with you!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Colonel Mustard<br />(I did it in the Study with the pipe).
