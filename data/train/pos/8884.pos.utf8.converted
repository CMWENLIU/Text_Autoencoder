This is the best price I have seen for Selina Naturally Celtic Sea Salt. One taste of this salt and you will never buy the over-processed, chemically-tasting table salt again. It brings out the natural flavor of foods without tasting "salty". I love that it provides trace minerals missing from our modern, "civilized" diets. I go to a lot of trouble providing wholesome, fresh, healthy meals for my family. I'd hate to ruin them with inferior ingredients like grocery store, iodized salt. I did a lot of research on different types of salt and was torn between the pink Himalayan salt and the gray Celtic Sea salt. I think either would probably be ok but felt this salt held a slight edge as it tends to be less expensive.<br /><br />Helpful Notes: This salt arrives in a large, sealed plastic bag. It is rather moist, but that is no problem. I prefer to buy the coarse ground purely because of the price. I use this salt in three ways: in a sea salt grinder for the table, finer ground for baking, and naturally coarse for cooking. For the grinder, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OWA338">Kyocera Ceramic Fine Mill, White Top</a>, which I also purchased from Amazon. It handles this moist, course salt beautifully and never clogs or rusts, even in the humid South. No need for drying, just fill up the grinder with salt straight from the bag. For baking, I lay out some salt on a baking sheet to dry a bit, then grind it in a spice grinder. I then store it in a small glass jar. For general cooking, I like to use a salt cellar that I keep next to the stove. I just grab a pinch or spoonful as I need it. It dries out naturally a bit as it sits. I store the remaining salt in a large glass jar and take out what I need when I need it. I bought a 5 lb bag 4 months ago and at that time I filled the salt mill for the table, the salt cellar, and the jar for baking. I still have not yet refilled any of these containers, and we are a family of four with two teenage boys. This salt will last us a long time!<br /><br />I think a bag of this salt with the Kyocera salt mill would make a lovely wedding gift!
