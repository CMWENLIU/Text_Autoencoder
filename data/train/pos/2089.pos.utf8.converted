I am an iced tea addict.  I am very fussy about the taste of my tea and rarely buy any other than Lipton.  I liked the little boxes this tea is in, so I ordered some thinking I could mix it with my regular tea if needed.  BUT this tea stands alone. I really liked it very much.  Now I am thinking about trying some of the others, meanwhile I ordered more of this flavor.
