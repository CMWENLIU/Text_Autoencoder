I just discovered this product a couple days ago, and I am not the least bit surprised at how well it has been received. I bought it to put in coffee, in case I ran out of fresh milk or soymilk.<br /><br />I cannot tell the difference! It is enriched with vitamins and minerals, and the children's version is even better enriched with significant amounts of 19 vitamins and minerals, with a little more sugar and less fat.<br /><br />One caveat- this product is NOT fat-free, as Amazon.com states here. That would be too good to be true!<br /><br />I keep my Nido in the cupboard right next to the K-cups(coffee)and honey in my cupboard. What could be simpler?
