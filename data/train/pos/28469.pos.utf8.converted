I have read a lot of good reviews about coca teas and Bolivia Stores, and finally got the chance to try one of their teas. I have to say that I'm not disappointed. This is a very good tea! When I opened the air-tight bag, a strong aroma of Andes rushed out.<br />This is one of the more complex teas I have had the pleasure to taste and this deep and rich tea is one I would certainly recommend.
