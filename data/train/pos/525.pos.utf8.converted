I have been using canola, sunflower and peanut oil my entire life. But after reading about the health benefits of Extra virgin olive oil or EVOO (anti cancer, anti inflammatory,good for digestive system, bones etc ) I decided to change to EVOO. And according to the UC davis study, this brand was one of the 5 imported oils that was actually 100% EVOO and not a mixture of different kinds of olive oil. and unbelievably, this is even better than whole foods brand EVOO. And the best part is this is the cheapest of the 5 that passed this test. And I would recommend you to buy this at costco, where you can buy 1.5L for $8.99. And I have been told that if you do not have a membership, you can buy a costco gift card and use it to shop for things like this.<br /><br />[The below information is taken from: [...]]<br /><br />The other approved brands are:<br />Corto Olive<br />California Olive Ranch<br />McEvoy Ranch Organic<br /><br />And the brands found to have be fraudulently labeled as Extra-Virgin:<br />Whole Foods<br />Rachel Ray<br />Safeway<br />Newman's Own<br />Colavita<br />Bertolli<br />Filippo Berio<br />Pompeian<br />Star<br />Carapelli<br />Mezzetta<br />Mazzola<br /><br />This is the best EVOO out there and I would recommend this to my friends.
