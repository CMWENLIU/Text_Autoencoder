I'm very pleased with this grain-free, healthy yet highly-palatable dog food made with human-grade ingredients. (By the way, duck is sometimes better than chicken for dogs with alleriges.) Both of my dogs love the Dogswell canned foods. I like to buy them a variety of canned food to mix in with their dry food. They never miss a beat when it's time for them to eat. They come running everytime! A couple of folks commented on the strong smell of this product (with duck) but I don't think it's that bad. The dogs love it. Plus, I always add wild salmon oil to my dogs' dinners for their skin and coat - the Omega fatty acids are so good for them. Just because we as individuals may not love gamey/fishy smells, the fact is the dogs love the food and it's really good for them. Besides, there are plenty of products that can help with their breath if an owner feels it to be necessary. I personally have never been bothered by the smell of this dog food, and I highly recommend it. Your dog will be very happy.
