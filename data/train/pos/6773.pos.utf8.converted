Minute Maid quit selling their frozen lemon juice.  Why, I don't know, but then I needed too find a replacement and juicing lemons is too much work for my arthritic fingers.  So I embarked on an internet search for a replacement.  Lakewood Organic is what I came up with.  Of course it costs more and I have to buy a case at a time, but it tastes better and "organic" has to be a plus, right?  Yeah, I don't know either. But the bottom line is Lakewood tastes really good and it's all I can find.  If Minute Maid brings back their frozen lemon juice again, what will I do?  Well, price is more of a factor now, so I honestly don't know.  If their price were the same, then I'd go Lakewood without a second thought.
