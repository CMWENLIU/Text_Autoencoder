We started purchasing Eight O'clock Coffee about ten years ago when we saw it in our local grocery story.  We like the whole beans and also the decaf.  My husband and I have decided that it is probably the most under-rated coffee ever.  It is rich, flavorful, and exciting.  The flavor is distinct and original.  It is not Starbucks, but it is far better and much less expensive.  We have found Eight O'clock Coffee to be consistantly fresh ,and the aroma while is is brewing, literally defines comfort and contentment.  I can run around with a steaming cup in the morning and feel confident that my day is going to be just perfect. I conclude by saying that this coffee will steal you away from other much more expensive brands and you will be an Eight O'clock convert for life.
