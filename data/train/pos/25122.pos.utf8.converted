In fact, in Japan these rice would cost about $50.  But before you think most California short grain is the same, you need to try this or koshihikari.  If you don't want to spend $30 (locally sell here for around $25) then some stores sell them in small container for under $10.<br /><br />What's different about tamanishiki, koshihikari and other popular Japanese premium rice?  The grain is even shorter than regular short grain rice people are used to in the USA.  The texture is more 'plump' while the rice glitters with a very natural sweetness you don't normally get with regular American short-grain.  It has a very subtle bite on the outer layer.<br /><br />WASH your rice.  I don't know why this isn't stressed in the bag anywhere.  It's a standard procedure to wash the rice with cold water 3-4 times then fill the bowl and let the rice sit for 20 minutes.  If you're using a rice cooker you'll know this 20-minute wait time makes a difference.  I'll usually dump the water again and fill to the appropriate level and turn on the rice cooker.<br /><br />Try it for yourself though; the price will seem much cheaper when you eat these premium rice and why it's used at home and almost all Japanese sushi restaurants that offer quality sushi and dinner.  You won't be able to go back eating the regular $12 bag of 20-lb rice sold at your local grocery store.
