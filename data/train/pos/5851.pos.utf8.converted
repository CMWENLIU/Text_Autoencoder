I still have this batch "in the works" but so far it looks to be one of the best batches I have ever made. I did two modifications: I added one Granny Smith apple plus two pears (minus the peels) to the batch when I started it, and then I also stopped the fermentation when the SG was at 1.02 as the alcohol was at 14% and this left a residual sugar in it which is leaving it sweeter (used crushed Campden tablets to stop the fermentation)(I also made it about 5 1/2 gallons as opposed to 6). I am about 1 week from bottling but so far the flavor is awesome - distinct fruit flavors, cross between semi-sweet and semi-dry; very tasty. I also made a Chardonnay which also came out well, and am getting ready to order two more Vino Italiano kits. These are the best deals on the market when the free shipping is included. Highly recommend!
