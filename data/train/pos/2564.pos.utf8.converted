"Draught of the Living Death" would be a better name for this. It is freaking DELICIOUS, but seriously, don't drink it at work. I could barely keep my eyes open for the rest of the day, and only managed to wake myself up by shoving an ice cube up my nose. I fell asleep at 8:30pm, and woke up twelve hours later with no idea where I was.
