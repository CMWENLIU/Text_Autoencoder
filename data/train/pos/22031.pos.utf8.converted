My dogs go absolutely bonkers when I go to get into the bag of these.  I feel good knowing they are 100% natural too.  They break in half easily so you don't have to give it to them all at once.  I have a small dog and a large dog so this comes in handy for the small one so he's not getting too much at a time.
