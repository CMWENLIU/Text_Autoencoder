Taste: These nibs taste a bit bitter just as they should because they contain no sugar and are raw unprocessed cacao. Cacao is considered a super food because of all the vast array and quantity of nutrients they contain and this is exactly the way to eat them to get the maximum benefit. My husband can eat them straight out of the bag but if you need a little sugar with your cacao like I do you could try this: I melt some dark chocolate, stir in about equal amount of cacao nibs and place teaspoonfuls onto a nonstick surface. Place in frig and when hardened, put them in a container and stash in the frig. The taste is really good, some lightly sweetened melt-in-your-mouth chocolate with crunchy cacao nibs for a great texture contrast. You could also add them to a shake if you have a really good quality blender. You could also do a search for recipes on the internet and you'll find all kinds of ideas.<br /><br />Quantity: Just right, enough to make it worth the free shipping but not too much that you can't consume it before it looses it's freshness. My husband and I can easily go through a lb or more a month.<br /><br />Quality: Excellent, they look and taste just like the nibs I purchased from whole foods a few months ago.<br /><br />Price: Excellent, only a fraction of the price you'll pay at a grocery store or other online sources.<br /><br />Shipping: Prompt, well packaged.
