I needed alum for dyeing my hand spun wool with natural colors.  I got the package delivered at home fine and on time, but only then realized that I got aluminium sulfate (Al2(SO4)3), instead of potassium aluminium sulfate ( KAl(SO4)2.12H2O). Those two have very different properties, and I cannot use aluminium sulphate in dyeing, because it does not open wool fibers as potassium aluminium sulphate does.  According to Wikipedia, this is a common misnomer.  Adding the chemical formula would have helped me a great deal and saved time.  The package I was delivered did not have the chemical formula on it, it only had the name aluminium sulphate on it.  Also, the chemical formula was not mentioned on the website at all. Proper naming would have made my life a lot easier.<br />  The product itself was in very good condition when it arrived at home, and I was impressed how well it was packaged.
