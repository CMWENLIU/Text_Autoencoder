Meat imitations can taste awful, but not this one! Very delicious.  I haven't had it in a long time because it's a bit out of my budget, but I sure miss it.  Everytime I pass it at the grocery store, I always look at the price, hoping for a sale.  Makes a great quick meal.  Goes great with leftover rice.
