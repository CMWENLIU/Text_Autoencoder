I never thought I would actually be reviewing milk chocolate here on 'Amazon', but in this case, I just had to since i'm sitting here salivating like 'Pavlovs dog'.  For years, I have been ranting and raving about how phenomenally great and smooth 'Lacta' milk chocolate (from 'Kraft Foods' division in Greece) tastes, but I could not find it here in the states.  As a milk chocoholic, I would actually have my cousins in Greece send me a box of 24 bars about once a year, until now.  Just today, I randomly discovered this 'Milka' brand on sale at my local 'Giant Eagle' supermarket, and was 'blown away' by the taste!  My immediate reaction was that it tastes just like 'Lacta'... EUREKA!  Upon reading the label, I noticed that it is made by a division of 'Kraft Foods' in Germany.  My guess is that this is the same as a 'Lacta' bar, but it was renamed and repackaged for the German and export market.  In any case, if you love superior tasting milk chocolate, you owe it to yourself to get your hands on 'Milka Alpenmilch'.  I would rank this as the world's BEST TASTING and unique milk chocolate, or in the top 2 or 3 ever.  It's THAT GOOD!
