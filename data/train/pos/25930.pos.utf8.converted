It tastes like cream of wheat. It takes longer to cook; because it's a whole grain. I soaking it overnight in almond milk (1/4 cup amaranth and 1/4 cup of almond milk) so it doesn't take so long to cook in the morning. Add raisens, cinnamin, & vanilla and you're good to go! Great way to get your grains, protein, and fiber all in one and skip the gluten!
