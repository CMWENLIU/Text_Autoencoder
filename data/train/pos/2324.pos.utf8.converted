Can anyone explain why none of the adults on my staff, who happily gobble these up during meetings, won't eat the green ones? I can understand it with kids - but with people 34 - 65????<br /><br />Please add more pineapple Life Savers to the package and win my staff's hearts!<br /><br />What more can I say? They're Life Savers.
