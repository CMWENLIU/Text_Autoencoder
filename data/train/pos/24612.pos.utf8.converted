Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut is an EXCELLENT product.<br /><br />My gripe is with the shipment of Let's Do Organic's products through USPS (United States Postal Service), even though I have a prime account.<br /><br />As many know, the USPS tracking number is worthless; no mention of a parcel's travel is posted often for three or four days.<br /><br />Additionally, many times boxes shipped through the USPS arrive damaged or open and some or all contents missing.<br /><br />Surely, a better shipping arrangement can be made with UPS or FEDEX ground.
