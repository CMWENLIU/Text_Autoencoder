It is 17 degrees outside, I'm snuggled under a blanket with the fire in the fireplace drinking my very first pot of this coffee. Warm and smooth, it adds just the right touch of chocolate to my morning, just a hint, nothing overwhelming.<br /><br />I purchased this directly from Gevalia (along with a free coffeemaker), and they included instructions to make their coffee the SAME WAY you make yours. Since I normally use about 1/2 of the grounds that the box recommends, I fixed it my way.<br /><br />I was making 6 cups, so I added 3 TBS of grounds. Then, I had learned a long time ago a trick for getting the best flavor out of flavored coffee and put 1 tsp of sugar in with the grounds.<br /><br />My way also includes a bit of cream and sugar (actually Equal), which is how I made my cup.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the flavor is smooth, and there is no acid taste or "tummy acid" after I drank this. And, as I wrote this simple review, I drank my first cup down to the very last drop. Fortunately, there is more in the kitchen.<br /><br />Best of all, since I ordered the decaf, I can drink it day or night ...<br /><br />I never expected to give a coffee 5 stars, but this one earned the right!
