We started using this several years ago and liked it so much we tried it on my cancer dog Ray. I saw a dramatic improvement over his health since being on it. Days that he doesn't have it he almost drags himself around the house and with it he is robust and filled with energy despite his condition.<br /><br />Every morning and evening we put it in his water bowl with half the amount of water he normally drinks that way he drinks what he needs with the green juice in it with none left over. Plus I have started putting it in his raw food supplements along with shredded carrots and inside home baked dog biscuits. Thanks to this company I will have a few extra years with my Ray!
