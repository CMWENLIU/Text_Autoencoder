I've had mixed luck with Dr. McDougall's line, generally like only about half of what I have tried, but lately things have been looking up.  When I tried these, my expectations weren't great, but I was surprised.  These were really very tasty and quite easy to prepare.  The noodles had an excellent consistency and body.  The sauce was good and spicy, but not too spicy.  I could have eaten about twice as much (big guy talking here), but I found there was just enough to satisfy me for a quick lunch when I added a fruit side dish.<br /><br />The neat thing is that this is good enough that I will be looking forward to having it again.  That's pretty good for an instant noodle cup type product.  If you do the "subscribe and save" the price is competitive.  I don't give 5 stars lightly, but I think this one deserves it.  Not as good as local, but excellent for an instant product.
