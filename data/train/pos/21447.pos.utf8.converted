Bottom-Line: It's what for lunch every day.<br /><br />As I stated in my review of Campbell's Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta soup, I am a family man with the normal trappings of American society; i.e. a mortgage, car payment, insurance payments, children in school, medical bills, grocery bills, well you get the picture.  I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day sometimes in the guise of "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" in an 18.6 oz can or 18.8 oz microwave bowl.<br /><br />The soup brand, whose tag line used to be "so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,"  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber, but "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" contains a whopping 8 grams per serving.<br /><br />"Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" has 230 calories and a still low 8 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous portions of both beef and kidney beans this hearty bowl is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.59 per microwave bowl at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  However, my local Target and Jewel does not carry all of the varieties of this delicious chili, but enough so that I can partake in at least four times a month in a different flavor.<br /><br />Other varieties Campbell's offers include Firehouse Chili, Sizzlin' Steak, Tantalizin' Turkey, and Hold The Beans Chili.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br /><br />Ingredients: water, tomato puree, seasoned beef crumbles, diced tomatoes, red kidney beans, kidney beans, contains less than 2% of the following: red peppers, green peppers jalapeno peppers, dehydrated onions, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika.<br /><br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" contains 230 Calories, 8 grams of fat (including 3.5 grams of saturated fat), 30mg of Cholesterol, 870mg of Sodium, 25 grams of carbohydrates, 8 grams of dietary fiber, 11 grams of sugar, and 15 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" figures highly on my shopping list each week, even my wife likes it and she is a finicky eater.  Low in calories and fat, "Campbell's Chunky Roadhouse Chili" is a tasty alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich.  And most importantly if fills me up until my mid-afternoon snake.  Yes, the chili is a little higher in calories than other soups in the chunky line line-up, but hey a guy has to live a little; no worries.
