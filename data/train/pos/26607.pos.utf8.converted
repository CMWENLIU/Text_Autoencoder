McCann's Irish Oatmeal, the QUICK COOKING choice, is excellent and very well priced.<br /><br />However, there is a HUGE frustration!!<br /><br />Frequently, the product is withdrawn from the line-up of several McCann's Irish Oatmeal choices.<br /><br />It disappears and reappears without explanation.<br /><br />A notice should be offered regarding availability.<br /><br />I would order MORE if I knew it might be withdrawn over certain periods!!!!
