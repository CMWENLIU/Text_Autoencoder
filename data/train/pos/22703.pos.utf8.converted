Starkist Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water makes for one of the healthiest foods on your grocer's shelf. At the Amazon price it is economical, too. More importantly, however, this tuna provides you with protein, B vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 is just about the only fatty acid that is actually good for your heart. Your heart loves omega-3; trust me!<br /><br />Starkist packs the tuna in water to keep it moist and fresh for months at a time while it is in the can before you open it. You may want to drain the water from the can before you remove the tuna. This tuna, as Amazon correctly notes, comes from only the choicest cuts of the fish and it tastes delicious. While you certainly can eat it right out of the can; it mixes particularly well with products like mayonnaise and reduced fat mayonnaise.<br /><br />One caveat, however: the water/vegetable broth contains soy, salt, and pyrophosphate. If you are allergic to any of these ingredients or if you are on a salt free diet consult your doctor before eating this tuna. Starkist may make this tuna with reduced salt; and there are other brands of tuna that definitely contain less salt.<br /><br />Overall, Starkist solid white albacore tuna in water offers an amazingly healthy meal. It is especially healthy for you because it is lower in fat and cholesterol than meat or even poultry. It tastes great directly from the can; and it makes an excellent ingredient for tuna fish sandwiches with mayo or any recipe that requires tuna. I highly recommend this tuna for people who want to eat healthy foods; and this tuna fish will never disappoint mothers who want to feed their children well.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!
