This kit is perfect for those of you who are new to home brewing or thinking about upgrading from a smaller batch size fermenter.  It is just as easy to use as some of the smaller size begginer home brew kits, but it has a few more advanced tools that really let you customize and create better home brewed beer.  The products that come with the kit all seem to be of high quality and everything arrived packed neatly and in good shape. The instructions are very easy to follow and guide you every step of the way. It really isn't much harder to use than the smaller 2 gallon begginner kits. The instructions teach you the process with an easy basic, but tasty, brew. It then gives you a recipe for most of the major styles of beer.  All you will need is an ingredient kit, a big pot to brew in, bottles, and a few utensils to cook with and this kit will have all you need to make great beer.  Cheers!
