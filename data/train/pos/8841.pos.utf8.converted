I bought this cocoa powder after seeing it recommended both in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1579653774">Ad Hoc at Home</a> and in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307720497">Momofuku Milk Bar</a>. I was not disappointed by its quality. Now, every time I bake something chocolatey, people compliment me on the incredible flavor that my cookies/cupcakes/brownies have, and I know it's because of this cocoa powder. This size is an excellent compromise for people that want to buy in bulk to cut down on shipping costs (come on Amazon, please make this stuff available via Amazon Prime!) but can't use the huge boxes that are available. If you're a baker and/or a chocolate lover, check this stuff out!
