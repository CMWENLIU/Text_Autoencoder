No, it isn't quite regular ice cream.  Yes, it is a bit of a taste compromise.  But it is only 136 calories for the ENTIRE PINT so did you expect Ben & Jerry's?!  The best thing when you're in need of comfort food is tucking into a pint of ice cream ... right?  But if we do that, we all know the potential bad outcome, don't we?!  First the guilt, then the scale.  Yikes, what a duet of misery.  It all stops if you have this truly delicious ice cream.  It's tasty ... the flavors are terrific (this strawberry banana is the best IMO).  And, you can down the entire pint for about the same number of calories as a large apple.  Hmmm.  Apple?  Ice Cream?  Is there a choice here?.....<br /><br />BTW - Amazon ships it in dry ice.  Mine sat on my front porch in the heat for an entire day and was still rock hard when I got to it.  No worries about shipping.
