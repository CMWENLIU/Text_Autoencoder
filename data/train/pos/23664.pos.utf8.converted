Do you remember that old commercial from the 1970's that was later spoofed in the movie "Airplane?" A couple has just finished dinner when their host offers the visiting husband a second cup of coffee. When he happily accepts, his wife gets a concerned look on her face and thinks, "Jim never has a second cup at home," suggesting that the coffee she makes in her own kitchen must taste like swamp water.<br /><br />Well, Jim and I had that in common. I NEVER had a second cup of coffee. Don't get me wrong - I LOVE coffee, but unless I was cramming for a mid-term at 3:00am in college, I'd never found a cup that was good enough to warrant more. But that all changed when I discovered Douwe Egberts.<br /><br />I'm probably the only person here who isn't Dutch and hasn't had this coffee in the Netherlands. In fact, my first experience with Douwe Egberts was in Las Vegas - I just didn't know what it was called.<br /><br />I LOVE Las Vegas and make the trek 3-4 times a year. For the past few years I've stayed at the Paris Hotel and had breakfast/lunch in their buffet (Lunch is served at 11, so if you get there at 10:30, you can have their amazing breakfast AND lunch for the price of breakfast!) The coffee was the best I'd ever had - no kidding. I'd have cup after cup and couldn't get enough! I'd be more hyped-up and jittery than a washer on spin-cyle, but I didn't care - the coffee was THAT good! After several trips and regardless of the hotel, it got to be that I'd HAVE to make it over to the Paris - JUST FOR THEIR COFFEE. But every time I'd ask the server what kind it was, they'd never tell me. Then one trip I found a server who was from my home town. After schmoozing her for a while, I finally got her to give it up. She went in the back and returned with the name scrawled out on a meal ticket. Yes, it was this nectar from the gods, Douwe Egberts! Perfectly blended and roasted, I promise you won't find a better cup of coffee - even in Seattle. It is a bit pricey (I get this same package at a local Dutch store for $6.20), but if you think about what you pay for a "gourmet" cup of coffee at the corner Starbucks, this is a bargain.<br /><br />Take my word for it. Splurge a little and see if you don't agree with me. Or if you want to just try a single cup before you blow the whole $8 on a half pound, you can always fly to Vegas and get some from the Paris buffet which I also highly recommend, but we'll save that for another review.
