I usually do not like flake cereals because they get so soggy by the end of the bowl.  This Special K, Vanilla Almond, does not get soggy like that at all and has nice crunch all the way to the bottom.<br /><br />It also has a generous serving of actual almonds in each serving, enough to notice and enjoy them.  They are slivered so they mix well with the flakes, unlike chopped nuts that immediately sink to the bottom.  The vanilla flavor is there, but it does't overpower or taste of chemicals.<br /><br />I would describe this cereal as being a cross between granola and regular Special K, it is wonderful slightly crushed and mixed into plain yogurt and fruit -- lower cal and fat than granola, a great substitute.  I like it better than Honey Bunches of Oats because the crunchy bits are pressed onto the actual flakes and not just chunks mixed in with plain flakes, I think is why it stays crunchy in milk.<br /><br />I have a bowl of this with milk and it keeps me full and happy for hours, I think the almonds give it more staying power than most flake cereals.<br /><br />I subscribe to this product and would recommend it to anyone.
