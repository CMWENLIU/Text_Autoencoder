I started using this stuff several years ago but its availability has been sporadic until I discovered it was being sold on Amazon and then I was thrilled!  Before I discovered this stuff I was using antibacterial dish washing soap to wash my produce and it always left a soapy residue and aftertaste.  This stuff leaves no aftertaste and removes more gunk than soap.  A couple of things about it.<br /><br />1. Use it when you are ready to consume your produce because it washes off those nasty preservatives in addition to the pesticides.  Once you wash off the preservatives the produce has about a 48-hour shelf life.<br /><br />2. This is really useful for those that actually eat the recommended amount of fruits and veggies everyday.  It's too expensive for those that eat the occasional tomato.<br /><br />The bowl and strainer are a nice little bonus but not really big enough to wash more than a pound of tomatoes or a couple of bunches of cilantro at a time.  Also, for people who scoff at the idea of being so anal about washing produce that you intend to consume raw, I once washed a head of romaine lettuce and found a tapeworm in the water.<br /><br />Happy washing!
