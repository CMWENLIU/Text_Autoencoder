RiceSelect Sushi Rice is the best on the market.  Easy to prepare, never fails in the rice cooker.  The secret is in the washing....you have to do it.  This is a light fluffy sweet rice, excellant with fish, seafood and any meat.  I like to add raisins, butter, sugar and cinnamon for a late nite treat with the left overs.
