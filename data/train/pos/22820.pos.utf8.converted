Finally I don't have to be beholden to Keurig's outrageous prices.<br />Nor do I feel bad about all the packaging that goes into the trash as SF Bay's done the OneCup all eco-friendly.  I have loved buying this coffee in bulk @ Costco - now I can use the Keurig my Mom gave me for Christmas last year, Amazon & my Prime(free) shipping so this is a WIN-WIN!
