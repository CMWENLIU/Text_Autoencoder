I have been ordering Organic Valley White Lowfat Milk from Amazon for over a year now and they have become a staple on our pantry shelf.  They provide a very convenient way to give my kids a healthy, organic beverage in their lunches or on the go.  I even take them to work with me!  I really like the taste - this milk is slightly creamier than regular milk and my kids love it because to them it is like a "milkshake".<br /><br />What I really love is the fact that it is organic and hormone free - something I am paying more attention to lately and looking for when buying dairy and meat products. Organic Valley is a company that cares about it's farmers, animals and it's consumers.  Their products do not contain pesticides, non-natural fertilizers, synthetic growth or breeding hormones, antibiotics or GMO's (genetically modified organisms). They care about their animals and the land that they graze.  When you purchase their products, you can feel good about what you are serving your family and you are supporting farmers who care as well.<br /><br />Amazon.com sells this product at a great price (lower than at my local natural food stores and even large chain stores).  I save even more by ordering this through Subscribe and Save - I save an additional 15% AND have the milk delivered to my door every month (you can have it delivered every 1,2,3,or 6 months and if you run out and need more you can have it sent on demand!)  If you are a busy parent, this is an incredible convenience and I highly recommend ordering this and other commonly used items through Amazon's Subscribe and Save!
