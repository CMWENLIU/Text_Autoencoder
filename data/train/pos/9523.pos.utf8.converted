The oil itself is wonderful. It has only a subtle coconut scent, which is excellent for low-heat cooking. Although it is recommended for slightly higher heat, the risk of burning the oil is high, yielding an awful synthetic taste and smell.<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my raw vegan desserts. Unfortunately, I live in Florida, which means that the coconut oil itself is always in a liquid state when kept at room temperature. Be forewarned that in the warmer months, you will have a liquid oil, since it "melts" at 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 C). If I make a raw cheesecake, it needs to be refrigerated immediately and cannot sit on the counter for very long, But it still does an excellent job! It is also great for the hair and skin; I keep a separate bottle in the bathroom for such uses. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, and the gentle moisturizing properties of the coconut oil do not irritate my skin or pores at all.<br /><br />The only problem I had with this product, after months of receiving it, was that it was shipped to me once with an open lid. When I received the box, it was coated in oil with a sticker from the post office that it had been received damaged by them (the postal carrier would not even carry it up for me), and damaged a box of books I had shipped separately. However, Amazon was very quick to rectify the issue.<br /><br />A few other reviewers have complained that the oil "sweats" and no matter what they do, the outside of the jar becomes oily. I've been through about 6 bottles of oil over the years and have only had this problem when I didn't wipe the bottle off after use. Scoop the oil out with a spoon (don't pour it from the bottle!) and you won't have a problem.
