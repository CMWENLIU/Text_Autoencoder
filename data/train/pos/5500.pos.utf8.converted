I have purchased most of the food tek fast and fresh line.  I ordered everything with really low expectations, but thought it would be good to have the items for emergencies and traveling.<br /><br />I have been pleasantly surprised by almost all of the items, with the hamburger buns being my very favorite.  I can now mix up my own bun and microwave it for 90 secs, then toast it for a minute or two and I have the most enjoyable gluten free bun I have ever had.  I so look forward to having this bun, that it really surprises me.  It is ok without toasting, but for me, the toasting made it really delicious.  I often use this for other types of sandwiches.<br /><br />I love the fact I can have one bun, freshly made right when I want it.  I no longer have to make big batches and freeze, or buy some inferior card board like bun.
