Mackeral is one of the best fish you can eat for the Omega 3's (DHA & EPA) along with sardines and salmon.  These mackeral are packed skin and bone free....no worry about picking little bones out before you eat!  They are a delicious mild fish.  They are packed in soybean oil which I DO NOT like but it's a minute amount so I ignore that my preference of Extra Virgin Olive Oil is not used.  If EVVO can be used in the cans of boneless and skinless sardines.....why can't it be used with these??  Anyway...these are absolutely scrumtious.  The cans are tiny so I consider them one serving and they are expensive but the price on Amazon is terrific.  They are like sardines but without that "fishy" after taste.  I love sardines too so they are both a wonderful complete protein.  I sometimes eat them as the protein in my meal or sometines as an afternoon treat...right out of the can.  I guess if you don't like sardines you should try one can locally before buying the 25 pack from Amazon.  I will be buying these again and stock up when the great Roland sale returns!
