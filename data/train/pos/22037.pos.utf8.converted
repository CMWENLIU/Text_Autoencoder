This tastes kind of like the 6" disc shaped nut/seed treats that had a hard honey glaze they were sold in some stores. Every bit of space on this bar has some type of nut, seed or dried fruit crammed into it. They have a great flavor and to me taste way better than most nutrition bars. I have a problem with eating right but this helps.<br />Oh and you can find this box of 20 bars at one of the big warehouse club stores for nine dollars cheaper than in Amazon.
