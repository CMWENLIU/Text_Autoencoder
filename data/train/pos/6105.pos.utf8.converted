These don't stay in stock too long so buy them when they are available.  I waited for a year before Amazon started stocking these.  They are 25% cheaper than the local supermarket.<br /><br />Great quality and not your typical Ramen noodle.  Once you have these, you'll never go back to the 10 for a $1 Ramen noodles (unless you are in college).
