Innova Evo is bar none the best dry cat food out there and believe me, I have tried them all.  I have had multiple cats all my life and I do try to feed them a good diet, okay, better than my own in a lot of respects.<br /><br />Evo is strong in natural ingredients and low in grain, which I believe has caused a lot of problems with obesity and diabetes in our domestic pets.<br /><br />The improvement in my household is pretty dramatic.  My three cats have more energy, better coats, less throwing up, and more solid stools than ever before.  The girls, who were pretty much 'furniture with fur' are demanding to play at least half an hour a day.  So far, no weight loss, but they are eating a smaller portion (about 2.5 ounces per day for cat) and are not demanding a lot more.<br /><br />One caveat:  do not start this food abruptly.  Evo is rich and you will need to introduce it gradually.  So, start with 3 or 4 parts your current cat food to one part Evo and gradually increase the amount of Evo as your cats will tolerate it.  If you go much faster, you might give your cats diarrhea or other stomach upset.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, September 2008
