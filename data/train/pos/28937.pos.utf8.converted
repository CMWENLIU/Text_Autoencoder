This is the best of the Tasty Bite Indian retort-packaged dishes.  It is moderately spicy and has a wonderful flavor of eggplant.  It is a bit oily, like some Indian foods can be at times.  The texture is sort of creamy/lumpy because of the eggplant seeds.<br /><br />It is wonderful with a little microwaved frozen broccoli added to bulk up the meal, along with brown rice and some frozen naan.  Yum!<br /><br />This same item is sold camouflaged at Trader Joe's.
