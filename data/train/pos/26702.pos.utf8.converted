I love this seasoning on my popcorn. I have been looking for better toppings and better seasonings to have a more "gourmet" experience with popcorn. This is #1 for white cheddar. I use a premium popcorn kernel popped in an aluminum pot with a tablespoon of olive oil. After popping i toss the popcorn with spray butter and then shake on the seasoning. Yummy!
