This is great food; it has natural ingredients and is formulated to be as close as possible to a cat's natural diet. I switched my kitten to this food with NO issues, not even the smelly stools others complain about and I'll explain why. I am into body building and diet and I know that when you switch from bad food to good food, you actually need to eat less and adjust from there.<br /><br />The smelly stools occur when there is undigested (unused) protein in the stools. Thus you need to balance your cat's food intake and exercise so that he's getting enough food for his or her energy needs. Too little and your cat will definitely let you know, too much and the stools will let you know.<br /><br />I feed my cat Innova Wet and Dry food, leaving dry food out all day with one serving of wet food in the morning or at lunch time. Unless my cat has finished all his food early on in the day, I don't feed him any more of either; no matter how much he meows (it took about a week or two to change his routine). Also, if he's finished or nearly finished his food by the time I go to bed, I don't refill his bowl till morning.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend consulting your vet and watching your cat closely while adjusting his feeding. Watch for energy levels, alertness, responsiveness and overall demeanor.
