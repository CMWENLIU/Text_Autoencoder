If you are on a dairy-free diet, this quick pesto sauce is for you!  Just add the olive oil & water.  My gluten-free, dairy-free son loves this sauce on rice penne pasta.  It has a bit of a strong taste, so you can adjust the amount you use -- I personally use 1 envelope per box/bag of pasta (ignoring the instructions to use only 6 oz. of pasta).  In my local store, 1 envelope can be $2-3, and not always available, so this is a much better deal (12 packets for $15.51 plus super saver shipping) for a product we use weekly.  If you like the Knorr brand (contains dairy), you will probably like this.  However, if you are picky about your pesto (use only jarred/fresh, make-your-own) this may disappoint, you should buy just 1 packet to try from your local store before you purchase a bulk item, but it pleases my family.<br /><br />** If you have corn allergy/intolerance, this product is not for you.  One of the ingredients is derived from corn.
