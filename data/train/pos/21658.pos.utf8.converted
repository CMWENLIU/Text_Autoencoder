I was hesitant to try this powder, as I'd been adding wheatgrass to my smoothies and it definitely altered the flavor (though I could still drink them; it wasn't awful).<br /><br />Then I passed a sample table at a health food store & I poured a cup. It actually tasted somewhat pleasant. Somewhat is all I need, since I drown these powders in smoothies anyway.<br /><br />I use 1 little scoop every day. My skin is definitely reacting well -- knock on wood, no blemishes since I started with this. I also use a scoop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OHUVVQ">Whole Food Smoothie Infusion by Vega - 16 oz</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SG1H6O">Shake & Go Smoothie Vanilla Almondilla By Sequel Vega - 10.6 Ounces (300 grams)</a> . I use lots of fresh ingredients (kale, spinach or collards, coconut water, banana, 1/2 avocado + some frozen fruits). It makes for a tasty breakfast. For me, anyway. I don't like things too sweet, and I hate the sickly sweet taste of many protein powders.<br /><br />Another powder I like is Spiru-Tein Protein Energy Meal Cappuccino 1.1 lbs Pwdr (but not the other flavors, except maybe vanilla).<br />I'm happy. Loving my smoothie breakfasts.<br /><br />7/11 update: I have had an amazing healing happen that I can only figure is due to the wheatgrass (and all the greens, though I've always been a healthy eater). I had a collection of plantar warts on my heel for about 30 years. A group the size of a quarter. So pretty big & painful. Never went away. Only got worse, 'til there was also a 2nd group of warts, dime-sized. I had tried every home remedy I heard about over the years, from duct tape to banana peel and neem oil. Nothing worked. So I was resigned to a lifetime of these things & had given up on the home cure attempts. Then one day, a few months after I began upping my green quotient with this powder in my daily smoothies, I brought my heel facing me during yoga one day and all the warts are gone! I know doctors say warts go away on their own eventually, but come on, after 30 years? I'm pretty convinced it's my green smoothies and Amazing Grass. So I'm a super convert now. So so amazed by this surprise development. Yay!
