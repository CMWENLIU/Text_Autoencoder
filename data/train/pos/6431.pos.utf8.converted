Over time, I have tried to minimize the amount of salt that I use in cooking or adding to the final dish after it has been prepared.  Salt is not necessarily the healthiest part of our diets.<br /><br />However, this product adds a nice touch to dishes (used moderately). The standard salt out of the cardboard boxes is pretty bland. Grinding sea salt crystals produces a much nicer flavor enhancement.<br /><br />This is a great companion with the pepper grinder made by the same company. I still am conservative in my use of salt, but this serves my purposes in cooking much better than the normal "out of the box" salt.
