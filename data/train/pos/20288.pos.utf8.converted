I have had this starter in use for seven loaves of bread now. I keep it in the refrigerator between uses and bring it out the day before I intend to bake, feed and divide it. I decided a long time ago to treat a starter with respect but to not coddle it and this starter is right there with me each time unlike several other brands I have used in the past. This is the best starter I have ever used, I am glad my old one was lost. I live north of San Francisco and was dubious about a starter from the midwest, however I feel my sourdough bread rivals San Francisco's best in taste and texture with this one from Breadtopia!
