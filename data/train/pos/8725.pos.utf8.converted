These oats are rolled quite thick, resulting in chewy oatmeal that takes longer to cook (10 minutes) than more conventional, thinly rolled oats.  They are my favorite because of the much more substantial texture.  However, shipping charges make local bulk purchase a much less expensive option - ask for a discount on a case purchase at your local store.
