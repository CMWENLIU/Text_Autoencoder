I used to play with and chew these gum cigarettes as a kid (I grew up in the 80's). These are exactly like the ones we had then. You can blow the powdered sugar (or what we pretended was smoke as kids) out of them a few times, before peeling them and chewing the gum. Glad I could find these and share the tradition with my kid. I told her these were the only "cigarettes" I'd ever approve of...lol
