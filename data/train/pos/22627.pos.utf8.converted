The service from iGourmet is impeccable<br /><br />Everything arrived in perfect condition i.e. ripe (and therefore "stinky" just like it should be!!)<br /><br />The Styrofoam packaging was the perfect vessel for delivery; the cheese arrived "alive" from not being over chilled.<br /><br />I have not had cheese of this quality outside France, and this is the first time I have found "perfect" cheese in the US.<br /><br />If you like top quality "stinky" cheese this is for you.........
