Great and tasty tuna. Easy to store, easy to carry, and very easy to eat! A full pack runs about 200 calories of mostly protein. This tuna has a smoky, almost BBQ flavor to it and can be eaten on its own (although that's really no fun).<br /><br />If you want to take this tuna to the next level, add (1) cumin, (2) hot sauce, (3) salt/pepper, (4) a dash of paprika/coriander, and (5) chopped scallions and cucumbers. Makes for a very healthy, quick, and tasty lunch.
