I did an experiment when I bought this slightly more expensive than usual cat food. I set bowls of their current foods out. Chicken for the Cat Lover's Soul came in third.<br />EVO, which is the healthiest for one cat because it has no corn meal, became a treat/snack because it is most expensive, California Natural came in second and Natural Balance is first. However, knowing cats, if you do, this choice could change at any time because of the finicky part of the experiment. Although the full fat California naturals can be a favorite it really is fattening for indoor cats and they do not care for the low fat variety.<br />I feel satisfied because this is a healthy choice. There was one bowl that I removed from the test: Meow Mix, because they put something in it besides cornmeal and other questionable by-products, that act as an addictive. They can have Meow-Mix as a treat also, until they use of the bag.<br />So, my cats-- two adult (consenting) males and one kitten-- vote for natural Balance.<br />Thank you
