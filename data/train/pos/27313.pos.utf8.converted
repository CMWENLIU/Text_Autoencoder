First let me start off by saying that I had never eaten Halvah prior to this purchase, and boy do I wonder where I have been all this time! What a great recommendation from a friend of mine.<br /><br />These Halvah snack tastes so good that once you eat one you can't help but want another, do try to contain yourself with this snack. You've been warned!<br /><br />The packaging is nice and aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />If you're like me an had never had this before, I highly suggest you give it a try. This sugar free one is a plus for anyone who is trying to sway away from sugary snacks or someone dealing with diabetes.
