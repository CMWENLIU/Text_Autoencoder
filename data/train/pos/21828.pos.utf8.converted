I wasn't quite sure how this product would stand the test of my taste buds after trying Lotte's Blueberry gum (it it's self loosing flavor and juicy factor quite quickly)but to my surprise it tasted more like a ripe plum than i had imagined.. quite sweet and very juicy and both the flavor and the juicy factor lasting quite awhile. i must say i quite enjoyed this product and highly recommend it.
