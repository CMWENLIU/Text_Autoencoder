Most salt sold to the public is nothing but industrial waste. This salt is full of all the trace minerals and has an absolutely WONDERFUL taste. I have been buying it at the local Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage in the one pound bags but last time I went to buy it they were out of stock. So on a lark I checked Amazon and found a five pound bag available for a much lower price per pound. And it was Prime to boot.<br /><br />FWIW I do not buy into the salt is bad for you meme perpetrated, and perpetuated, by the big food companies so they can sell low sodium foods at exorbitant prices and high profits. I use more salt than anybody I know (you might guess that - as how many people buy a five pound bag of salt!) and at 60 my blood pressure runs between 113/76 to 112/73.
