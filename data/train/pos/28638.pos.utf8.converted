I grew up eating Loma Linda meat substitutes, including this item: Vege-Burger. I also eat meat, but I prefer the Loma Linda and Worthington meat substitutes when I have the choice.  To find these products in restaurants you have to find a Seventh-day Adventist school (or sometimes an SDA hospital), and patronize their cafeteria, or college snack bar.<br /><br />First thing you need to know: Loma Linda Vege-Burger is not meat.  It doesn't cook like meat - can't grill it because it'll burn easily.  It doesn't taste like meat.  It has a similar but not overly identical texture to meat (it's not as tough as meat, but is substantive which provides for chewing satisfaction; this is the biggest complaint of meat eaters: not the same chewing satisfaction as animal meat).  This vege-burger has a similar form to loose, cooked hamburger in that it's pellet like, and it'll stick together.<br /><br />The purpose of this meat substitute is to give people who prefer not to eat meat a similar and clever alternative that we can use in recipes where hamburger is used.  The nutritional value of this product is plant protein.  For any vegetarian - however you choose to define the term - there are concerns for missing nutrients from the diet that aren't provided by meat (vitamins, minerals, etc).  I'll leave that topic up to you to figure out.<br /><br />Loma Linda Vege-Burger is best, in my opinion, in cases where a well defined pellet of "meat" is appropriate.  This includes for me: taco meat, meat loaf, and chili.  I like this product very much - it's one of those staples of meat substitutes for me.  I cook with this vege-burger just like I do with meat except it's already cooked.  It's slightly delicate - fry it at a lower temperature than hamburger, and don't bake it as hot or as long as a hamburger meatloaf - just get the veggies cooked in your meatloaf - as much as you want them cooked - I like my celery and onions a little crunchy to add texture.  Oh, and in the meatloaf I like to add some pecans!  Yes!<br /><br />Worthington brand also makes a canned vegeburger (available here on Amazon as of this review 6/2010).  For me the Worthington burger is a finer, smoother grind - ie not as pellet like.  I like it especially in pasta sauces, meat balls, and stuffed green peppers.<br /><br />To your health!
