Product 19 has been a favorite since 1967. It is almost impossible to find in grocery stores so the subscription service from Amazon is a "lifesaver".  Kellogg marketing is really missing out by not being more agressive in store placement. Product 19 made a very brief appearance in my local WalMart Super Center but quickly vanished. The cereal stays firm (vs a quick soggy mess) and has excellent taste. Just all round GOOD!
