My 6 month old male Tuxedo cat likes Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, which is "Y" shaped kibble, similar to Californian Natural <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F782JY">Chicken and Rice Dry Cat and Kitten Food - 5 lb - Bag</a>. Premium Edge has a higher fat content than California Natural, and is therefore recommended only for kittens. Based on the stated ingredients and nutritional information, I award Premium Edge Dry Cat Food for Kitten, Chicken, Salmon and Vegetables, "5 Stars," even though the bag does not feature a resealable strip, which is a nice feature that some other kibble cat food bags have.
