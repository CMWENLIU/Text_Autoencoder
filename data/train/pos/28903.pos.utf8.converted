My son has many food allergies & we rely on Cherrybrook kitchen for awesome birthday cakes!  This icing is SO FANTASTIC.  However, we don't use butter/margarine.  Instead, I use Spectrum Organic Vegetable Shortening.  The frosting has a super-light flavor, reminiscent of Oreo cream!  Yum!  Can't wait to try the chocolate.
