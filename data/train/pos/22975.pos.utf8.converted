This was the BEST cup of hot cocoa. We tried the sample that came with our Keurig brewer. Use a bigger mug (to prevent overflow) and use the smaller setting for more richness. Add a dash of cayenne pepper for the ultimate rich taste. So much easier than making it from scratch like we usually do. Also MUCH better than the Green Mountain hot cocoa K-cup.
