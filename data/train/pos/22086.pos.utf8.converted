Do you love the charred flavor of Starbucks at $4 a pop for a thimbleful of overpriced swill?  Then you'll feel like a Mensa genius after trying Lavazza Crema e Aroma Beans. This price is genuinely a bargain if you shop around the internet.  Even if you're using a $20 grinder with a whirly bird blade and a Sam's Club espresso machine, your toes will curl with a brew of these beans.  No I don't work for these guys.  But if you really love your morning espresso or cappuccino smooth and hearty you'll love Lavazza. Just be prepared for friends start dropping by and mooching a fix once word gets out.
