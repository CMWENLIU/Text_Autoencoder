These are really addicting candies... so the generous portion provided here may not lasts as long as you'd think! Each straw is individually wrapped so if these manage to last for a long time they stay fresh. The variety pack has strawberry, blue raspberry and green apple. Blue raspberry stains teeth and tongue quickly and is one of the stronger flavors. Excellent value if you like sour candy (may be too sour for some little ones) but I found it to be just the right amount of sour for me!
