I have purchased this item twice in the past & thought it an excellent product at a fair price. It was $41.15 for a case of 25 items or $1.65 each. Now that amazon has raised the price to $50.65 a case or $2.03 each, it is not such a great deal anymore. That is a 23% increase in the price. Should have purchased this item in July, 2007 before Amazon decided to gouge it's customers. Oh Well!!
