I think the negative reviews are a little harsh. This company is not alone in labeling their almonds raw even though they are most likely pasteurized. Is it right. I agree no, but when it comes to almond butter no matter what your choices are going to be either organic or not. So at least you know they are being grown healthier than the alternative.<br /><br />ALL almonds in the United States are pasteurized. You can go to health food/ co-oop store and most likely find imported raw almonds ( my store has some from Italy), but if you go to Whole Foods they are also going to try and sell you "raw" almonds that are not truly raw. Everyone seems to be in on the mislabeling.<br /><br />Anyway...google it and get educated if your interested.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great tasting organic almond butter at decent price you won't be disappointed with this one. As I scanned the negative reviews I don't think I remember them commenting that the taste wasn't great.<br /><br />For what's it's worth I tried Vitamixing my imported truly raw almonds to make my own almond butter, but still doesn't taste as good as this.
