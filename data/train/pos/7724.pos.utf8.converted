I was first introduced to these candies by my Grandmother, who is Austrian.  She brought them back from her one of her trips to Europe and I was hooked.  They are small balls of deliciously smooth chocolate covering a hollow crystalized sugar center which holds the liquid alcohol. Great for gifts, entertaining or just a treat! They were very hard to find at a reasonable shipping price so thanks Amazon for offering this product.  I have ordered two shipments already and will probably need another for Christmas presents soon!
