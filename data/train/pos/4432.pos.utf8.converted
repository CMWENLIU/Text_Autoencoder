We adopted a rescued 4 month old Siamese kitten (Cosmo)in May 2008. He was really scared after being dumped at the local animal shelter with his 3 siblings, and was a reluctant eater.  After 3 weeks trying dry and canned kitten food, I bought NuVet Plus supplement and sprinkled 1/4 teaspoon on his cat food.  He began to eat better.  Then we found EVO Ancestral Diet Kitten and Cat food.  He thinks he died and went to Heaven and will not eat anything but Evo (not even treats).<br /><br />We now have four rescued cats (Cosmo the Seal Point Siamese, Missy the Tiger Tortoise, Jennie the black DSH, and Buddy the Black Bombay) and they all love EVO and thrive on it.  None of the 4 cats is overweight, and they DO NOT overeat on Evo. Velva sometimes puts down more than 2 ounces, and the excess is left in their bowls at the next feeding time.  Since Evo is very nutritious, I now sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of NuVet on 8 ounces of Evo for the 4 cats at each twice a day feeding.<br /><br />As we adopted each cat and started it on Evo, we had some diarrhea and gas.  I sprinkled a smidgen of Coleus Forskohlii and Milk Thistle on the Evo every other morning to cleanse their liver.  I pulled open the casule and used these human grade herbs that we both take each day.  Every other day, I sprinkle Soil Based Organisms (a mix of 13 probiotics) from [...] on their Evo.  Walla! No more loose stools and almost NO litter box odor!  I think it helps that we switched to Swheat Scoop natural litter earlier this year.<br /><br />All 4 of our cats are healthy and active and have soft shiny coats and beautiful eyes.  We play with them at least twice a day. We got a Drinkwell 360 water fountain about 6 months ago to make sure they have plenty of water.  They were all fascinated with the running water when we brushed our teeth and we got tired of holding our hand under the faucett for them.<br /><br />I have gone over the Innova web site in detail and they seem to be truly concerned about cat nutrition and health.<br /><br />Jess and Velva Crawford
