I am wheat/gluten free, and love to bake. I am so thankful for Bette Hagman's Gluten Free Gourmet books - the recipes are awesome, I don't find I miss much (except for "real" pizza crust and bagels - I just can't seem to find a good recipe for either!) Teff is higher in nutrients than rice, corn, or potato flours, and is very tasty. It is kind of like graham in flavor. I use Bob's brand of teff regularly in Bette's zucchini pineapple bread, gingerbread waffles, and sweet potato cranberry loaf recipes, and it is great! I really encourage celiacs and those with wheat/gluten sensitivities to do their own baking - I can't begin to tell you how much the taste is worth it compared to the gluten free convenience foods available. Yes, it takes time, and you will have to buy several kinds of flours, but it is SO worth it! WFGF convenience foods are SO expensive, the flours you buy to do your own baking will pay for themselves. Make recipes in large batches and freeze for comfort food  breads and muffins you never thought you'd have again.
