Another Amazonian recommended this brand to me, so I ordered it.  It is Really Good peanut butter, lots of crunchy peanut chunks, and not too much salt or sweetener. Also, no aerobic strenuous hand churning the oils/solids!  I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045TLSA8">Jif Natural Crunchy Peanut Butter Spread, 18-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, but it is impossible to buy locally, and the price here on Ammy has shot up to a ridiculous level.<br /><br />My next venture into peanut butter exploration will be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E32">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, The Heat is On, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>, which sounds amazing. Good company, excellent product.<br /><br />Oh, and I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E3M">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate Dreams, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>, which was smoooooth and yummy, too. Much much better than Nutella.<br /><br />So, if you like natural peanut taste and lots of crunchy bits, you'll probably like this brand.  Remember, peanut butter is one of the basic food groups, along with chocolate, BACON, and ice cream.  :D
