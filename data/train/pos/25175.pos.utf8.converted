Excellent product.  I came across a recipe for escargot in mushroom caps and was looking for large escargot.  Local markets only had smaller ones and were much more expensive then Escal.  Escargot in garlic butter in mushroom caps with grated cheese.  Placed on thin toasted french bread for balance and to soak up excess garlic butter.  WONDERFUL!!!
