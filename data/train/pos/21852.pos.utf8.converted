A pleasure to read the glowing reviews here for this truly fine brand of tay. On an average day stretched to include morning, noon and night I can honestly say I must drink upwards of fourteen or fifteen scalding hot mugs of Barry's Gold Blend and not a bit of a bother on me neither during the entire length of the duration. Milk and a lump of sugar too, of course, black tea being something of a Paddy Kavanagh-like penance for the homegrown likes of me. Barry's tea is blended in the fabled city of Cork, me old stomping ground as a matter of fact, having being blended meself as a fat wee babby in nearly the exact same whereabouts some two score and seven years ago. Cork incidentally is also home to The Butter Museum, a revered if not indeed wholly sacred institution whose existence is quite properly the pride of Shandon. It hardly needs repeating I suppose that Barry's tea and butter are big news in Ireland although to be honest I myself never ever tire of repeating it. Lookit now and this is no lie but there I was just the other day watching John Huston's The MacKintosh Man from 1973 and sure weren't bits of it filmed in the west of Ireland and anyway along comes this bus at one point and here's what was written in giant green letters along the full length of it: BUTTER IS THE CREAM. Begob but I froze that frame instamatically for to stand up and larf and hoot in a befitting manner. Ah memories! I heard tell of a relation of mine once, batty as a barm brack by all accounts, who on discovering he was out of milk one morning promptly dolloped a spoon of butter into his breakfast tea instead. Like I said nutty as a fruitcake but how's that for country cute, eh? Only in Eire although our Sasanach friends across the puddle do be drinking more tea than even us betimes and to prove it I'll leave yiz all with the following ditty from that very great Englishman Ray Davies, entitled appropriately enough:<br /><br />HAVE A CUPPA TEA<br /><br />Granny's always ravin' and rantin',<br />And she's always puffin' and pantin',<br />And she's always screaming and shouting,<br />And she's always brewing up tea.<br /><br />Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,<br />Cos he loves his leg of beef<br />And he washes it down with a brandy,<br />And a fresh made pot of tea.<br /><br />Chorus:<br />Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,<br />have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,<br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea<br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea.<br /><br />If you feel a bit under the weather,<br />If you feel a little bit peeved,<br />Take granny's stand-by potion<br />For any old cough or wheeze.<br />It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia,<br />It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time,<br />You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing,<br />Tea when the weather's fine.<br />You get tea as a mid-day stimulant<br />You get tea with your afternoon tea<br />For any old ailment or disease<br />For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed,<br />Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree<br />It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation,<br />It knows no one religion,<br />Nor political belief.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Good that, innit? You should hear the rest of the album too that that smashing little song is on, Muswell Hillbillies, bleeding masterpiece so it is. The Kinks, wha'? Right then, I'm off to put the kettle on.
