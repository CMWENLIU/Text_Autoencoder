I work in a hot warehouse 12hrs for 4 days a week and by the end of the day I am DOG TIRED! After moving boxes around for nearly 6 hours it's boring, tedious, and tiresome. What's the solution? Red Rain! I used to buy the extra strength 5hr shots, but at nearly 4$ a pop it gets kinda expensive quickly! These you can buy at walmart or any dollar store for MUCH CHEAPER!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and compare the labels! A red rain shot is the EXACT same thing as the normal 5hr shot, but at less than half the cost and quite frankly...the 5hr shots taste bad. So save yourself some money, safe your tastebuds the chemical aftertaste and BUY THIS! You can have almost 3 of these for the price of ONE 5hr shot!
