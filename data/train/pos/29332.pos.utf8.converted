I am convinced this stuff is some sort of miracle for cat owners. My cat used to use the compressed, recycled newsprint litter (like Carefresh or Yesterday's News) and I thought that was good, but then I read about Feline Pine and decided to give it a try. Well, there is simply NO SMELL AT ALL. I live in a small studio apartment which I thought was forever fated to smell like a litterbox, but with the discovery of Feline Pine, which absorbs all of the ammonia  odor, you don't even know I have a cat unless you see her. The tracking is noticably reduced and there is much less mess. I highly recommend you try this stuff - my cat made the switch with no problem at all, and it's been completely worth it for both of us (my apartment doesn't stink, and she doesn't inhale clay dust.)
