I have been to NOLA twice, and both times drank as much Cafe Du Monde as possible.  Make it 50% coffee (I use a french press) and 50% hot whole milk.  I get mine at the local asian market for $3.65 a can but this price is fair for the coffee, and it is simply the best, full chickory taste.  Great with grits in the morning too!
