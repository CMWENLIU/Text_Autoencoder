For years I used the stuff you just bought at the grocery store.  I always felt it was "o.k.", until I was at a friend's house, and she was using a really good grade of vanilla, and I realized I wasn't limited to whatever the grocery store was selling.  So I decided to see what Amazon had for sale, and came across this vanilla.  My first purchase was the set Totonac has, with the three different vanillas.  One was from Mexico, one from Madasgar and one from Tahitia.  While they are all good, we all really liked the flavor this one gave to whatever I was baking.  So, when I ran out of the set, I just purchased this one vanilla, since it was our favorite.  The price is right, and you get 3 bottles, so I felt that while it is more than I would likely spend at the grocery store, I don't think it is a whole lot more, and we like it so much more!  If you aren't sure which vanilla to buy, I think you might like this one!
