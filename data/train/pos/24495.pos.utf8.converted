I'm the primary grocery shopper for 2 households. My dad's and my own. I switched to this salt a few months ago and we've been using it in place of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKQWK">Hain Pure Foods Sea Salt -- 26 oz</a> for table salt and cooking in those months.<br /><br />It's been a success. My dad has his doubts about the color and "dirty" look of it because he's used to standard white table salt, but the flavor convinced him. The rest of my family didn't have the reservations he had.<br /><br />The flavor is wonderful, and it's doesn't have the chemical taste that iodized salts have. It's fine enough to work with my salt shaker and I haven't noticed any caking issues.<br /><br />My daughter really loves the flavor, as do I. My husband doesn't notice a flavor difference and uses it happily.<br /><br />It has some of flavor profile of more expensive finishing salts with a price for every day use. I'll still use my coarse and flake salt for candy making and other things where presentation matters, but for every day use and cooking, this is my new salt of choice.
