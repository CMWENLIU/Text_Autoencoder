I have a pretty picky cat, but she loves this cat food. I love it too because it's in small cans, so the leftovers don't sit in the fridge for more than a day. No off flavors or smells get a chance to develop. My cat absolutely hates the pre-formed chunks, shreds, etc. She only likes natural fish flakes, and that's what this product provides. The only thing similar is Trader Joe's 100% tuna. It's a great buy, but you need to live near a Trader Joe's, and the cans are larger. So sometimes I'd have to throw out the leftover food because it didn't get eaten fast enough. A local pet store carried the Tiki Cat Ahi Tuna, so I was able to purchase it there. Sadly, they've stopped carrying it, but I'm happy to have found an internet source.
