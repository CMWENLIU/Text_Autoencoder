Okay, I first came across the "Fiber Gourmet" brand from a vague Google search for "low calorie pasta". I'd previously bought into the shirataki noodle craze and while I admit--calorically speaking--shirataki have EVERYTHING else on the planet beat hands down, I quickly tired of the stuff mainly because I knew I would have to chew the heck out of it before swallowing, lest It Come Out Looking the Same Way It Went In ('nuff said there) and for the cost of each bag (the store brand I found in the tofu aisle was roughly $2.50 ea and the Miracle Noodle brand from online is essentially the same for 8-9 oz bag) my diet was getting pretty expensive eating 2bags a day 4 days a week. I ate shirataki by the bag, after all...<br /><br />So when I happened across the Fiber Gourmet website, I simply bookmarked it and went along my way. Finally, after a couple more weeks of laboriously chewing shirataki, I decided to give it a whirl and ordered from the official website. I have to admit, the first time I tried the Light Spaghetti pasta I wasn't exactly bowled over and that was because I was actually mixing the Fiber Gourmet noodles with another, lower sodium (but still 210cal/srvg) noodle brand and honestly wasn't seeing much of a difference--on the scale or satiety-wise. However, in the past couple weeks I went back to my case of 6 boxes and tried them again, this time wondering why in the world I didn't like them first time! I stopped mixing them with the other noodle and most times have either exactly the 56g serving size or 84g (1.5 srvg) and mix it with veggies, spices and low-sodium/calorie glazes (Captain Rodney's Sweet & Spicy Pepper Glaze being my fav). For a treat I'll throw in a couple ounces of Morning Star Farms fake chik'n strips.<br /><br />The best part about the Light Spaghetti is how absolutely filling they are. I've taken to having the above-described dish for lunch and honestly I don't feel hungry again until several hours later. 18g of fiber is just ridiculous (per serving) but I'm so glad it's there because you really don't need much of the noodles to get satisfied. That's one thing these have over the shirataki. Another is the whole "chewing element"; I found I don't have to count 32 chews (literally; I actually did this w/ the shirataki) before swallowing. Fiber Gourmet also cooks dang close to legit pasta. I found that really leaving them on the stove boiling for a while (over 20mins) is best and you can tell from sight when they're ready. I haven't managed to overcook this pasta yet.<br /><br />But above all the pros, I have to say that the fact they fill you up is the best. I'm on a low calorie diet so having that extra 70 cals/serving these spare you really helps. My faux-lo mein:) meal described above is around 250-395 cals depending on whether I add any meat to the pasta. Since I don't need an afternoon snack on the days I eat Fiber Gourmet for lunch, I can save another 100-150 there for dinner.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend having these more than once a day or having more than twice the serving size on account of how much fiber is in a serving but so far I've had no intestinal issues whatsoever (TMI?). Oh! And even though I bought my first case from the Fiber Gourmet website I'd highly recommend buying them here from Amazon--when I saw the case for $16.92 WITH PRIME S/H I was sold and ordered immediately so I won't have to go even a day w/o these. I paid about $20 for the case from FG's site and then about $7-10s/h on top of that so the deal is DEFINITELY here. Since I've incorporated the FG pasta into my diet I've dropped almost 3lbs in 10 days whereas shirataki 4 days a week had me at a statistical standstill. I highly recommend FG's pasta if you want to taste noodles almost exactly like the real thing and can't stand the thought of life w/o a past dish like I can't:)
