This is my daily breakfast of choice, higher in protein then Oatmeal, and tons of fiber. It's an acquired taste (a little earthy), and can be a little "soupy" but I cook it with a tablespoon or so of oat bran for thickening. After cooking, I add a little agave nector for sweetness, and ground flaxseed, bee pollen and/or whatever else I have handy; I have even added a scoop of whey protein for additional benefits (vanilla works great!).
