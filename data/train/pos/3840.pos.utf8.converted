Wow - this stuff sells out fast -- I no sooner got an e-mail from amazon saying it was back in stock than when I went to order it, amazon said there's was only 1 left in stock so I was able to grab the last one this time ---- the same thing happens at the grocery store: they get it back in stock and it sells out right away.<br /><br />This has a wonderful aroma when you open the container. It's a slightly citrus smell and you can smell the spiciness of the pepper. The definite plus - and the reason I gave it 5 stars - is that there's no salt, no MSG and no added sugars. It seems most seasoning products have salt and sugar listed as some of their main ingredients - why pay an arm and a leg for salt and sugar?<br /><br />Mostly I use this on fish and chicken although I have used it on pork tenderloin when I'm going for a more citrus flavor for the pork. One trick I've learned is that this stuff tastes even better if you can soak or marinade it and let the dried herbs blend and come to full fruition in some sort of liquid -- my favorite is white wine. That's definitely not necessary as it's good just as good if you just shake it on top of food, but the "soaking" seems to blend the flavors really well.<br /><br />Ingredients contain (per 1/4 teaspoon) no calories, no fat, no salt, no protein, no carbs, no nothing. Here's what's in it as listed on the container: onion, spices (black pepper, basil, oregano, celery seed, savory, thyme, cayenne pepper, coriander, cumin, mustard, rosemary, marjoram) garlic, lemon juice powder, carrot, citric acid, lemon peel, natural lemon flavor, oil of lemon, turmeric color, chili pepper. Just so you know, there's a definite peppery flavor or taste to this.<br /><br />Being an old lady, I really watch my sodium intake (as well as sugar and fat)and use these types of products on a regular basis.
