I have a couple of old herniated cervical discs from an injury (nursing is physical). Have been taking 1 Tsb of the gelatin every day for about 3 months and the stuff is a miracle. No more neck pain, increased range of motion, no more grinding when I turn my head, all my joints feel great and my skin has never looked better. My 75 yr old mother-in-law also started at the same time and she no longer has knee pain (she was going to have bilaterial knee replacement). She couldn't even climb the stairs without horrible grinding and knee pain. No more. Please try this stuff before having any type of ortho surgery you will not be sorry. Takes about three to four weeks of DAILY use to see results. One more unintentional bonus I lost 5 lbs and she lost 20. Win, win, win!
