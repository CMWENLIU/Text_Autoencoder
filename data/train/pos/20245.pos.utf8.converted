My local stores have not been stocking Red Oval for a while and I ran across a review in the San Francisco Examiner that asserted that expert tasters rated several imitation 'stoned wheat thins" as better than the original.  This is a poor excuse for a blind tasting, but the expert foodies with cast iron palates decided that several imitations were better than the original.<br /><br />Since I have trouble finding Red Oval, I decided to give the ubiquitous Wheatsworth, ranked number two behind Whole Foods, a try. Gag me. They are truly awful. I wouldn't serve them with aerosol Velveeta, let alone a pricey Humboldt Fog. They are chock full of superfluous ingredients, thus failing the Occam's Razor test AND they contain too much salt, sugar, and honey. They had no cracked wheat texture whatever and a mouthfeel more like Graham Crackers. If these were intended to imitate the Red Oval product, they did a darn poor job of it.  I think they are snack crackers and should not be compared to adult food. I guess the tasters liked sweet and salty.<br /><br />So, I did what I had to do.  I threw out the Wheatsworth and ordered a 12-pack of my 35 year favorite, Red Oval Farms Stoned Wheat Thins.
