Believe me, once you've had a Blenheim ginger ale, you won't settle for anything less.  I've hunted far and wide, tried all of the local ginger ales and beers as well as the exotic, "designer-label" ones.  They all disappointed.  Some, admittedly, have a tiny hint of "hot" (Reed's Jamaican ginger ale), but that's all it is--a mere nuance.  Even Blenheim's "medium hot" version is guaranteed to knock your socks off (probably best for beginners to start with that "plenty heated" one rather than the one explicitly named "hot" by the company.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the price of the drink plus the postage make it cost-prohibitive, except for the addicted (which I confess I'm not).  Until Amazon makes Blenheim Ginger Ale available through Amazon Prime, I'm simply swearing off ginger ale altogether.
