Super Easy, Great Taste, & Gluten Free. I know...seems like an oxymoron... I heat water, milk, butter and season packet in a microwave safe dish for 3 minutes, then add the noodles, and tuna and cook for 15 minutes (up to 20 depending on microwave). There are also stovetop instructions.  This is great for travel too as you can cook it in a microwave and skip the butter and use powdered milk (reconstituted).
