As a big cereal fan I like to try out new products (especially when on sale :). I am very happy to have picked this one up! The cereal is similar in taste and shape to Cap'n Crunch, but the pieces are smaller and more wholesome (made with Kashi's 7 Whole Grains).<br /><br />My general criteria for cereal is that it should have a reasonable amount of fiber and less than 10g of sugar. This particular cereal has an even fiber/sugar ratio (6g each) so you know it is healthy. The honey taste is great and hits you right away with each bite.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who want a healthy cereal with a better taste than Cheerios or Oatmeal.<br /><br />Peace, Ben<br /><br />Eph 3: 20-21
