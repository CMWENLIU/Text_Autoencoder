I spent a long time trying to find these Healthy Edibles for puppies.  They are good for puppies 3 months and older.  I really needed something to keep my puppy busy during our meal times.  However, most products (even puppy products) are for puppies 6 months and older.<br /><br />I was able to find these (after searching high and low) at Pet Smart.  I found them after I had already ordered on Amazon.  These are expensive on Amazon, so shop around your area first.
