I'm surprised by the review "T. Bates" has left because I think these Nairns dark chocolate chip oat biscuits are delicious.  I have to wonder if s/he has had oat cakes before, because, if so, s/he would have known to expect a somewhat rough, rustic, hearty, and not overly sweet biscuit.  These are nothing like the typical cookies one can buy in American grocery stores.  I love the rich grain taste and texture and the subtleness of the dark chocolate chips.  These are more of an "adult" European biscuit and less of a true cookie.  They are definitely something good for those of us looking for a less processed, different cookie rather than the same old tired options available at the supermarket.
