We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.
