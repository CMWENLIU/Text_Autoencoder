If you have a nut allergy (or any other food allergy for that matter), this is the only extra virgin olive oil that I have found that is free of cross contamination.<br /><br />The spout on the bottle is great! I've never seen a spout like this. It pops up for easy pouring, then when you put the lid back on it goes back down without any effort. No more adding a pour spout and leaving it uncovered.<br /><br />The flavor is so rich and wonderful I find myself putting it in everything. I'm so impressed by it that I just received my first order of their pepper infused oils today to try out in my next curry.
