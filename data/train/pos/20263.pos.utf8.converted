is my favorite tea.  The bags are individually packaged so they travel well.  This is one of the stronger Oolong teas and may take some getting used to.  Once your tastebuds adapt, you may not want to drink any other tea.  I have tried many of the other so-called "best" Oolong teas and Oolongs promoted by "experts."  I always come back to Bigelow.<br />My corner store has been sold twice over the past 7 years.  The company that owns it now quit stocking the Oolong, so I am very happy that I can still purchase it through Amazon!
