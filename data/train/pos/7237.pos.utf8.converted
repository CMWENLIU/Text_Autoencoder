MMMMM, this stuff tastes so good! Just kidding!<br /><br />In all seriousness, my 8 year old Red-Nose Pit Bull several years ago, began getting bumps all over his body. After several thousand dollars in vet visits and steroid medication, (he had some sort of  white blood cell condition) the doctors told us to start feeding him more protein and no carbs. I discovered this food after searching online and reading the numerous good reviews. After about a month on this food, his condition cleared completely! Now I feed the rest of my dogs (3 total) this food.
