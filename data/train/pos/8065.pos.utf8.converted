I LOVE this soup mix and use it often as a marinade for chicken. Easiest recipe: Spray a 13x9 inch pan with Pam. Slice peeled potatoes paper thin and line the bottom of your pan with two layers of your potatoes. Put boneless, skinless chicken over the potatoes. Take two soup packets and combine them in a bowl with 1/3 c. olive or vegetable oil and about 1/3 c. water; mix. Pour marinade over chicken and then bake entire thing for an hour. SO EASY AND SO DELICIOUS! Every time I make this, I get nothing but compliments; it's even my husband's favorite. Lipton nailed it with this one and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves garlic and zesty spices.<br /><br />This was also a pretty good deal since the packets can sometimes be difficult to find at the store and usually aren't on sale for less than $1.50. I'm very happy with my purchase!
