I've made a lot of bread in my day, worked my way through college in a bakery from 1100 to 0300 hrs, and this is one of the easiest and best sourdough breads that I've ever made.  Caution:  I recommend that unless you are an experienced baker, use the "basic" bread machine setting on your machine.  It always comes out perfect and tastes just like you would buy in San Francisco.  You can make it by hand, but unless you know what you are doing the results are less then the excellent product that will come out of your bread machine.  This mix is equal to your own sourdough starter made bread, and that is saying something in this day and age.  A terrific product if you like sourdough bread and do not live in Northern California.  (Oh yes, have to add that you  need to make sure the water you use is at specifically 80 degrees.  Warm tap water will do the trick too.)
