Our Maltese puppy loves this food and it is good for him. He was on another food and was scratching all the time. We switched to the Wellness Super5Mix Puppy and within a week his scratching has stopped. The pieces are small size perfect for a small bread puppy.<br /><br />We plan on using Wellness dog food when he is older.
