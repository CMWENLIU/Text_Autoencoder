I discovered this in a specialty store in Seattle and was immediately smitten.  It's absolutely delicious on egg dishes (try it on a homemade egg and cheese breakfast sandwich!) and turns ordinary buttered popcorn into a culinary masterpiece.  Here's the catch -- my husband *hates* it.  LOATHES it.  The smell alone makes him push his own truffle-salt-free dish away because he can't get the scent out of his nose.  So now I'm reduced to using my precious find when I'm home alone with the dog.  Thankfully he doesn't seem to mind it.
