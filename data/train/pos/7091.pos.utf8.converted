On a friend's recommendation, I tried one can of Verve.  I was skeptical because it was carbonated, and I've given up sodas.  Simply put, I drank it to be polite.  The taste was refreshing and the carbonation was very light, but still too close to soda for me to be comfortable.<br /><br />The big surprise was that the next day, I wanted another one.  I even felt like I needed it.  This has only happened to me once before, and that was when I juiced carrots/apples/celery for the first time.  I began having moments when I craved carrot juice, usually in the afternoon.  The same thing happened with Verve.  I felt like I needed the vitamins/minerals it provided.  The bad news was I had no idea where to buy it, and my friend was out of town on business.  Because of my lack of curiosity the previous day, I had to get on the phone and calling all over town to find it.  Annoying.  I did find it, and now I keep a week's supply in the refrigerator to drink one every day.  I am a HUGE fan, and feel like it is part of a healthy routine.  It has mangosteen, and that alone is a reason to drink it.
