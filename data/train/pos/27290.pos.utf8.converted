These beans are in great shape (very whole, look good) and are vacuum-packed really well. I have had other cacao beans (from Trader Joes) that were very dry, and I THINK a bit easier to eat because they were more crunchy/crackley where as these are a bit fresher, with a hair more moisture in them so you taste the bean more -- at least it seemed that way to me.<br /><br />I think that means these are fresher, but really, everything else about "should I get these" boils down to your ability to eat cacao beans.<br /><br />The taste is not for the unprepared.<br /><br />If you have some bakers chocolate laying around, go try that to get the idea. There is nothing "chocolate" about these (for folks that aren't familiar with cacao beans). These taste a lot like eating giant, burned, acidic, coffee beans. The taste is sharp and I find it pretty unpleasant.<br /><br />I do have friends that eat raw cacao a lot (health nuts) and think it's a "good" taste.<br /><br />If you are already familiar with cacao and are trying to decide on a bean, I'd recommend these. As state the beans are in great shape, very whole, well packaged and seem to be quite fresh. No stale/dried out taste.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't get these again just because I think I hate cacao beans, not because there is anything wrong with these beans.
