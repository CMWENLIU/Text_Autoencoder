I couldn't understand why one of my dogs had almost daily diaherra but finally read that dogs find cornmeal difficult to digest - and it's in lots of different dog foods! Well, a trip to a fancy pet store yielded lots of samples for me to try on my dog and Taste of the Wild was a quick hit - loaded with protein -30% - any no grain at all. Corn is nowhere to be seen o\in the list of ingredients but bison, venison and fruits and veggies sure are. Naturally you have to pay more for such goodness - lots more - but my dog's digestive system is now fine and Taste of the Wild is the reason.
