This is my favorite go to dinner when I want something really tasty, but really easy and fast.  My favorite way to make it is to bring it to a simmer and add chicken breast, so that it cooks in the soup.  Sometimes we add a small can of corn, and sometimes, some fresh basil shredded on top at the end.  It's absolutely delicious!!!!!! Enjoy!!
