I was very happy to find this product on Amazon. As living in a small Midwest town, I don't have access to a health food grocer like Whole Foods Market unless I drive 1 hour each way. Only mushroom I can buy locally is regular mushroom, but now I can keep this in my pantry for whenever I need to use it in a recipe. I just made a Pasta with one of the packs and that was great! Just enough for 4 people, and the mushrooms are ready to use after soaking them in hot water for 30 minutes. The left over liquid can be used to make a recipe like cream of mushroom soup or something as it has great extract from them. Considering they are organic, price is good for me. I also bought Shiitake and Matsutake too.
