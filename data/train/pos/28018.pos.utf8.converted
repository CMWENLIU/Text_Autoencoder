Never heard of it. Did some research and decided to try it. Extremely satisfied with my choice! I went for the "Light" version since my research mentioned that it was the one with no strong after-taste. Much better, natural choice than artificial sweeteners. Does have calories, but the glycemic index response is very good; translation: it doesn't give you that "sugar rush". I like things fairly sweet, so I use 2-3 teaspoons per cup of coffee. You may need less. DEFINITELY get the 12 pack!!! Best value and you'll be amazed at how much you start using it!
