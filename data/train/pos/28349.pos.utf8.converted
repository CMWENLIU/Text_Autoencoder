Truvia tastes more like sugar than the blue, pink, and yellow packets; and it does not leave an aftertaste.  In some, excessive Truvia intake can cause digestive distress; but this has not been my experience to date.<br /><br />1) The blue packet turns into formaldehyde at 86 degrees.<br /><br />2) The yellow packet claims to be made from sugar - - - but - - - it involves a five-step process that substitutes three chlorine atoms for three hydroxyl groups - - - and it breaks down into chlorine when digested.<br /><br />3) The pink packet was delisted as a carcinogen, but it is made from an organic molecule out of petroleum.<br /><br />4) Truvia is made by steeping (like tea) the leaves of the stevia (an herbal shrub) to extract steviol glycoside rebaudioside.  This is combined with a sugar alcohol (made by fermenting glucose {simple sugar} with yeast).<br /><br />To sweeten my grapefruit, my choices are products that are basically:<br /><br />1) formaldehyde<br />2) chlorine<br />3) petroleum<br />4) leaf extract, simple sugar, and yeast<br />5) refined sugar<br /><br />Formaldehyde and chlorine give me migraines.  Petroleum is a nonstarter for me, and refined sugar has the most calories - - - which I do not need.  The phrase "all natural" doesn't impress me because snake venom is "all natural"; but all things considered, I'll take number four.<br /><br />I'm also looking forward to trying Sprite Green and Odwalla Reduced Calorie Quenchers (with Truvia), all the while hoping that Classic Coca Cola Green will follow.
