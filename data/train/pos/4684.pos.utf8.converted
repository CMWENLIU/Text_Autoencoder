Irish blend from Twining has a pleasing crisp taste, just a bit spicy, fragrant and hearty, not so robust as a Kenya, but much more than a gentle Darjeeling. If you have tried Twining's English Breakfast blend, you should expect this Irish Breakfast blend to be stronger and more complex in flavor, but with similar brewing properties.<br /><br />You can buy Irish Breakfast blend either in teabags or as loose bulk tea. I strongly recommend the latter for greater flexibility, but the bags taste just as good -- no flavor that I can detect from the paper that Twining uses.<br /><br />Twining produces some excellent teas, none better than this fine blend. It has my strongest recommendation. It is also available as a decaffeinated tea, with very much the same delightful taste.
