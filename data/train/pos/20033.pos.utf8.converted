I love love love these! They are great as an afternoon pick-me-up when I want something sweet tasting but have eaten healthy all day, and don't want to spoil that. I'm not diabetic but I do think it's important to eat as if I were, who needs all the sugar found in regular everyday snacks and drinks. These are so full of flavor--coffee/espresso combined with chocolate is always a winner; sweetness comes from the use of Agave, a low glycemic choice. The other flavor I go for is the Cranberry-Orange Spice. All the choices are great because they have the healthy basis, with Omega 3's and Fiber, so I don't have to scrutinize each box/flavor like with some brands. I even brought a box of each flavor to share at a family gathering because half the group is active and the other half is not, and these are good for both!
