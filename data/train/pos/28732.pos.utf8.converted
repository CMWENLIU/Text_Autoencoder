This is an excellent stock! I am so very pleased with the simplicity of preparation and the taste. For those who are salt restricted, this may not be the product for you. There is 730 mg of sodium in one cup once prepared. That is very high. Knorr should consider producing a low sodium stock. I purchase many products by Knorr and I have yet to be disappointed. I made a chicken noodle soup. Thanks to the stock, the soup is delicious. I even boiled my noodles using one of the containers of chicken stock. This definitely added to the flavor of the soup. So, if you are not salt restricted, purchase it. You will not be disappointed.
