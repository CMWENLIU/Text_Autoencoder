I am a tea drinker and generally do not try new stuff and have stuck with the old lipton for years. But then a friend recommended the Dilmah range and specially their premium tea.<br /><br />I tried it and am hooked. Its so refreshing i could not believe it. Now my morning starts with a nicely brewed cup of Dilmah premium tea. Its just too good to leave now.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this tea.<br /><br />Go have a sip...<br /><br />Thanks.
