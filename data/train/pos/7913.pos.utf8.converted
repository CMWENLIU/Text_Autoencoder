I found this at Costco and got one to try. It really satisfies the "crunch" craving of chips but is also somewhat chewier akin to jerky. The ingredients are simply: organic apples & organic cinnamon so there's *nothing* added. 58 calories a serving makes this extremely guilt free.<br /><br />I'm one of those who sometimes has to snack on something while watching TV. Because it takes a little more time to chew them, I can give in to the (bad) urge to eat to just be chewing on something and still not eat that much in a sitting. And its all healthy. Great fiber.<br /><br />Just one word of caution: as tasty as they are, don't eat very much at first because it seems to expand in your stomach a little so can cause a stomachache if too much.<br /><br />I'm happy to see that Bare Fruit has partnered up with Amazon to provide a way to order this online for reasonable amount. Especially as I discovered yesterday that my local Costco only has them on a closeout basis (when sold out, that's it). They're selling the 14oz bag for about 40c/oz but 57c/oz on Amazon is still worthwhile as I'm not buying other pricy junk foods anymore. I look forward to trying the other baked dried fruits from Bake Fruit.
