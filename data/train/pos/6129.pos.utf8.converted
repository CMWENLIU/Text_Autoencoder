I struggled with my Rhodesian Ridgeback Mix Muriel and the allergies and sensitive stomach that she inherited.  We tried other premium brands such as Wellness, Canidae, Inova and even made our food until we found Nature's Variety.  It was actually recommended to us by a vet who specializes in dogs with allergies.<br /><br />Since we started feeding this fantastic food 4 years ago Muriel no longer gets hives, upset stomach or ear infections.  Her coat is glossy and she is as energetic as a puppy even though she's almost 9 years old.  We also feed Nature's Variety to our 2 cats and our other dog Gilbert (English Fox Hound Mix).  They love the chicken instinct but we rotate through the other flavors available and add Nature's Variety Canned and Raw frozen food (Available in a variety of flavors: Rabbit, Salmon, Duck, Beef, Lamb, Bison and Venison).<br /><br />I'm Lucky enough to know the owners of some of Muriel's Litter Mates and am Happy to say that I have made converts of some of them. Their dogs no longer need allergy shots or suffer from hives and upset stomach. As for the ones I haven't converted, I'm still working on them.<br /><br />But don't think this food is just for dogs with problems, this food has changed the health and lifestyle of all our pets.<br /><br />A word of caution this is a very nutrient packed food, no fillers. So you feed about 1/2 as much as you would of many other dry dog food.  See the Nature's Variety Feeding Chart at [...] to figure out how much food your dog or cat needs.
