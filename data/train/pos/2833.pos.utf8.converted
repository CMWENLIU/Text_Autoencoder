After attempting to use Wilton food writers on candy melts (successfully, but difficult and very spotty), these AmeriColor food writers are a dream! They're so smooth, and make perfect, crisp lines. Plus, the tips are very flexible, so lines can be thin or thick, depending on the amount of pressure applied. I use them for candy chocolate-covered cake pops, and plan on keeping a supply of these markers on hand at all times!
