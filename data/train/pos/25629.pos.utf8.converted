This is a great product when used for what it was intended. It is not made to use as fresh sour cream on potatoes and the like. It is intended for baking or recipes like dips. It does not mix well straight into water, you add it with the powdered or dry part of your recipe and add the water with your other wet ingredients. I love powdered products and sour cream powder is a real convenience when you are out and need it.
