I get this and a whole bunch of other food items for my husband every year at Christmas time from foodireland- a huge order of food and it always arrives in perfect condition and nicely packed- it's always a nice treat and like the other reviewer, my husband is from Ireland and he really appreciates all of his favorite breakfast items especially during the holidays! Most especially the puddings and the rashers which we can not find in our local store. I like those rashers too, so I make sure I get extra of those. and there is nothing better for your toast than a nice fresh irish butter. foodireland is a great company!
