The winter of 2006 found me searching for food items in this price range to add to my order, so I could advantage of a "Special" that Amazon was offering.<br /><br />When I came upon these, I decided that they would make nice additions to Christmas gifts as the tins are so attractive.  Upon receipt of the order, one of the tins was dented.  I decided to go ahead and open the dented tin, since it wasn't pretty enough to be a gift.<br /><br />The prepared cereal from that dented tin was so delicious that I ended up giving only 1 tin away - I kept the others for ME!  I gave that tin to my Sister.  After my Sister tried it she immediately tossed the oatmeal she had on hand, and placed a double order for this!<br /><br />This oatmeal is full of flavor, has a great chewy texture, and is so filling.  It is also much more nutritious than rolled oats.<br /><br />I can't believe how we (in the USA) have had only "rolled oats" on our breakfast tables!  Where has this oatmeal been?  What do the US companies do with the good stuff they remove to be able to roll the oats?  This real oatmeal is nothing like the gooey stuff we were forced to eat as children, and as adults eat to try to lower our cholesterol.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself (and your friends and family) to place an order.  I guarantee you'll never go back to the guy with the funny hat!
