I just ordered a case of this mix and a Muffin Magic appliance from Amazon.  I had them delivered to my job since I'm not home during the day to accept deliveries.  In just a few minutes I had the Muffin Magic plugged in and the Whole Wheat Wild Blueberry muffin mix prepared.  This box, which says it makes 8 muffins, made 6 muffins in the appliance.<br /><br />Everyone loved them.  They're not overly sweet, but sweet enough so they can be eaten plain.  They would probably be excellent toasted with maybe a little butter and/or jam, but they didn't last long enough to find out.  Everyone ate them warm, right out of the Muffin magic machine.
