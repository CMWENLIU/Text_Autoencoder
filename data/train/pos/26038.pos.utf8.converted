These are the best crackers we've tasted in a while: they are flavorful (and quite delicious!) unlike some brands that taste like cardboard, they do not crumble and/or break easily, so they arrive in perfect condition and are not messy.<br />The shapes (zoo animals and birds) are very cute too and the price is decent (I paid less than $7 per box using Subscribe and Save).<br />They do not contain milk ingredients and are *not* manufactured on the same equipment as nuts, so they are safe for "peanut-free" classrooms and for people with nut and milk allergies. Each individual package is large enough to share. :)<br />All that combined makes these crackers our preferred snack. Both kids and adults in our family enjoy them.
