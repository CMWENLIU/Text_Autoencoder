I'm relegated to eating low-sodium for the rest of my earth-bound life, so most baked goods were either severely limited or totally off-limits.  But not any more!  This product has re-opened the door to a plethora of baked goodies.  Be sure to pay attention to the instructions and double (at least) the amount of product you use in recipes.  If the recipe says use a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, use at least 1 teaspoon of this substitute, maybe even a bit more. And, like some of the other reviews point out, because this product starts working RIGHT AWAY as soon as it's wet, add it last ... i.e., just before putting your recipes in the oven.<br /><br />Other folks have complained about the price and the fact that you have to use more.  My response: I don't mind. I'm thrilled that this product exists and allows me to eat foods that were previously on the "do no eat" list.<br /><br />Is there a taste different?  Very slight / hardly noticeable.  Do I mind?  No. I'm just glad to have something that gives me more options.  The mere fact that this product (a) exists and (b) actually works means I give it five stars.
