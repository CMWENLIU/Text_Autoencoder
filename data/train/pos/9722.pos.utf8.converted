I have been using Joseph's Lite Syrup for over a year, have introduced it to many of my friends and all who have tried it, love it. It's thick syrup with a real sugar/maple taste.<br /><br />After a local store dropped this product, I purchased two cases here through Amazon/factory direct for my friends and family. What I received is 12 leaking bottles with loose lids and 3 of them over half empty. I think Joseph's expects this because the outer of three shipping boxes was lined with a heavy plastic bag. The bottles read, refrigerate after opening, so for all I know, they are all spoiled.<br /><br />Joseph's has not responded to the E-mail I sent to their customer service and that is most frustrating.<br /><br />In summary, Great Product, but Joseph's doesn't care once they have your money.
