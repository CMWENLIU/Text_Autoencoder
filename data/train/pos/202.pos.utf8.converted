Though this micpreamp has several weaknesses, I give this 5 stars because it's just perfect for what I do.<br /><br />I've been finding ways to record vocal in convenient way with good quality. Everyone told me I'm suppose to get audio interface for good vocal recording, but audio interfaces always ended up with frustration.<br /><br />After seeing several reviews of Icicle, I was going to return this, but once I used it, I don't think I want to return it anymore.<br /><br />This preamp is way beyond my expectation.<br /><br />However, like I mentioned above, it has weaknesses so this might not be a solution for many people<br /><br />1) it has no headphone jack for direct monitoring<br />2) no asio driver<br />3) only one input<br />4) does not look strong so always be careful<br /><br />If you are a person like me who just to need to record vocal conveniently using easy software like cool edit or audacity, you won't regret.
