We have been buying these chips for awhile now.  My son who is on a gluten/casein free diet is able to eat these and just loves them.  The taste is excellent and they are not as bad for you as traditional potato chips.  I would recommend them to anyone...they do have other flavors such as sour cream and onion and hot if you want to try the different ones.
