When my husband and I lived in Nashville TN, we stumbled across these in a Fresh Market store. I quickly fell in love with them due to their low calorie refreshing fruity flavor. I would often have them after a meal as a palate cleanser or in place of gum during the day. When we moved to VA, I could not find them ANYWHERE.<br /><br />All of a sudden they showed up on Amazon for a great place and I have my JOLS again!! The forest berry was the only kind I had ever had before however now I am a huge fan of the orange as well. If you are a pastille fan or like "Ricola Pearls" you will be a big fan of Jols!<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for bringing back my must have candy as they are incredibly hard to find and expensive everywhere else!
