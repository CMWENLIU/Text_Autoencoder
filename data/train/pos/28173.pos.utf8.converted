I selected the Plato treats due to the natural ingredients. Wow, my pug Ponch LOVES them! I currently have a bag each of the duck, salmon and chicken. When we get home from our walk he runs straight to the kitchen and runs in circles waiting by the fridge for his treats! These are the only treats I'll buy.
