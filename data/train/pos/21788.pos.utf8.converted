For some reason, known only to the powers that make such decisions, this bland, Twinings Prince of Wales Tea is not longer readily found on supermarket shelves.  You can still find it in variety packs, but It has been sometime since I have been able to find a whole box of the stuff.  That is a pity, but as I am what you might call a "tea hoarder," I had two boxes in my stash and was rationing it slow out.  You can imagine my delight when I found you could purchase this product through Amazon!<br /><br />Prince of Wales tea has a nice robust taste but no bitterness.  It is one of the few teas I can (if I so desire) drink without adding some sort of sweetener.  It never use mild or cream as my wife does, so for me that is a nice factor.  I simply like the flavor of this tea.<br /><br />Twinings has been around (It is based in England) for a bit over 200 years now and there is a reason for this...they provide a fine quality product.  We are constantly trying new teas as we locate them, but it seems that over the years we keep coming back to this brand.  Now as has been noted by another reviewer here, this stuff is NOT packaged in England; it is packaged and distributed here in America.  This does not magically change the flavor of the tea though.  Tea is tea is tea.  Tea is NOT grown in England, so to say that tea that is packaged in England is better than that packaged in America is simply codwollop!  Yes, you might get "stale" tea here, but I doubt it. If you keep your tea under proper storage conditions, i.e. out of the light, no moisture and away from heat, it will last quite some time...I can assure you that the producers do this simply because they want to sell you the best tasting product possible. We in this country may not be as adept to brewing tea as our English brothers, but I doubt it.  No, the difference in the taste is more than likely all in the drinkers head.<br /><br />The biggest problem I have and the biggest problem I have noted in our country when it comes to drinking tea made using tea bags is that we seem to be a very, very impatient people.  We simply do not, generally speaking of course, do not let it steep long enough.  A tea such as the one being reviewed here needs to steep no less that three minutes; preferably at least four.  I find myself getting in a bit of a hurry at times and end up drinking very weak and rather tasteless tea simply because I did not wait long enough.<br /><br />Note:  Cost wise, this is on the rather high end for tea bag tea...in my opinion it is quite worth it though.<br /><br />Anyway, enough of my babbling...this is a good tea.  Is it the only tea I drink or ever will drink?  Of course not.  3/4s of the fun of being a tea drinker is continuing throughout life trying different blends and brands.  I will say though that I most certainly have not grown tired of this stuff...yet.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks
