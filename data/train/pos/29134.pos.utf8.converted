One day over 20 years ago I detected a wonderful smell in my kitchen and it turned out to be some Nature's Burger mix + water being prepared by one of my house mates. He was letting it soak in preparation for frying. Eventually I bought some in bulk at the local market and I've kept some on-hand ever since. Occasionally I make a Nature's Burger instead of a hamburger when I have the impulse. Since I only make this occasionally, I keep the mix in a bottle in the refrigerator to ensure freshness. It seems to stay fresh for years if kept this way. Today I glanced at the list of ingredients posted where I buy it in bulk for $2.99/lb:<br /><br />1/4 cup (47 g) Nature's Burger:<br /><br />170 calories<br />25 calories from fat<br />8 grams protein<br /><br />I figure that these burgers cost less than 1/3 of meat burgers, are very tasty and nutritious. What's not to like?<br />- - - -<br />Feb. 24, 2011 edit:<br /><br />Today I went to replenish my supply at the Berkeley Bowl and see that the price/pound has been jacked up to 4.29. Argh! So, I inquire if they have the boxes (I remembered that buying it at Amazon was barely more than the bulk at the Berkeley Bowl), and was directed to where it would likely be if they had it and sure enough they had a selection of various Fantastic Foods products in 10 oz boxes. The price/pound was about the same as bulk, so I got a box. Currently, Amazon's price (comes to 3.33/pound) is easily the best I can get so I'm buying 12 boxes here.<br /><br />This is cheaper than ground beef, and I figure better for you in a lot of ways, though it's probably a bit lower in protein content. Anyway, it's quite delicious and easy to prepare. Lately I soak 2 oz in 3 oz water for a few minutes. I don't bother to use my hands to form patties, I just scoop it out of a rounded bowl using a rubber spatula and press down with utensils to form the patty right on an olive oiled cast iron skillet. Fry on one side and press lightly with a spatula to flatten somewhat after turning, then fry the 2nd side. I like them between toasted whole wheat bread slices with a little mayo and some lettuce and perhaps a slice of red onion.<br /><br />Edit 3.11.12: Lately I think these are definitely on the salty side, but I'm still eating them very regularly. I get a box of 10 boxes sent to me every 3 months, it's 15% off that way, with free shipping. I'm now adding 10% by weight of egg whites powder and storing in a bottle, once I open a package. This adds some protein, and the fried patties come out nicely. My formula to form a patty is to boil 2.6 oz water and pour over 1.55 oz of this mix, stir, and after sitting about 30 seconds, pour onto a hot skillet, flatten a bit, fry both sides over low-medium heat.
