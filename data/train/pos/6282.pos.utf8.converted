I love the original Republic of Tea Ginger Peach flavor (a black tea), and came to Amazon looking to renew my supply. I've also been drinking more green tea recently for health benefits, and when I saw these two great things together in one tea, I had to try it. Hooray, I'm so glad I did! It's fragrant and delicious, as much of a treat as the previous version. This is not the loose-leaf kind, it's in cute little round bags, and the container is solid and seals out moisture so your tea stays fresh for a long time. Just opening the tin and inhaling the aroma is almost intoxicating. This is an indulgence I don't have to feel one bit guilty about.
