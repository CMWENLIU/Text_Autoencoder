I'm back again, to buy this unrefined Sea Salt, Barry Farm---after finding that this unrefined sea salt is the only one of Four, including 2 known name-brands, that has benefited my family's health! One of the biggest benefits for my family, lowering high blood-sugar counts. If that hits home with you and your needs, look into Googling--The Sea Salt Diet and chat with your doctor. God bless you. I hope you see health benefits, too. Note: you must have true "unrefined" sea salt. There are shams with no shame, out there. Many retailers claim that their product is better as the "true unrefined" sea salts because they are colored "gray/grey." I fell for that. My health benefits steadily dimmed. Their assertion is only an empty advertiser's tagline. I've paid dearly for another brand's high-priced unrefined salt and saw my family's health benefits favorably respond. My wallet/purse says buy from Barry Farms....my wallet/purse likes the extra bucks that stay behind. As for shipping...we received this product well packaged to survive whatever the Shipper-process put its box through. Great!
