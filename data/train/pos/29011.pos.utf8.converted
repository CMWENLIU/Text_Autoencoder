I have tried other products; this is the best deal and the best tasting.  I put it in oatmeal, other hot cereals, tea, hot chocolate, veggies, gravies, and also cook with it.  I must warn you to start out slowly, maybe 1 teaspoon daily.  It has detox properties and if you take too much at first, it will cause you to detox too quickly.  I also use it daily on my skin, including my face. If you want more information, just put a "Coconut Oil benefits" search in Google.  You can't beat the price of this oil through Amazon with their free S & H.
