I make homemade pasta every Sunday and I recently gave Bellino Semolina a try.  I was really impressed with Bellino's Semolina flour when making linguini.  Normally when making pasta with a hand crank roller and cutter I need to use half Semolina and half white flour but with Bellino I was able to skip the white flour all together.  It's easy to work with, has a great consistency and has a great taste.  I highly recommend this product.  The ingredients I use for my homemade pasta is one bag of Bellino's Semolina flour, 4 extra large eggs, 4 tablespoons of Olive Oil and 1 teaspoon of salt.
