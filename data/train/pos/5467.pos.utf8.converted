This bar is unbelievably good. The flavor and texture share no relation to the original 3 Musketeers bar. The blurb on the wrapper does not lead one to believe it would taste like a modified original bar. The airy, crisp wafer tastes like the meringue wafer in a German chocolate truffle cookie I used to be addicted to - in fact, the bar itself tastes very similar. The truffle cream is rich but not too sweet and the combined textures just make the bar. Love it!
