This item worked great. I just installed an additional 300' privacy fence. Bought 1300' of 17 gauge wire with this system and set it all up in one day (appx 800' installed). I tested on myself and got a good zap to see what my dogs were about to expirence. I have a german shepherd, lab, and rotweiler. Now none of them go near the fence or try to escape.
