I had been trying to make GF cornbread from scratch with limited success. Now I don't have to! Tried this for the first time and it is excellent. Only had to use 1/3 of the bag for 6 muffins so, at $2.50 per bag, it's not at all expensive. Now I can make casaroles with cornbread topping, etc. I also am not fond of the Bob's mixes with the bean flour (taste really funny and beany) but this one is a keeper.
