I am on my second 5 Lb bag of beans from Palouse, and I will keep coming back as long as the price is consistent. The quality of the beans is high: they are delicious, cook well, are packed nicely, and arrived with Amazon Prime shipping-speed (two days). I don't take advantage of the QR code identifier (to see which specific fields the product comes from), but it's a nice touch, and builds my trust in Palouse, the manufacturer.<br /><br />Palouse is now my preferred option for both these garbanzo beans and brown lentils.<br /><br />Also: I have found one pebble going through 7.5 Lbs of beans--this is a very good ratio, and means they properly sift through their beans before packaging them. Worth the price.
