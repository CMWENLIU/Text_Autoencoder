The product arrived in a timely manner. It has a nice flip open cap with a squeeze nozzle type deal similar to mustard or ketchup. The oil is a rich green color. I've used the oil on pasta (it has directions to make a salad dressing on the bottle) and I like the flavor a lot. The flavor is kind of a warm, rich, nutty kind of flavor. What I bought the product for was not for food though. I bought it for my read dry skin on my face. I got really bad sunburn last summer on my face and it's been flaking ever since on my cheeks. So, I squirt a little bit on a sock and rub my face with it! The flakes of skin come right off and it helps my skin. It hasn't given me acne and this oil miraculously does NOT clog pores. I shaved my head and gave myself a mohawk but I noticed I had really bad dry scalp on the sides and it was disgusting. I treated my head with this stuff for about a week and now it doesn't have any flakes and is completely healed... my face is being stubborn though... the sun really cooked it last summer. If you're looking for a healthy product for your face and your food then buy this stuff... it's great!
