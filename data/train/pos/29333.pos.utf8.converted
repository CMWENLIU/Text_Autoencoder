Ever since I was a baby kitten, rescued from a busy street and parking lot, my lady owner has been squawking about my litter smell.  The nice guy who rescued me, smelled the litter box but didn't want to complain...cause he just loves me.  We are cool, we're real buddies.  But oh, that lady in the house, she tried everything to get me to stop stinkin'.<br /><br />I begged the nice guy to clean it up so mean lady won't get rid of me!  Every day he cleaned my box, but it still didn't work.  And sometimes he didn't remember too good and ohhhh the smell was baddddd.  Even for me.  And each week they hauled in different kinds of litter for me...still no good!  She hated the smell and swore to the man that I would have to go. Ow... Meow!  I could just hear her nagging voice:  Clean up that damn litter box!  I got a little scared every now and then.<br /><br />Then one day she heard about Feline Pine.  The pellets were little strange for me to get used to, but I was willing to do anything to keep the mean lady happy.  Then, I couldn't believe my whiskers.  There was no smell for weeks.  The pellets started turning to sawdust.  And there was no smell, same litter for two weeks or more!  Meow, Meow.<br /><br />I am happy, my nice man is happy cause mean lady is happy and a sweetie now.  All because of Feline Pine.  Lex
