This cornbread mix is so good, I serve it to the whole family and they have no idea it is gluten-free.  It actually tastes better than the grocery shelf cornbread mixes I had made and eaten before my diagnosis of celiac disease.<br /><br />The cost is compatible with most standard mixes.  I make muffins with the mix and they store well in the refrigerator and can be warmed up for another day without losing its texture or flavor.
