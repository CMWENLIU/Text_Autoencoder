My sweetheart, Ansel, is a very spoiled Bengal cat. He does love this for his wet food. He hates most other wet foods. The pate ones he will not even touch. This is just real meat with a little bit of broth, but not like a gravy.  As far as my part, I like it because it's not a lot of filler and junk. He will eat the other foods, but then he horks them up, so what's the point? My only issue, and I did not dock stars because it's not the product...but I used to be able to get this at a really decent price on subscribe & save. Now the price is so high [really. a dollar thirty nine each?] I can get them at Walmart cheaper, usually a dollar twenty four.  If I watch my sale flyers, I can get them for a dollar sometimes and I stock up cuz a buck a piece maeks kittymama happee! kthxbai.
