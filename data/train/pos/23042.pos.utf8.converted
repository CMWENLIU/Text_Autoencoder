I almost feel bad that I'm not giving this product a five star rating.  Our baby is breastfed but also requires supplementation with formula.  At a time when every night at 8pm sharp colic was driving our infant into a 4 hour inconsolable torrent, and after trying many different formulas and remedies, switching the formula we used to Enfamil Gentlease drastically improved just about every part of our lives.  Finally, with more sleep, we were able to enjoy and build our relationship with our little girl.  And, most importantly, we didn't have to watch her suffer every night.<br /><br />I only worry that the first ingredient is sugar.  All of the other organic formulas bring back her colic, but I would have preferred  a product in which corn syrup was not used, or at least not the first ingredient.<br /><br />But the outcome is what counts, I guess.  On this formula, I must say that our baby has thrived.  She is healthy and happy, so for that reason I would highly recommend this formula.
