My son was found to have lactose intolerance when he was 4 weeks old. The doctor switched us to Similac Sensitive Fussiness and Gas (the orange bottle) which helped a little but didn't help him completely. I then switched to Similac Sensitive Isomil Soy and he was like a whole new baby! The constipation quit and the unstoppable crying stopped all together. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone! I got a great deal on it and love the fact that it was ready to feed, no more mixing!
