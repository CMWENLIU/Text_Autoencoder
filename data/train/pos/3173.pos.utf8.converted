This 16 ounce order from SweetGourmet surprisingly came in a transparent, thin plastic bag, like it was packaged from bulk or something. Gourmet licorice contains licorice oil that smears the inside of the bag, so it looked pretty ugly by the time I opened it (I had intended to give it as a gift to someone who loves licorice). However, it was the SOFTEST of this brand that I had ever had, even softer than the ziploc bags that have the Kookaburra name and logo on them. I think SweetGourmet has the best price to weight ratio for this item, too. I will certainly order from them again.
