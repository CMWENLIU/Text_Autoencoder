This was my first time ordering casings on amazon, and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Previously I've ordered sausage casings from Butcher Supply stores, and while the prices were agreeable, the casings were clearly designed with large quantities of sausage in mind, and usually arrived in large bags of saltpack, tangled up worse than a rats nest of TV cables.<br /><br />These however, come neatly packaged in a small, re-usable and re-sealable pouch. Any excess casings can be tossed back in with some kosher salt and be re-used quite easily.<br /><br />The casings also come pre cut in 10ft long strips which are just about the right size for stuffing small batches of sausage. Cooks looking to make batches greater than 5lbs will probably be turned off by this, but for someone like me who only has a kitchenaid mixer for my sausage stuffer, it's just the right size and length to work with.<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic product, and I'll be ordering more soon.
