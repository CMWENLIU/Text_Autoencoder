We all know we can't afford Innova or Orijen, which is one of the best foods you can possibly feed your dog. A lot of people buy Iams, myself included, for our dogs. Then there are the people who continue to buy Beneful and Old Roy and Pedigree and don't realize that you are basically buying corn, which your dog cannot digest and will essentially poop out! So you are just throwing your money into fertilizing your yard! LOL Dogfoodanalysis.com has a great rating system and reviews all dog foods and rates them with stars. 6 being the highest. To put this into perspective, Iams is a 1 star dog food, based off of its ingredients. This food, Chicken soup for the Soul is a 4 star food. Blue Buffalo is also a 4 star food, but costs twice as much! Iams sells at Walmart for $17.88 for an 18 pound bag so .99 a pound. I would typically feed my dog 2 1/2 cups of Iams. This food, as of the time of this review is $39.99 for 35 pounds,so $1.14 a pound. And I would only give my dog 2 cups. Think about it, if you ate fillers all day long and food with very little nutritional value, you are going to eat more. But if you ate food with more substance, that was healthier, you would actually eat less. This is the same for dogs. So many people run out and buy Kibble and Bits because you can get a huge bag for $10, but you end up feeding your dog 3-4 cups and blow through the bag in a matter of days. They don't realize that if they buy a better quality food, you actually feed your dog less. Not to mention they would be on a healhier diet.<br /><br />I think for the money and the quality this is an excellent dog food choice. It's middle of the road, not insanely expensive, but not super cheap. And the quality is far above par in my book.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, ocean fish meal, cracked pearled barley, whole grain brown rice, oatmeal, millet, white rice, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), potatoes, egg product, tomato pomace, duck, salmon, flaxseed, natural chicken flavor, choline chloride, dried chicory root, kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberry powder, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-carnitine, Enterococcus faecieum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D supplement, folic acid.<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein 24.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fat 14.0% Minimum<br />Crude Fiber 3.0% Maximum<br />Moisture 10.0% Maximum<br />Sodium 0.3% Maximum<br />Zinc 150 mg/kg Minimum<br />Selenium 0.4 mg/kg Minimum<br />Vitamin E 300 IU/kg Minimum<br />Omega-6 Fatty Acids * 2.2% Minimum<br />Omega-3 Fatty Acids * 0.4% Minimum
