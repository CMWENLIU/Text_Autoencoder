These are standard gumballs found in most gumball machines. Nothing fancy here in colors or flavors, but they are an excellent deal for the money. The box isnt too ridiculously huge. My supply only lasted about 6 months, and when I was done I never wanted to see another gumball.<br />Great for kids if you can trust them to not leave the gum under the table or chairs.
