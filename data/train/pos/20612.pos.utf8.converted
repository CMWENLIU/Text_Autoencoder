Before these were sold out in our local Target, we've managed to buy two packs of these cookies and they were quickly consumed due to their deliciousness!<br /><br />The cookie part is your standard Vanilla Oreo, of which if you've had them before, they have of course a warm pleasant vanilla taste. The cream, contrary to other reviews I've read, is actually pretty good with it's vibrant half orange, half yellow coloring. The taste is near spot on and sweetly delicious with candy corn flavor. This is verified by me actually eating Candy Corn some time before eating a few of these cookies and then eating some candy corn roughly a bit later (Yes, Candy Corn is the favorite of my family!). The taste of the cream was unmistakeable Candy Corn as advertised! It was surprising to me at first as I just expected them to be a Candy Corn colored variant of the standard Vanilla Oreos. A wonderful surprise indeed!<br /><br />If you have a serious sweet tooth, these cookies are irresistible and you might find yourself constantly munching one. Plant one of these packages amongst a family and these will be gone quick (trust me, I know...).<br /><br />I will say that sugar tolerance varies from person to person, so if you couldn't already tell from all of the bright colors on the packaging, these may be a bit too sugary for some tongues, but for most others, these are definitely a treat to enjoy.... that is if you can get some before they sell out in your local Target or elsewhere!<br /><br />Bravo Nabisco, this was a wonderfully fun idea to put into cookie form. I'm almost sad that they are limited edition though...
