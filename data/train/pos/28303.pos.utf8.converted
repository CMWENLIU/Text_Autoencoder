My mother made this cake for me, actually it was her birthday but she wanted a cake that I could also eat. I can't speak to the taste of this particular batter because I didn't make the cake, but from past expereince I can't say I have ever tried a gluten free batter that tastes good.<br /><br />But the cake itself is great. Six of us tried it and everyone thought it was wonderful and very moist. I am the only one who eats gluten free so that means this cake has the approval of five "normal" taste testers.  It was especially good with some coffee ice cream and homemade chocolate frosting.
