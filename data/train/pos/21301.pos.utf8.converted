My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and needed a gluten-free vanilla with great flavor.  This fit the bill for both.  The flavor is excellent and can be used with all the receipes we make.  It lasts about as long as the other quality vanilla's and has a rich flavor that really enhances the resulting cake, cookie, candy, etc.  I wouldn't go back to using any other brand.  I'm very pleased with the product.
