I order Panang wherever I go but never knew there was a Panang curry paste.  I'd been looking for Panang recipes on the web and discovered the paste.  I came straight to Amazon (the best company ever invented!) and ordered this paste immediately.  Two days after receiving the paste, I made Chicken Panang Curry at home, yum!  I can't say enough how grateful I am to have discovered how simple it is to make at home, how glad I am that Amazon carried the product and how delicious it is.  I live on an island and finding exotic spices etc is not that easy.  If you enjoy curries, try this one!
