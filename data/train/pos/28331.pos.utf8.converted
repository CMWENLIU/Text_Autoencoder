<span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>VIDEO REVIEW:<br /><br />In the video, I show how I mix up Prowl, what it looks like, plus my three cats are shown eating it.<br /><br />Her Highness Serena, Oliver the Tabby Kitten and my Siamese the Wonder Kitty say, "Purrlease enjoy the video!" :) My kitten Oliver gets a small amount of Prowl because he is on another food currently and will be transitioning to Prowl shortly. Enjoy the video! :)<br /><br />My (written) review: ;)<br /><br />Basically, this is to help anyone introducing Prowl to your cats for the first time. Once your kitties get used to Prowl, you can mix it up to different consistencies. :)<br /><br />I received a sample in the mail from Prowl before purchasing my first box of Prowl. This sample turned out to be very helpful, as the sample was for making one portion of cat food. The sample was "1 ounce" or "29 grams" to be mixed with "1/4 cup water." All three of my cats -- my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair, my two-year-old finicky eater Siamese, and my six-month-old golden tabby, loved it.<br /><br />Then I bought a two-pound box. The directions say to mix 1/4 cup warm water with 1/4 cup Prowl.  Imagine my surprise when I weighed 1/4 cup of Prowl with a food scale and discovered that it only weighs 23 grams and, when mixed with 1/4 cup of water, makes a very watery soup that my cats turned up their noses at in disgust. Thankfully, I had kept the empty sample packet as a reference.<br /><br />I measured 29 grams of Prowl on the food scale, the same amount that was in the Prowl sample packet. To that I added 1/4 cup water. This time, the consistency came out perfectly, and my cats loved it.<br /><br />The "Happy Cat" ratio is: 1/4 cup Prowl (Sample Packet Prowl) i.e. 29 grams of Prowl to 1/4 cup water, and one way is with a food scale. Or you can mix your Prowl up a bit thicker and that will work just fine, too.  What my cats taught me is there is quite a difference in Sample Packet Prowl (29 grams) and the 1/4 cup "Directions On The Box" (23 grams).<br /><br />NOTE: The video mentions food scales, but you can just add extra Prowl if you don't have a food scale. :)<br /><br />My cats find this food very tasty (as you can see for yourselves in the video!) Enjoy your healthier cat! My cats are reaping the benefits and I can't say enough about this food: less shedding, less allergies, and my cats' overall condition.<br /><br />However you get there, I hope you find the purrfect "Happy Cat" ratio for your cat on Prowl!<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> There is no snooze button on a cat who wants breakfast. &lt;&lt;
