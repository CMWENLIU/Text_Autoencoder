These are excellent.<br /><br />Dried beans are significantly more healthy (and economical) that canned beans, and the difference in flavor and texture is *amazing* - truly! I should also note that organic beans are smaller in size that non-organic varieties, as they have not been modified. Often people are surprised and may mistakenly find these inferior, but that is not the case.<br /><br />Clearly there is more time involved in preparation, but a few months ago I started doing the following, which may help others:<br /><br />I dedicate a certain time to 'bean cooking.' I'll use 3-4 *very* large containers and soak 3-4 different varieties. Note that for the sake of efficiency (time saving) I do not soak a single box - I generally soak 3-5 boxes, or whatever the total included in each varieties' respective Subscribe & Save order is.<br /><br />After all beans are soaked, all beans get cooked. I don't have an arsenal of extra large pots, so 1-2 varieties may need to be cooked in two batches due to my cookware availability. However, since the most time consuming part of preparing dried beans is the soaking, this really doesn't take very long and other things can be done whilst these simmer away on the stove. Some people enjoy using crock pots for dried beans; my own experience is that I have less control over the quality and the end result is not as good.<br /><br />As the different varieties are cooked & cooled, they are divided into two (2) cup portions and placed directly into individual packages for the freezer. (The portion size is a very personal matter; we happen to have a large family/entertain a lot.) Depending on what's on hand/not in use, the packaging may be Rubbermaid containers/ziploc bags/pressure sealed. I prefer not to dispose of plastics, so those are turned inside out & run through the dishwasher to be re-used. Works beautifully.<br /><br />The individual packets defrost beautifully in the refrigerator overnight, or in a pinch using your microwave's defrost setting they're ready to go in less than two minutes. Using great quality beans has enabled us to cut down significantly on the amount of meat that we consume, and high quality beans make vegetarian dishes satisfying and filling to the most ardent meat lovers - unlike canned varieties. This preparation process makes meal planning a *breeze* and ensures that very healthy food is always on hand - at an excellent price.
