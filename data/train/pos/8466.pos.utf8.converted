Delicately sweet, these Roland white peach halves are packed in sugar and water, the old fashioned way, with NO corn syrup, so the natural flavor of the peaches shines thru. (About six halves per can.) They are perfect right out of the can, or try making upside down cake with them (instead of pineapple) adding a touch of cinnamon. Wonderful! A great Summertime lunch, too, served with reduced fat cottage cheese. We also make individual luncheon treats by adding one peach half to a half cup pyrex bowl of lemon Jello, then unmold round side up for each guest. (Garnish with fresh mint.) Highest quality - you won't be disappointed!
