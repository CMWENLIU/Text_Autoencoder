My girlfriend introduced me to these chocolatey delights a few years ago. She had brought them back from a trip to the middle east and I also found some on a business trip to Hong Kong in the airport a few years back.<br /><br />The Kinder Bueno is the love child of ferrero rocher(sp?) and kit-kat. I adore these and was happy I could find them on Amazon.<br /><br />My girlfriend now uses them to train me to do the dishes and laundry. Our relationship and house are much better off because of Kinder Bueno.
