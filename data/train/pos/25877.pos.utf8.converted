I LOVE these lollipops, and have never tried a flavor I didn't like.  I definitely appreciate the lack of high fructose corn syrup and artificial colors when I'm looking for an occasional treat to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br />There is a nice mix of flavors, but for those who are picky, they are not evenly distributed.  Of the 330 lollipops I received in my 5-lb. bag,<br />64 (19%) Tart Sour Apple<br />58 (18%) Googly Grape<br />39 (12%) Mango Tango<br />32 (10%) Strawberry Smash<br />28 (8%) Ginger Zest<br />25 (8%) Wet-face Watermelon<br />24 (7%) Pomegranate Pucker<br />22 (7%) Cheeky Lemon<br />17 (5%) Orange Squeeze<br />11 (3%) Blood Orange Cocktail<br />8 (2%) Very Very Cherry<br />2 (&lt;1%) Tooberry Blueberry
