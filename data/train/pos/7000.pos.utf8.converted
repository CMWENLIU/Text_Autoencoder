Cheese?  I received a cheese of the month package from my son as an unexpected gift just before Thanksgiving.  Surprising!  He knows I like IPA's and Cab's, but cheese?  Doesn't that mean sipping Chardonnay and wearing turtlenecks?  But on opening the package, we found three generous pieces of cheese with interesting names my wife knew, but I could not pronounce. When we opened them on Thanksgiving, everyone enjoyed tasting them and were impressed with the quality -- uh, including me.  So I learned that fancy cheese really does add to the enjoyment of a gathering and enhances the taste of my other favorites -- those IPA's and Cab's.  I don't know if it was just an accident, but it arrived the night before Thanksgiving -- perfect timing.  And there was a chill-pack in the box which kept the cheese in perfect condition.<br /><br />What a nice gift!  Thanks, Son!
