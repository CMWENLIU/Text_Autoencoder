Very useful culinary ingredient.  Provides tartness and protection from browning.  Use anywhere you would like to use Lemon or Lime juice but don't want the taste of lemon or lime.<br /><br />Try mixing a small amount with simple syrup to glaze fresh peach or apple slices - no browning and all you will taste is the peach/apple.
