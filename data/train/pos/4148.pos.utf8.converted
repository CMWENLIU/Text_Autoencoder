Love this product!  If I am completely honest, the first couple times I used them I wasn't sure if they worked the way I expected.  Then I noticed such a big difference when I didn't use them that I became a believer and now use them every time I drink coffee.<br /><br />Depending on the type of cup you use, you get different results.  The one thing that stays consistent is that the coffee becomes drinkable (hot, but not scalding) within a couple of minutes.  I use cream in my coffee, so in a coffee cup I will usually use 2 joulies and with my travel mug I use 3 joulies.  The general rule I have come up with is it increases drinking time to about 2 or 2 1/2 times the original time.  For example, in my open, no cover coffee cup, my coffee stays hot about 20-30 minutes and in my poorly insulated travel mug with cover, my coffee stays hot about an hour and a half rather than 30-45 minutes.  I just recently bought an insulated mug and am very excited to use the joulies with it, because I know I am going to have perfect temperature coffee for hours (much longer than my coffee usually lasts).<br /><br />This is a product I would recommend to any coffee drinker, as long as they know the type of cup you use does make a difference in the results you are going to get!  If you follow the guidelines provided with the product (pre-heating, using an insulated mug with cover, and experimenting with the number of joulies) you will find the combination that works for you.
