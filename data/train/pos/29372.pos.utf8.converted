This chocolate has ruined me for any other.  If you like the Dove dark chocolate candy you will love this.  It's smooth and creamy, like drinking a dark chocolate bar.  And it's not fattening.  Only 100 calories dissolved in 1/3 c. milk; yet it seems to make about 1/2 cup.  That's all you need.  It's rich, filling, and very satisfying.  I just wish amazon had the complete list of products.  This is not for people that like hershey's chocolate!
