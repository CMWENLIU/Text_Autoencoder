I raise American Pitbull Terriers and this has been my food of choice for well over a year! My 3 dogs thrive on this food and several of my customers have had great results with this food as well. Stool is always solid no throw-up. I have used natural balance previous but i switch once i got a few samples of this food and my dogs really liked. Like any other food i check it out do a good trail run and see the results. Highly recommend!
