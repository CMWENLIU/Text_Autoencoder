If you enjoy puffed whole grains, this is one of the best to eat because millet is very nutritious, and it is one of the few breakfast grains that is alkaline instead of acidic.<br />I like to toast these slightly in the oven for best results (these are very small puffed grains, so they will get soggy if you leave them sitting in milk too long), and at breakfast I mix them in my bowl with a sweeter flaked cereal to balance out the sweet taste with a more mild taste and different texture.
