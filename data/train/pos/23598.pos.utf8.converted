Other than the Republic of Tea The People's Green Tea, I really like Yogi Tea Healing Formula. Not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. Other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches, body aches and pains, digestion, depression, immune enhancement, detoxification, as an energizer, and to prolong life. The only side effect is insomnia and I'm suffering from it but I know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!
