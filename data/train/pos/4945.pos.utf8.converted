Kashi 7 Whole Grain Pilaf is packaged into 3 bags per box.  Each bag makes approximate 2 cups of pilaf.  I ruined the first box trying to cook the pilaf.  I confess that, while I am an excellent cook, there are still somethings that I cannot be trusted to cook: rice and water.  A whistling teapot solved the water problem and a rice cooker solved the rice problem.  The pilaf is exactly the same as my rice problem so I experimented with cooking it in the rice cooker.  I was finally successful when I put the pilaf into the rice cooker with *exactly* the number of cups of water called for on the box--2 cups for each bag.  The lines on the side of the rice cooker are worthless for cooking this pilaf.  I also found that I had to reset the warm/cook button to cook a couple of extra times.  The resulting pilaf is a bit gummy after about an hour and I've thought about letting it sit on warm for a while to see what would happen but haven't had the time to do so yet.<br /><br />I eat cereals for breakfast:  cold and hot.  Farina must be cooked on the stove with a hand on the wisk which is not always convenient.  Heavy rolled oats may be cooked in the microwave but must be watched.  This pilaf may be cooked in the rice cooker with an occassional button pushing session.  I like that I can cook the pilaf and have it available to take to work for breakfast.  I have a cup of it for breakfast with a touch of sweetener.  It's a nice variation in textures.  My only complaint is that it is heavy on the calories.<br /><br />I have not yet used this as a side dish.  I suspect that, like rice pilafs, it will be a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Edited to add:  This review was written prior to my purchase of the nifty fancy rice cooker that I have reviewed elsewhere.  The rice cooker used here is one of the ka-ching ones.
