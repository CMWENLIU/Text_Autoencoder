Really good true butter taste, great for popcorn. I have ordered other products from Snappy Popcorn, and they have all been good. When I ran out of the Butter Burst before, I made the mistake of getting a jug of Act II Popping and Topping Oil at the big box store, because it was cheaper. It was not so good. I learned my lesson, you get what you pay for. I will definitely keep ordering Snappy Butter Burst Oil.
