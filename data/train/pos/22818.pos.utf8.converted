I've been drinking this brand of coffee for many years.  I was delighted to see them come out in a Keurig compatible form.  Because they're not really "K-Cups" they don't have to pay the licensing fee, so they can sell for a lower price.<br /><br />The One Cup pods deliver the exact same taste as the beans, a good rich French Roast.<br /><br />Because these are pods and not sealed cups, they should be stored in an airtight container or they will go stale very rapidly.  The box is subdivided into smaller sealed bags, each bag holds a few days worth of cups for the two of us at my house.
