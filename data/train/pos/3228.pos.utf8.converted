Unfortunately my cat has been in cronic kidney failure for some time so he needs to have a low protien diet. We tried the one from the vet and he wouldn't touch it. I then tried this and he eats it really well. It's been hard to find at pet stores recently so finding it on line is a god send. My vet is very pleased with my cat's weight gain and one of the reasons is he likes this so well. I definately recommend this for anyone who's cat needs to be on a low protien diet. The price is much more economical than the KD diet from the vet and cats seem to find it much more palitable.
