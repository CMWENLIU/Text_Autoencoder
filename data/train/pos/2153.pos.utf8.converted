I prefer DeCecco pasta, so I gave this spinach fusilli a whirl and a twirl.  Although the description says it's made of "Spinich," I know it's really spinach and Amazon hasn't responded to my suggestion to correct the spelling.  Anyway, the pasta is one of the best of this type I've tried.  I've used it with tomato based sauces, in cold salads, and simply with roasted garlic, olive oil and freshly grated parmesan reggiano cheese (grated on a Microplane.) Being that the spinach, egg and whole wheat pastas have a shorter shelf life than others, be sure you can consume this pack of 10 in less than a few months.<br /><br />I wrote to DeCecco to inquire because there was no "best by" date on the boxes, and learned the following regarding the imprinted code which is on the bottom of each box:<br /><br />SHELF LIFE  --  As a general rule, De Cecco dry pasta does not have an expiration date since if it is stored and handled properly it can last for a number of years. However, we generally advise our consumers that to savor the unrivaled quality and taste of De Cecco pasta, it is best to consume it within 18 months (whole wheat, egg, spinach, tricolor) to three years from the date of manufacture.<br /><br />CODE DATE FOR PASTA -- Each De Cecco pasta package is imprinted with the date of manufacture, a four-digit number found on the outside flap at the bottom the package. The code is based on the "Julian Calendar", and reads as follows:<br />- The first three digits identify the exact day of manufacture based on the number of days (100) that have elapsed since the first of the year.<br />- The last digit indicates the year of manufacture<br />**:** is the exact time the product was packed<br />- *-** identifies the production line<br /><br />My order is set to expire in only four months, but I know it will last longer because I keep it in a cool, dry location -- if it lasts that long.
