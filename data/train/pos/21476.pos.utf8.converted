This was my first Erin Baker purchase and I was quite pleased with these cookies. They have a great moist oatmeal flavor. They didn't crumble or taste dry at all. It kind of feels like a cheat - like you're eating one of Grandma's oatmeal cookies before a "real" meal. My only issue is I wish there were more walnuts. I've had three cookies so far and one had one walnut, the other two had two. It's a nice unexpected crunch when you get one though. I'm going to try another flavor!
