I have bought Peanut Butter & Co from Amazon, In bulk, twice now. I have only bought the Crunch Time. Haven't tried their other varieties yet. But I certainly will try some of the others. I like my peanut butter a little looser than this brand so I keep a bottle of peanut oil in the frig. I add about a teaspoon of oil and a sprinkle of salt to the jar when I open a new one. I have a large deep bowl in which to stir it. Then I spoon it back into the jar and enjoy.
