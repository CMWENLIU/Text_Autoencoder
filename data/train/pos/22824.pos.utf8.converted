Judy's Sugar Free Peanut Brittle was so good that I kicked myself for only ordering one package.  Anyone who likes peanut brittle but cannot have sugar should order this since it's just like the real thing.  Sometimes candy with sugar alcohols instead of real sugar can make a person's stomach do flips but this one didn't affect me at all, I was fine.  My only suggestion is not to do what I did and order a few packages at a time because it goes fast!
