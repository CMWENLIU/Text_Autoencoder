Caffe Bomrad just hit three home runs in my book.<br /><br />Quality<br />  From the opening of the bag, the aroma drew me closer. Not too oily, but rich and dark. I had to try a cup as soon as my package arrived so I pulled out the grinder and set the grind to course (I will expand on this later).  I put 4 Tbsp in my coffee press and added 16 oz of water. 4 minutes later, my new best friend was there to great me.  The 2mm dark brown foam stayed on top as I poured the coffee for both my wife and myself. She added pure sugar and some frothed milk and I, usually taking my coffee the same as hers, decided to try the coffee uninhibited. We both drew the cups to our noses and took in the new aromas as they were much different than any we have had here in California.  The taste was full, but without any bitterness. We immediately knew that we have found our new staple to our morning wake up.<br /><br />Service<br />  Before sending off $50 to Italy for coffee I had never heard of,  I checked out their great website and even shot off a quick email inquiring of grinding recommendations for this higher quality bean/roast.  Within 6 hours, I had received an extensive email back detailing the desired grinds ( and amounts ) for drip, press and espresso.  To top it off, the emails came from the Bomrad family. This, in my opinion, is a family who takes great pride in their product and their name, not to mention raising the bar extremely high in terms of of customer service.<br /><br />Value,<br />  I was hesitant to spend $50+ on 1kg of coffee until my wife reminded me that I drop that on a bottle of Cab at dinner all the time.  I agreed and then ordered.  For us, the coffee was worth every $$.  If you enjoy great art, wine, or culinary delights; you have spent hundreds of dollars to give yourself the best.  With Caffe Bomrad, you only need to spend an extra 10 cents a cup more to give yourself the best coffee/espresso you can serve yourself.  Enjoy.
