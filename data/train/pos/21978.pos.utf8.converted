I had been having terrible problems with gastritis and GERD.  I have taken this Manuka Honey as instructed for the last 10 days (1 teaspoon before each meal and 1 teaspoon before bed) and I feel so much better.  I hope this continues.  I was so happy that I re-ordered 2 more jars of the honey just so I don't run out.  I have a sense of well-being since I've started using this product.
