Wow, I don't get the 1-star reviews claiming this juice is tasteless...I think it tastes great! I think the overly sweetened, corn syrup & artificial flavoring/coloring-laden "juices" that kids are used to drinking these days are disgusting, though, so you know where I'm coming from.<br /><br />We're not big juice drinkers in our household (eat fruit, drink water, I say), but I let my kids have these juice boxes in sack lunches and for treats and what-not. I love that these drinks include veggie juice and only have 9 grams of sugar per box. I'm on a constant quest to reduce our sugar intake, so this works for me! I haven't had any kids complain about the taste either, and we've served these at various kids' parties, so FWIW, I think kids are amenable to the less-sweet flavor, unless perhaps their taste buds are ruined with a constant high-sugar diet. *shrug*
