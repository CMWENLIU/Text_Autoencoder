After being outshown by my siblings in year's past, I ordered these orchids for my mother for Valentine's Day. This was something of a risk, because (A) she claims to despise Valentine's Day, decrying it as commercial manipulation etc.; and (B) she has never liked orchids. Guess what? She loved these orchids. She's been reminding me how awesome they look on her side table every time I call. Not a bad return for the price! I'm writing this review because I'm thinking of ordering another batch.
