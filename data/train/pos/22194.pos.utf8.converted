My husband and I purchased our first Keurig this month, which of course meant we also purchased a good number of k cups as well, thus leading us to decide that it might be nice to get something that could not only nicely hold a large amount of the k cups but also be a way of showing to guest possible drink options. We have several friends who also own keurigs as well as different types of k cup holders. We felt that after seeing and hearing their opinions on some of the k cup holders and seeing some of them first hand, we decided we wanted one of the carousel types.... 1. because we felt they were built better 2. They did not seem to fall apart as easy and seem to be of nice, stable structure 3. they seemed to display very well a variety of k cups all while making them easy to get to and use.<br /><br />We did not want to go with the smaller Carousel version, because we wanted one that could hold a large amount. We did have some reservations at first about this model, however all of our nervousness was put to rest once our carousel finally arrived. It is not only sturdy and well built, it also spins smoothly when it is turned, no parts were broken and it can display up to 35 k cups at a time! WE LOVE THIS CAROUSEL!!! It was worth the money spent and we are certain will hold up for many years. It is easy to access the diff k cups, it looks great on our counter next to our keurig and soda machine, and it is also not too tall so that it easily stores underneath our cabinets without issues!! Highly recommend this product for those consumers wanting a larger k cup holder, that is sturdy, well built and great to use!!!! 5 stars from these two happy consumers!
