I was quite surprised at how incredibly good this coconut tastes. I will never again purchase what the grocery store sells. It is so good right out of the bag, that I ate more than I should have, I just couldn't resist. I am thinking of buying a coconut cookbook so that I can use this product daily, that's how much I enjoyed it.
