This is a delicious meal.  Well, I eat it as a meal.  It, of course can be eaten as a side dish. It has two types of greens and a bit of a "bite!"  You might want to put some sour cream or plain yogurt on the side. :)  I will always buy this as I'm too inept and lazy to prepare the recipe myself. lol
