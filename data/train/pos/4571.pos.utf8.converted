I have to admit that this is a great addition to the kitchen.  My daughter-in-law introduced me to sticky rice.  My wife and I were on vacation at the time and when we got home the first thing I did was look for the tools to make it.  I found this product and am extremely pleased with it.<br /><br />Shipping time was great.  I think it was only about 3 or 4 days for it to come all the way across the country.  Nothing was damaged and nothing was missing.  The aluminum cooker, bamboo basket and cheesecloth were all there along with the bag of rice.  Instructions were included as well.  I think we made our first batch the very next day.  The cheesecloth keeps everything in place and keeps the basket from getting messy.  Cleanup is easy too.<br /><br />If you want to try sticky rice or just need a replacement this will be a great addition.
