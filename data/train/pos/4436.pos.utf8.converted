I have ordered this cake three times in the past 15 months. We love marzipan and this cake epitomizes great preparation, presentation and proportion of marzipan. We do not care for traditional fruitcake, but this cake is very different. It's abundance of delicious high-end fruits and moist cake make it taste out-of-the-ordinary. Try it, you will not be disappointed.<br />Amazon offers the most competitive pricing, when you order it directly from them, not a MarketPlace vendor. We found out that we have to watch our carbs (sugar, etc.) intake. so we don't order it as often as we would like.
