I got a Keurig for Christmas and got these to hold the k-cups for things like hot chocolate that I have a ton of the same flavor.  Doesn't take up a lot of space, easy to access the k-cups, easy to refill, and looks neater on the shelf than some of the other racks I saw online.  I found them for around $25 at Wal-Mart, but was unable to find them on Amazon for less than almost twice that until someone listed a set with a slightly damaged box.  The box didn't bother me, the second set was just as great as the first, but I'm not sure I would have paid more than I did for either set.
