As far as I'm concerned a pizza just isn't worth eating unless it's generously decorated with anchovies.  However, I'm the only one at our house who feels this way.<br /><br />  On weekend nights we frequently order in from our favorite pizza place, and since I must have anchovies I keep these on hand to garnish my share of the pie.  (Never would dream of imposing my educated taste on others  ;-)<br /><br />  We've tried other brands - the ones packed in oil tend to fall apart; others have been tasteless.  These have a rich flavor and are meaty enough to hold their shapes.  They're the best we've found.
