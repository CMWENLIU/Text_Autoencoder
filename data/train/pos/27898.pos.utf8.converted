My guess is that the other reviewer used an inexpensive machine, just not the right amount or maybe a bad bag.  It happens - we have all been there.<br /><br />Anyway, we were very happy with the taste - especially considering the cost.  Once we got the settings right on the Gaggia, every espresso and latte has been great.  Blows Starbucks away.
