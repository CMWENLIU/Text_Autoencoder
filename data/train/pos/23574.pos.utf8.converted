This is a terriffic way to confirm a tentative diagnosis of diabetes in a cat without the trauma of taking your cat to the vet or trying to hold a strip to them while urinating.  You sprinkle some sugar-detecting "confetti" in the litter box and check it each day for color change.  In our Simba, we confirmed high blood sugar and immediately took her off her existing kibble diet (kibbles are generally high in carbohydrates as well as grain products such as flour and gluten that cats and dogs can't metabolize).  She now eats only high-protein grain-free canned food and is symptom free. I highly recommend this product. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VJ55U">Purina "Glucotest" Feline Urinary Glucose Detection System (one test packet)</a>
