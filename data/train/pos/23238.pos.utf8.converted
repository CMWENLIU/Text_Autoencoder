This is by far the best RRL tea ever. Traditional Medicinals uses the best herbs and this particular tea helps me very much. Not only that, but it tastes good, too. I drink three cups a day and don't have to add anything to it. This is an excellent product and I order it through the Subscribe & Save service and I really do save a bundle! Each box only turns out to be like $3 and change. In the store they are $5.65 each. I absolutely love this product!
