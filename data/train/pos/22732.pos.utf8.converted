This is one of my favorite flavors of Dr. McDougall's brand of soups and mixes. The texture is pleasing to me along with the spices. Yes, it's a dried soup mix so you can get clumps sometimes, but nothing a good stir with a spoon can't fix. Plus, the larger size soup cup means I can eat this with a little something extra to make a nice lunch. Oh, and if you are looking for a hearty lunch, try pouring this over rice or some other starch.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see this offered through Amazon. Check out the split pea cup, too, that's my other favorite.<br /><br />Also, compared to the "Fantastic Food" brand soup , I've always found the Dr.McDougall soups to be thicker, have more spices, and be more filling. This is the perfect vegan cup of soup when you don't have time to bring/make your own. If you intend to make your own, check out Dr. McDougall's Quick and Easy cookbook.
