I eat a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast nearly every day. For me alone these 6 bags will last about a year.  These are prepared differently than I am used to, in the US rolled oats are the typical variety.<br /><br />For those not familiar, pinhead oats are the same as steel-cut oats, oats cut into small pieces rather than being crushed (rolled) in a mill and steamed.  The result is that they take longer to cook; rolled oats take about 10 minutes to get mushy all the way through, but steel cut oats can take up to 30 minutes to get soft and will probably never be as mushy as rolled oats.  This results in a different texture than rolled oats that a some people like.  Also of note, is that steel-cut oats are denser than rolled oats so the ratio of water to oats is closer to 4:1 rather than the 2:1 for rolled.<br /><br />All that being said, steel-cut oats have a lower Glycemic Index.  Plus they seem to retain a bit more oat flavor than typical rolled oats.  To help deal with the longer preparation time, I started making my oatmeal in batches for several days.  I use small containers, about 1 cup (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012DQ6S4">Rubbermaid 7J59 Easy Find Lid Square 1-1/4-Cup Food Storage Container</a>), and eat one every day for breakfast.
