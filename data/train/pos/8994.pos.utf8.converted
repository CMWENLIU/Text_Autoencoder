Yummy! Not like a typical instant or canned soup -- very much like served in a restaurant, including a nice body/texture. Using the 8-oz hot water and a teeny touch of soy sauce (I'm a salt-loving person -- you might not want it), I find it perfect. Have served it to company with openness and no apologies for it being instant. I like to make food from scratch, but not every course every time, so this is a welcome addition to my pantry. And nicely filling for a between meal snack.
