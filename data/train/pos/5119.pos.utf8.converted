I ordered this because I've been participating in a bone broth challenge, and we are encouraged to also use gelatin (which also naturally occurs in bone broth).<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this, I recommend visiting the company's website; it has a lot of really good information, plus a couple dozen recipes for using gelatin.<br /><br />I was especially concerned about the MSG content, because I know that free glutamate typically occurs in gelatin.  Great Lakes has a whole page about MSG, though, including lab results indicating free glutamate content, etc.  It seems like a pretty safe product.<br /><br />So far I've been making homemade jello with my Great Lakes Gelatin.  Basically, what you do is heat up half a cup of fresh juice, add 2 Tablespoons of gelatin, and stir on low heat until it is totally dissolved.  Then let it cool, and add it into a bowl containing 1 1/2 more cups of fresh juice.  Stir until it is well combined, pour it into the container you want it in, and then let it set in the fridge for several hours.  I made this recipe with fresh cherries and lemon, and I left pieces of fruit in it, and added raw honey to sweeten it a little--it has been wonderful!<br /><br />Until I bought this I hadn't eaten jello in a long time because dessert jellos at the store usually have sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, etc that I avoid.  I'm really enjoying this Great Lakes gelatin, though.
