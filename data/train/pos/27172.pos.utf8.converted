I have mostly been a granola breakfast person, but the calories on granola more than I want every morning, but this cereal has fewer calories, a lot more fiber, and in addition it has a large dose of Omega-3 as a bonus (Omega-3 is one of the suplements I always take because of the long list of benefits.<br /><br />In addition it tastes great!  When I was a kid I used to like Kelloggs Sugar Smacks, which I'm sure would taste sickeningly sweet to me nowadays, but the Kashi Honey Almond tastes just like I remember the Sugar Smacks tasting from way back when, but a scant cup of the Kashi is very filling as opposed to the couple of bowls of sugar smacks I remember eating as a kid :-).
