I sent this assortment of cheeses to my parents (who love french cheeses) and hoped for the best. Here was there response in an email: "Thank you so much for the wonderful gift...we enjoyed all the cheeses and goodies that went with the cheeses...the package was very elegant too." Because they live so far away. we didn't get to try the cheeses, but they said that they were all excellent and of the highest quality. I will definitely order from this company again.
