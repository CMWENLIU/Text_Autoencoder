Thanks Amazon! And thanks to Organic Valley for a LOW FAT shelf stable milk that tastes great! I always have these handy packs around, and this is the only brand I know of with a low fat option. I started using Parmalat in Europe, but when the company filed for bankruptcy in '04 it became almost impossible to find in the USA....and no one filled the need for UHT milk. Who stepped up to the plate? The Organic milk companies! This size is just enough for a day's worth of coffee drinkers.
