Most people that buy powdered eggs tend to use them in recipes as a replacement for real eggs.  My introduction to instant eggs was not so indiscreet.  I first tasted them on a camping trip with my sons scout troop quite a few years ago.  It was late spring and getting warmer so we were concerned about bringing real eggs along.  We had the "Honeyville" brand that is available here on Amazon as well. I found them to be surprisingly good scrambled.  In fact when done right they seemed indiscernible to me in respect to real eggs.  Same texture and flavor.  I decided to buy more powered eggs years later when I started to do more numerous hikes that took me further out into the wilderness, and I found myself missing the taste of eggs over an open fire. Being the frugal gourmet that I am I opted to try the Barry Farm egg powder over the Honeyville for it was a bit cheaper. Not only that, but I already owned and have used Barry Farms chicken and beef bouillon powder for quite some time and found them both to be excellent in soups and stews.  I am pleased to announce that my being a tightwad this time around was very well placed, and rewarded. The Barry farm egg powder taste very good when prepared right. I make them here at home as scrambled quite often.  And as a recipe substitute I find they are undetectable as to be compared to real eggs. They are most definitely just as good as the Honeyville brand. (Although in all fairness, I have noticed lately that Barry Farm is just about the same price now as the Honeyville. I still prefer the taste of Barry Farm).  The only suggestion I would make to anyone that wishes to be adventurous and make scrambled eggs with this powder is make sure you grease the pan well.  They stick something awful if you don't, just like real eggs.  There will always be a core amount of folks that would never attempt cooking or tasting powdered eggs either scrambled or in a recipe. For those that fit into that category don't bother to get adventurous now.  For those of you that have tasted these before, or are tempted to taste them now, I highly recommend Barry Farm egg powder.  They're nowhere near as bad, or the same powdered eggs soldiers used to tell horror stories about when talking about the cuisine of their war years...
