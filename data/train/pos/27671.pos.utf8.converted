This is by far my favorite breakfast cereal on the market.  I was introduced  to it about 20 years ago when my doctor recommended it to me as part of a program to lose weight and get my blood pressure down.  But beyond the fact that it's very healthful (no sugar, lots of fiber), it's very tasty.  The toasted flax seeds (which I'd never tasted before) give the cereal a very nice nutty flavor.  It may take you a few bowls to cultivate the taste - and I'd encourage you to resist the temptation to add sugar - because Uncle Sam is not like other cereals.  By volume, I'm satisfied with about half as much as a "normal" cereal. In a word, Uncle Sam cereal is wonderful!
