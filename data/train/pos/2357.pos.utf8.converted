I received my Dawn Redwood a couple of days ago.  I don't think I got the same impression as others when I first saw my tree.  I ordered it early in the year so I am assuming it is just now starting to get its leaves for the spring.  My wife's first impression was that it looked like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.<br /><br />I love the bark on this tree and how it makes it look older.  The trunk of the tree and taper is probably about average.  From soil to the top of the tree it is 21 inches tall.  The color of the bark and the color of the leaves is really beautiful.  I am anxious for it to fill out.<br /><br />Overall it looks like it has some potential for a nice tree.
