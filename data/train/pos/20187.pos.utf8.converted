If you're looking for the real thing, these are the ticket! As mentioned in one of the other reviews, they're not too salty which is a big plus. They're plenty hot while not being overwhelming and have the perfect texture and flavor. I've tried many brands over the years and these remind me of the good old days when they were made the right way. Well worth the cost!
