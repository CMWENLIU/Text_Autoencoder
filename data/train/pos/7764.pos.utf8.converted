...it's just one of those awesome little things you have to share.<br /><br /> I was stationed in Hawaii for more than 8 of the last 24+ years at different times and one of the joys of Hawaii (among many) is the great local food. The downside is that finding the particulars that make local Hawaiian cuisine so fun and tasty are hard to locate in one place in most of the rest of the USA.<br /><br /> A common favorite is a dish called Ahi Poke. Though you can Poke lots of other fish, Ahi Poke is the most frequently enjoyed. Ahi is just tuna, though a slightly different type. The one used for this dish is a sushi grade raw Ahi. The part that is Poke is a blend of various spices, oils and a specific seaweed and it gives an absolutely unique and delightful flavor. It is a firm family favorite whether we simply scoop some over a dish of rice or make it into a sushi wrap. Most people who like any sushi at all love Ahi Poke.<br /><br /> Alas, thinking I should be able to find all the various spices and ingredients in any big city I didn't bring any with me from Hawaii. Getting all of those ingredients in one spot proved impossible. Even just consistently locating all of them anywhere was an exercise in hours of cross city driving and frustration.<br /><br /> So, on the off chance one day I typed in a search for the brand of pre-packaged Ahi Poke mix I used in Hawaii..Noh..and voila: Amazon had it! I bought a case just in time for my nephews birthday and he was absolutely gobsmacked to have a nice big bowl of his favorite food.<br /><br />  This package makes THE Ahi Poke. You can find recipes using more common seaweeds or other substitutions all over the net, but this is the real deal. That same rich and exotic flavor blend you remember from that shabby shop on the North Shore is right in this package. Each individual package is labeled to work for 1 pound of fish but I found that using 3/4 of a pound gives about the correct flavor. A pound makes it a tad weak. Of course, that's a lot of fish anyway. We tend to think in terms of hamburger or steak but the richness of raw Ahi means people will generally eat significantly less in ounces than they would other meats.<br /><br />  Love this stuff and I certainly recommend it. The price may seem high for a packet of spice, but the bulk prices on that seaweed, when you can even get it, is pretty high so this is actually quite reasonable. Happy Sushi!
