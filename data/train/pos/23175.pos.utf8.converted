I like these quite a bit better than Power Bars or Cliff Bars. Both of these seem to leave me with a serious lack of interest after one or two while kayaking. The Kashi Bars fare much better. The Malted Chocolate is my favorite, but they all are quite tasty.<br /><br />Only problem - the chocolate coating gets soft or melts in hot weather. So here's a tip... just hold them under water for a few minutes to cool 'em off before eating.
