I like the flour, but it is difficult to find recipes and know how to use it in conjunction with other flours. If you love to cook and are an experimental type of person, you can really have some fun with this. If you are an average cook who is interested in not having any disappointments, this is not for you. By the way, it is a very healthful alternative for people who need gluten free products.
