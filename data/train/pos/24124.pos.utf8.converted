I purchased this item to give as a gift.  I was a little wary of purchasing based on the photo alone, but when I received this item, I was extremely pleased.  First, the item comes shipped in its own ready-to-ship Amazon box; if needed, you can simply apply a label and ship to your recipient.  I wanted to view the product itself, however, so I opened the box.  Inside, the individual food items were neatly arranged on the cutting board, with the cheese knife placed across the top.  The entire thing was wrapped in plastic to hold it together and then encircled by a very nice quality red bow accented with gold.  This excellent presentation definitely makes this product a gift I am proud to give!  Since my recipients have not yet received the item (it's a Christmas gift), I can't say anything about the quality of the food products that are included, but I will try to update my review with more details.  Based on appearance alone, however, I would definitely recommend this product.
