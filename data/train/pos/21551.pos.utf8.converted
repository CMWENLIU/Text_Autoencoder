I was concerned that it wouldn't taste good unless it was mixed with yogurt the night before as so many reviewers had stated they do---I'm happy to report that I put it in a bowl, pour on some low-fat milk, and chow down-----it is delicious right away---yum yum go get you some. The only thing I would argue with is the serving size----who could eat a 1/4 cup for breakfast--not me--a cup at least--so it goes quickly. I also love that there is no ground up stuff in the bottom, from top of the bag to the last bite it's all perfect-----Thanks
