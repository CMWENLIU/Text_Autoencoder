I bought these ostensibly for my husband, but after a particularly bad day I decided to tear into one. I bought four packets in different flavors: cherry, caramel, chocolate-mint and original. Don't worry, I will replace the ones that go into my husband's birthday gift but I couldn't resist.<br /><br />I used them in an interesting application, which is to make 'frozen hot chocolate'. I took a packet of the original and blended it with ice and milk (actually I used So Delicious Coconut Milk Beverage because I eschew dairy). I like that it doesn't have powdered milk solids or anything else. It's a very pure mix that isn't muddled up by a ton of sugar or extra fanfare.<br /><br />Great sipping chocolate! Exceeded my expectations. I tried three of the flavors. I am going to get more to replace the ones I pilfered...
