I have been on the HCG diet protocol & the flavored Stevias are wonderful to sweeten my tea & coffee.  Since I have some difficulty drinking the total amount of water needed, I decided to try some of the vanilla creme stevia in it.  Wow!!  Tastes like an Italian soda!  And I can really suck it down with pleasure!  I use about a dropper full per 16 oz. glass, however others use more or less.  Also is very good to put a drop on apple slices for those times when you get an apple that is not as sweet as you would like.  Great on a baked apple with some cinnamon....
