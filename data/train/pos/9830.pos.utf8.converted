After loving Nutiva's coconut oil (great coconutty flavor and SO healthy for you!) I wanted to try the coconut manna.  So I bought it and I LOVE it!  It's got kind of a peanut butter consistency.  It is so delicious!  I take the whole jar and just grab a spoon and snack on it while watching tv or any other excuse I can find to eat it.  It's a great healthy and tasty snack.  I highly recommend it!  YUM!<br /><br />I should add that I am low carbing, so this tastes sweet to me, but may not to someone who eats sugary foods regularly...
