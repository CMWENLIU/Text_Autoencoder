First let me start of that i am an indian residing in the US. I miss authentic indian food and dont get to eat good indian food in the restaraunts in my city.<br />These are very vlose to the real thing and taste just yummy. For people who dont eat too much spice the butter chicken wood be an excellent choice. Now i do cook the real butter chicken(not the best cook) i think this tastes better and is very easy to prepare. I didnt have to add any additional ingredients and the chicken came out great. Even entertained a few american guests and they were all over it !
