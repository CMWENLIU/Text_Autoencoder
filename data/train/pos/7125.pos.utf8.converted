When you just need something crunchy and salty, these fill the bill.  Count out 30 of them and sit down to a crunchy snack with only 110 calories.  They are crisp and sort of similar to potato chips, but less oily. I generally eat 15 of them and find it satisfies me just as much as a 150 calorie bag of potato chips, for only 55 calories.  Ideally, I would avoid a snack entirely.  But when I just feel like I've gotta have one, these are great to have around.  I open the package and count them into serving size baggies right off the bat so I am not tempted to just eat from the box without counting.
