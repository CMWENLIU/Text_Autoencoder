I lived in Japan for two years and drank this tea all the time.  This tea is crisp and has a slight earthy taste.  It is my very favorite cold beverage tea. When I moved back to the U.S. it was hard to find this tea.  I now see it sold in most Asian markets however the labeling is different.  I guess the manufacturer wanted to appeal to the Western market.  I try to get as much as possible but I live 20 miles away and it is more convenient to purchase it on Amazon and have it delivered.  The cost benefits is pretty much the same.  I recommend that you give this tea a try.
