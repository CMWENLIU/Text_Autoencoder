I actually bought this after reading an article about catnip oil keeping mites and other buggies away from chickens (we have chickens). However, upon receiving it I sprayed a couple of kitty toys that our cats ignore and view with disdain. Immediately they came running (they smelled it from the another room) and now the previously ignored and rejected toys are the favorites in the house! Seriously!! They were rolling, licking, playing with these toys for quite some time (45 min?) and even now when they walk past they can't help but go over and give the toys a bit of play.<br /><br />Very potent - highly recommend for cats!
