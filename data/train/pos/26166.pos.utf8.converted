I ordered this after reading about how healthy it is, and the food I bake with it actually comes out tasting very good. If you aren't totally grain-free/paleo, you can still benefit from the healthy aspect of this. My banana bread recipe is below:<br /><br />3 large ripe bananas<br />1 egg, well beaten<br />3/4 c. sugar<br />3 tbsp. butter, melted<br />1.5 c. (whole wheat) flour<br />1/2 c. coconut flour<br />1/2 c. water (or as needed to reach proper consistency)<br />1 tsp. soda<br />1 tsp. baking powder<br />1/2 tsp. salt<br />Walnuts (optional)<br /><br />Mash bananas well and mix with beaten egg. Add sugar and mix thoroughly. Melt butter and add to the banana mixture. Sift together remaining dry ingredients and add to banana mixture. Bake in a greased 5x9 inch pan (2 lb. loaf pan) or two smaller pans. Bake at 350
