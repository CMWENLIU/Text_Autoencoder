The Oregon Pitted Red Tart Cherries are the fruit of choice for my wife who is an excellent pie baker.  The price offered on-line is 20 to 30 cents less per can than can be found in any of the grocery stores, not all of which carry this product.  Thanks for making them available, I'm looking forward to enjoying the taste of the pies.
