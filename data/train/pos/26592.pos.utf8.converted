The Nature's Hollow sugar-free jams are just delicious.  I ran into this product in the book BELLY FAT CURE by Jorge Cruise.  I immediately purchased all the flavors for my pantry and do not miss sugar-loaded jellies or jams at all.  It is a strong weapon in my determination to lose weight and eat healthy meals.  My husband was recently diagnosed with diabetes and he loves the jams also.  Truly, you cannot tell they are sugar-free.  I strongly recommend this product.
