This is not sugary sweet hot chocolate, nor is it supposed to be.  It has a little bite. We like to call it hot cocoa for grown ups. I love to drink mine with Almond Joy creamer, or Cold Stone Creamery's Sweet Cream creamer. One of my daughters likes vanilla creamer, and another likes to drink it almost black. Nice, warm, rich comfort beverage alternative to coffee.  Tastes best when brewed in a French press. I just have a cheap 32 oz press that I got here on Amazon, but it is so much better than using an electric coffee maker. Also be aware, it is not going to brew as dark as coffee.  That threw me off at first, but don't let the light color fool you! It has a lot of flavor.
