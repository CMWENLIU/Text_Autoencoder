I just started home roasting and this was my first purchase of green coffee.  I am a coffee enthusiast, and living in a small town, home roasting is the only way to get fresh roasted coffee as the stores just don't sell inventory fast enough.<br /><br />My first batch of this coffee was great tasting with nice body and earthy flavor I would expect from Sumatran. It was packaged well and I received it in 3 business days.<br /><br />From past experience with store bought Sumatran, I like a city plus or maybe full city roast rather than the very dark vienna or french roast the stores seem to like. Roasted to city plus or full city, this product produces a flavor that is full and earthy, but not over the top like a dark roasted Sumatran can be. Lighter than city plus will taste grassy like most coffee. Just my preference and your experience will tell you what works for you.<br /><br />I read some home roasting how-to articles on the web and tried to roast using an air popper to a city plus or full city, ending up with nice medium colored and evenly roasted batch. The aroma when newly roasted is kind of "raw", but after an hour or two it is fantastic.  It wasn't very tricky to roast and I've been able to repeat the results as often as I need fresh beans, usually 6 to 8 oz. of beans each weekend.<br /><br />After letting the roast "breathe" for a day, it made great espresso in a 15-bar pump espresso machine with fair crema, and in a 3-cup Italian moka pot. With a coarser grind it was terrific in a French press as well. I haven't tried it in a drip machine. The results have been consistent from batch to batch and I would buy it again.
