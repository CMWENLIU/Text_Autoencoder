This is a great product! I have congestive heart failure from a pneumonia virus in 2004. It is great to use for soups instead of chicken stock in the can or other boullion, great for chicken dressing, chicken dumplings, chicken spaghetti, alfredo, adding to stuffing. Use in turnip greens instead of bacon grease, bacon or ham to add a good flavor a little vinegar gives it a slightly salty taste. The beef is also good and we use in beef stew or more beef based broths sometimes, also can use to help make brown gravy without grease, fat or sodium. These are must haves in our pantry!
