My wife and I both like the spearmint flavored BreathSavers, but they were becoming hard to find locally. It seems most stores had Breathsavers, but not the spearmint flavor. I decided to check online and found them on Amazon at a super price. We bought enough to qualify for "free shipping". We'll be buying more when these run out--Thank You !!<br /><br />  Vaughn & Diane
