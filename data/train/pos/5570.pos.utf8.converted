This Glaze is the best!!!  Forget buying all those expensive balsamic vinegars - adding a bit of brown sugar and reducing for a nice glaze.  Just get this and save the money and the time.  Try it in ways mentioned on other reviews, the label....but then do yourself a wonderful favor and try it on some braised or grilled veges OMG!!!
