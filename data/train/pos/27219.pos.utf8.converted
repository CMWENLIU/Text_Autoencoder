I love coffee, i have tried so many in the past and happened upon the cafe altura. Now, every other coffee out there is just so-so. I occasionally give another recommended brand a chance but it never comes close to this one.<br />When you open the bag the quality is clear: The smell is intoxicating - not fake like flavored coffees and not 'burnt' like starbucks, but rich full COFFEE flavor. Also, the beans are visually oily, not wet or nasty as i have heard of some coffees in the past but just shiny with the oil (where all the flavor is)<br />Because of the quality of this coffee i use less, the taste will tempt you to take it black, and its organic from an ecologically-minded farmer....sweet!
