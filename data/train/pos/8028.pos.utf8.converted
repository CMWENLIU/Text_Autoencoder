I am newly diagnosed Diabetic (as well as having food allergies), and I was told to keep a quick snack of at least 15 carbs on hand for emergencies.  That means about 4 of these. However, I often find that I crave a small hard candy after my evening meal.  I pop one of these into my mouth as I sip my coffee and work, etc. and am thoroughly content.  I do so wish though that these were more readily available in the plain lemon. I crave lemon drops and they are so very hard to find in gluten, lactose, soy and grape free.  I just cannot get myself to eat what amounts to a honey lemon cough drop flavor such as comes in this assortment.  Please, AMZ or MFG. consider offering this assortment with just plain lemon in the mix.  But, I still give this 5 stars+++  It is so yummy.  I love the chance to have  a selection of flavors  - - how about some other mixes or more flavors to this one - - orange, watermelon, mango, pineapple, coconut????  Love the Subscribe & Save option!
