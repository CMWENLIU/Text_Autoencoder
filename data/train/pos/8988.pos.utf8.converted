I tried a a good number of incense by HEM and I really enjoy the Precious Rose scent. I am 98% sure that the oil that the sticks were soaked in was synthetic; because I smelled organic rose essence and oil 2 different rose synthetic oils and this scent smells very similar to the synthetics. I also think that the scent is synthetic because natural/organic rose oil is very expensive and I do not see how it could be used for such inexpensive product as the incense sticks. Nevertheless, the scent is very pleasant. At first I wanted to give this product 4 stars because of my suspicion of the synthetic oil and no identifier of it on the packaging, but the I decided to give it 5 stars because I honestly enjoy it a lot. If I could I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars.
