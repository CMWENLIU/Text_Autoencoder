Millet makes a great gluten-free flour, but it has issues:  millet flour goes bad fast, but it's only a "secondary" gluten-free flour, so you wouldn't want to buy a lot at once. (You can't use it as the primary flour in gluten-free baked goods because the resulting baked goods are too hard.)<br /><br />The millet flours that are commercially available aren't necessarily gluten-free, so that is a serious obstacle to using millet flour as well.<br /><br />However, millet has a complete amino acid profile, meaning that you can be a vegan gluten-free person and live on millet;  it's worth the effort for that reason alone.<br /><br />If you have a Krups coffee grinder, and this, you're set for millet flour the next six months of gluten-free baking.  This is really good stuff--use it to make shortbread and arepas mixed with rice flour and all-purpose gluten-free flour.
