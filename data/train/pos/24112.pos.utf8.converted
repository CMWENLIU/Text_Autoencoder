Big, crunchy ribbons of coconut that look a little like paper gone through a shredder to give you an idea of the shape. While not very substantial, these are very tasty little morsels. They are very flavorful (coconutty, of course) and just slightly sweet. Fun to munch on, though I do wish there was more in a bag... a little pricy for single serve, and 2 oz couldn't make for more than that.
