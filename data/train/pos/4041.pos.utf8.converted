Almost all low carb breads I've eaten taste like cardboard. Not this one! It has a coarse, nutty texture that is great. It soaks up egg for a great french toast and just toasted, it comes out crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside. The other breads from Health Express that I've bought were the Flax-yummy! And the sesame seed and the oat of which makes the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had!!
