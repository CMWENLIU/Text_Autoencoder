I was a bit skeptical when I read 'maple' but this is just a touch of maple to give it a bit of a sweet flavor. For anyone looking to get off 'peanuts' or try something new, this is a great great product. I used to get fresh ground almond butter at Whole Foods, but I'd pick this over fresh ground any day!
