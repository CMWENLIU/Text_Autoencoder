I am not the main chef in our household. My husband enjoys cooking whereas my comfort zone is being the clean-up crew(washing dishes, storing leftovers away). Don't get me wrong, there are a few occasions where I will prepare a decent meal but for the most part, I'm normally in the background when it comes to the kitchen.<br /><br />With our first child, I made a feeble attempt at making my own baby food. I roasted a butternut squash in the oven, steamed a couple of vegetables then used a food processor for blending. I was excited about making my own baby food for about two weeks tops. For me, it took so much time and a lot of clean-up afterwards that I ended up purchasing ready-made baby food.<br /><br />With our second child, I decided I wanted another go at making baby food. Since I already (unsuccessfully)tried making food by steaming/baking and blending separately, I realized it made sense for me to purchase a baby food maker.  I narrowed it down to Beaba and Baby Brezza. I chose the Baby Brezza after reading the reviews for both on Amazon.<br /><br />I love the Baby Brezza. Since my daughter turned 6 months, I've prepared: green beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, chicken breast, sweet peas, pears, apples, peaches and prunes. And she is 7.5 months. Yes, I know that I've only been using it for a month and a half but the point is, I have used it every four days (the recommended time for babies to be introduced to new food) and I see myself using it until she can eat food that actually looks the way it should. It's super easy to use. You chop up the food in small 1/4 cuts, pour water into the reservoir, transfer the food into the container, decide whether you want to steam only or steam + blend, select the length of steam time and press START.<br /><br />The clean-up is pretty easy. I let the blade soak in warm, soapy water while I clean the container. I also drain the water out of the reservoir and leave the cap on the reservoir open so as to let the inside of the reservoir air dry. It takes about a day out on our kitchen counter to be completely bone dry inside the reservoir. For people concerned about mold, if you dry your reservoir completely, you have no worries. Food occasionally sticks on the blades but I use a short small bottle brush to thoroughly get in between the blades.<br /><br />My only (minor) complaint would be the blending noise. My husband and I don't mind it, my 3.5 year old son doesn't mind it, but my 7.5 month daughter gets a bit spooked. But, seriously, the instrument is blending. It's doing its job. It's a strong motor that purees fruits/vegetables/meat to a homogenous consistency. I don't blame the maker but I just want to throw that out there for people that have noise-sensitive babies.<br /><br />*FYI, the optional items really aren't necessary. The cutting board? Really, just use your hands and scoop the vegetable/fruit/meat into the collection carafe. The spatula? I'm sure you can find a baking spatula in your utensil drawer.<br /><br />**FYI again, I use little BPA-free storage cubes to store the blended foods in the freezer. For me, it's a lot easier to use than ice cube trays.
