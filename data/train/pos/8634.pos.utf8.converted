I just started using this product, and really like it.  I used to hate lemon juice in a bottle, and if I didn't have a lemon around, I did without.  Now you can have the real taste of lemon with you all the time!.  [...] Though I thought 12 boxes was a lot at first, I've shared with friends, and sent several boxes to our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan as they are always looking for ways to add a little "zip" to their water.  By the way, a single packet in a quart/liter of water does the trick for me, but you can also add a little sweetener if you would like lemonade.  Also try True Lime.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQR9JW">True Lime Crystallized Lime Mix, 40 Packs, 1.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> True Orange just came out, and I hope that Amazon.com will offer it soon as well.
