I LOVE GIVING WELL-PACKAGED AS WELL AS HIGH QUALITY FOOD. A BIG RED BOW, AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. THIS IS BOMBA RICE -- WHO CAN RESIST A NAME LIKE THAT -- AND IT COMES IN A CUTE  LITTLE SACK WITH A PICTURE OF A FRIAR ON IT. VERY LOVELY. AND GOOD RICE. BOUGHT THE PAELLA PAN TOO, ALSO ON AMAZON. EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET IT RIGHT.
