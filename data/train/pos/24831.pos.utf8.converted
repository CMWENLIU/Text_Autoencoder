I love mashed potatoes and these are really delicious. You can't go wrong with 100% organic vegan mashed potatoes. Very easy to prepare, simple ingredients and cooks instantly. Each box contains one envelope for four good servings. The only thing I must point out, as others have is the amount of liquid should be increased. I used 1 1/2 cup water and 4 tablespoons of Earth Balance vegan butter because I love buttery mashed potatoes. Then I added roughly 3/4 of Silk soy milk, but I recommend you eye it and pour as needed to obtain your desired consistency and some salt for additional flavor. Everyone enjoyed them!
