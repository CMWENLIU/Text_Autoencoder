My cat has had a delicate stomach. I have tried many different foods and tricks. Since I started feeding him this, he has had no throwing up. I have to feed him more than I did. He doesn't seem to get satisfied as quickly. His sister who has no stomach problems needs larger portions too. they both have no complaints about the taste. This stuff is expensive. It is worth it to not have him throw up all the time.
