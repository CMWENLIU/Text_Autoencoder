I sent this as a gift, and it arrived with lightening speed, in perfect condition.  The only negative was that my recipient mentioned there was no tray under the plant,and usually plants come on a decent little tray.  A detail, but you need to know when ordering. Otherwise we both very happy with the plant.  I would definitely order more plants from Amazon again.
