Picked up the 16oz jar from costco today for 6.89 + tax. I am shocked at the online price of $21.00 ?!?!  This is a great versatile product but it's not worth 21 bucks!<br /><br />an update SEPT 2011...Wow, this is some good stuff! I'm on my 3rd jar already!  I usually just get the Herb Ox brand of bouillon cubes but then costco stopped carrying the Herb Ox and had this instead. So i decided to get it..thinking they're all the same. I was wrong. I never knew bouillon could be so good! I use it to make quick veggies soup and I also put a tsp of this in the curry chicken that i made. The curry didn't taste exactly right but after a tsp of this stuff, it tasted great. This stuff is like instant seasoning to make everything taste better!  This is good good stuff. If you get it, remember to buy it from costco coz it's $6.89 there!
