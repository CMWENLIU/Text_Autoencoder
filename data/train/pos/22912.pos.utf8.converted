I was a bit worried about ordering these online, but do not fret, they are what you are looking for in a good durable natural casing for sausage stuffing.If you are just starting out like myself, only use a few strands at a time, I stuffed about 3 pounds into two strands. Also, you really want to soak them for at least 30 minutes and run warm water through them 3 or 4 times to get rid of all the salty taste.
