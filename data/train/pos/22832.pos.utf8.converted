I've put these wonderful chocolate oranges in my family's stockings for many years and Christmas wouldn't be the same without them.  The chocolate is smooth and creamy with a light orange flavor.  The candy is round and made up of sections.  Part of the novelty of this treat is in how you eat it.  The instructions tell you to smack the orange on a hard surface.  This will allow the sections to separate so you can eat your "orange" section by section.
