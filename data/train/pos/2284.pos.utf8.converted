I have tried out only two forms of chia seeds and I would have to say the texture of this one is by far the best.  The other two I have tried either still remained grainy/cold pressed and just felt them go down my throat.  But the texture on how these chia seeds smoothing out when mixed with liquid is the best.  Mixed with solid foods also doesn't give away any taste on how I may have cooked my meal.  I don't mind the small crunchiness and sprinkle them on just about everything I eat. Its great, I love them!
