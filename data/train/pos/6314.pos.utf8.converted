Just in case anyone is wondering, you get 3 full sized bags of marshmallows that are about 8.5 ounces each.<br /><br />Ive used them to make Rice Krispies and marshmallows, and it only takes about half a bag per box of Krispies to get the right mix. Finally after all these years I was able to mix up a bowl of my favorite cereal, and its all thanks to these wonderful marshmallows.
