This is great tea. It is by no means Viagra, but it never claimed to be. It is all natural. The taste is ok. Not like Green tea. It has it's own unique flavor that takes some getting used to.<br />Since everyone is different, I'll speak about the effect it has on me. I felt the same at first. I drank about 3 cups a day for a few days and then drank about 1 a day. After about a week I tested it out on a lady friend of mine. I must say it made me feel 20 years younger! I'm late 49 years old now going on 30. Mind you, I was healthy before. I run 7 miles a week, Lift a few weights 3X a week (Light)I also don't drink and don't have ED yet. I hope it makes your package younger like it did for me. There is the chance that it may not work for you at all. By the same rules, it may make you even younger than me! I keep it in my toolbox at work so I'm always supplied. I found that my attitude is much more relaxed and calm. It's like going from a 6, back to an 8 cylinder motor. They'll both get you there. One just burns more rubbers!! Have fun and stay safe from child support and other annoying disasters.<br />One thing that happened with my order was that I received only 1 of the six boxes. The paperwork said that the shipment was complete! The box they shipped it in could only hold maybe 3 boxes if there were no packing cushions. I called Amazon and they quickly resubmitted my order of 6, meaning that I got a free box for my trouble. Since they corrected it on the spot, I gave them and the tea 5 stars. I'm all about good customer service. Order soon, or I'll order the rest.
