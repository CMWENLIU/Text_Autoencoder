During a long night of searching the Amazon web site I came across this coffee deal for a price of $14.00 with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Since it was about $10.00 less for the same amount of coffee beans that I had purchased from Amazon in the last few months, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I have bought Hawaiian Kona whole bean coffee, Lavazza Super Crema Espresso whole bean coffee, and Starbucks Colombian whole bean coffee in my quest to find a good, reasonable priced coffee bean. But, even at the lower price that I paid, this ranks right up with the best of the more expensive coffees.<br /><br />It is smooth, full bodied, with no "after bite" in the back of the throat. It is not a dark Italian coffee, as some might use for espresso, but is what I would call a full flavored, and rich, breakfast blend, I prefer it to two other brands that I over paid twice to three times as much for.<br /><br />I did sign up for the Subscribe & Save simply because of the lower price, but now I'll use that account to continually receive this coffee once a month.
