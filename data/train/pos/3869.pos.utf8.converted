Ah, so many great uses for this great product. The texture and fine and smooth, very even, just like flour, but also very dry because the oil has been removed. If you want rice bran without the oil removed, don't buy packages labeled "stabilized."<br /><br />First of all, I use this to make an exfoliating face mask/scrub by making a paste using this mixed with a little bit of green tea, olive oil (or whatever carrier oil you like), and milk. I smooth a layer over my face, wait for it to dry, then jump in the shower, dampen it, and rub for about a minute before rinsing it off. The tiny grains exfoliate without being rough on the skin and it smells sooo good! (like rice :) My skin is much tighter and brighter afterwards and I put the leftovers in the fridge for another day. Plus, this is way cheaper than buying those rice bran face masks from Japan.<br /><br />I also use this as a partial substitute for flour in baking. It's very nutritious and causes my cookies to spread out a little flatter (maybe because it reacts differently to the baking soda?), but the taste of the cookies is not affected and I like crispy edged cookies.<br /><br />I also sprinkle this on white rice since this is the vitamin-packed part of the rice before the rice is processed. I sprinkle it in other dishes too, especially ones that require a little thickening. Overall this is a great product and I'd buy it again!
