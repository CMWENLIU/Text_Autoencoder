I give this product 5 stars, the price is zero stars.<br /><br />You can buy a case of 8 (not 6) jars at Whole Foods for $27.92 (thats $3.49 per jar) and then take 10 percent off for buying it in a case (which is right around 25 dollars.)  Obviously if you don't have access to a Whole foods, then paying these steep prices would have to do.  You should only buy tomato products in glass jars, since the acid pulls the chemicals out of the lining on metal cans.<br /><br />Too bad, I would have liked to buy these online, but looks like I will just buy a case from Whole Foods.
