It's hard to describe flavor, isn't it? I would compare the smoothness and body of this coffee to a Panama Boquete, but with a much more intense coffee flavor.<br /><br />When my order arrived today I immediately ground a sample and pulled a shot of espresso with my twenty year old Gaggia. Great crema on the first try. That tells me the beans are quite fresh.<br /><br />This is described as a dark roast. I'd describe it as something like "full city roast plus." It's dark...but not too dark. The beans are just to the point of releasing some oils, but not full on oily. The aroma upon opening the bag is great. And when grinding, that aroma just gets better.<br /><br />Regardless of crema, aroma and appearance, the proof is in the tasting and I can only say that this coffee gets very high marks. It is rich, low acid coffee with a great mouth feel and great coffee flavor. I think it's well worth a try and personally I know that I'll be ordering it again.
