I was super thrilled to see that amazon was selling these for such a great price. I know its not Halloween yet, but I'm just excited for the variety pack of chocolates. They're great to have in my dorm, but they seem to be going fast. My friends and roommate have already helped me plow through a bag.<br /><br />One thing though, amazon packages these in a heavy styrofoam box with ice packs inside of another box so they don't melt. I guess its nice for quality control, but it was super bulky.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I purchased this at $10, so given that you receive 2 bags resulting in each being only $5 I found it to be a good deal. Especially because shipping, when combined with another $10 candy item was still only $1.99.
