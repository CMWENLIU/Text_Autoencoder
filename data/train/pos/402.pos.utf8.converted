I used to eat tofu almost every. And i havn't had those for a while.<br />So i was searching and i was actually surprised that amzon has tofu!<br />I was Half-curious and Half-pleased!So i bought it..and i don't regret it.<br />It's Organic, cheap and doesn't need to be refrigerated until opend.<br />I just like to eat these by it self or with udon soup.<br />I am going to buy this again. So good..: )
