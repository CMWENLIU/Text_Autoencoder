OK, so if you're actually serving mashed potatoes from a box (erghhh...), you wouldn't want to TELL anyone, right?  WRONG!!  These are so good, it's worth bragging about them.  I was serving dinner for 12 from my open kitchen, a little behind on the cooking, and thus everyone saw (and gasped!) when I mixed the mashed potatoes just before serving.  My husband and I are generally considered a team of good cooks, and people were already wolfing down appetizers in preparation for what they fully expected would be an outstanding meal -- and here I was making mashed potatoes FROM A BOX??<br /><br />Well, several stuffy guests put token amounts of mashed potatoes on their plates and just moved them around on the plate, leaving them there when plates were cleared.  No one else said anything -- except that everyone else had seconds or even thirds on the potatoes, and *three* wives contacted me afterwards to find out where to buy the exact same box!!  Confession:  I'd have made the potatoes in advance and hidden the box if I'd had time.  Alas, I didn't.  Now, I wouldn't even bother trying to hide.  These potatoes are THAT good!!  We still have remnants in a box that's a year old (don't have mashed potatoes for dinner parties all that often, and use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUK7E">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Four Cheese, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a> in a smaller and even more convenient package for family use) -- and the potatoes from our old box were still GREAT last weekend!<br /><br />If you're a mashed potato lover, or if you cook for those who are, you owe it to yourself to try these.  I make great mashed potatoes from scratch, but these are just as good and take a whole lot less time (best part is not having to peel all those potatoes!).  This product is a huge win!!!
