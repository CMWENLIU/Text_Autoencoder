First, I'll respond to whomever said this brand doesn't come in a 26 oz. jar so this item description is misleading.  All I can say is that I bought it at Sam's and I'm looking at it right now.  My husband told me he also saw a smaller jar at the local Harp's, but yes, this product definitely comes in a 26 oz. jar.<br /><br />Second, I don't know why anyone would say it's runny.  Maybe other brands are, but the MaraNatha All Natural No Stir Almond Butter Creamy is definitely not runny.  I find it to be very smooth for what it is, but it probably isn't as smooth as one could expect from overly-processed peanut butter.  This has a much more natural texture.  It is a little bit thicker than peanut butter, but ultimately, it's still very spreadable.<br /><br />Finally, I have to agree that the price here on Amazon is way too high.  We can buy the same size jar locally for about $7 I think.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.  I have problems keeping my "good" cholesterol high enough so this almond product is perfect for me.  I love to put it on Ritz crackers as a snack.
