I love this bread mix!  It is really as close to regular bread that I have found since going gluten-free.  This bag sets up to make 20 loaves of bread (3-1/2 cups each).  You will need to add 2-1/4 tsp of yeast to the mix.  I use a bread maker.  Nice thing for this mix is that you can use a regular cycle and don't need a gluten-free maker.<br /><br />Down side of this large sack is that it does not give you the recipe!  So, here it is for a bread maker:<br /><br />Pamela's Best Gluten-Free Bread mix<br /><br />3-1/2 cups Pamela's bread flour<br />2 large eggs<br />1/4 cup oil<br />Hot water<br />2-1/4 tsp yeast<br /><br />In 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure first the oil, add the two eggs to the container, fill the container up to the 2 cups mark with hot water.  Add 2 tbsp hot water.  Pour into bread maker pan.  Add the Pamela's bread flour to the of the egg mix.  Make a shallow well at the top of the flour mix and put the yeast into it.  Put into bread maker.  Set the bread maker at 1.5 lbs and at medium color.  When the bread maker is at mix, use a spatula to scrape the sides and corners to help mix the flour in. Remove the pan right after it is done baking (do not allow to remain in the bread maker for the warm cycle after baking).<br /><br />Remove from the bread pan immediately and cool on a wire rack.  Use butter to coat the outside while warm.  Cool before cutting.  Enjoy!<br /><br />For regular baking, you will have to look at a mix.
