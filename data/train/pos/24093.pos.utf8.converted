Amazingly delicious and convenient.  I love the 3 bean-salad right out of the can or added to rice, eggs, pasta ... anything.  Even my carnivore husband likes it.  I keep several cans in the pantry so I always have something fast, tasty and nutritious ready to eat as a snack or meal.  It is also a great gift.
