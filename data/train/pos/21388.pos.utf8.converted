If I am correct this is a new addition to the Olive Garden wine selection. I believe this wine is an excellent starter wine for any individual who does not like stronger red wines. In terms of sweetness it is a little less sweet than the moscato that olive garden carries. Personally, I love this wine. I had a glass after dinner and for me it was the perfect wine. Not too sweet, not too bitter, but just right. If you are new to wine I would recommend this wine or if you are looking for something a little sweeter. Hope this helps someone.
