Mrs. May Trio bars are the best nutrition/snack I've ever tried.  The strawberry and the blueberry flavors are my favorites.  I have to watch my appetite because these pack a wallop of 170 calories per bar.  The price is very fair and I like to take these when I travel as they pack easy and beat the junk food at the airports by a mile.
