I love this tea very much. It smells good and it tastes good. I drink a cup every morning before breakfast and before going to bed. It has helped me to get rid of a lot of excess water....I feel so much lighter and I have lost 10 lbs since I began drinking it a month ago. It's especially good for the liver and for the kidneys...it makes you pee a lot, which is very good. I recommend this tea to everyone.
