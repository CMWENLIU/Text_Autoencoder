This seems to be the preferred nice and juicy meal for my fussy eater, Sweet Cee Cee. She dives into the dish and afterwards looks at me, and licks her chops as if to say to me "now wasn't that NICE!!!"<br /><br />To the human nose it's pretty smelly, but I guess to Cee Cee it's nectar and ambrosia.<br /><br />This is one of many of Fancy Feast's diverse selections on "the menu".
