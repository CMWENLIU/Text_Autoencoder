This green powder is SO good, I just had to get the word out. Others I've tried (Whole Foods brand, Barlean's Greens, Berry Green, many others) literally taste just like grass clippings, so you have no choice but to mix it with juice or a smoothie. THIS green superfood is palatable enough to drink just mixed with water! (Let me explain: do not expect it to be SWEET. This is a veggie drink, but it has an ever-so-slight hint of raspberry that's pleasing to the tongue when you gulp it down.)<br /><br />Healthwise, I've notice that my skin has gotten clearer, my energy levels have evened out, and I've harly even gotten a cough, let alone a cold, in the several years I've been drinking this- and I work with the sick and elderly.<br /><br />Yes, there is sediment, but that is because this drink has FIBER in it- the kind that is naturally in fruits and veggies.<br /><br />Accept it for what it is, compare it to the alternatives, and imagine how incredibly amazing you will feel. Then make your decision.
