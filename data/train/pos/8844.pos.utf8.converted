As a boy in New York, I loved to go to the soda fountain and have a coke and a .10 bag of Wise Potato Sticks. French's Potato Sticks are as good (or better) than my childhood favorites. The foil package also keeps them very fresh.<br />I have ordered this product several times over the years--not a single bad experience. Enjoy!
