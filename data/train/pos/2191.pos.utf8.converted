I absolutely love this coconut water.  Amy & Brian's in general is better than any that I've tried.  To me, the other brands have a "chalky" mouthfeel after you swallow.  Amy & Brian's is very clean, and has a very light yellow tint, rather than a pink tint like the others I've tried.  The original is very good, but I love lime, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I'm hooked!  Like I said, it has a very "clean" taste, and the lime is definitely there, but it is not at all sour.  It really does kind of taste like a flat lemon-lime soda would taste, or lemon lime Gatorade, minus the salt.  I do not drink soda or any other sugary drinks, and haven't for 16 years, so I really am not accustomed to sweet beverages, but Amy & Brian's is definitely sweeter than others I've tried. It is also very replenishing.  I drink this when I exercise and also before and after I drink alcohol.  It is very good, I think you will love it!
