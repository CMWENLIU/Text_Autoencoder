Just made a Green Tea Latte with this stuff and it is quite good.  This is an excellent price for this quantity of organic tea from Japan.  I don't ever drink matcha traditionally prepared, but I do enjoy it in cooking, sweet beverages, and ice cream.  This particular tea has a very light, green, fresh grassy taste and I'm glad I'll be able to enjoy so much of it at this price.
