We have had active starters in the house for most of the last 30 years in all climates and altitudes.  Most were started from scratch and a few used starter "kits".  After my mother-in-law A)asked me to make some sourdough bread for an upcoming family get together, and B) proudly stated that she had "tossed out that stinky, sticky stuff in the jar" we decided to give this starter a try. Turns out this has the best flavor without a doubt of any of my starters over the years.<br /><br />Our experience is that all starters seem to have "personality" and not just the flavor.  This one is easy to care for, smells and tastes great and activates really quickly.  I can't recall a starter producing this many of the bubbles and holes that help make sourdough distinctive.<br /><br />The seller's videos, recipes and advice are straight forward and practical.<br /><br />In summary, can't say enough good things about this cost effective way to get a starter.
