My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do. Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made. We like the rolled method better than the drop, but either way these are easy, quick and consistently great biscuits. As good a true southern biscuit as even my grandmother used to make! My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy & biscuits breakfast.
