THERE IS NOTHING MUCH TO SAY, EXCEPT THAT I PURCHASED THESE ITEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD TO FIND IN THE LOCAL STORES AND WHEN YOU DO FIND THEM , THEY ARE A BIT EXSPENSIVE, SO WHEN I SAW THAT AMAZON HAD THEM AND I REMEMBERED THAT I PURCHASED A LARGE QUANITY A FEW YEARS AGO AND THAT THE PRICE WAS GREAT, I ORDERED TWO LARGE PACKS. I ALSO MANAGED TO EAT THEM ALL WITHIN  ABOUT 10 DAYS, BUT THAT'S OK THEY DIDN'T MAKE ME FAT... JUST HAPPY.
