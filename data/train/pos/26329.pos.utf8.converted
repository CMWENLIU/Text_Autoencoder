This prosciutto is the best also known as Parma ham.<br /><br />For anyone not familiar,Parma is where it's made. Sciutto translates to dry.<br /><br />A bit salty but makes an impression on the palette. An impression you're bound to love. I believe this is the best prosciutto and I buy mine at a nearby deli who always keeps it fresh.<br /><br />One of my favorites is putting it over ham.<br /><br />I'm sure most people have tried it and I just want to review it cause I love it so much.
