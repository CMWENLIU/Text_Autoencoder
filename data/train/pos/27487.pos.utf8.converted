I use tahini primarily to make hummus dip for fresh vegetables and pita bread.  This is a fresh tahini paste (vs roasted) with a fresh nutty-sesame flavor.  This tahini is more liquid than other tahini that I have purchased.  You may need to adjust your hummus ingredients to use less liquid to get the consistency you prefer.  The current price point of $5.00/lb ($30 for 6 pounds) is OK (previously very reasonably priced from $3.00 to $3.79 per pound.) In addition, 6 pounds is a huge quantity for me despite my liking for hummus.<br /><br />Hummus can be prepared in 5 minutes in a food processor if you start with canned or cooked chick peas. You may need to stir the tahini before using as it tends to separate. Start with 1 clove garlic; chop and then mince in the food processor; add a 15 oz can (drained,reserve liquid) chick peas, 1/3 cup tahini, 1/3 cup olive oil. Mix and process at high speed until smooth; adjust thickness with reserved liquid as needed.  Add seasonings such as salt, pepper, cummin or lemon juice to taste.<br /><br />Whether you call it tahini or tahina, this sesame seed paste is also used to make halvah, a  candy and debis which is the Middle East  version of peanut butter and jelly.<br /><br />This product: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2CW">Al Wadi Tahina, 100% Ground Sesame, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>
