If you're diabetic or just a low carb eater, you have to try these brownies.  Half a softened stick of butter, one egg, the powder mix, 15 minutes at 350 degrees F, and you will be a very happy camper.  These are really good and virtually indistinguishable from a "regular" brownie.  And these have lots of nice baby chocolate chips in them too!<br /><br />Prepared as directed, I found these a teensy dry, which a little more butter or two tablespoons of water will remedy, along with baking the minimum time- check with a knife inserted in the center coming out cleanly.<br /><br />Just shop this item a little.  I have found this product elsewhere on the 'net for as low as $4.29 and will keep this in mind before repurchasing... which I definitely will do.
