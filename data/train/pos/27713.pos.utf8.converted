I was curious about the differnce between the two mixes and called the company.  There is only one difference:  All Natural mix uses  natural real vanilla and it is only sold in retail packages. The Original mix uses artificial vanilla flavoring.  That's it! The taste for both products is the same: Great!  Natural is our choice.<br /><br />In our opinion, the mix makes great pancakes and excellent waffles.  The malted flaver is more distinct in the pancakes. Enjoy!
