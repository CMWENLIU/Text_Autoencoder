This tea is amazing. I love it. I didn't think I'd like it, especially the chocolate/mate notes, because I hate coffee and I've found that tea with chocolate tends to have a coffee taste to me and I don't like it. But this is awesome! It's beat out my usual morning Earl Grey and I'd certainly drink a lot more of it if it was easier to find. Amazon appears to be out of it. Two other sites I tried ordering from were out and the store I originally bought it from said it wasn't part of their regular inventory and wasn't something they were planning to stock again. I think Tazo hates me. This is the second tea of theirs I've fallen in love with and can't seem to get my hands on.
