Excellent product!! I have found that coconut oil can be used in any way you would use oil or butter. It has a very mild coconut flavor----nothing that would really alter the taste of what you're preparing. It can take high heat cooking without breaking down. (All the benefits of olive oil are destroyed with high heat). It doesn't need refrigeration----another plus. Tastes great on toast. Too bad the good things about coconut oil have been surpressed for so many years. It seems to be one of the healthy fats instead of all the synthetics (e.g. margarine) and hydrogenated products on the market.<br />Must be organic, unprocessed, & cold pressed to have all the good benefits.
