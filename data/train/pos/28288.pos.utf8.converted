Mrs. Miller uses cane sugar in the jelly. It makes a world of difference in both taste and consistency. The jellies using corn sweetener all seem gummy and their taste degrades after being open for a few days even if refrigerated. This jelly is the closest to my grandmother's home made I have ever found.
