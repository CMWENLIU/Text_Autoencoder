Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of "buck$" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with "chocolat chaud" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.<br /><br />At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!<br /><br />Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!<br /><br />OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a "bowl of soul," a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie.
