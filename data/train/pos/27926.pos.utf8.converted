I was a little skeptical when I saw this at the local WF store, but picked up a 6-pack to put the product to the test. Boy howdy, did Zevia get this one right! It's a delicious approximation of it's Mountain Dew source of inspiration. It has a crisp feel to the body, rather than what I perceive as MD's thick/oily feel. Definitely a stronger hint of grapefruit in this citrus mix. An all-around lovely drink.<br /><br />At the time of this review, the product was not available from Amazon.
