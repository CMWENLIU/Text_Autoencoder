I am no cacao expert but these seem like very good quality. At first I thought it was too bitter, but then I got addicted to them. Now I am munching on these throughout the day. I also found a good education article about organic raw cacao here that has encouraged me to eat more: [...]<br /><br />Just a caution to new consumers out there - these are strong and potent. If you eat too many, the effect is somewhat similar to coffee - your heart begins to race and your mind gets overactive with difficulty to focus.
