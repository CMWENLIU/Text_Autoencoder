This is my first review ever, and it's in response to the only other review posted by Deb S. and putting this at a "2".  I have never tasted the brand which she describes and will plan to some day, but at this point I have tried several brands and place this at the top of them thus far. Therefore,<br />until I find better, I'll have to give this a 5. Let's face it, nougat by its nature is "too sweet" but that is also why we eat it. I agree there's a lightness about the Bellino, but this is exactly what makes it stand out: it accentuates all the subtle flavors under the sweetness...the honey, the almonds, and even the wafer itself. Quite the best so far! Enjoy!
