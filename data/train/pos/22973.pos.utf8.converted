I love harvest cheddar sunchips, which is why I ordered them, but buying them directly like this, wow, they are so much fresher than I've ever tasted buying them from the store or fast food restaurant.  Yum.<br /><br />I was surprised, not only at the freshness, but that they arrived in great shape, too.  No smashed bags or itty bitty broken pieces.  Very pleased.  Now, I just have to find somewhere to store 60 bags! ;-)
