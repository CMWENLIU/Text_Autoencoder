Thanks to those who reviewed this tea, and who referred to this brand in other reviews.  Have enjoyed Yogi & Celestial Seasonings "sleepy" teas in the past.  Celestial, well, bought for price & decided not to buy again for lack of taste & no individual wrappings to keep tea fresh.  Favored Yogi, especially when Amazon has on sale, but even at regular price, beats grocery store.  Now that I've tried Good Earth, I think I'm pretty much sold on it.  Just as good if not better than Yogi.  Husband (the coffee drinker in the family) even likes it.  I was a bit leary about buying 6 boxes without trying it first, but I was not disappointed & will buy again.  I suggest definately worth a try if you enjoy tea before bed to help relax for sleep.  Does it really help me sleep?  Well it can't hurt right?
