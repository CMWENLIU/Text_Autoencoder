Citric acid is one of those incredibly useful items to have on hand. I use it mainly for cleaning tasks such as:<br /><br />> cleaning coffee machines - works much better than vinegar at removing hard water deposits.<br /><br />> cleaning hot water pots - as above. Much easier and less smell than using vinegar.<br /><br />> cleaning dishwashers - add a couple of tablespoons and run the dishwasher through a cycle when it is empty. Makes the interior sparkle like new.<br /><br />> boosting dishwasher detergent performance - add a small amount (about a teaspoon or less) to dishwasher detergent. Really boosts the cleaning power and eliminates hazy dishes. Be careful not to use too much, however, since it can pit delicate glass or metal.<br /><br />> cleaning steam cleaners, steam mops and irons - gets all the crud out.<br /><br />Basically, this is the best cleaner for anything that is affected by hard water deposits. You can buy commercial products such as Cleancaf or other similar cleaners, but the main active ingredient is citric acid. You can get it bulk at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />The only downside is that this comes packaged in a thin plastic sack. The first thing you'll want to do is transfer it to a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Makes it much easier to store and use. Regardless of the container, citric acid clumps up easily when there's humidity in the air, but that does not affect its performance. Just bust up the clump and you're good to go. The shelf life is indefinite when you use it as a cleaning product.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
