This coffee is great!  The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly.  I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting "steam locks" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded "steam lock"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn't open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don't put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to "break up the coffee" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.
