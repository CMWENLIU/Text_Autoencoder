The senior cat in our fairly finicky 3-cat household has a foot injury that's taking a very long time to heal, so I've had to close off feline access to the patio where my cats like to graze. Hairball upchucks ensued in short order.  The Cosmic grass seed from the pet store was a big hit, but it's been out of stock for weeks now. Which is how we came to try this. Was a tad worried about how quickly my guys would do away with the contents of such a wee small garden-in-a-bag. But the crop it produced  is much more dense than other kitty grasses we've tried and is still going strong after a couple of weeks on the floor next to their water dish--despite heavy use. It often gets tipped over, but since nothing ever spills out, that's not a problem. My cats, for some reason, won't eat snipped grass scattered over their food. They will only chomp greenery straight from the source. This product is perfect for that.<br /><br />Update 11/30/11: First batch lasted a full five weeks.  Have ordered more.
