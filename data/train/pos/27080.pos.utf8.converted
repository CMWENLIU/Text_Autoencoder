Tired of the same old Colombian every morning?  This makes a great change of pace.  The slight bitterness of the chickory may surprise you if you've never had it before; but you get over that quickly and find yourself enjoying a deliciously rich cup of New Orleans.  Of course, if you've visited New Orleans, you know what I mean.  I use this for about every third pot,just for that wake up.  Yet, it could be daily,it's that good. The other major brand?  Well, I doubt that you'd find much difference.  If you try both at once, let us know.<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon could ship fresh beignets.  Well, I see they do have mixes; so if you're ambitious, go at it.
