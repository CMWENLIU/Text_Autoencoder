Ok, so this isn't Starbucks Via, but it is a fraction of the cost of Via AND it is organic which is important to me. I think that, though delicious, Via tastes like Espresso. Mount Hagen tastes like coffee. Good coffee. Unlike many instant brands, Mount Hagen does not taste burnt or bitter. It is smooth and mellow. If you like a stong cup of coffee, maybe don't go for these single serve packets... try the jars instead. For me, one packet produces a smooth, medium bodied cuppa that I will continue to purchase and enjoy daily. I love Via, but it is too expensive and I see no reason to give Mount Hagen a low rating because I also enjoy a different brand that I can't afford. I'm glad to have found this product and highly recommend it.
