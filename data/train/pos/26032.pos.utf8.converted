We love this tuna!  A while back our store revamped itself and stopped carrying Genova.  We asked them if they would bring it back, but so far it hasn't happened.  So when we found we could order it through Amazon.com we jumped at the opportunity.  Thank you.  Now we're going to order another case so we won't run out.  Life is Good
