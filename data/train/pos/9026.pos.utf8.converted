My cats are just nuts about this food.  I transitioned them (one is 10 and the other is almost 12) to Evolution about 4 years ago with some trepidation. I read _The Obligate Carnivore_ and being vegan myself was persuaded to give vegan cat food a try. At the time my oldest kitty, Daisy, was on prescription cat food (Science Diet, I think) that I could only purchase from the vet--she had a history of urinary tract infections. Even while eating the prescription food she would occasionally have flair ups. Since she's been eating Evolution she has not had even one flair up. In fact, she's practically abusive about having a full bowl at all times. Even her vet (who doesn't know that Daisy's food is vegan) is astonished at how youthful she appears and acts. That's all the evidence I needed to feed my girls an animal free diet.
