This honey has an exceptional flavor. It's very sooth, as well as a beautiful amber hue. The flavor resembles the common Clover Honey. It's great in teas because it has a subtle honey flavor, which doesn't hinder the flavor of the tea. I would highly recommend it if you are someone that is looking for a mellow, yet still flavorful honey.
