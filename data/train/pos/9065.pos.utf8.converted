I damaged my vocal cords when I was a kid, so I lose my voice often and I am also prone to getting a sore throat VERY often . A friend of mine recommended this tea to me about four years ago and it is incredible!<br /><br />It tastes delicious. I usually let the tea bag steep for 10 or 15 minutes to develop the full flavor. It is soothing and really does "coat" your throat so it doesn't burn or scratch or hurt. It is almost like a natural organic anesthetic. I highly recommend it to anyone with a sore throat. Try it once, and you will be a fan for life.
