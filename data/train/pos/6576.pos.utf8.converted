I ordered this oatmeal on a whim one day after running out of Quaker and being too lazy to go to the grocery store. I was pleasantly surprised; the flavor is better than Quaker and the nutritional profile is better as well, particularly the amount of protein and fiber in the oatmeal.<br /><br />The flavor is mild and not overly sweet like flavored microwavable oatmeal can sometimes be. The oats do not clump together into a mush, but stay whole after microwaving like the higher quality oatmeals do.<br /><br />Basically, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just wanted oatmeal, and was very pleasantly surprised, especially for the price and convenience. I will be ordering again as well as trying the other flavors.
