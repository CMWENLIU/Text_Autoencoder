We are very impressed with Wine Country Gift Baskets.  We ordered the soup basket for our elderly relative, but unfortunately there was too much sodium for her to enjoy the soup.  She called Wine Country Gift Baskets to explain her dilemma, and they very graciously sent her another basket absolutely complimentary.  They did all this before Christmas so she could enjoy her new holiday gift basket.  We certainly appreciate their efforts because they helped make a holiday brighter for someone else at their own expense.  We give them a big THANK YOU !!!!!!!!
