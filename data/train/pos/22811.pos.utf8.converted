Alright, for those who are not in the know, Cincinnati style chili has almost nothing to do with the firey bowl of red that most people think of when they think "chili."  In some ways this style of chili has more in common with a stew called "burgoo" then with Southwestern Chili.<br /><br />What does it taste like?  Well, for starters it is savory rather than spicy.  It is also sweeter, which generally comes from the spices used (cinnamon, allspice, and cloves are not uncommon) and the use of chocolate.  If you are familiar with the chili at the Steak & Shake chain of restaurants, it bears some similarities.  (I dont want to over do the comparison, but I want to give people a frame of reference.)  The resulting concoction is very flavorful but it doesnt really stand up on its own.  As a result you rarely find people eating a bowl of Cincy chili by itself.  Most often it is combined with other items to make the famous Chili 3-way, 4-way, 5-way's etc.  For example, "chili 3-way" means Cincy chili over spaghetti, topped with a large amount of finely shredded cheddar cheese.  Add raw chopped onion to that and you've got 4-way (my favorite).  Add kidney beans to 4-way and you got 5-way.  And that is the beauty of this stuff, you can dress it up the way you like.<br /><br />Now, in Cincy there are a number of places that sell this stuff...and I never lived there.  I did live in Dayton for a year and came to love this stuff.  Skyline is the chain most people are familiar with and they make my favorite chili for 4-way.  Gold Star is another chain many people prefer.  I'm a little weird as I think the Gold Star coney is superior to the Skyline...but in general I like the Skyline product better.<br /><br />However, making this at home was often a problem.  The Skyline mixes and frozen products always disappointed.  Gold Star had more success with their frozen chili, but when I moved away from the area even that wasn't an option.<br /><br />Enter Cincinnati Recipe Chili.  This stuff works really well.  It is absurdly simple to make (all you need is water, ground beef and a can of tomato paste) and the resulting chili is pretty close in taste to Skyline.  Now, you can find recipes online to make Cincy chili from scratch and they can work as well, but for ease of use and good flavor I most often use this mix.<br /><br />So, if you are an Ohio ex-pat who wants a taste of home, or someone who just wants to try something different this is a good place to start.
