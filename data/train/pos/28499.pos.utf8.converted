I've had regular quinoa before and although I did like it, it was a bit gritty. I wanted to give the pasta a try. I read some of the other reviews for this brand, I knew when ordering that this particular brand wasn't glutten-free. I like the taste( on the whole wheat tasting-side). It really came down to what my husband thought since he loves his pasta and since he liked it as well, I will be ordering this again. Oh, & I wanted to mention that on the box it says to boil your pasta for 6-9 minutes. I had to let it boil for a few extra minutes since I thought it was a little too on the al dente side.
