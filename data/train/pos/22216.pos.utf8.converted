I'm very picky about chai teas because I don't like them to have too much "spice" in the after taste; basically, I don't like the black pepper too much. But this chai latte has the perfect blend - it's not too much, nor too little. I was addicted from the first sip. And I love that once it's brewed and steaming in my cup, I don't need to add anything to it! This is my favorite thing to brew into my travel mug and take with me on the ride to school in the morning. Just brew and go! Very soothing for sitting in stressful traffic.
