Item arrived today, unbelieveably fast delivery! Was very impressed with packaging. Each bully stick is indivdually wrapped with product info on tag. When I ordered them, the description did not specify what country they were made in so I was concerned because I absolutely refuse to feed my dogs anything made in China. The price however was so awesone, I decided to give them a try. Was very pleased to find they are made in Brazil. My dogs were going crazy for them before I could even get the wrapping off. As far as one reviewer stating the odor was strong, that is another reason I DID order them because the dogs LIKE the smelley things better where they will not touch products I have purchased in the past that were odor free. To me, the odor was not an issue. It was no stronger then the ones I have seeked out in local retail stores by sniffing each one before purchasing with the hopes my dogs would chew on them. I am enrolled in autoship and as long as the quality continues I will continue to purchase this product on a preselected schedule.<br /><br />2/17/2011 Update: Just received my autoship delivery today. Dogs love them just as much now as when we first ordered. Actually have doubled my autoship order because my mom's Weimer loves them too! Still highly recommend.
