Abuelita is a Mexican chocolate drink. It comes in tablets or packet form, but I prefer the tablets. The directions call for you to use one entire tablet, but I would think that would be too much. I use about 1/3 of a tablet and 2 1/2 cups of milk. You heat the milk until it is warm enough, but do not boil. When blended, it creates a nice froth. I like to have Abuelita before bed. It must be something about the warm milk and subtle chocolate and cinnamon flavor, but regardless of how wired I am, Abuelita puts me right to sleep.It has a complex, but lovely flavor. The bottom of the mug can be a bit gritty if not fully blended, but even that is not unpleasant. Try Abuelita and you will be able to swear off any sleeping pills!
