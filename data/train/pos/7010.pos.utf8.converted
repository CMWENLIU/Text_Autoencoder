Excellent quality rice. This rice is especially good for those who are iffy on the taste of brown rice as this rice has a much milder flavor profile. The whole family enjoys this rice.  Admittedly, I purchased this rice from an Asian market for less than $20 and do not plan on ordering from Amazon. But if you don't live close to an ethnic market and want a high quality, mild tasting brown rice, this is your brand.
