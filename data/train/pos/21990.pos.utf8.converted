I tried this after years of being a "no cake mix" snob. found it in south carolina, and can't find it up here in n.j. it is delicious. everyone who tastes it loves it. and it's embarrassingly easy. tip: make an icing out of cream cheese, powdered sugar and a tiny bit of maple flavoring and chopped pecans. worth every calorie.
