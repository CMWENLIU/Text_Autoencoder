I originally purchased the 5-bin carousel directly from Tassimo, and I wanted another one because I routinely use about 10 different types of T-Discs.  For some reason, Tassimo stopped offering their carousel except to their "European cafe collection" customers.  The only other carousel I could find was this one, the Nifty Home Products carousel.  It is a little smaller, 4 bins instead of 5, and does not have the holder for the cleaning disc like the Tassimo holder.  I didn't think I would like it as well.  As it turns out, I like it just as well if not better.  It is an attractive carousel, and it spins better than the Tassimo carousel.  Although its capacity is slightly less, it is not bad.  It can hold full stacks of 4 different T-discs, or, if you don't mind taking T-discs out of both the bottom and the top of each bin, it can hold half-stacks of 8 different T-discs.  And the price on Amazon is great.  I definitely recommend this carousel.
