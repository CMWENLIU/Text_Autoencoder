We have the vanilla flavor of this almond beverage.  I can't say that it tastes pleasant by itself.  BUT, I have been using it to bake with - it is especially wonderful in muffins.  Any baked item that calls for milk, I would recommend trying this in.  The 8 oz. size are really convenient.  Lots of recipes call for 1 cup of milk.  I look forward to trying it in homemade ice cream also.
