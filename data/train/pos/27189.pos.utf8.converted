If you love a great drama filled with lots of action, mingled with some wonderful light-hearted moments, set against the backdrop that is Hawaiian Paradise then you will love Jake and The Fatman, Series 2. Some haunting music, great guest stars and storylines that are engaging and often poignant, will lead you down a magical path that pays tribute to the skill of the police and law enforcement offices in Honolulu, the breathtaking beauty of the islands and their people and the charismatic performances of the stars. Highly recommended, highly valued and often watched. Love it.
