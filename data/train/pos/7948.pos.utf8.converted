If you are looking for a real salami this is the product you want to buy. Having traveled and worked in Italy, I can say this salami is as good as its get, considering it is crafted in the US! We are from Switzerland, living in the US for the last 10 years and often brought back Salami from Italy when we were in Europe (well, we know how the guys at the border control would respond to our treasures...). So I was very pleased to find a "legal" source in the US to buy a GOOD salami. But on the other hand, you need to have the taste-buts for this kind of sausage! Enjoy!
