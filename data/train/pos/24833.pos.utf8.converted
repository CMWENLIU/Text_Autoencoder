"fluffy"?, no. I will add some more milk next time as a previous poster mentioned to lighten them up just a bit. I did think they were fabulously tasty :) After dinner tonight I thought, I'll have to see if Amazon carries these; sure enough they do, and at a good price.. esp. w/subscribe & save. YUM. I just changed my rating to 5 stars from 4 cause i remembered that on top of being tasty, easy and affordable, they are also organic!!
