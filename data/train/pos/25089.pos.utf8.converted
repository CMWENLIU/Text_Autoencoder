I really like Jasmine rice but locally it is usually cost prohibitive OR comes in huge quantities. This is a happy medium and delivered right to my door. It's a welcome change to the rice selections at the grocery store. For those the use rice as a gravy vehicle, this is too good for that, any old rice will do.
