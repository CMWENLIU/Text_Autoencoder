I purchased the AeroGarden and set it up back in Febuary of 08' and just now the herb seed kit I used is finally at an end.  It's already June!  So, when they say you should expect four months of produce, I would say that is very accurate.  Here are some main points about the product:<br /><br />* It is very easy to set up.  Requires no tools, very minimal effort, everything fits together or snaps into place.  You plug it in and it's ready to go.<br /><br />*The "light" stays on for 16 hours on the herb setting (there are different settings for different seed kits).  When you set it up make sure that you plug it in according to when you would like to it to come on and turn off.  I had mine running from about 6:45pm to 11:45am the next day.  Makes a nice night-light too!<br /><br />*If the power goes out, or if you move it, it will automatically restart the growing schedule it was on.<br /><br />*Make sure to pay ATTENTION to the directions that come with the seed packs.  They suggest you place the herbs in a certain order so that they will all have the correct amount of light and water.  Don't just place them where you want them, they won't all grow properly if you do.  Also, do not remove the plastic covers on the seed packs until the plant inside has reached the top of the cover!!<br /><br />*As the plants get bigger (and they will!) they will require you to add water much more often so be mindful and check to make sure the water level light isn't blinking daily.<br /><br />*It doesn't say this in the booklet, at least anywhere that I can find anyway but if you are growing herbs, cut them frequently when its time to harvest because this encourages them to continue to produce.  Parsley, cilantro, dill and chives grow much better when harvested frequently.<br /><br />*Be prepared!  This product does work.  I have basil coming out of my ears!  You have to make sure that as the plants start to get taller you try and keep them away from the grow lights in the top of the unit.  It tends to scorch them if they are too close to the light, so try getting them to grow out a little.  Even the highest setting (meaning as far as it will go above the plants) sometimes isn't enough, they will keep on going!<br /><br />Overall, I have been very pleased with this product.  The herbs are very handy to have around, esp during the winter when you can't garden outside.  The unit is not heavy or bulky, I was actually rather suprised.  It doesn't take up much space, however, I have a very large amount of counter space and I opted to put the AeroGarden on an iron plant stand by the sliding door.  It's out of the way and gets the extra light from the window as well.  I don't have anything bad to say about it this far.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS and it will work for anyone.  You do not need any sort of green thumb to run this thing.  ;-)
