This product is great.  I made homemade raisin filled cookies for christmas and my family loves them.  The filling tastes just like the homemade kind.  You can't buy raising pie filling in stores anymore and I don't exactly have the time to cook the raisins and make my own so I tried this product.  It's perfect.
