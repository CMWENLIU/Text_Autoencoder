I have tried many brands of coconut milk and this is by far the best.  At least 1/2 the can is the thick coconut paste prized in so many recipes.  The only ingrediant is coconut extract, oh and water.  Every can is the same, no inconsistency from can to can.  I have a hard time not scooping it from the can directly into my mouth.  Have used this in rice, soups, curries, marinades, cakes/cupcakes and drinks.<br /><br />I understand they make an organic product that is not as good due to an emulsifier, but haven't tried it myself.
