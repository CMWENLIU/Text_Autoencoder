This company really sends out a great sour dough starter and instructions.  I recommend you also buy the Sour Dough Starter Kit that comes with the wide mouth jar and recipe book.  We followed their instruction exactly and the bread turned out better than any Sour Dough that we can purchase from a store, really nice and chewy, and is incredible when toasted.  They show you how to make it extra sour by "feeding" it with more flour and water over time.  We used pure filtered water and King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour in our recipe, my wife and I really got excited about how great it tasted.  We let it rise 2 times, and did an extra rise overnight.  The dough was so bouncy that I am going to try and make pizza dough next.  I tried other sour dough companies on Amazon, but this one is the best.  As a native San Franciscan I appreciate great sour bread, and this is the greatest.  Just be sure to give it extra "feedings" in order to get that extra sour taste. Making this type of bread takes TLC, but the time you put into it will pay big dividends.  It is going to be fun trying their other starters, such as the Alaskan and Italian starters.  We are into Whole Foods and like to cook things ourselves so we know what is in the product.  The recipe we used had flour, starter, water, honey, milk, and salt, that's it hard to believe it made such wonderful bread.
