whoever wrote a bad review obviously isn't using these right. I have one trap with 31, yes thirty-one moths, and the other has 15 (fifteen) trapped inside. We have an air conditioner that isn't completely sealed in a window near one and I think it even attracted a few from outside and trapped them. So it captures the males no problem. But that's what you want to break the cycle in a cheap and effective way without poisoning yourself, the planet, your kids or your pets right? These work!
