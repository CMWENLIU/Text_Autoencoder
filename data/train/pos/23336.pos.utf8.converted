This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry. I have had no negative reactions though by using this product. I am very happy to discover Xylitol which came from other people's reviews.
