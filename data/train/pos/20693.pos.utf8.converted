I can hardly believe how tasty this stuff is. I was first introduced to stevia sweetener in the Sobe Lifewater drinks. I knew that I had to find some for at-home use. I now use it regularly in my breakfast tea, smoothies, etc. Since they're in the packets, I haven't tried Truvia in baking, but I can say that it is great in drinks. Also, I don't experience any digestive problems or gross aftertaste that people often get with other types of sugar substitutes like aspartame or sucralose.<br /><br />Purchasing it on Amazon is an amazing deal. With this quantity I won't be running out of it anytime soon, but I'll definitely be back for more.
