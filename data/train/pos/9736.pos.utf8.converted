Dilmah's Ran Watte tea is exactly how they describe it, "Golden orange color. Elegant structure, like a fine Champagne".  It is not your traditional tea!  For tea drinkers who don't like BIG tea's, this is an excellent choice.  It's light, flavorful, delightful to drink and is a real leaf tea.  You'll know what I mean after you brew a cup.  I brew mine in an IngenuiTEA maker for a perfect cup.
