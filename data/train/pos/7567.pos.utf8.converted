I love soup cups because they are quick, easy and don't create a lot of mess to clean up. Most soup cups, especially in grocery stores are way too high in sodium to be even remotely healthy. These Dr McDougall's soups address all of these issues. They are Vegan, and even if you are not, you will find them tasty and good for you. Plus, if you have allergies, the odds are with vegan foods, that what you are allergic to isn't in here.<br /><br />Not all of the nutrition information is shown, so here goes: 200 calories, NO FAT, NO CHOLESTEROL, Sodium 360mg [a lot lower than I've seen in any other brand of soup cup], Carbs 35 grams, Fiber 9 grams, PROTEIN 13 GRAMS. It's a good source of Vitamin A and Iron. If you are a veggie person, you know that you have to pay attention to make sure you get enough protein. This is a great source, especially for a 200 calorie serving. The cup, by the way, is larger than most. It's a very satisfying serving.<br /><br />Other than the dehydrated peas, the other ingredients are in a foil pouch inside the cup. I can only assume it keeps the ingredients fresher. Let it sit for three or four minutes and it gets nicely thick.<br /><br />If you are not participating in Amazon Subscribe and Save, consider it. If you set up a regular delivery schedule, anywhere from one to six months, you get a 15% discount plus free shipping without the $25 requirement. This soup is hard to find in stores and when you do, it's more expensive than it is on Amazon. Plus, you can order early or cancel an order if you need to.<br /><br />I'm not trying to pimp for Amazon, it's just that I've found it to be the best deal.
