BEST BROTH EVER. I use it in place of meat based broths and it's perfect. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian either. And not onion-y or garlic-y either. They use excellent herbs for their mix and it's a small simple list of ingredients.<br /><br />I even put a cube in to my rice cooker (with the rice) and it really flavors the rice up well.
