You could take my word for it.  I really don't make many reviews on Amazon or anywhere else, but I feel so strongly about this product that I just must.  If you've any question, research the product on their website and I think you'll be convinced too.  If you like or prefer "sea-salt" either for health or taste, this is simply the best, especially for the price.  This is sea-salt, just that it comes from ancient ocean deposits left millions of years ago, way before any possibility of man-made contamination.  Himalayan salt is the same thing, but look at the price!  Seriously, one taste and you'll never go back to table salt.  Real Salt is purer, and way cheaper than any of the "sea-salts".  It doesn't clump and it's even a nice color, unlike grey "sea-salts" that are so popular.
