I have to admit that I'm a Crystal Light addict. I've probably tried every flavor they make. For a sugar-free product, it has a bold, great taste, and I don't notice an aftertaste from the sugar substitute either. Pink Lemonade is my favorite flavor because I find many of the fruit flavored ones are a little too sweet for my taste. My second favorite is the cranberry flavored Crystal Light and my third favorite is the orange flavored one (these two not yet offered by amazon as of this writing).<br /><br />As well as being an excellent drink on its own, as an added bonus for those who are dieting but still like to imbibe, Crystal Light is a great alternative to the high-sugar, high-calorie drink mixers. The pink lemonade works in any drinks recipe calling for lemonade, the orange is great in a Tequila Sunrise, and the cranberry is great for a vodka & cranberry.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Anne K.
