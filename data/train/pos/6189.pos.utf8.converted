We love these pretzels!! They have a unique taste--not like a regular pretzel. The multigrains combine to form a distinct taste with hints of rye, poppy seed and molasses. They are not as salty as regular pretzels. And they have 3 grams of fiber per serving. I have reordered several times since I cannot find them locally. They always arrive promptly in perfect condition.
