This pasta sauce is like marinara sauce with a generous dose of Tobasco sauce added, perhaps even hotter.  I love spicy food, so I don't mind it, but be aware of that before you serve it to your unsuspecting guests who might even nod along when you asked them if they like their food a little spicy.<br /><br />In other words, it's more suitable for Cinco de Mayo (Day of the Dead) fiesta than Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />In our family, we put mussels and other seafood into the sauce and the combination is excellent.  Maybe it'll work as marinate for chicken wings, and then BBQ on a grill, or bake them in the sauce in an oven.  I guess I should try those out.
