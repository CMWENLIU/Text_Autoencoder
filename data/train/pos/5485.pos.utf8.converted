I've been getting these sardines for 4 months under the subscription program and am quite satisfied. There are usually 3 sardines per can, sometimes 4. Occassionally there may be a tiny spec of skin still present, but not usually.  I would characterize the taste as mild which is just fine with me. I think some people who call these bland are more used to sardines packed in olive oil and a lot of salt, but these are a lower salt alternative and have less calories than those packed in olive oil. The quality has been very consistent, and i consume a half can of these sardines every day on wheat bread with humus.<br />I have had briesling sardines, which, as i understand it, are very young and tender sardines, and they were superior to these sardines, but i have always found briesling sardines to be a lot more expensive. These sardines suit my needs and price range very well and i enjoy them a lot.<br />As you probably know, sardines are a very good source of omega-3 fatty acids (the good kind), like other fish. But unlike larger fish, sardines tend to have lower mercury content, which makes them an ideal protein rich snack.
