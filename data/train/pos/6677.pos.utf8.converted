I don't know how this has gotten such bad review, I ordered 2 packets since they're so cheap. Planted 5 without pre-germinating them in a paper towel and all 5 grew quickly and have been very hardy. I now have 2, 2-3' maples and haven't had a single problem with them. The other two died because I didn't take very good care of them. One died of root rot, the other died because I forgot to move it near the window before I left for vacation. And the last one I gave as a gift to one of my friends. I would say these are by far the easiest plants I have ever grown. When I started growing these it was my first time ever trying to grow any tree/plant from seed and also what got me into growing more. I now have around 10-15 healthy plants of all different shapes and sizes.
