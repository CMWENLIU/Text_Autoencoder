I recently adopted two cats and transitioned them to Evolution food. They like the taste and try to break into the closet where we store the food. My older cat is obese and used to just lie around, couldn't jump up on the bed, and threw up a lot. Since putting her on Evolution food, she is gradually losing weight, plays with the other cat, can jump, and throws up a lot less. I know lots of other people whose animals have been healthy on Evolution food for years.
