I've used this yeast several times to make many batches of beer.  Worked in both Pale Ale and Stout and both 5 and 6 gallon batches.  All batches were good with no bacteria or infected beer problems.  I have enough for now, but when I go to order more yeast, I would buy this one again if it's available.  Hope this helps with your decision.
