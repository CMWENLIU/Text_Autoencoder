This is a premier product, although pricey with shipping added in, for making a outstanding chocolate malt. I think that it is far superior to the typical products one finds on grocer shelves. My recipe for a Malt for 1 person is 1/2 pint chocolate or vanilla ice cream, 1/2 cup milk, 2 Tbs Horlicks Drinking Powder, and 2 Tbs chocolate syrup. Mix in a blender. Adjust as you see fit..... There are many recipes on the web.<br /><br />I also made a hot chocolate malt at breakfast one morning. I used 1 Tb Horlicks Drinking Powder, 3/4 cup of warm milk, and 1 Tb chocolate syrup. That also was good.<br /><br />Again if you love malt this product is an excellent choice.
