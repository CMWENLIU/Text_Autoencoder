Finding good and hot Cayenne has been challenging for me - until now.<br />I've bought Cayenne pepper at grocery stores, specialty stores, mail order, and at fairs.<br />Sometimes they've been OK, sometimes pretty bad.  This Cayenne pepper is Outstanding!<br /><br />Be aware, this is not the wimpy Cayenne you would buy at the grocery store.  This stuff is really hot - and that is exactly what I have been looking for.  I have a very high tolerance for heat.  I literally use Tabasco sauce for salad dressing.  I cannot taste any heat with typical crushed red pepper or store bought Cayenne.  But I get a good kick from this stuff!
