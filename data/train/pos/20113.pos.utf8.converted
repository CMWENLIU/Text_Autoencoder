We sent this basket to my mother in law for Mother's Day and she loved it.  I was worried because she will definitely let us know if she doesn't like something and she really raved about this.  I didn't see the basket in person, but she said the items in it were all very nice.  She was most excited about a package of soap petals that was included.  She said they looked just like dried flowers, but you use one petal at a time as soap.  She'll be using those in her guest bathroom.  The food items were all really good quality and there was a really nice picture frame in the box too.  She also raved about the box itself and plans on using it on it's own.<br /><br />This is the 3rd Art of Appreciation gift basket I've sent as gifts and I always get good responses, so I'd feel confident about sending this as a gift.
