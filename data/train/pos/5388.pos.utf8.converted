I wanted this for making seitan and for baking whole wheat bread.  I love that it's a large size and doesn't cost as much in bulk like this.  I have used it in experimenting with some new recipes and it is a great item.  I made a recipe for quinoa and red lentil cutlets.  They are a great vegan meat substitute and really deliciously reminiscent of a good sausage.  The gluten makes it seem very meaty!  Thanks for this!
