Yes, eating this snack bar is like eating a candy bar.  That certainly doesn't bother me!  These are smaller bars but only 100 calories.  The "meal" bars are larger and are 200 calories, but the meal bars are not nearly as yummy.  On a diet or not, I would recommend these if you don't mind the candy bar likeness.  They have even replaced my granola bars.  They are my "granola" bars, my "snack" bars, my "gotta have chocolate now" bars, my "still 2 hours until dinner" bars and my "don't have time for breakfast" bars:)  LOL, I love 'em.<br />P.S.  I am the mom of the pickiest little girl ever and SHE eats these!
