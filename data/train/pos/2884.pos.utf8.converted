All my pets get the best that I can give them. I researched long and hard to find the perfect food for my boxer (5mo), and this was highly recommended on the boxer forums I frequent (backed up by independent research). DFA website gives TOTW a 6* rating! The fowl version did make my girl gassy, but the bison (yellow bag) is Wonderful!<br /><br />She's growing steady, lean (as boxers should be), playful, beautiful, shiny, and soft. She eats smaller portions vs. her old food (no fillers!); really has smaller, firmer stools as well (uses more of the food). Even her breath smells good! Yard is pretty easy to clean up now too.<br />She came to me with an awful ear infection-- it has not recurred since the switch a few months ago. Our vet had never heard of this food... but she said it looks like our girl is doing Great on it.<br /><br />Our pup is always excited at mealtimes... she LOVES it... and I love that I can afford it, and we are far from rich.  In a perfect world I would feed raw, but TOTW is a great alternative.<br /><br />This food is right up there with the best of the best quality grain-free kibbles...
