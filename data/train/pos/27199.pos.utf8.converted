I just found the Mueller's on Amazon.com and did a little price shopping.  Looks like with the Subscribe and Save option the pasta is only about $1.15 per box.  This is an incredibly good deal for an everyday price on Mueller's pasta.  I really like the quality of this brand and the price with the Subscribe option can't be beat.  It is 20 boxes, but I just used the 3-month subscribe option.  We will eat 20 boxes of pasta in 3 months (big family).  Thanks Amazon!
