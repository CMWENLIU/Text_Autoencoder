I have been researching dog food for our puppy for awhile.  The goal was to find something that was 1.) optimal for her health, most importantly and 2.) not so hard on our wallets.  After trying a few other foods, this one beat out the rest.  She loves it, it is made with top-quality ingredients, and we get a reasonable deal through Amazon with free shipping if you sign-up for a delivery schedule.  This was also the only place we found that sells bags larger than 5 Ibs.  BEST of all... no more horrible puppy gas!  She is part Boston Terrier, which can be known for flatuence... this food has completely done away with this problem.  You can check any dog food review site, Castor & Pollux gets top reviews.  Very pleased.  We will be sticking with this brand for quite some time to come!
