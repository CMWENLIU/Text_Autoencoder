Every year I will make around 5gals of spaghetti sauce. After it cools, I'll put it in 1gal freezer bags and freeze it for quick easy meals. Without the Italian seasoning & the onion powder that I purchased, my sauce would be very hum-drum & bland. Checking other web sites I found that by far the best price for the spices is right here. Don't be fooled by other offers for "like" products. The onion powder is granulated not powdered dust. The Italian season is coarse and not bits & pieces of the "leftovers" that other companies package. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few Spice Companies out there but right here is by far the best offer!<br />Happy Cooking!<br />Cheers!<br />Dave
