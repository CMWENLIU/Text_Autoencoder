I've had "Blue Diamond' almonds on many occasions, of course. It's a rather famous brand. But all my sampling was fron small bags or smallish cans. This time I was in a Costco Warehouse Store and they had a big display of 38-ounce plastic jars of Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds. How could I refuse? These things are really delicious. My goodness! And I love that Smokehouse Flavor. I have to limit myself to a certain portion or I'll consume a half jar at a sitting. About the only thing I don't care for is that they seem a bit salty. I love the flavor, but I worry about taking in that much salt. In any case, watching the portions will also be a way of watching the salt intake.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
