I love, love, love this rice and Amazon for having introducing me to something new and exotic. I purchased this rice along wth two other flavors as a special purchase,  I am so glad I did take a chance and purchase this rice. This rice is quick and very easy to prepare and works well with any and all of your rice dishes. I just have one caution this rice will become addictive, replacing your brown and or white rice. It is well worth the purchase for a change of pace from the norm and very healthy for you too, take a chance and explore the exotic, you will be pleasantly surprised you tried this rice.
