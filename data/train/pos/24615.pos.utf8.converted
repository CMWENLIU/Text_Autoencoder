We adopted a dog from the humane society and had tried about 6 different high quality dog foods before we tried this one, this is the first one that we really noticed a big difference! Her coat came back and her itching has reduced noticeably. She's gaining weight and loving it, as is our other (non-allergic) dog. So glad we tried this dog food, I know it won't work for every dog's allergies as everyone's are different, but this one is definitely worth trying!
