Ever since the unfortunate accident at Conagra factory, the prices of slim jims have jumped to ludicrous prices. 49.99 for a 100 pack of slim jims! No sir, you have forced me to look elsewhere. I came across these little morsels when I was having my yearly slim jim itch and boy did they fill the spot. I think it would best describe these as slim jims without the massive amounts of grease and with a more satisfying spicy flavor. If you're still having trouble finding slim jims these are the perfect substitutes or even replacements.
