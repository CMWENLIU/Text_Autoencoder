I don't like to have a lot of kitchen counter clutter so I was so happy to find this product.  I read a bunch of the reviews ahead of time so I went ahead and secured it with the screws so it wouldn't go anywhere.  I love this thing so much that I bought a second one so both my husband and I can have our own coffees in our own holders. The design is sleek and I love being able to have a bunch of different flavored coffees right by my Keurig without having a pile of different boxes on the counter.<br /><br />The one tip I would like to pass on is to open and close the holder by using the front bar only.  Otherwise it can go up cockeyed and not close up flat.
