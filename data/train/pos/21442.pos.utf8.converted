This is the best tasting coffee by far! It's very sweet and there is no bitterness.<br /><br />And there is no coffee maker required for this type of coffee! It's "instant" coffee. Simply put a couple of spoons in a hot cup of water and stir (like tea). The grinds will settle to the bottom. You can also use a tea diffuser.<br /><br />The first time I ever tasted this coffee was when I was visiting overseas. I had never been much of a coffee drinker and usually made my coffee with so much cream and sugar. But with this type of coffee, I can drink it black with only a little sugar (which is how everyone was drinking it).<br /><br />It's absolutely wonderful! Everyone who's tried it is amazed. I am spoiled now.
