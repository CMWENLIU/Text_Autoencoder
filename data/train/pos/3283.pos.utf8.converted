I got these noodles delivered about a week ago (pack of 6). I ate the last one today, so basically I've been replacing one meal a day with these.<br /><br />I really like them!<br />THE SMELL: Ok, these DO smell awful after you take them out of the package. I hate fish, so I was skeptical. But after rinsing for a full 2 minutes and patting dry with several paper towels, the smell was almost gone. The finished product was not at all fishy (see recipe at end of my review!).<br />The TEXTURE: They DO feel kind of gelatinous. Again, this goes away after cooking, and the texture is much more like a thin rice noodle.<br /><br />I literally just finished eating my daily noodle bowl- filling and delicious! Here's the recipe I've been using!<br /><br />Here's what I did:<br /><br />Rinsed the miracle noodles for 2+ minutes, and patted dry on paper towels. Cut with large kitchen knife.<br /><br />Sauteed half of an onion in pam no fat cooking spray.<br /><br />Dumped the noodles in with the onions and let cook over low-medium heat for a few minutes.<br /><br />Put in half a teaspoon of peanut butter (really, a very small amount), let it melt over the noodles.<br /><br />Put in about 2 T of ginger soy sauce.<br /><br />Put in about 1 Tablespoon of hot sauce.<br /><br />Chopped up about 8 leaves of fresh basil and threw them on top.<br /><br />Stir fried for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />And then I ate it! It was really really good- tasted like drunken thai noodles. AND, I estimate the calorie content at about 100 calories. I also feel like a few pieces of chicken breast would have gone with it really well, to add protein.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
