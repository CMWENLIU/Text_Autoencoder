The main flavor of this sauce is the aged, pickled, Scotch Bonnet peppers. It has a delicious, complex, fruity flavor from these peppers. Although there is some sugar in it (cane sugar, not corn syrup), I think most of the sweetness actually comes from the pepper. I don't know what the scofield rating is, but it's quite  a bit hotter than most readily available hot sauces in the U.S., such as Habanero Tobasco. Unlike a lot of the hotter hot sauces, there is no sacrifice of flavor for heat. It is delicious AND hot.
