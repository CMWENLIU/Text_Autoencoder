This is Justin on Milinda's account.  First of all, apple cider vinegar is practically magic.  It is amazing and can help with so many ailments, aches, and pains that it's not even funny.  But it is by no means delicious!  It tastes like Hell has puked in your mouth!  I have to take it by the shot, and then I wash away what taste I did get with a glass of water.  It's worth the taste, though, for all it can do for you!
