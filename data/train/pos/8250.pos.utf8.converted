As a vegetarian who tries to avoid dairy products, I am always looking for tasty, low calorie sources of protein. Most of the protein bars I've tried that have a high protein count also have a high calorie count AND often taste like cardboard.  The Simply Bar Lemon Coconut has 17 grams of protein with only 140 calories.  It is light, chewy and tasty. I have the protein bar with a piece of fruit in the morning for a breakfast under 300 calories. Also a good choice for those on a gluten-free diet.  The price is a little high, but I haven't been able to find the bars any cheaper anywhere else. I also tried the Simply peanut butter chocolate bars, but they were not as good as the lemon bars.
