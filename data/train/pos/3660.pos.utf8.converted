I've used this on many trips to the Amazon jungle, and it remains on the top of my list of things to take with me.  Unlike Deet and the "natural" products, it's odorless and not greasy. That said, I always combine it with either Buzz-Off clothing (Ex Officio brand) or with clothing treated in Sawyer's clothing repellent.  With this combination I generally do not get bitten, either by mosquitoes or by biting flies and chiggers.  Since I do travel in Malaria and Dengue Fever areas, this is life-savingly important.<br /><br />It does have to be applied more frequently than DEET, but it's a lot more pleasant.<br /><br />The only caution I will give is to apply it outdoors as breathing in the spray is a bit irritating.
