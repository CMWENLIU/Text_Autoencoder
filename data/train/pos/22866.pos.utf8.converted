I am a lifelong Marmite lover but this XO Marmite is in a class by itself and I am completely hooked on it.  The box says it has a "stronger taste" than ordinary Marmite.  I consider that to be somewhat inaccurate.  It is more flavorful rather than stronger tasting.  There's a wonderful tangy taste that is almost (but not quite) fruity and a lot less of the harsh burn that you get with the regular Marmite (e.g. when you spread it too thickly).  If you like to spread your Marmite you should try this.  If you just make drinks or add it to stews, I think the difference is less noticeable.  Buying it here is quite expensive as the seller ships it from England - it's still worth it (but remember I am now addicted to XO).  I hope Unilever makes this a permanent addition to the Marmite product range and that it becomes more readily (and more cheaply) available in the US.
