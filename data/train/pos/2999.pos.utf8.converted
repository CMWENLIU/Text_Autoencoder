I was a little doubtful when the amount of grains seemed small, but I followed the instructions and started them in milk right away.  The first couple of small batches smelled a little "off" to me, more like sour milk, but I fed them to my dog who loves kefir mixed with her food.  The instructions I got with the grains indicated that they need 5 days to recuperate from shipping and that they should be in milk to recuperate--no problem for me with included instructions.<br /><br />As time went on, actually not much time less than a week, the batches smelled better and I began to eat the kefir myself.  YUM  The grains continued to grow, and in less than two months I started giving some to friends who say they are working great.  I was surprised at how fast the grains grew!  They are good, healthy grains.<br /><br />I should mention that I have used mostly whole-fat raw milk, but also used some whole-fat non-hormone milk when I ran low on raw milk.  Also, I make sure that I rinse the grains with filtered water that has no chlorine or other toxins to the grains.  I do not use any metal for making kefir, and I ferment the kefir in a closed kitchen cabinet using a glass jar loosely covered.<br /><br />Typically, I make a smaller batch for me that I let ferment a shorter time, and a larger batch for my dog that I let ferment longer.  I have "stored" the kefir grains in milk twice in my refrigerator for a couple of days, and their activity does not seem to be affected. I am enjoying my kefir and the process of making it!
