Our citric acid arrived on-time and in great condition.  I completely understand the argument about the cheap bag--it is flimsy and of poor quality.  However, they apparently learned their lesson.  Ours had a second bag over the outside to add a little bit more tear resistance.  It might still not be able to stand up to a great deal of abuse, but it was apparently enough to make it to our house unscathed.
