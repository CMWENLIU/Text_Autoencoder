My son is on a gluten free, casein free (GFCF) diet and eats quite a bit of this bread.  Like the another poster has said, if you are Gluten Free only, I suppose you have quite a few options these days. If you are GFCF, then it is difficult to find bread that also does not have the dairy (typically introduced as milk or butter).  We've bought some of the frozen breads that are GFCF from the grocery store, and they are ok. However, it is nice not to have to freeze the bread and just have it available for use without defrosting and fighting to get the slices of bread apart.  I've eaten this bread right along with my son and I think it tastes just fine, and way better than the frozen stuff. I mean, it isn't as soft and squishy as typical bread, but I think it tastes pretty good.  Toasted is always better, but it is fine on its own.  If you do not have a dietary restriction or aren't choosing the bread for its other ingredient differences, you'd probably enjoy other bread over this bread.<br /><br />Note that the bread is specially packaged such that you are not supposed to freeze it before opening. I believe it is supposed to last up to a year using its special packaging. Mileage will vary there, as I've bought loaves from the local grocery that started molding within a few weeks w/o opening them, but have others from Amazon that have lasted a couple months.
