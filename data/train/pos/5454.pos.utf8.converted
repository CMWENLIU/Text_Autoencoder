And Heaven knows that Caramello bars are absolutely divine!<br /><br />When you open a Caramello bar for the first time, you might think, "what's the big deal?"  It smells and looks like a normal-ish Hershey bar, which is as good as all Hershey bars, but why are these people so obsessed?  If it's a warm day, the bar will have cracked open, and you will already know -  but for the sake of this review, it's a normal day, the bar is in one piece, and you haven't discovered the incredible surprise that makes a Caramello the sinful and delicious treat that it is.<br /><br />Break the bar open and pull the two pieces apart.  There it is -- a ribbon of soft, delicious, tasty caramel, just waiting for you to pounce.  And you had better pounce quickly, because this stuff recognizes new/expensive/dry clean only clothing and  will pounce on you if it has to wait.  But the pounce and slurp are so worth it -- completely delicious, and when you take a bite of that chocolate shell, you know what's for lunch in Heaven.<br /><br />But there has always been a snake in the Garden of Eden, and the name of this snake is Calories.  Specifically, 540 calories for the 4 oz bar I'm reviewing.  200 of those calories are fat, which makes this food a true splurge.  You can't even fake that it's providing superior nutrition for all those calories, because the only good stuff in appreciable quantities is the 8% calcium the bar provides.  A single Viactiv chew Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews, 500+D+K, Milk Chocolate, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) provides 500 mg of calcium, half of your daily requirement, at a measly 20 calories.<br /><br />On those days when you can afford a treat, or those other days when you must have a treat and the heck with the diet - this is one heck of a splurge.  It's incredibly delicious, chewy, slurpy and crunchy all in one treat, and you can lick your fingers afterward.  If you do it right, it's more than a snack, a Caramello bar is an experience.
