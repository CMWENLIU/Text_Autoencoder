This ginger is very tasty on its own, with sushi, and with any seafood. I signed up for the Subscribe and Save program for this item, which gives 15% off the price and allows you to choose how often you want to receive the product (no obligation, no shipping charges.) Initially, I indicated 6 months, but my daughter and I ran out of it in a little more than a month, so I changed the order to be delivered every month. In addition, there is a promotion until March 31, 2010, which allows you to save an additional 10% (bringing it to 25% off) if you use the promo code ROLAND77
