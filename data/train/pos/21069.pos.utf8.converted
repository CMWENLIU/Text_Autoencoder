If I 'drink' milk it's going to be soymilk and SILK CHOCOLATE SOYMILK IS THE BEST! I don't care what 'cow milk' drinking folks say - it taste just like chocolate milk from the cow - but MUCH HEALTHIER!<br />I'm delighted to see they sell it in bulk! I wasn't sure about the cartons - but for the price and quality - just put them in the fridge and you're ready to go! Once again this is a good snack I like to take on the go!<br />ENJOY & DO BUY SILK SOYMILK! :)
