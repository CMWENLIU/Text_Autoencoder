Until last u\year I had never heard of Quinoa. Now I am hooked. I love the taste. Although I'm really not that keen on the red. But the white (or gold) will be found in my pantry from now on. Just cook it like you would rice, but keep a watch on it as it will stick. Most recipes say it cooks in 10 min. but I cook mine covered about 20 at a simmer in salted water with a little olive oil in the water.. Also you can use stock instead of water. I even threw some raw chicken in a pot with Quinoa (added some celery, onions and some spices) it was great. I make a double batch and keep the leftovers in the fridge. Good for breakfast w/milk , as a side dish or just a snack. Excellent for diabetics (like myself).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHUYD4">QUINOA, 10 lb Bag</a>
