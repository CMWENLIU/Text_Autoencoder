I love these candies and so does everyone I've ever given one too!  They make a great gift and come in this festive little box with individually wrapped Raffaellos, every one a work of art to die for!  So what's not to like???  Well, how about the fact that you can get this same product at Walmart for about $3-4.00?  Knowing that, do you really want to spend $10.00 plus shipping for a few pieces of candy???
