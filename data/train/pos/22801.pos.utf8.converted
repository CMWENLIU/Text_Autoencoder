I was looking for an easy and convenient way to add lean protein to my diet on my training days.  A friend suggested I try these, so I did.  They are really tasty!  The jerky strips are really yummy as well.  You will not be disappointed if you buy these.  They were also much cheaper than buying at a local "health food" store!
