I'm a salty-snack fiend. I've always liked the dry, salty strips of jerky. I'm a little odd in my tastes in that I like stuff typically dry and crunchy, so sometimes I'll even leave a bag of jerky open and leave it in my glovebox for weeks to get it just right. I am not a big fan of marinated jerky - it's usually just slimy, and you nearly rip your head off biting a piece from it and then your jaw is sore for hours from all the chewing to get the gristle-filled lube-fest masticated enough to swallow safely.<br /><br />During a road trip, I stopped at a gas station and picked up some staples. I knew from experience that the other brands available at this pitstop were jerky's I was not fond of, and so I gave this one a go.<br /><br />This stuff practically melts in your mouth. Marinated, but not greasy. Easy to chew, and no noticable gristle or fat globules. It's not the type of jerky I would have normally gone for, but I'm so glad I did. On the way back from my road trip, I stopped at the same gas station and bought all the packets they had.<br /><br />Beef jerky has gotten so expensive over the years, you'd think they were marinating it in super-unleaded gasoline. This is one bag of beef jerky that you will not think is over-priced once you try it. If jerky were served at gourmet restaurants, this would be the brand to serve. My hat is off to Golden Island Cuisine for re-inventing the ancient art of drying meat to preserve it and making it taste good without pumping it full of MSG and formaldehyde.
