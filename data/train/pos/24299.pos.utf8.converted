If all of our creamers or coffee flavorings were rated by their good-for-you factor, we would probably have to stop drinking simple coffee to begin with. (I've also used the sf vanilla syrup, which doesn't have the same creamer effect; to achieve that you'd have to add another dairy product, which defeats the purpose for some specifically restricted diets like mine.) (I don't have to worry about fat content, though.)<br /><br />On my planet, I'm just really happy to have found a sugar-free alternative to the coffee creamer I thought I'd have to give up forever. The powdered form guarantees that I can take this to work without having it stolen from the community refrigerator (and for the fat-conscious people who don't want to give up their creamer, there is a lowfat/fat free version out there). The sugar free version doesn't stray too far from the original vanilla Coffeemate. The only complaint I have is that Amazon doesn't carry the SF liquid vanilla version that I can keep at home.<br /><br />Coffee in and of itself can be a guilty pleasure (caffeine, added sugar, dental stains...); I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the effects of a regular powdered creamer who has very strict natural sugar limits.
