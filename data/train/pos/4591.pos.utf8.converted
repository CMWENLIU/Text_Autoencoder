I gotta tell ya.. as someone that used to drink 2 2 litres of coke a day minumum and hates diet coke.. this stuff is a life saver.  I have no interest in soda anymore as this stuff tastes 100 times better.  and has no calories.  its made with extract from the stevia plant that is like 100 times sweeter then sugar but minus the pathway to diabetes.  Ive dropped weight without even barely trying.. just by replacing coke with this stuff.  I Highly recommend.. most supermarkets you can get for a buck a bottle.  just make sure to drink it nice and cold.
