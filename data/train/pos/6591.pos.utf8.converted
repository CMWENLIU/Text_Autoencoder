Butterscotch (butter rum) lifesavers are hard to find in the stores (the individually wrapped ones), so I buy a case of these every so often for my elderly mother.  She likes to put a few in her purse and enjoys eating a few a day.  Because they are individually wrapped as well as sealed in the larger bag, they have a long shelf life.  I wish more stores would carry this flavor so I would not have to pay the shipping costs.  But it is for my mom.  What can I say?  :)
