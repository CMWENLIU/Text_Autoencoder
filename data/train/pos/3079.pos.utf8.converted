Trader Joe's has been carrying the No Pudge Brownie mixes for over a decade and it's not unusual to see customers buying them by the case.  At the current price of $15.55 for 6 that makes them $2.59 a pack if you have Amazon prime or use Super Saver Free shipping and that's not a bad deal.  What mnakes these brownies so popular is that all you have to add is yogurt.  I add Vanilla Nonfat yogurt and sometimes I'll toss in two tablespoons of instant coffee of espresso powder to jazz them up.  You don't need butter or eggs - just the yogurt.  Once you do that, you stir 'em up, pour 'em in the pan and in no time you have delicious brownies!  They aren't as ooey-gooey as some mixes but that's what I like about them.  They also aren't cloyingly sweet.  They are simply a nice, fudgey brownie that you don't have to feel too guilty about eating. I always keep a couple packages in the pantry to whip up for unexpected company or for whenever that chocolate craving hits you out of nowhere.  The best thing about No Pudge Fudge Brownies is that they are easy to mix, quick to cook and they always come out to be the same good and fudgey brownie you are longing for. Keep some on hand at all times!
