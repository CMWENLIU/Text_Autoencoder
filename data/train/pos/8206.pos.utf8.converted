Exactly how I always pictured Bertie Bott's beans would be. I have the generation before these and they've been spot on since movie 1 (GOD, the HORSERADISH flavor was AWFUL. UGH.). The generation before these has a single flavor that literally made me retch. The fish flavored jelly beans are SO AWFUL that you will gag.<br /><br />You will.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />These, on the other hand, only have a few really awful ones. Avoid vomit if you can, because that's probably what you'll be doing next.<br /><br />whoever makes these is awesome.
