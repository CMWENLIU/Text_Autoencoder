These samosas remind me of empanadas. You have a bread stuffed with delicious food. We keep these frozen in the freezer, then defrost in the microwave and cook for 15 minutes in the conventional oven at 350 degrees. They are spicy to me. The chutney (yogurt and mint leaves) helps cut the spices. 4 samosas to a box with 6 boxes comes to ~$1 a samosa--expensive to us.
