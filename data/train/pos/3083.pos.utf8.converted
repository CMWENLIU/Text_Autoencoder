If you're not from Minnesota you might not know what Caribou Coffee is; quite simply it is some of the best coffee on the market.  It has a delicious smokiness to it that is not overpowering and does not taste burnt like Starbucks.  Coffee is not supposed to taste burnt!  The Caribou Blend is their "middle" roast that has made them what they are and is very well balanced.  It has an amazing flavor and is easy on the stomach too, as I personally have difficulty with some coffee roasts and digestion.
