Unfortunately, the large 25 lb. bag does not include directions, but does include the best ingredients ever.  Every single time we make this we love it.  Add coconut, nuts, swap apple sauce for some of the butter/oil and they are great!  Highly recommend!<br />****update:  on my 5th bag of this stuff.  Can't beat it.  Now we are adding chocolate chips, coconut flakes and slivered almonds.  You can't go wrong with this bag!
