The first reviewer wrote:  "The flavor of this product is good. But peanut butter always tastes good. Skippy doesn't deserve credit for the fact that peanut butter tastes good."<br /><br />She missed the whole point. This isn't just any peanut butter. Skippy has managed to produce a PB with no hydrogenated oils, while having no separation -- and it still tastes great. Try any other brand with no hydrogenated oils and you'll find that they actually don't taste very good, they have all the oil on top, and you have to keep them in the refrigerator. This Skippy product is a very unique peanut butter.<br /><br />She admits it tastes good, yet instead of rating it highly, she only gave it one star because it's kosher. C'mon! Amazon should remove the review.
