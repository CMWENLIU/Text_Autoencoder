I have a  background in Alternative Medicine and also as a Personal Trainer. Drinking plenty of good quality water is vital to our health and I make sure I drink a minimum of 2 quarts of water a day.<br /><br />Over the last several months since I first met Mr Trivedi, I have been drinking from 1 -4 bottles of Trivedi Water every day. I am delighted that it has become available on Amazon and can now be delivered directly to my door!<br /><br />The things I have noticed are remarkable.<br />It has helped with my digestion. My tummy feels lighter. When I have applied it to small cuts on my fingers or minor abrasions it has healed them up in a day or 2. When I have poured it onto my plants they seem to come back to life with more vigor. Drinking it on a daily basis I feel fantastic and "energized" and if ever I am fatigued it seems to take stress and fatigue out of my system. I've applied it to my eyes a couple of times when they felt irritated and within minutes the irritation and redness began disappearing.<br /><br />I also notice that it seems to hydrate my body more so than any other water and I drink a lot of good quality 8.5 - 9.5 pH alkaline water. This water is wonderful.<br />Start drinking some and see for yourself!
