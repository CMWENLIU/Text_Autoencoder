I was looking to get away from artificial sweeteners, and have been away from sugar for a long time.  I am so glad to have found this product on Amazon!  I had seen it advertised in Natural Health magazine many times, but could never find it at the store.  Since I am very familiar with stevia and have used it for years, I am IN LOVE with these packets.  Helps me get my daily water intake, keeps me away from diet pop completely.  Will order these packets again and again!  Oh yeah, the flavor is good, too.  Not overly sweet, but not too "healthy" tasting -- just right.
