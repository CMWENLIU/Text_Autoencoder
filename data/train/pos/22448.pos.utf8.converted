Do you remember what a clean, crisp taste your favorite soda had before the sugar in it was replaced with corn sweetener?  I do. You may be surprised that it costs less than one cent more per 12 oz. can to use sugar rather than corn sweetener.<br /><br />The last time I had a Dad's Root Beer I was about 13 years old.  35 years later, at 48, there are times when it seems I can still taste it.  Thanks to Amazon.com, I'll finally be able to satisfy my thirst for it.<br /><br />Dad's has a much crisper, less syrupy taste than A & W, which leaves a sometimes unpleasant aftertaste.  Barq's tastes slightly closer to Dad's, MUG closer yet.  Dad's Root Beer has a little more carbonation, just a hint of sarsaparilla, and they still uses cane sugar instead of the ubiquitous corn sweetener.  You can definitely taste the difference.
