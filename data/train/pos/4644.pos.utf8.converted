Update on 09-03-2010:  I recently learned (by reading) that the natural sweetener Xylitol is poisonous for dogs to ingest.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Too bad I can't rate this product with ten stars! Manufactured in Sweden, these are appreciated around the world. Why do I appreciate them so much? What are they like? Well, here goes:<br /><br />Sugar free with only 3 calories per serving, they are sweetened with xylitol, which occurs naturally in the fiber of many fruits and vegetables. Xylitol has virtually no aftertaste, and doesn't impact blood sugar, so diabetics can enjoy them. With these, I haven't noticed any tummy discomfort as I do with Sorbitol or Aspartame. I don't really consider these as candy in the normal sense, but more as a refreshment. These pastilles are a wonderful treat that can help prevent cavities by keeping the saliva flowing. This is especially helpful for those of us who are stressed, have a medical condition or take medications that can cause dry mouth. These pastilles are firm but chewy, and also melt in one's mouth. There are no sharp edges which can occur with some hard candies.<br /><br />The taste is distinctive, rich and pleasurable, with notes of licorice and menthol.  A serving is two pieces, with a total of 12 servings per box (which is small enough to discreetly carry in a pocket or purse.)<br /><br />Lakerol Special Licorice pastilles come in handy, too.  Ever need to change the subject in a hurry? Offer one of these. Got the munchies at 2:00 a.m. but want to wake up free of guilt? Forget the cake and have a couple of these instead! Mouth going dry on your way to the principal's office? (Or enrolled in a speech class?) No problem. These will help!  Bored stiff trying to do your taxes? Lakerol and a stroll away from your desk will help refresh you... and with luck you will think of a couple more deductions.<br /><br />If you suffer from arthritis or any other source of chronic pain as I do (ankylosing spondylitis), these may help distract you from the pain and help you proactively focus on doing something kind and positive for yourself, such as gentle stretching or a hot bath.<br /><br />These do have menthol, but are not overwhelmingly strong, which is a nice plus. If you have a sensitive mouth, as I do, this can be very comforting. Also, I'm a chocoholic, but more often than not these stop those cravings and reframe my feelings to something more positive.<br /><br />My husband and I both love these and wouldn't want to be without them. Whoever invented them must be a genius! I've ordered them multiple times through Amazon.com and am extremely satisfied.  My order often arrives within four days or so. What more could I ask for?  I hope you try these if you haven't before.... they really are special.
