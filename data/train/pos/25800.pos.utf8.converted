I have celiac disease and must adhere to a very strict gluten free diet. I routinely travel the extra distance to shop at the area health food stores which carry this item.  I am thrilled to have finally found this item on line at a more reasonable price. This oatmeal is fantastic and now I am able to eat it daily with no problem. I was at first suspicious that it might not truly be a gluten free item because it is so tasty and is the exact consistency of the traditional Quaker Oats, so I called the company to check the lot number of the package. The company rep was informative and assured me the lot numbers were their product. She even told me that they had recently improved their milling process to make this product easier to microwave and cook with. I am so thankful for this oatmeal as a gluten free diet is very restrictive and I had not eaten oatmeal for 12 years  because there was not a gluten free oatmeal on the market.
