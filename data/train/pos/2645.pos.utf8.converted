Dog-la loves 'em and just today, he was asking me to order another 5-lbs before he runs out.  Which I did, because the price is right w/s&s, he gives me 3 minutes of peace while he chews, and his teeth are pretty clean on a chewie-a-day.  And, well, he's got me trained to serve him obediently.<br /><br />No problems for him, and he's got a bit of a sensitive stomach (he can eat random cat poop no problem, but let 'im swallow the tiniest piece of plastic while eating through a bottle to get to the treats inside, and, bam, massive surgery bill and lifelong intestinal scarring).  I appreciate the reviewers sharing their tails of caution, but I've had no problems.  I give one with dinner and dog-la noshes on (inhales? magically adsorbs?) some kibble and veggies (30 seconds, max), and then grabs the rawhide and enjoys a relaxing chew.  Once in a blue moon, I give him a rawhide unattended (but that's a bad idea with basically ANY chewable, because dogs can gnaw off a chunk and inhale/swallow it).  He's sitting on my foot 99% of the time he's chewing these and he's never choked or suffered stomach upset from 'em.<br /><br />Dog-la seems to digest these perfectly; I sometimes see pieces of other rawhides in the pooper-scooper, but not these.  And he's a definite fan.  He won't eat some types of rawhide (especially flavored ones), but he he gets all eager and pushy when I pull these out, as if to say, "good human, GOOD human! Now, release. Drop it, drop it! NOW, gimme, gimme, gimmmeee!"  6 months of daily use, and he's still madly in love.  And he's not getting fat on them.<br /><br />EDIT to add: Dog-la did "choke" on one of these.  He started breathing funny and kind of clearing his throat - he was still breathing, but it stuck in the back of his mouth and after a couple minutes he hadn't cleared it on its own.  I freaked out a little, but it was easy to grab and pull it out - he then finished chewing it (yuck).  I keep a couple week supply of these in a tub for easy access, where they dry out a bit, so that may make them a little harder to chew.  I'll still buy them.  I've had food get wedged in my mouth the wrong way (luckily, I have fingers, so I can pull it out) and I'm not a complete and utter pig like my dog. LOL  I don't think having a flat object lay flat in the dog's mouth and slip back where he can't quite chew it is a product defect at all.  But I no longer give him rawhides unattended, ever.
