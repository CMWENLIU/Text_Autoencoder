This is my favorite of the currently (1/2007) available K-Cup Earl Grey teas.  To calibrate this review to your tastes: (1) I like *tea*, plus this one flavoring, not herbs with a little bit of tea -- I'm even finicky about how much Bergamot gets put in.  (2) I prefer Twinings to Stash (in bags, not available in K-Cups) for that very reason.  Twinings is sightly less expensive than Gloria Jean's or Celestial Seasonings, and has the "cleanest" taste of the three.  If you like a "brighter" or more flowery taste, go for the Celestial Seasonings; or if you like a more "complex" or "spicy" taste, choose the Gloria Jean's.
