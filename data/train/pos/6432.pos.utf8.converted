An avid coffee fan, I find Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold to be the single best dark roast coffee I have ever tasted.  Having traveled extensively, I've tried many dark brews from around the world and they  often left quite a bitter after-taste. This particular coffee is so delicious, I no longer purchase coffee from any of the "chain coffee cafes".<br /><br />Treat yourself well.  If you're going to drink a deep, rich, flavorful cup of coffee-choose Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold-you won't regret it!  Keurig Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve Extra Bold
