K cups can be expensive and you often have your very own favorite coffee anyway.  Why not reuse those K cups!  This product is easy to use and will enable you to get an even better brew in your Keurig brewer when you use your own coffee.  The refillable brewing accessory for the Keurig makes an acceptable cup of coffee, but not a great cup.  My-Kap makes a huge difference.  The product will be shipped from an independent vendor, but your My-Kaps will arrive within just a few days.  Be sure to place the print on the cap up when you insert it into the K cup so that it will fit easily into the cup.  You will choose the same brew size you normally use with the K cups.  The number  of times you can reuse the K cups varies from coffee company to coffee company, but you will still be able to reuse most of them at least 4 to 6 times.  I have reused several K cups 10 or more times before discarding them.
