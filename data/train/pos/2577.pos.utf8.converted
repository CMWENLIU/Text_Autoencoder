For several years, I've been purchasing local honey from my local Natural Food Coop. Unfortunately, as the years have passed, not only has the price gone up but they have moved away from the unusual and toward more generic "let's please everyone" products. The local honey, star thistle, that I preferred, has a wonderful strong, earthy flavor to it and I've been missing it. Orange blossom honey is just, well, just sweet.<br /><br />This honey--Honey Tree's Organic Rainforest Honey has that nice strong, earthy, flavor that I have been missing. To me, honey is not just a sweetener but a flavor to add wherever I want. If I want just a sweetener, Splenda is just fine.<br /><br />Truthfully, I purchased this honey because of the price. I wish that it were available as a Subscribe & Save, but, regardless, I will be purchasing it on a regular basis.
