Bought this tin of Springerle cookies for my daughter and her husband as an anniversary(12/26) gift in spite of the cost---$6 per cookie.  I knew she wouldn't get them until the middle of January  but ordered them anyway.  They arrived on her anniversary and she was delighted!!!  She said they were delicious, but she intended to save some as ornaments as they were so beautifully decorated.  Don't know if that ever happened.  I was just very happy that I chose a product that made her so happy.  GREAT COOKIES, GREAT SERVICE!!!!!!!!  Thanks so much!!!!
