If you're expecting the stevia flavor to be present, you'll be disappointed. This is not a true stevia sweetener, because it only contains reb A and none of the other compounds found in stevia.<br /><br />Truvia is very similar to another brand called PureVia. They are pretty much equal in quality and flavor. Both are very effective at tasting close to sugar without the typical stevia flavor. Truvia differs from PureVia very slightly. PureVia has a slight creamy flavor, and Truvia is a little sweeter per packet (each packet contains more). Both are primarily sweetened with erythritol and purified reb A (another name for rubiana). Erythritol is a natural nearly zero calorie sweetener found in fruit. Reb A is a natural zero calorie sweetener isolated from stevia leaf. Unlike stevia, which is known for a leafy licorice like aftertaste, Reb A has almost no aftertaste and is intensely sweet. Because it's present in Truvia in isolated form without the other stevia compounds, Truvia tastes nothing like stevia.<br /><br />Truvia contains erythritol, reb A, and natural flavors. PureVia differs in that it also contains isomaltulose and a tiny bit of cellulose powder. One big difference between PureVia, and Truvia is that Truvia contains far more erythritol, so erythritol has more of an impact on the flavor than it does in PureVia. Erythritol tastes more like sugar than reb A does, but it has a watery quality to its flavor and a cooling effect. Reb A has a thin sharp sweetness to it. When the two are combined they greatly enrich each other giving a more full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Truvia, NuStevia, and PureVia are the best stevia based sweeteners you can get when it comes to stevia sweeteners without the stevia flavor.<br /><br />PureVia tastes better in coffee because it has a creamy flavor. Of course most people love cream in their coffee, so PureVia has an upper hand there because of the creamy flavor present. The creamy flavor of PureVia goes well in some things, but not all things. Truvia is not creamy tasting, is sweeter per packet and is better suited for general purpose sweetening where a creamy flavor might not be desired.<br /><br />I did taste tests with my family using PureVia, Truvia, and Sun Crystals, three of the newest stevia based sweeteners. PureVia and Truvia were liked by everyone with PureVia judged slightly better for things requiring a creamy flavor and Truvia scoring better for things that taste better without a creamy flavor. Sun Crystals has the taste of stevia in it, and for that reason it scored lower, because the flavor of the stevia was a negative in some taste tests. Of the three PureVia tasted the most like sugar, Truvia the most like erythritol, and Sun Crystals the most like stevia. One thing that was interesting during the taste test that we found was that when PureVia was tasted plain after Truvia was tasted plain, PureVia tasted better, likewise when Truvia was tasted plain after PureVia was tasted plain it was judged to taste better, but when tasted together the flavor wasn't as good.<br /><br />If you're looking for an effective all natural zero calorie sweetener, this is about as good as it gets. The taste is very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners, it has it's own unique flavor. While PureVia tastes a little more like sugar and has a creamy flavor, it's not as sweet as Truvia. Truvia is a better deal because it's sweeter per packet. The difference in flavor is very minor. Also PureVia relies more on reb A for sweetening than Truvia does. Reb A is great in small amounts, but not so good in large amounts, so when more sweetness power is needed Truvia is a better choice. Very large amounts of reb A will taste bitter, but when used in normal amounts, it doesn't taste bitter. Reb A is similar to saccharin in that way. Small amounts taste better than large amounts. There's a sweetness threshold with reb A, and if that threshold is passed, it starts tasting less sweet and starts tasting bitter. That's one thing you need to know when using a reb A based sweetener. Because Truvia relies more on erythritol for it's sweetness than reb A, this is not as much of a problem as it can be with PureVia. You can use far more Truvia packets before you get a flavor "overdose" of reb A than with PureVia.
