We have a finished walk-out basement.  I had only  seen a couple of insects and put traps in every room as a precaution,before the arrival of guests. To my amazement, and mortification,  I am constantly replacing the traps which are catching an unbelievable variety of insects.  I do not know where they hide.  Because we have cats, I am pleased that these traps are not toxic, and that I do not have to spray toxic products on the carpet and along the baseboards.  I realize that this will not eliminate the problem entirely, but it also will not poison us or our pets.
