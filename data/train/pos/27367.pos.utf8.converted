After trying to nurse my son for the first month under very challenging circumstances, I found it necessary to switch to formula. I started with Similac, as that was all I had on hand from offers sent in the mail. I did lots of research and finally settled on Baby's Only Organic Dairy Formula. I have been feeding this formula to my son ever since he was about a month and a half. I give him a little bit of probiotics and vitamin D3 each day--as recommended by my amazing, unique holistic / MD pediatrician, and this has really helped to build his immune system. He also is able to digest his food beautifully! I have read that it is good for babies to get used to lactose, rather than automatically going for the sensitive, lactose free options. I believe that my son might have a tiny bit of difficulty digesting any formula without the aid of probiotics, but with the probiotics, he is able to digest his formula really well.<br /><br />I LOVE this formula! It is the only one on the market that I could find without the unnecessary and deceiving "DHA/ARA for brain and eye development" added, which uses Hexane to extract or produce it for use in baby formulas. Baby's only has the natural fatty acids that help the human body to produce it's own DHA/ARA for brain and eye development. The other formula's use this additive in a very deceptive way--basically just as a selling point by making you think it is something your baby won't get unless it's added, which isn't true!<br /><br />Additionally, Baby's Only appears to be a company of integrity, and I love that. They purposefully label this as a toddler formula, simply because they believe mothers should breast feed their babies for the first 12 months, if at all possible. This formula has all of the necessary nutrients for infant development, and it is comparable to any other top one on the market--only it is less expensive, AND organic!<br /><br />My baby boy smells SO good, and his diapers smell like a normal, healthy breast fed baby's diapers. There is no strong or offensive odor as sometimes caused by other formulas.<br /><br />Check out Baby's Only Organics official site by doing a search online for more excellent information on this awesome product! Absolutely recommended for babies of ALL ages! Best wishes to you!
