I am a coffee fanatic, but I recently gave up caffiene (even decaf) so I was looking for an alternative. A friend recommended Teeccino and I will NEVER go back to regular coffee again!  This stuff is AMAZING! It satisfies all the cravings I had for coffee and it is rich and smooth enough to drink black. The TEE bags are so convenient, but if you prefer to brew your coffee the bags of coffee work just as well.  I highly recommend for those who love coffee, but need to cut back on caffeine.
