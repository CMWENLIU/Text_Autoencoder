I love sprinkling this on baked goods like cupcakes or fruit and nut bars for added eye-appeal. It is also perfect for whipping up some coconut butter (huge money saver) in my food processor. I just put it in, turn on the food processor and let it go for 5-15 minutes (depending on how smooth I want it). Sometimes I let the food processor cool down and then run it again for an extra smooth butter.
