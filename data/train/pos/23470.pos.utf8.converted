We first purchased a jar of these at a Crackle Barrel near Wichita, Ks.  As we traveled we looked for them in every Crackle Barrel.  Could not find them.  Finally looked at the label and found their website.  We ordered a case of them and I can't seem to keep a jar open and full.  They are wonderful.
