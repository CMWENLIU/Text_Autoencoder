(i cut and pasted this from my website)<br /><br />---<br /><br />Phil Ford, a real estate appraiser and father of four in Raleigh, North Carolina, developed his sauce around 1987 while trying to copy his mother's recipe for a western North Carolina-style barbecue sauce.<br /><br />The resulting all natural, fat-free, fragrant blend of ingredients include: tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, honey, molasses, mustard, horseradish, lemon juice, onions, garlic, peppers, natural hickory smoke, natural spices and salt.<br /><br />This one gets [...] props for a magical combination of quality ingredients, simple packaging, clever name, and well balanced flavor. The only thing I found slightly lacking (a stretch) was that the consistency was a bit on the thin side.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful - a sweet yet complex aroma with hints of apple, mustard, lemon, onions, and the "smokiness" that all barbecue sauces attempt. I could see putting this on almost anything - I think I want to try this on swordfish next, then a Bone Suckin Burger after that.<br /><br />The first time I tried this stuff was a long time ago, during my college days, before I knew much about BBQ and grilling... and I had slathered the stuff on before the meat was ready for a barbecue bath. The result was a less-than-tasty, blackened mess. Bad experience for a bad griller - I blame it on the beer I was drinking at the time.<br /><br />But my most recent, and sober, experience was a meal of half rack of ribs and a few chicken wings all done the right way, when the meat is at about the 75th percentile of BBQ cookage. This way, the sweets didn't completely die and I was able to take in one of the best natural- ingredient sauces on the market...<br /><br />You know I love my Bullseye and traditional Kansas City style BBQ sauces (even though some may contain the dreaded HFCS), yet this one went all natural and retained a quality flavor - a deed well worth 5 out of 5. Sometimes that's hard to do - I compare it to household cleaners... sometimes you don't trust those all natural, "green" cleaning products because you assume they aren't going to be as strong. And sometimes you don't trust a BBQ sauce when they decide to limit ingredients to things that are not manufactured and/or processed. Not the case here.<br /><br />After my 100% objective tasting and review, I found other high ratings across the board:<br /><br />Rated #1 in Health Magazine<br /><br />Rated #1 by Newsweek Magazine<br /><br />All Natural, Fat Free, Gluten Free & Certified Kosher / Pareve.
