I bought this to use in some low carb and gluten free recipes that I have and it is excellent. Bought the book "The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook", excellent book btw, and made the chocolate cookies and they are outstanding, really just incredible. I tried Bob's almond flour in the past and the difference is night and day. This flour gives a nice light, fluffy texture while Bob's seemed grainy. The price is a little steep but still better than I can find locally.<br />Great purchase!
