I first tried these Ricochet Mints at work. The person in the cubicle next to me suggested I try them and I'm really glad I did. That fact that these mints are sugar free, have all natural ingredients in them, and that they taste great makes them a joy to eat every time I use them. The flavor is not so strong that you will hate it. In fact, I'm not a big licorice fan in general yet I love these mints. I'd highly recommend them to anyone who wants a decent breath mint.
