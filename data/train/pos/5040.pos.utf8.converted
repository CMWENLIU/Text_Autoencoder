I had been looking for sorghum in Denver for quite a while.  I could not find it, so I looked on-line.  I took a chance and ordered it from Golden Barrel.  It turned out to be a great choice.  The taste is EXACTLY like I remembered at my Grandma's house.  She served it on toast, and I do the same.  It takes me back to a very cherished childhood experience.  This is a great source for a great product!
