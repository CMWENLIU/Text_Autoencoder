This little grain is a great additive to muffins, breads and pancakes.  (I always soak them in boiling water before adding them to the recipe.)  They add a delightful little crunch and very subtle texture to my baked recipes.  The pudding recipe on the bag is yummy and I think they would be great in certain cookies too!(-my next experiment)  I am sure with some thought they could be added to any number of recipes for bulk and the benefit of "whole grain goodness"!  Also, A little bit goes a long way so, For Christmas this year I am using two of the bags to give to friends, along with the Bob's flax seeds and my bran muffin recipe which calls for both ingredients.
