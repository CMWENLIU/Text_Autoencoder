If you have a small child who is hard to get to bed at night, put them in a routine. Make them some sleepytime before bed (you can add splenda or honey to make the tea sweeter). This will calm thier nerves and make for a restfull night of sleep. This has also shown to me to prevent a fight from a child who does not want to go to bed. With a cup or two of this tea they should be off to sleepyland.<br /><br />This tea does have a distinct taste which can be hard for some to get used to. I add honey or splenda to my tea to calm the bitter taste down. This tea is like chammomile - with little to no taste. So you'll need to add lemon juice or honey to make this tea taste good.<br /><br />This tea can also calm you after a hard days of work if you've been over worked or stressed out.<br /><br />I give this tea to friends and loved ones who are going through stress, or issues to remind them to relax.
