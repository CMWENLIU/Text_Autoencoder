These are a staple in our pantry.  I love mashed potatoes, but who has time for scrubbing and prepping potatoes (Except for the holidays!)?  And up until I found these I would not buy the conventional brands of instant mashed potatoes.  Mainly because they are not organic and also because they don't taste very good.  Potatoes are on the top 12 list of vegetables with the most pesticides; stick with organic!  The Edwards and Sons Organic Mashed Potatoes taste really good!  Granted nothing beats scratch made mashed potatoes, but these are the best of the instant.  They are excellent made with milk and butter, but they are also great with rice milk (if you are vegan or have a dairy issue) and no butter.  Actually, my husband has said that they seem to mix up nicer with rice milk.  We have found that when using the specified amounts of liquid, the mashed potatoes are very thick, so we add more milk or rice milk than directed.  The instant potatoes also work great as a thickener for stews, soup, and gravy.  The flavor is mild, but tasty with a bit of onion and black pepper.  There is also a "chreesy" (non-dairy cheese flavored) version, which I don't like as much.  Our daughter likes the chreesy version better however.  These are also gluten free!  I was buying them by the case from an online discount vitamin store, but Amazon seems to be coming down on their food prices and with Subscribe and Save, they currently have the best price.
