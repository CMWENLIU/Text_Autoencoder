I got the 4-pack some time ago, and I've been adding the flax meal to different foods. The omega-3 oil increase definitely is beneficial especially if you're vegetarian, or if you simply eat a lot.<br /><br />Some good ways to incorporate this healthy stuff into your diet:<br /><br />- Soup. Don't cook it into the soup, or you'll break down the Omega-3's - apparently cooking destroys the benefit according to what I read about flaxseed oils. Add it to the soup around when you add cheese or croutons<br /><br />- Sauces and chutneys. Indian cilantro or mint chutney can hold a lot of flaxseed meal without its taste being affected. Likewise for hot sauces, salsas and so on.<br /><br />- Waffles. The flaxseed meal becomes a kind of solid fat that enrichens the waffle. I add it to regular, chocolate, or oatmeal flour waffles. Yes, the waffle maker may affect the flaxseed meal directly in contact with the hot plates, but the rest of the fsm is not exposed to as much heat.<br /><br />- As they suggest, breads of all kinds.<br /><br />- If you're grilling a cheese sandwich, might as well up the fiber content and get whatever Omega-3's as you can salvage. Stick it in the cheese.<br /><br />- Believe it or don't it incorporates into nachos and pizzas too. If that's all your kid eats, maybe a flaxseed meal infusion will help (but do fix the food habits, fsm is not a fix-all)<br /><br />DON'T:<br /><br />- Try to eat it plain, I tried it, and it's about as disgusting as trying to drink vegetable oil, plus it has fiber<br /><br />- Add it to stuff that is still cooking. No benefit, the fat changes to regular unhealthy Omega-6 with the high heat from contacting the pan surface<br /><br />- Overdo adding fsm to stuff. I tried to push the envelope, and if you overdo it, the food tastes slick and even a bit soapy, kind of like it's gone bad.<br /><br />- Add it to clear liquids or foods. Sounds obvious, but once you feel a benefit (it can take a week or so) you can get carried away. The last thing you want is to be disgusted by it.
