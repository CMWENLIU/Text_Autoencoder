My husband read about these noodles and I decided to try them.  They arived fully cooked in a plastic bag.  I was a little hesitant to try them at first because I didn't expect them to be cooked and thought they might taste soggy. We heated them up and served them with a seafood dish.  I was amazed at how good they tasted. Almost identical to flour based pasta (and only 20 cals/serving!)<br /><br />After researching these noodles on the internet, I was delighted to find out how many health benefits they had.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to lose weight, prevent heart disease, balance their insulin levels....  Try it and enjoy!
