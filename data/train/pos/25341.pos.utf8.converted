These are high-quality pilchard sardines wild-caught from Morocco and contain 2g of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids per can.  They are boneless and skinless and ready-to-eat.  My favorite way of eating sardines is crushed with some extra virgin olive oil and hot sauce (Jamaican pickapeppa sauce is ideal), on top of crackers.  Buying a whole case of 25 cans is much more economical than buying individual cans of comparable quality at our local supermarket.  We're very happy that Amazon sells these sardines.
