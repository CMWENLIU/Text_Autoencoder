This is an excellent coffee that is very similar to Cafe Du Monde but it is much more available. I can find this at my local grocery store whereas I have to order Cafe Du Monde through Amazon. (Which I do on occasion)<br /><br />I find Cafe Du Monde just a tad bit smoother and a little "earthy", but that said this is still top notch, and has notes of caramel.<br /><br />Remember as with all coffee with chicory to use less then you would normal coffee, perhaps half of what you normally would. Using less you will still get a dark coffee as it is almost impossible to get a light coffee with this. That being said, it still contains less caffeine as normal coffee and is certainly less bitter and taste less acidic.<br /><br />Try this today if you are like me and love a good, bold, robust, great tasting coffee with chicory. You will not be disappointed.
