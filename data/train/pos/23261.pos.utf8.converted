I had an excellent shopping experience with Leonidas. From my experience, I can assure you that if you ever have any problem, Leonidas will be courteous and considerate in dealing with you. As for the chocolate, my husband and I are very fond of dark chocolate and have tried many brands before. We found Leonidas ideally bittersweet in its taste and also generous in quantity. In fact, the best of all the European brands we've tried in our five years of dating. It's the kind of chocolate that you not only would buy for gifts but would also want to buy and keep for your snack.
