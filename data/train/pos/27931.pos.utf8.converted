We just got a Keurig brewer for Christmas and had tried several different k-cup brands that came with it.  Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend was one of the samples and we loved it!  Now we have it sent to our home very two months via Amazon.  Great coffee with a very smooth, but full-bodied flavor!!!
