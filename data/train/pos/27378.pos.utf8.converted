How cool is this?  It's a 10 on my scale.  You get this block of salt that's possibly millions of years old.  Yeah, I know salt is everywhere but a brick of pink salt is just too cool for words.  I figure on using it as a serving surface for a while and then recycling it in my mortar and pestle when the time comes.  If you are reading this then you know it's not anything close to a need-to-have item but it's a luxury that I'm happy to own.  I bought 4 of these and will probably buy a 4 more.  The Z-Shop seller that sells them for half the price is not selling what is pictured; rather, they are selling 8"x4"x2" bricks and not 8"x8"x1" salt plates.  (They're still pretty cool too!)
