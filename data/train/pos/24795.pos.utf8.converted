I highly recommend this tea.<br /><br />First, its claims:<br />I've been drinking it for three years, and I started by picking it up at my local organic co-op.  I tend to be very skeptical, so even though the tea said 'energy' I figured it would be because of the minimal amount of the caffeine in green tea and not whatever else they put in it.<br /><br />I was very, very wrong.  This stuff doesn't give you wham-bam energy like large amounts of caffeine, instead it gives you what I think of as more stamina.  So unlike caffeine with the quick pick up and crash, it will definitely help you keep going and, more importantly, lets you down very gently so that you don't suddenly feel like you're going to start snoring in the middle of typing.  Also, unlike large amounts of caffeine, I'm able to sleep well after drinking multiple cups of this tea over the course of the day.<br /><br />Second, taste:<br />I like the taste, but agree that it would be very possible to dislike it, so try the tea before you stock up on 12 boxes.  I add a small amount of sugar to the tea to counteract a tiny bit of bitterness that's there if you want to drink it straight, but this would also be very drinkable with no sugar added if you're accustomed to that sort of thing.  (My favorite type of tea is chai, and I'm a sugar addict.)<br /><br />To summarize:<br />If you're looking for some sort of energy drink jolt type junk, keep going.  This tea isn't going to rocket blast you out of your seat, but it will provide a strong, gentle boost and take away some of your perception of your fatigue.
