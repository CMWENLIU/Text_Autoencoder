Product:<br />I've become addicted to Folger's Black Silk coffee.  It is strong without being sharp, deep without being bitter, and extremely smooth.  I brew mine very strong, occasionally adding a measure of chocolate truffle flavored ground coffee (light roast) with the usual amount of Black Silk.  This is a special treat I save for rewarding myself or serving to people who come to visit.<br /><br />Price:<br />On the matter of this price - wow.  Just - wow.  I get one 27.8 ounce container of this exact brand/flavor at an extremely expensive (not open-box) store in my neighborhood for $6.99 per container, which is under $14 for two.  The product here on Amazon is priced at $29.20 for a two-pack as I type this.  You can do much better than $15.00 per container, at least as of Nov. 10, 2010.  I just checked my local grocer, who offers online shopping and home delivery, and it's still $6.99 there.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Shop at your local grocery store and find this coffee.  Even $9 per 27.8 oz. container is worth it, but I'm sure you can do better than that in your usual stores.  I'm uncertain why Folgers would jack the price up so much here, but aside from this sales tactic - the coffee itself is magnificent, rich, and very smooth.
