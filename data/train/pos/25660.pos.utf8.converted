My 3 cats, including my youngest who doesn't like seafood (but loves to play in water!), LOVE these. I can't go to the cabinet without all 3 of them following me, meowing for these treats!<br /><br />And they're healthy because they're mostly air. So, my guys get this treat just about every evening. Buy them - Your cat(s) will love them, too. BTW, these were reviewed/tested by either Cat Fancy or Catnip magazine (where I first heard about them), and they got 5 stars because all of the test cats loved them.
