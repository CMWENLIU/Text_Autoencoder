I love this coconut oil. It tastes great on bread instead of using butter. It has a great coconut taste. I also use when I'm baking istead of using other types of oil or shortening.<br /><br />Extra Virgin Coconut oil is the best. I made the mistake of getting the refined coconut oil once(different brand), and there is huge difference in the taste. The refined oil has no coconut taste, it tastes like shortening.
