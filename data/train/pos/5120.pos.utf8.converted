If it wasn't for a friend of mine who already used this product, i probably would of tossed it in the garbage after trying to use it the way the instructions suggest after the first time. So to help out anyone else, i'll post how i make jello here. I'll give you a quick recipe that i use to make cranberry juice jello.<br /><br />2 cups juice (i use lakewood cranberry juice, but you can use any kind of clear juice you want).<br />2 tablespoons of great lakes gelatin<br />sugar to taste<br />a 3(or 4) cup pyrex container<br />a 2 cup pyrex measuring cup.<br /><br />i start off by mixing 1 cup of COLD juice with the 2 tablespoons of gelatin in the measuring cup.<br />keep mixing till all the gelatin has been mixed with the juice, don't leave any chunks.<br />then let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />dump the cup of juice/gelatin into the pyrex dish, and then clean your cup, then pour<br />another cup of juice into your measuring cup. I then microwave this cup for 2 minutes (maybe another minute after i test it)<br />then take it out to measure the temperature. you want to try to get the liquid around 160F degrees. (should be pretty hot to the touch)<br /><br />then i mix in the sugar to taste, then add the hot liquid to the cold, and mix it.<br />it should all be clear after you mix them together, and then i leave it sit on the counter for a few minutes,<br />then put it in the fridge. It takes a few hours to harden.<br /><br />when i first tried to make this, i thought it was like other jello, where you mix it in with hot liquids.. which is a bad idea.. since you'll wind up with a wad of glue stuck onto your spoon. Then after i tried to just mix it with cold water like the instructions said, but this never solidified. It turns out you have to mix with cold water, then apply hot water afterwards to activate it to harden.<br /><br />i hope this helps someone.
