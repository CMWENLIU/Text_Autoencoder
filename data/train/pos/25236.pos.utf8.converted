I have used Braggs Amino for many years in cooking recipes in place of soy sauce. I prefer it. I just finished my first bottle of ACV. It is much higher quality that others and although strong it seems milder (to the taste) that other brands. To the person that did not get good results from using it and anyone else; I also followed the directions on the label, it did nothing, THEN I decided to try it with a sugar alternative (PureVia) instead of honey and it made a BIG difference. I feel better and get an energy boost. I am going to purchase the Braggzyme now.
