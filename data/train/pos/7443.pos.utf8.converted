I purchased these for my husbands candy bin in his office at work.  In case you wonder how many fireballs are in 16 oz. (like I did) there are 78 fireballs in this bag. I debated on purchasing this 1# bag or the 200 ct. container and went with this size for easy transportation as we live overseas and I'll pack these in my suitcase.  The price comparison is negligible, with this 1# bag being slightly cheaper. These are very difficult to find in stores. I searched Costco, super walmart, smart & final, with no luck till I decided to just check and see if Amazon carries them. Bingo.  Can't go wrong with Amazon.
