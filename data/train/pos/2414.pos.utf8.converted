this oil is very good to cook with. when heated, it has a very low viscosity, and tends to coat the pan and food evenly. also has a very light flavor, and it's good for you.

I'm also happy to find out that the added vitamin E won't break down with heat. ([...]). This is a very healthy choice, and I plan to deep-fry with it as a healthier alternative to other oils.
