I just returned from Italy where I bought a Balconi Tiramisu cake in a grocery store.  I had the cake for three weeks before I brought it home to eat.  I kept thinking... How is it possible this cake will be any good when it has not been refrigerated?  (I bought it off the shelf in the cookie isle in Italy!).  The cake was Wonderful!  It is extremely tasty and moist!  I highly recommend this great-quick dessert!
