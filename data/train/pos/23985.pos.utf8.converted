Quick chocolate chemistry lesson:<br /><br />1.  If you use "natural cocoa" it is acidic, and designed to be used in baking with baking soda as a leavener.  It is not intended to be used as a drink mix for hot cocoa.<br /><br />2.  Many recent "gourmet" cocoa products tout "natural cocoa" because it is cheaper than alkali processing.  However the high price will probably give you an acid stomach ache.  It does that to me.  Ouch.<br /><br />3.  "Dutch cocoa" is processed by simply exposing cocoa to baking soda, nothing more creepy than that. It just neutralizes the acids so you can stomach it, and to tone down the harsh flavor.  Your taste buds may prefer "natural cocoa" because you're used to it, but not everyone does.  I think it's too harsh.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />4.  Alkali processed cocoa is also easier to mix with liquids so you don't get a gloppy, lumpy mess like you do with natural cocoa.  It's a lot like the difference between masa flour and corn meal flour.  One has been processed with alkali, one not.  The traditional version, masa, has been processed with alkali (traditionally potash).<br /><br />Therefore, if you need to make brownies with a recipe using only baking soda leavener, use natural cocoa.  If you're making hot chocolate, use your own discretion based on the flavor you like, but if you get a stomach ache from natural cocoa, then use dutch cocoa.  Dutch cocoa is probably what you remember from childhood hot chocolate anyway, so if you like Swiss Miss or Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, then stick with dutch cocoa, or the flavor will be "off" for you. The reason cocoa tastes "off" is because you're used to "natural" and bought "dutch" or vice versa.<br /><br />Re the comments about sellers...  I've been a customer here for years and I still don't trust anyone who doesn't at least fulfill through amazon.  Their rating had better be above 96% too.<br /><br />Products that have dutch processed cocoa (in order of my preference):<br /><br />1.  Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa<br />2.  Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa<br />3.  This product<br /><br />There are probably more but I haven't tried them.<br /><br />Products I know are way too acidic for me and are natural cocoa (in order of nastiness / acidity):<br /><br />1.  Trader Joe's Sipping Chocolate<br />2.  Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa<br />3.  Hershey's Cocoa "Great for Baking" (NOT the Special Dark)<br /><br />Best wishes for finding what you're looking for!  This one is for hot chocolate lovers only.
