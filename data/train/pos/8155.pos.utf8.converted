When I began cooking for myself about 6 years ago, I tried five or six different recipes for chicken vindaloo, from Madhur Jaffrey's classic recipe to actor Anthony Hopkins' "healthful" one (which I found on some entertainment Web site).<br /><br />Most were good, with Jaffrey's being the best of the bunch, Hopkins' the worst (Hannibal's take on vindaloo was surprisingly bland). None of the recipes were nearly as good, however, as the spiced-just-right vindaloo I used to order at least once a week from Baluchi's when I lived in New York City.<br /><br />During my recipe experimentation, I visited a local Asian grocery store and asked the clerk for some advice. He recommended trying Patak's paste. I was dubious, but I did. It was absolutely great. And the bonus: The Patak's recipe is much easier to fix than the various recipes I had been collecting.<br /><br />I've cooked with this paste so often now, I've learned to make a few alterations to the recipe. I basically follow the directions on the jar (substituting chicken for shrimp), but add a 1/4 cup of yogurt and about a tablespoon of fresh minced cilantro at the end of the cooking process. If I have some lemon juice around, I put in a couple of squirts just before serving. (I usually cook the dish with two to two-and-a-half pounds of chicken and freeze the leftovers. It reheats well.)<br /><br />If you're using chicken breasts rather than dark meat, make sure not to overcook and dry out the chicken. That's about the only thing you'll need to guard against. (A friend told me to marinate the chicken bits in yogurt and then cook them under a broiler, separate from the sauce but adding them to the sauce once they're cooked through. He says this locks in the moistness and adds a little flavor to the meat via the slight charring/carmelization that results. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good.)<br /><br />By the way, I'm not sure how healthy this paste is; don't overuse the paste or the dish can get a bit greasy, for example. (There must be a fair amount of oil in the paste.) Just use the amount recommended on the jar and you should be fine.<br /><br />Patak's doesn't beat Baluchi's chicken vindaloo, but for a home cook looking to make fast and tasty vindaloos, this paste can't be beat.<br /><br />Now if I could just learn to make a quick-and-easy naan, I'd really be in business...
