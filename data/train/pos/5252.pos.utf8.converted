I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised.  Being on a low-sodium diet, everything tastes bland at first, then the opposite happens...you begin to really taste the flavors of the food you're eating...this seasoning is VERY flavorul, with just a bit of heat.  The way I like it.  It comes in hotter blends, if you like.  I use this in rice, pasta, chili-of course, eggs, canola mayo, lite sour cream dips, soups, etc...Love it!
