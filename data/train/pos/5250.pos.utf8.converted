Price<br />This is one of the best accessories I've bought for my Keurig.  I have four at home and two at work.  The product is excellent, but the price is way too expensive from vendors selling them for more than $20 - $25.  I got mine for $20 plus tax at my local Bed, Bath, and Beyond after using a 20% Off Coupon.  This makes them worth about $10 a piece since they are sold in pairs.<br /><br />Efficient<br />I love taking a K-Cup box home and dumping them in these containers.  I prefer this method rather than individually presenting K-Cups in other storage containers.  They are easy to grab from the opening at the bottom.<br /><br />Size & Looks<br />They are pretty big.  Make sure you measure your cabinet space before purchasing.  They won't fit in a lot of standard cabinets.  They are attractive after getting a few brands on display.  I like being able to use one of the K-Cups as a display model.
