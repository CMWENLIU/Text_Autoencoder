My first Tazo experience included a box of interesting items from a friend and packets of Tazo Green Ginger tea, which was slightly bitter and delicious with orange blossom honey.<br /><br />This box of Assorted Teas:<br /><br />Awake - Keeps you very, very awake!<br />Calm - Chamomile<br />China Green Tips<br />Earl Grey - Perfumed<br />Tazo Chai - Spicy<br />Passion - hibiscus flowers and orange for a calming blend<br />Decaffeinated Tazo Chai<br />Wild Sweet Orange - really delicious when blended with Lotus and poured over ice<br />Lotus<br />Zen - Nice alternative to black tea and has a lemon verbena,<br />spearmint and lemongrass twist.<br /><br />The ingredients include: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />I use 16 ounces of water and two tea bags for each experience. When you drink these teas you can transcend reality for moments at a time and that is all the truth I need about these teas. Some of these teas even evoke a sense of wonder.<br /><br />Warning: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE TEAS. Once you taste these teas, you will want to try them all and forever be on a search for new Tazo teas. Fortunately they have enough tea blends to entertain you for years.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
