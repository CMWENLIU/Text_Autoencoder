Many coffee brands that advertise their beans as &quot;Kona&quot; are blends, containing only ten percent beans from the highly desirable region, but these Aloha Island Gold beans are pure Kona, all from plants grown on the Big Island in the designated microclimate that produces some of the smoothest coffee beans in the world. While the Aloha brand may not be Hawaii's best, it is certainly one of the more available brands on the mainland.  Store in the freezer to maintain optimal freshness, and grind the beans immediately before brewing.<p>For coffee connoisseurs, two phrases light up their eyes, &quot;Jamaican Blue Mountain&quot; and &quot;Kona.&quot;  If you want to give a gift sure to impress a sophisticated coffee drinker, you've found your beans.
