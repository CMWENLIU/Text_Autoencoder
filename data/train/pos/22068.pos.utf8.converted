After careful research on the best dry food for my dog's diet, I chose Wellness Core Reduced Fat. My mixed breed dog is low energy and has a tendency to put weight on easily. It was very difficult to find a dog food that does not compromise quality ingredients to make a food low fat. Since my dog is low energy (by no means a sled dog), her diet does not require her to have extreme protein intake. This food is the prefect balance of protein, quality meat sources, fat content, as well as important sources of fruits and vegetables and fish oils. Her eyes are bright and coat is shiny. While she hasn't lost any weight, she hasn't gained any either, which is a good thing!<br /><br />You get what you pay for when it comes to dog food. When purchasing this brand, one is paying for high quality food (meat content, veggies, fruits) without fillers or extreme levels of protein.
