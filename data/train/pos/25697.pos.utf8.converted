okay.  so, the flavor wears off real fast.  be forewarned about that.<br /><br />BUT-----this gum is perfect for my needs.  i had wanted something to clean my teeth/mouth in between meals (like at work after having a snack when i can't brush my teeth)  I don't intend to chew it very long so the fact that the flavor wears off fast doesn't bother me.  I answer phones at work anyway so i can't sit there chomping on gum.....<br /><br />My breath seems fresh & my mouth feels clean, so mission accomplished  :)<br /><br />One other thing i noticed that is AWESOME is that my sinuses are clearing out a lot.  I am always feeling stuffed up & have sinus problems every day. i often feel a lump in my throat when i swallow.  I have allergies & silent reflux at night so the whole area is irritated.  especially after consuming sugar, it gets worse.<br /><br />so anyway i chewed about 6 pieces of this gum today over the past 2 hrs & i feel SO much better.  I knew xylitol has anti-bacterial properties but everything i had read spoke of how good it is for your teeth. that is why i bought it. it didn't occur to me that there were other benefits. So i didn't realize when i bought the gum is that people actually use xylitol as a nasal wash & even to clear up ear infections. i discovered this only after clearly noticing the effects on myself.  it was so drastic that i did more research online (google of course).  I mean the change was so noticable for me that i thought this can't be just a coincidence & went to look it up. and lo & behold it is used to cure sinus & ear infections!  i also bought xylitol granules to use as sweetener in my tea instead of regular sugar.  now i'm going to dissolve it in mater & gargle with it too. and I will continue to use this gum every day as well.
