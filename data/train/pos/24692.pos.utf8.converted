Jennies Coconut Macaroons have three ingredients: Egg whites (so if you are on the SCD, eat them when you are able to eat eggs), Coconut and Honey. There are no other sweeteners, no artificial ingredients, nothing else added. They are tasty, chewy, goodness, and the ingredients can be tolerated by many people who otherwise have to avoid most of what they see at a typical grocery store. The packaging keeps them fresh. I tried the SCD diet recipe (which contains the same ingredients plus optional lemon zest) and can't get them as good as Jennies.<br /><br />For a sweet treat with wholesome goodness, Jennies coconut macaroons are the way to go!<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE!!! As I have seen from another reviewer - in my most recent order, Jennie's changed from HONEY to EVAPORATED CANE JUICE WITH HONEY!! This is a HORRID DEVELOPMENT! WHY DID THEY DO THIS?? I can't eat them now! They are no longer SCD Diet friendly :(
