I moved to Missouri from Las Vegas, where I was used to buying these fabulous chips in every grocery store.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered they're not offered in Missouri, nor can groceries here order them from Lay's (so they say).  I ordered some online from the Mexican Grocer, but since the packages of chips were just thrown into a box without packing or dividers, I received crumbs.  Tasty crumbs, but crumbs, nonetheless.  I know that Amazon would pack them to ship correctly, so please, please, please, Amazon, won't you please talk Lay's into letting you offer these through the Internet?  Please?
