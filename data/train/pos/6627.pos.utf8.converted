I have this product delivered to my Dad every two months.  He loves it!  He has tried to find it or something similar on the open market in Los Angeles, and just unable to find the same prime quality.  Once he mailed me the packaging.  I thought he was sharing.  NOT!  He wanted me to see how nicely the product was packaged!  I'm glad I finally found something that he really looks forward to receiving.
