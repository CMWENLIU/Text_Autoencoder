Since the demise of "Mr. Milkman" powdered milk, I have looked for a comparable product.  Nido instant milk was suggested to me by other grieving former Milkman customers and I am so glad I tried it.  It has good whole milk quality.  Excellent taste and texture, especially compared to the low or no fat powdered milks that you find in the grocery store, which taste like chalk.  (Try finding powdered WHOLE milk at your local store - good luck!)<br /><br />It's perfect to add to a hot beverage.  It blends easily.  (This specific product does NOT have added sugar.  Beware, a children's version of Nido does.)  Although it is not Mr. Milkman, it's a close second.  And I am very grateful that I have found it.
