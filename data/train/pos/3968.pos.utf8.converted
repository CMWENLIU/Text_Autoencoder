Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!
