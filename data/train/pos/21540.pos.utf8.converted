I have ordered these same Landjager multiple times since I tried them. If you're a meat junkie they're great! Just make sure you let them hang out to dry for as long as you can because they just get better and better! A week or so is when they really start getting good. I end up eating half of them before they really hit their sweet spot, but maybe you've got more self control than me!!!
