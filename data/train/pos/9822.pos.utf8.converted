I've tried different brands and flavors of Stevia. The Stevita brand vanilla flavored is by far the best I've purchased.My husband and I take it with us when we go out to eat or out for coffee.It allows that taste of indulgence without the concern for extra calories or blood sugar spikes.The vanilla flavored also doesn't leave the after taste as some other flavors and brands of stevia.I used to be able to find the Stevita flavored stevia in health or whole food stores,but the cost is much higher ,and they do not keep it stocked.I like the convenience of ordering it on line and being able to get enough of it to where we don't run out of it.It's our sweetner of choice!
