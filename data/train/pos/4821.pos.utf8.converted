I've been a chef now for over 18 years and was very skeptical about ordering coffee, organic coffee for that matter, online. When we got it we immediately opened it and vacuum packed and portioned the coffee, it comes in a 5lb. bag.  Up until the very last bean, they were all full of flavor and taste so much better than anything I have bought in a store.  The roasting process does NOT burn the bean, it simply brings out the wonderful volcanic aromas surrounding Nicaragua.
