I bought one bag of this at a local health food store and I LOVE IT!!  It's so EASY to make, which is such a bonus for Gluten-free baking.  It is incredibly moist and has a spongy texture (although some may not like that as it is a bit different than a traditional cornbread taste....)  It's good Gluten-free cornbread.  There's no other way to describe it.
