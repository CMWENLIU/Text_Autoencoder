This Nu-Salt product is almost entirely potassium chloride (KCl) rather than table salt, which is sodium chloride (NaCl). Potassium chloride tastes more like table salt than anything else I've tried, but it does have a bit of a metallic after taste. I've fairly-well masked that, though, by mixing 150 parts of potassium chloride with one part of citric acid crystals (also called sour salt). Citric acid has a very strong lemon flavor which is so strong by itself that it's difficult to use a small enough quantity of it. By mixing a small amount of it with potassium chloride, the citric acid flavor is much diluted, which makes it much easier to use, and the potassium chloride metallic after taste essentially disappears.<br /><br />EDIT: I keep changing the ratio of KCl to citric acid. Now I appear to have settled on about 1/4 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 3 oz. shaker of Nu-Salt. I think that works out to about 72 parts KCl to one part citric acid. It's all a matter of your taste, obviously.
