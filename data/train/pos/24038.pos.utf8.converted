I lived in Italy for three years and enjoyed the juice of the Blood Orange many times, but I've never had such a delicious blend of three different varieties of blood orange.  If you like your juice very - extremely - tart, this is the one for you.  Buy it by the case - you'll be surprised by how quickly it goes once you have your first taste.
