We are tea drinkers and drink multiple cups of tea in a day. Dilmah Earl Grey is one of the finest teas in the market and we kid you not. This is the only 100% pure Ceylon single origin tea available in the market at this time. We have tried several other items of this brand - Ceylon Supreme, Orange Pekoe and Green Teas and they are by far several times better tasting and refreshing than any other brand. We just read in an article that Dilmah Earl Grey has twice the amount of Antioxidants than Bigelow Earl grey as Dilmah Teas are packed fresh and at source.<br /><br />Our entire family is just truly hooked on Dilmah. The key to any Artisinal and traditionally manufactured tea is to brew it properly for min 3 minutes or the taste profile will not come and the tea will stay light. The cheap brands use a method called CTC (Cut-twist-Curl) which gives an instant color but lack the soul of the tea, which is flavor and of feeling refreshed.<br /><br />There are multiple reviews on Dilmah Brand on Amazon and no one has rated the particular item or the brand as the previous reviewer.
