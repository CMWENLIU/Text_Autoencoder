I tried a demo of Tasty Bite Entree Madras Lentils in a supermarket, and absolutely fell in love with it. Everything in it is healthy stuff, and it's a wonderful thing to use as a topping for baked potatoes or rice.<br /><br />Use your imagination! Add sliced chicken, top it with cheese, mix-in tofu -- the world is yours!<br /><br />Every Tasty Bite Entree I've purchased was really good and worth the price and can add amazing variety to your meals.
