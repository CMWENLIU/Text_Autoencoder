03.01.2011 - Update---<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Large thank you to Amazon for their return of Community Chicory<br />to there product line---<br />This is second order since availability re-instated. Great product!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~<br />The wording for the description of this product can be confusing<br />but only if you do not read it.<br /><br />Community may need to reword the description, however--<br />when the package reads 100% Chicory, this should indicate<br />the product is --- 100% Chicory---no coffee.<br /><br />The product does show a short period allowed for brewing.<br />This indicates product is getting to you "on time"<br />and produced freshly. This herb is harvested and roasted<br />to get to us fresh.<br />I keep mine in the freezer and move it to the fridge<br />when am ready to brew.<br /><br />I brew this plain and drink it as I like my coffee<br />cream and Ste-vita. Do not find bitter when consumed this way.<br /><br />Because of misunderstandings here,<br /> Amazon has pulled the product<br />and I must go to Community to get my supply.<br /><br />Caffeine elevates my blood sugar thus chicory<br />is my coffee substitute. Have been drinking coffee/chicory<br />blend for seven decades and just chicory for about 2 years.
