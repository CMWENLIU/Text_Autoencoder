No, not the Cincinnati Reds. And not the communists. I'm talking about the Starburst Reds. These flavors are awesome. And this is a killer deal for a 6 pack of these suckers... you get 5.25 pounds! I dumped all 6 bags into a large bowl and its sitting on my dining room table. My guests officially hate me because no one can stop eating them when they're over. I am considering getting a custom door mat printed that says "Welcome to FatVille, population YOU" with an arrow pointing backwards.
