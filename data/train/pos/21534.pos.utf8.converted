I buy this product regularly and have it stocked on all times.  I'm a huge fan of Eden Foods, especially since it's a company that appears to have integrity regarding their products.  Anyways, this seaweed is great for soups (for adding another depth of flavor), or even to make seaweed salad, with a little vinegar, honey, soy sauce and minced garlic.  I soak the seaweed first and make sure to rinse the seaweed several times.  Then blanch it for about a minute, and then drain the water.  Then cut it up, and mix it with the above ingredients for a yummy side salad!
