I have been using NIDO instant milk since 1979, the time I was missionary in Africa. Here in USA I was using bottled milk which sells in our suppermarkets. This bottled milk can stand for two weeks and not get sour, which is not normal. But if it eventually get spoiled, it is not sour, it is simply stinking and it has slimy texture. This bottled milk gives me terrible indigestion and lots of gas. Doctors told me that I have lactose intollerance. I am back to NIDO, KLIM or Peak powdered instant milk and I have incredible results. I have no more indigestion and lactose intolarance is not there any more. My son in law had the same experience.
