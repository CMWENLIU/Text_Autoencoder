You cannot go wrong with this white truffle oil, it has a good balance and none of the synthetic flavorings some other brands use. I am a Private Chef in New York City who has sampled many different brands over the years, this one definitely stands out. Even Daniel Boulud uses Urbani White Truffle oil in his kitchens, that should tell you something.<br />A drizzle of this stuff on a Soft Polenta with Sauteed Wild Mushrooms = Heaven. Check out my blog for the recipe. Hope this helps!
