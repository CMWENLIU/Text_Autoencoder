Ramen is a quick and easy meal, you can doctor it up to be fancier and more filling.. or eat it plain if in a hurry.<br /><br />It's a great staple to have in the pantry for quick meals, or emergency situations. All you need is hot water.<br /><br />But... with only a couple of flavors available locally, it got boring. I don't even remember exactly how I ended up on the page with all the Ramen soup flavors but I did.. and I'm glad.<br /><br />I ordered four new flavors that day, and found them all to be very good.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with this flavor. Nicely chicken and it really is in a creamy sauce. One of the better flavors, IMHO. I will order these again.
