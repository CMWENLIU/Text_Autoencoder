I'm not English but my mother was so I grew up a confirmed tea drinker. The British often complain that they can't get a decent cuppa in this country. Sadly true!<br /><br />I spent most of my adult life looking for a tea company that would make the strong steaming cuppa that makes everything better. If you like a good black tea, THIS is the one. I tried Yorkshire Tea for a few years and then discovered Yorkshire Gold and there was no turning back! Even my staunchly American husband wants this tea each day. This is a tea that has substance and an excellent taste. I bought the 160-ct tea bags because I don't want to risk running out, especially now that my husband is demanding a cup of this excellent tea daily. Somtimes he wants it at bedtime to soothe his soul as he does his paperwork after I've gone to bed.<br /><br />I tried PG Tips, Red Rose, and other prominent English brands but although they were a distinct improvement over Tetley and Lipton teas (gag!), they are no match for Yorkshire Gold. I have found MY tea. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I believe it's time for a steaming cuppa on this rainy day! Cheers!
