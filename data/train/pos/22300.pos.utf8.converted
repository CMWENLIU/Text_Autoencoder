These can be fixed so many different ways.  They go well with pasta or potatoes, they can be mashed with mayonnaise for a good sandwich spread, they can be mixes with condensed mushroom or cheese soup and heated for a good gravy, and I'm sure there are dozens of other good uses for them.  A good extra for a meal.  They're even good plain!
