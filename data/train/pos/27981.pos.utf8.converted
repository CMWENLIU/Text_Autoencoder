I would love to be able to buy SoBe Fuji Apple Pear by the case for my husband.  He has completely given up soda and now drinks Lifewater...however, I pay $1.00 per bottle at our local Wal-Mart Store and would be crazy to spend $125.00 for 24/ 20 ounce bottles...this is outrageous!  Why would anyone want to pay 5 times the price?  I love shopping on Amazon, but on this item you will not get my business!!  Why is it so high?<br /><br />Disappointed
