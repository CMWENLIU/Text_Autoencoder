I ordered a the salt cooking slab as a gift for my son, and included was a little blue draw string salt sampler in a tiny glass that was totally crushed/broken.  When I mentioned this to Posh Salt, they sent me another one in the mail unexpectedly.  That was a very nice and unexpected gesture of great customer service.<br />My son enjoys the 8x8 salt block to cook upon, just as the directions indicate, and the food tastes incredible!  It will work in the oven in the house, but is so much better on the covered grill outside.  Just make sure you thoroughly heat it slowly, no salting of the meat needed!  Enjoy...
