When thinking about growing up in NW Ohio, food seemed to be the most remembered. Home made food, not that "Happy Meal" junk.<br />Most of our family gatherings were centered on a big feast.  The best cooks ever in my life were my great grand mother, and my father.  My grand mother a Polish/German woman that I'm sure could take shoe leather and make it taste like gourmet food. She used Coleman's Mustard in so much stuff I couldn't list it all.<br />The next in line for great cooks was my dad.  He used Coleman's dry mustard in making his rub for baked ham and in the summer for his famous baked beans.<br />I was taught by both in the kitchen and elsewhere, we won't talk about.  When ever I make baked beans I always use COLEMAN'S DRY MUSTARD, the flavor blends very well and is certainly noticed when missing or substutited.  A touch of Colemen's also make a great enhancer to potato salad and salad dressings.  Dry rub for ribs, "Forget about it" (said with a thick NJ accent). You won't know what your ribs did without it. It is good stuff and a little goes a long way.<br />OK, I relinquish the soap box and the memory trail to the next person.<br /><br />The reviewer:<br />I am a former "Flying Tigers" 23rd Tactical Fighter Wing, Information/Public Relations Specialist. I review things honestly, fairly and don't hold back if there is a problem and praise the good. I majored at the University of Toledo in Public Relations and Education with minors in Nutrition and Safety/Health and a former writer.<br />My regards, John Marshall
