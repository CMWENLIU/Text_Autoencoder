I received this as a wedding gift, and I was excited because of the bottle. I didn't think much of what was inside it. It just sat on my nightstand.<br /><br />I finally opened it a year and a half later on NYE 2012, and was AMAZED by how smooth it was. I will admit, I am not at all a vodka connoisseur, so take this review for what it's worth, but it's almost invisible to the tongue aside from a very light hint of mellow, spicy flavor. No burning or stinging at all to the nose or throat.
