I was first introduced to Pu-Ehr tea by a Chinese friend, who told me that most westerners do not like it.  After one sip, I agreed with him, and after one cup, I was hooked.  That's the way it is with Pu-Ehr tea - initially an acquired taste, then an addiction.<br /><br />This tea is quite a good Pu-Ehr for the price.  Some low quality Pu-Ehr tastes very musty and earthy; this does not.  I brew one brick in a 22 fluid ounce (0.65 liter), and this yields the entire Pu-Ehr experience.  (A can contains 25 bricks.)  The first cups are mild, but the bottom couple of cups yield the heavy duty Pu-Ehr jolt.<br /><br />Never add sugar or milk or lemon to Pu-Ehr, just take it straight or with dried chrysanthemum blossoms.
