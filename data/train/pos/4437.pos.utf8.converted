There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron.  The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost.  One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer.  Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron.  I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase.
