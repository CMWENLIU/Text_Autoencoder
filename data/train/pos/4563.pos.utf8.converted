This tea is like drinking a light hot chocolate that is spiced. Drinking it reminds me more of hot chocolate than, traditional Masala Chai tea. I add skim milk and raw sugar to this tea after brewing. You could add a bit of condensed milk, for a richer cup, or it would be lovely with soy milk, or other non-dairy creamers for those that are vegan, or do not eat dairy.<br />This tea tastes of chocolate, the kind of warm spices often used in bakeries, a little nuttiness rounded out by lush coconut.<br />This tea doesn't taste like the traditional chais sold at cafes, and such. It doesn't have any cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, or clove. In this tea there are big chunks of cut-up vanilla beans, long shreds of coconut, cocoa nibs, spices, and more. It is easy to drink, and childern may even like it.<br />If you like hot chocolate, but want something less rich, and more healthful, this tea is great. This isn't just an alternative to chocolate; it is a full flavored, aromatic, indulgent, and a seductive tea blend. It could be an everyday luxury. You may even wish your next cup of hot chocolate tastes like this chocolate chai, it actually makes hot chocolate pale by comparison.
