This is the best cereal. I like to use it as a base and add more oats, nuts and cranberries but it is great by itself too.Not too sweet, no overpowering spices like too much cinnamon and plenty of fiber. Great with fresh berries. I wish Amazon still carried more varieties of this product as it is so hard to find without paying huge shipping costs.
