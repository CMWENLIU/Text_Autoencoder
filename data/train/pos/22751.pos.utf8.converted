I was a little hesitant to purchase this item because the can was 70 oz and what if I didn't like it?? Well, for store bought caponata, this is delicious. I had it over pasta with a little parmesan cheese and I was in heaven. I spooned it over toasted garlic bread and my eyes rolled to the back of my head in ecstacy!!  I recommend it highly and I am buying my second can today after receiving the first can yesterday!  ENJOY!!!!!
