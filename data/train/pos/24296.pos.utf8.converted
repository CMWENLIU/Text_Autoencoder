I suffer from gout and get attacks every several months. Between attacks, my feet are swollen and painful. Dr put me on meds which i suffered side affects.  I heard about regular cherry juice helping gout and started drinkin it. I had No change.  I read about the Black Cherry extract and tried it. I started taking 2 tblsp of Black Cherry Juice extract at night and the very next morning all swelling was gone from my foot and I was pain free.<br />I take the extract every night now and have never had another gout attack! I also quit all my perscriptions!!!!  I read that the extract actually neutralizes the uric acid!  It works!  I have told many people about it and they too have had great sucess.  This stuff really works!!
