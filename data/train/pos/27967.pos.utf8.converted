Say that 10 times real fast.<br /><br />These sheets are like a sheet of paper. I immediately opened them and tried 1 sheet as is. It is very sharp like paper. It almost feels as if you could get a paper cut from them so be careful if eating them raw.<br /><br />I have never tried any other brands, but I own a few other Navita products and I have been satisfied with their quality.<br /><br />These sheets are very good tasting in my opinion.<br /><br />They have a similar taste to the green Mactha <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003O7T87C">DoMatcha DoMatcha Organic 2nd Harvest Matcha, 2.82-Ounce</a>, but with a much saltier taste in addition.<br /><br />I cant wait to try these sheet in a soup and a wrap. But they are even good just eating raw as I mentioned before.<br /><br />I recommend this brand for their taste, quality, and price compared to other organic brands of nori out there.<br /><br />****UPDATED 3/14/12<br /><br />I tried the Nori sheets in soup and they were amazing! They add a nice flavoring to the soup and even a overall salty taste, leaving you to add less salt to your soup.<br /><br />Also, I made some sushi using there. They were a bit hard to wrap because of their texture. They do come with perforated lines to show you were to make your cuts for sushi, but it didn't help. Unless you have a super sharp, samurai type knife (pun intended), then these sheets will be hard to cut through. That may well be the case with any seaweed sheet, but I would not know because this was the first time I made sushi.<br /><br />One other thing I could mention is these sheets are pretty big if you are making sushi wraps, especially if you place to roll the seaweed with the rice on the OUTSIDE of the roll. You could definitely get away with using a half a sheet. If you are rolling the rice on the INSIDE like I did, then you might have to use the whole sheet, but they will still be too big and you will waste a bit unless you cut it off and use the extra in a soup later.<br /><br />Even still, the sushi turned out amazing (even though I wasted quite a bit because of the cutting issue).<br /><br />I still recommend these sheets and will be buying more.
