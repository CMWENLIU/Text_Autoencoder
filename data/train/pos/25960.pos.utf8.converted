After years of very busy work schedule which did not allow good eating habbits, my health was taking a toll. I did not feel it when I was hounger. But in the last couple of years, my cholestrol got higher, my skin was at its worst, and constant constipation was making my whole body ill. Finally I decided to add some natural ingredients to my diet which was convenient and not time consuming. Flexseed meal was one of them.<br /><br />I add two teaspoons of flexseed meal to my morning oatmeal, my afternoon yogurt snack, and my dinner soup/rice/pasta. I still eat all my other meals like the good old days, and enjoy hearty breakfast on weekends, but I already feel a difference from those small changes. Oatmeal and flexseed helps to keep my cholestrol down, my skin clear, and keep me regular. Once my body is comfy, I am very happy and content. It was hard to imaging what eating healthy may change a person. But it really helps!<br />Of the few different brands of Flexseed Meals I've tried, Bob's Red Mill was one of the best. It tastes good, and it stays fresh a long time. I keep half a bag in an airtight container which I access a few times a day, and keep the rest in the freezer. The flavor is always constent till the last spoon this way.
