I can't eat any kind of wheat flour, but since I discovered Almond Meal (Bob's Red Mill), my diet is much easier to live with. I use 4 parts almond meal with 4 parts garbanzo (bean) flour and 1 part potato starch (NOT potato flour)as a substitute for regular flour. I've made brownies, peanut butter cookies, banana bread, and carrot cookies and found the texture and taste are not noticeably different than the original recipe, at least to me.
