Our family has eaten real maple syrup ever since we learned about all the vitamins and minerals you get when you eat it.  Buying it at Wally world (walmart) or local grocery store gets expensive.  Found this fabulous deal through the subscription service, comes as frequently as you want it to and it's great to say we get our syrup from a family business in New England!<br /><br />This is good syrup!<br /><br />Highly recommend, especially thru subscription!
