Been using Knox Nutrajoint for years. At my mother's suggestion, to help w/my athletic arthritis, I started taking Nutrajoint and was amazed that in two months, the pain was gone. I continued taking it for years and was able to exercise freely with no pain. For no reason, I just stopped taking it. And was sorry I did!! After two years, the pain came back. I started taking it again recently and am back!!! No pain in the knees at all! It is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it!
