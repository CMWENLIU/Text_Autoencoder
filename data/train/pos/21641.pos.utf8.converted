Ferrero Rocher is a morsel of milk chocolate with hazelnut filling.  The candy has a pleasant slighty crunchy taste.  Even though I generally prefer dark chocolate, I find Ferrero Rocher very tasty and not too sweet.  I also like the individual packaging of the candies.  Sometimes I can stop at one. However, more often I have to have a "chaser".  They are a satisfying treat!<br /><br />I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  "Online Price Alert".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful.
