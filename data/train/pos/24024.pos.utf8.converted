There are three broad categories of herbal tea that I rely on throughout the Fall, Winter, and early Spring:<br /><br />1) Citrus and lemongrass<br />2) Rose hips and hibiscus<br />3) Chamomile<br /><br />For me, Tazo has held first place in each of these categories for the last several years. This is no small feat - I'm cutthroat when it comes to my tea collection! Passion is an absolutely fantastic tea, eking out a slim lead over Harney and Sons Peach fruit tea (mainly a rose hips and hibiscus blend) because it is cheaper, easier to find locally, has a bagged version, and is more-or-less just as tasty.<br /><br />For those of you who have never tried it, you will find it is robust and tart. I happen to love tart, fruity herbal teas and this is the first one that I reach for whenever I feel a cold coming on and I want a heavy dose of bioflavonoids to go with my Vitamin C tablet. It's so strong that I often only steep it for 45 seconds, and then I use the teabag again for a subsequent cup with a fresh bag of something else, like Wild Sweet Orange. Just a tip ;)<br /><br />One reviewer felt misled by the name. There is a category of "medicinal" herbal teas and some of them claim to help people experiencing problems with their libido, etc and I guess this reviewer felt that the name "Passion" should be reserved for such a tea. This is not that type of tea, so look elsewhere if that's what you need.<br /><br />If you like tart, fruity teas, however, I heartily recommend it.
