This has been my go-to coffee bean for the last 2 years.  To say that I've tried many brands and flavors would be an understatement.<br /><br />What I find remarkable about this bean is that it delivers the full flavor of a bold roast without being overly bitter.  Whether you make your coffee on the weak side or crank it up to heart-fluttering strength, the flavor will keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />Another point of significance:  this bean delivers a great flavor whether you use a drip machine, espresso maker, or even an AeroPress.  Some brands/flavors tend to favor a specific prep-method, being great as an espresso-bean but delivering mediocre quality in a drip maker (or vice versa).  The Dark Brazillian manages to play every position on the field - amazing!<br /><br />What more can I say?  If it's my money being spent, I'm spending it on Dark Brazillian by Coffee Bean Direct :)
