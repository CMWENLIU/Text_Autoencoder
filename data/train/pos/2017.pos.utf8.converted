This is the larger size of the Sprout Master sprouter, great for larger batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray divider makes it easy to make larger batches or separate smaller sprout batches. Half of this tray still has more capacity than the whole of one of the Sprout Master small trays. If you're growing for one or two people I would recommend the "Sprout Master Mini Triple" instead. Coming with three trays the mini triple would allow you to grow a more diverse or more staggered crop.<br /><br />The two "lids" that come with this tray are exactly the same. Put one below to catch any water and use the one on top if you want to block off light (this helps prevent the growth of green leaves, which is usually how bean sprouts are grown). The Sprout Master's drainage holes allow excess water to drain off very effectively.<br /><br />If you've sprouted in a jar before, you'll probably find this to be much easier. Hold the tray under running cool water two or three times a day, then allow excess water to run off before putting the tray away. The sprouts should be thoroughly rinsed to prevent spoilage, kept moist at all times, but not allowed to sit in water. (By comparison, with jar sprouting you'd need to fill and drain the jar of sprouts repeatedly to rinse the sprouts well, then it's more difficult to get them properly drained.)<br /><br />One minor complaint is that some of the smallest seeds can get caught in the drain holes. In my experience, broccoli is large enough to be safe, but with alfalfa or clover you might get a few seeds stuck. When you're cleaning the tray after use you may need to get a small poking instrument to knock one or two out again. The "Easy Sprouter" device doesn't have this problem, but allows slightly less light to reach your sprouts because of it's shape. Neither is a very significant complaint, and I find that the Easy Sprouter gets sufficient light for most purposes.
