I sent this to my daughter because her son has autism and ADHD and cannot tolerate sugar or high fructose corn syrup.  She really liked it, and the kids liked it.  I only wish it were more readily available and not so expensive.  It is a good product, and she doesn't have to use much of it to have a nice sweet taste.  She doesn't use it all the time but for a treat it is nice.
