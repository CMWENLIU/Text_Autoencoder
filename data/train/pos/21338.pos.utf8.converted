Got turned on to the idea of "Manuka Honey" (originally, from Hawaian Bees feasting on the Manuka Plant/Flower) while reading about it after sampling 42 Below Vodka, and trying to find their Manuka Honey Vodka (seems none of the liquor stores in my region want to stock it), so with my curiosity peaked, I ordered the "Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey Active 12+ from Amazon. And as secrets unfold, it seems it is often used in the manufacture of some medications. After a week of using it, taking a teaspoon a day before breakfast, I must say, it is doing something to my body! And I like! The flavor and aroma is quite strong, and unless your pockets are lined with gold, it is a tad expensive to use as a sweetner, but honestly it may be worth doing so.<br /><br />It was well packed, and promptly arrived by some Air Express delivery service. First used it to sweeten a cup of Green Tea, though on the second day, I read the label and ingested it alone before my first meal of the day, according to the suggested instructions on the label. Hey, I'm no Scientist, but there's definitely something to it, and unless you have an allergy to Bees, I'd recommend trying it...  GBJ
