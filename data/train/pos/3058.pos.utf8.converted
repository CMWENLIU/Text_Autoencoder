I've been popping corn since the days when you had to put the popcorn on a hot stove, in a deep pot with a layer of hot oil and shake it with the lid held tight. My dad, always standing ready, would tease me, "Shake it but Don't break it!"  I lost Dad this year (he was 80) but my love of popped corn is still with me -- I probably have 2-3 of these daily!  Great diet meal-replacement with Pepsi One!  It's harder to find it locally, with supermarkets closing, merging, etc.  THANKS AMAZON!<br /><br />Joyce Thomas<br /><br />Chino Hills, CA
