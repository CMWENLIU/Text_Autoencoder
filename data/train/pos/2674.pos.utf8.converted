I've been buying Tilda rice for some time now and just felt it was right to post a small review.  It's by far the best rice I've ever tried.  As the other reviewers mention, when cooked the rice is so light and fluffy, not a ball of glue.  Perfect side dish!  I use the simple cooking instructions on the side.  Rinse the rice before boiling, heat up the water to boiling and dump the rice in.  Cook for about 10 minutes and then rinse in a colander with hot water to stop cooking.  Perfect every time!<br /><br />I've also purchased several times from the this vendor and have never had an issue, always prompt shipping and fresh product.
