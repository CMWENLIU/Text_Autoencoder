As expected its about a third less sweet than the 85% Lindt version. But even at 85% the sugar hooks me a little while with the 90% Lindt the taste of sugar is so faint I don't experience anything except the fullness of chocolate. So if you like the taste of chocolate but can't stand the bitterness of 99% this may be the bar for you.
