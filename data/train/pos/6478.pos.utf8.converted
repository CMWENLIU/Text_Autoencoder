I am one of those K-Cup snobs, who loves a hot cup of fresh coffee each and every time I get a cup.  Sorry, brewing 10 cups that sit in the pot for an hour til I want another cup just doesn't cut it for me.  But K-cups can get expensive (running $0.40 - $0.60 per cup depending on the type).  Well, I picked up a packaged of Cafe Bustelo, and used the individual insert K-cup, and OMG!  None of my prepacked K-cups come even close to the flavor and intensity of this coffee.  It's bold but not bitter.  A scoop is fine for making a single cup, and I am guessing I'm going to have about 40 cups per 10 oz package.  Cuts my cost down into the $0.10 range per cup!<br /><br />So if you are a K-cup user, try this brand of coffee.  You will not be disappointed.  BTW: I purchase this locally at Walmart for about $2.80 per 10oz package...
