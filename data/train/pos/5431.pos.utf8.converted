I was led to this product after researching sodium hydroxide which was listed as an ingredient on a bottle of oyster sauce in the store.  I didn't see the brand that I normally purchased and was looking for a substitute.  After learning that there is a food grade sodium hydroxide and it is commonly found in fruit and vegetable washes, which I don't use, I decided that I wasn't interested in eating lye, food grade or not, and I started searching for a natural product and Wok Mei came up in the search results.<br /><br />Even though the oyster sauce that I normally used didn't list any unusual ingredients, the Wok Mei oyster sauce wins hands down in terms of flavor, and it has made a noticeable difference in my stir frys.<br /><br />I purchased mine directly from the Honest Foods website in search of a better price on shipping.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite veggie stir frys.<br /><br />Bok Choy<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1 tbsp sesame oil<br />1 tsp freshly grated ginger<br />1 lb bok choy, sliced<br />1/4 cup water<br />2 garlic cloves, pressed or minced<br />1 tbsp oyster sauce<br />1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce<br />1 tbsp brown sugar<br />1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, optional<br /><br />Directions<br /><br />Cut end off bok choy, keep stalks together and slice.  Keep white stem pieces separate from green leafy pieces.  The white pieces need to cook a little longer than the leaves.  Keeping stem pieces and leaves separate, rinse and place in a salad spinner.  Or rinse and drain in a colander and pat with a paper towel to remove some of the water.<br /><br />To make the sauce, combine water, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes, if using, in a small bowl and set aside.<br /><br />Heat a 14" wok or large skillet over medium high heat. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DDVUE">Joyce Chen Traditional 14-Inch Flat Bottom Wok Set</a>  Combine the oil in a small bowl.
