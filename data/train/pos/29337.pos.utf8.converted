A few hours ago, I put a dime sized dab of this sauce on a corn chip and scarfed it down.  Initially, it was hot but certainly no hotter than other sauces I've had.  I quickly followed up with another dime sized dab on a chip.  Shortly thereafter, it began to feel as if my tongue was being electrocuted.  My eyes began to sting and my lips went numb.  The ecstasy brought about by eating spicy food poured up out of my mouth and into my head.  I laid down and the dog started to act very worried.  While prostrate, I focused on the pain and stared into the darkness of my own eyelids.  Every little thing becomes significant when the mind is seeking relief from pain.  I do not know what will happen when this stuff makes its way through my digestive tract.  I'll be eating more soon.
