I switched to this food when my persian cat was diagnosed with Lower Urinary Tract disease.  The high moisture content of this food aided in curing my cat (with only nutritional changes!).  My cats love all of the flavors, but one of them is allergic to tuna, so now I only feed them the paw lickin' chicken.  They won't touch any other brand of canned food now! The food is also very high quality--it contains no grains (cats are obligate carnivores--feeding them grains is ridiculous), no by-products, free-range meat, nothing artificial, and the cans are BPA-free! I highly recommend this food.
