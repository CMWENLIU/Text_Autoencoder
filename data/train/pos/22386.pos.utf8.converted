I was not sure what to expect with cacao versus processed cocoa. The first thing I made I put to much powder in, alot to much...lol. The second thing I made...yup, to much again. My kids and I are loving this stuff. They are much more willing to drink homemade raw almond and rice milk with a bit of cacao and honey in it. And...so exciting...my 12 year old drank her green smoothie this morning with no fuss at all. She told me that if I would let her drink chocolate almond milk, she could handle raw vegan, but she had to have milk to drink that she enjoyed. This is definitely a new pantry staple, and the fact that it is nutritious just sweetens the decision.
