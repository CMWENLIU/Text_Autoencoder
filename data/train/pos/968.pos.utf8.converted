I actually got this package as a "Black Friday" deal on Amazon, so my price was even lower than the one posted here. I couldn't believe that they had it on the sugar-free variety pack! So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn't resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are "clear."  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I'm in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product. My husband only wishes that the cherry flavor came in this deal, but hey, that means I get to use all of them.
