These anchovies are outstanding.  We actually ordered these at approximately the same time we ordered Nettuno anchovies from Italy in a large jar.<br /><br />These are truly gourmet.  Terrific flavor, and more importantly, unlike the  Italian anchovies packed in sea salt water in a large jar - these don't fall apart.<br /><br />In other words - when we reorder - These Acciughe Salate whole salted anchovies will definitely be on the very top of our list.
