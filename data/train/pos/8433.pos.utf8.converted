I was skeptical about all the claims but got to admit, it DOES remind me of the coffee I get when I visit Europe. Creamy, frothy, and great tasting! I use the Dark Roast pod and make two cups per pod and it is perfect for me (plus save a little money)! I hot, freshly made wonderful mug of coffee in less than a minute.
