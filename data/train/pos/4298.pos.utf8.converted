My nutrionist "prescribed" Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) to me many years ago when I was a child. Though I think I have "outgrown" it but I continue to drink it, mostly for breakfast because I like the various vitamins, minerals, and protein it provides along with the convenience. Most morning it is my only form of sustenance as I rush to work. Tastes great, can't go wrong with Vanilla. Sometimes I switch things up a bit and get the variety pack which has Strawberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate. Back in the "good old days" a box of 10 packs cost only 3.50. Now it ranges from 4.99-6.99 hence I have decided to go online and get the bulk pack which is a good deal relatively speaking.  If only they have vanilla flavor canisters available, like they do for chocolate. Definitely recommend CIB. In fact, I have recommended it to a handful of friends.
