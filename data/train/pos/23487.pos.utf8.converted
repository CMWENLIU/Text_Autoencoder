These are probably the strongest mints I've tasted other than Smints.  They are about the size and shape of a sweet tart.  Like the previous reviews stated, they  are kind of crumbly and dissolve quickly in your mouth.  Good for a quick blast of mint to coat your mouth.  If you're looking for a mint to suck on, you're better off with Spry.
