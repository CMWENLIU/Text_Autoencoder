I find "Honey Mustard" to be too sweet but this Dijon one is delicious.  It's tangy with a powerful mustard seed flavor.  It's really great on hotdogs and turkey or ham sandwiches.  Not every one would appreciate this strong flavor as I do but I think it's worth a try if you like the true, natural unadulterated mustard seed flavor.  The price is quite high but with the current sale, it's affordable.  Give it a try -- it's really tasty!
