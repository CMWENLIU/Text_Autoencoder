I was unable to breastfeed my daughter and after much research of formulas and stress as to what to feed my daughter I decided on this one.  She started gaining weight and is healthy.  Unlike my other children on Enfamil she did not have the gas and colic that went along with them. She is a happy, healthy baby.  I love that fact that the formula does not have sugar but uses brown rice syrup because of the health factors associated with sugar and fructose.  I am glad that it is organic and does not have all the garbage other formulas carry as well.<br /><br />An overall great formula!
