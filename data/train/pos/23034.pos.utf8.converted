Huge cans (5 1/2 pounds each) so be aware of that! We used successfully to make potato salad for a crowd. We just rinsed one can of the potatoes, cut them in half, and proceeded with the regular potato salad recipe. Turned out real tasty and saved us a lot of work. If you can use a large quantity of cooked potatoes, buy these.
