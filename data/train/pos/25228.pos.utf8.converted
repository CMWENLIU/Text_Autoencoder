This stuff is truly a miracle.  My husband has had problems with his shoulder for years.  He regularly takes tramadol for pain, which makes him drowsy and not able to function.  He started on the ACV 10 days ago.  He has very minor shoulder pain now and has not taken a pain pill since he started.  He was able to put his arm on the pew in church yesterday, for the first time in many years.  He says his shoulder has only a minor ache, nothing like the severe pain he was suffering. He will continue on the ACV.
