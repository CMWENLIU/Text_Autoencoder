When this food came out, my cats went crazy the first time I brought it home.  My older cats had liked the ground or classic cat food but these cats wouldn't have anything to do with it.  I've been buying this food for over a year and novelty hasn't worn off yet and even the cat across the street comes over for some.  They love it!
