I have been using this in my morning smoothie every day for a month now. And all I can say is...well, I have more natural, clean energy that lasts all day, and my digestion,hormone balance and sleep is MUCH better! I'm buying the bigger jar when I run out of this. Oh, and I keep my jar in the freezer and believe that makes a difference in freshness and quality!<br /><br />My suggested recipe:<br /><br />1 scoop Chocolate Amazing Grass<br />4-6 oz milk of your choice (I was using Soymilk, but now use Silk's Original Coconut Milk).<br />Ice<br />Splash of Orange Juice<br />Half a banana, and/or a few berries of your choice<br />1 Tbs. Almond Butter or Peanut Butter (optional)<br /><br />Makes one 16-oz serving. (or two 8 oz servings).<br /><br />YUM!
