I received the honey in 2 days as promised and I love it. I bought it because I read it was a homeopathic way to treat H. pylori bacteria. I got the honey today and I've taken 2 tsps. so far and the horrible stomach cramps are gone. Honey is very pleasant tasting. Expensive but worth it and cheaper than doctor visit + Rx costs.
