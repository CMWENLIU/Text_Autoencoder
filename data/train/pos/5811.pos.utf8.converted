I've been using this mix for years, but in order to get the kind of scone I love - more British than anything else - I don't follow their recipe.  Simply take the mix from the box, add heavy cream instead of water or milk, and flour your board with a half and half mixture of flour and granulated sugar.  After you've formed your scones and put them on a cookie sheet, let it sit for about 10 minutes (to allow rising) before you put it into the oven.  You will be amazed at how much better these scones will be than anything you've ever had before.
