I love the Mio line. The portable package is sleek and stylish. The concept behind using as much or as little as you like is wonderful, and for the most part the flavors are awesome.<br /><br />The Mango Peach is my sons favorite. For him this product became a most convenient money saver. During the school year  he would leave the house in the morning and have class until the late evening hours. So he was buying many juice drinks and flavored water drinks at school, and spending a ton of money. With the ability to tuck a bottle of Mio right into his pocket, he was able to bring a water bottle with him and refill it,  add the Mio,and have flavored drinks any time he liked. And he saved a nice amount of money in the bargain.<br /><br />I like the creativity that Mio affords me. I can have it mixed in a little seltzer or Pellegrino for an elegant faux cocktail. Or I can add a few drops to my regular home brewed iced tea for a fruity, tropical twist on an old favorite. It is so nice being able to find multiple uses for a product. I am glad I found this.
