This honey is good and good for you too!  Raw and organic.  It has an excellent taste and unlike other honey, it doesn't get all over and make everything sticky when you get a spoonful out of the container.  It has a different consistency than regular honey.  I highly recommend this.  Also, it is fair trade too.  Can't beat the price or the quality!
