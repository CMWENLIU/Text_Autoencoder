I bought these delicious coconut macaroons a couple of days ago at a local natural foods store, and am so happy to see them at Amazon. I hope they will add them to their "Subscribe and Save" program.  The ingredients are:  unsweetened coconut, honey, and egg whites.  The can also states:  no synthetic color, no artificial flavor, and no chemical preservatives.  It's great to be able to enjoy something so tasty without any dangerous chemical additives.  If you buy these, you will not be disappointed!
