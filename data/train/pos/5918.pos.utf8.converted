This formula has been a real lifesaver for my son. He had a difficult time digesting every formula we tried from NeoSure to Lactose Free to Soy. Unlike the other reviews, I believe the Enflora has helped. On the can, it recommends not warming the product because it inhibits the enflora to work. I believe this to be true. In order to save money, if my son didn't drink a bottle I made because I thought he was hungry and he wasn't, I would save and warm later. It seemed as though whenever I would warm, he would scream with pain until he either gassed or pooped. Pretty much what he did with all the other formulas he was on. We use room temperature water when mixing and it seems to be the key. I would recommend giving this formula a try. It's expensive, but if it helps your baby, it's worth it. Sign-up with Enfamil online and they'll send you coupons. Good luck. I understand how difficult it is dealing with a baby in pain.
