The grains were fresh and plump and produced Kefir well...re-produced more grains well also.  They grew very quickly and we ended up eating many because they have re-produced so much.<br />I liked the recipes and instructions that came with them also.<br />I also appreciated the list of the numerous bacteria contained in kefir he/she included.<br /><br />Good seller - good product.  Sorry to see others had problems.
