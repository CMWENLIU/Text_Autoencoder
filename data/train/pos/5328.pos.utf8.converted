I rarely take the time to write reviews but this product deserves the time.  This is simply the best Mangosteen product available.  I have been a long time advocate of the Mangosteen fruit and it's health benefits.  I have been a long time sufferer of chronic tendonitis and severe arthritis from numerous surgeries on my ankle.  This product does not solve all of my pain BUT daily use creates an extremely significant improvement!  The Mangosteen juice allows me to function normally and with a noticeably reduced level of pain.<br /><br />This product is SUPERIOR for 2 reasons.  First the product consists of Mangosteen WHOLE fruit.  The rind (or Pericarp) is where the majority of the Xanthones (the main benefit of the fruit) are found in the fruit.  Many companies exclude the Pericarp because it doesn't taste as sweet as the rest of the fruit.  "The Genesis product contains 100% wild harvested WHOLE fruit including the thick tough and bitter inner and outside rind (Pericarp). OTHER INGREDIENTS: NONE"<br /><br />The second reason which may not be as noticeable at first glance but Thailand is notorious for it dangerous and harmful use of pesticides.  Pesticides are poison.  If you already have health problems chances are that they're from ingesting toxins.  Many Mangosteen products use fruit sprayed with these poison and don't tell you anything about it.  My girlfriend sells one of these products (which is how I originally became interested in the Mangosteen fruit) and is upset b/c I switched to the Genisis brand.  I told her that as soon as her company removed all of the additional apple juice and filler crap, provided information on exactly how much Mangosteen juice is actually in the product, and provide information about the pesticides sprayed on the fruit they use, I would never switch back to a substandard product that may actually increase health problems rather than help.
