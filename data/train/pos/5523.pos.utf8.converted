While I love most of Kashi's bars, I can understand why some people find them to be too bland, too granola, etc. I just have to echo what other reviewers have noted. The combination of Dark Chocolate and Coconut makes these Kashi Bars delicious. I suppose the only hitch would be if you don't like coconut or dark chocolate. Then I can only feel sorry for your taste buds.
