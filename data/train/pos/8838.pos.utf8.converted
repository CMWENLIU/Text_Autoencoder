I received this as a gift from my son and brought it to work.  Everyone LOVES it. People bring in things to fill it all of the time. And my group is constantly visited by people around the office to take our candy. Heh<br />FYI-  DON'T use the new pretzel M&Ms. They get stuck and grind up the motor.
