My 2.5 year old has been drinking this "milk" since he turned a year old.  It has been a great alternative to cow's milk and soymilk. It is fortified with vitamins and minerals, and it has a TON of omega 3s, 6s, and 9s!  I like that this "milk" has a bit of healthy fat in it, since that's good for growing children.  I am aware of the sugar in this product, but per 1 cup it has 9g of sugar whereas regular whole cow's milk has about 13g per cup.  The flavor is a bit earthy and strong for me; it's difficult for me to enjoy even though I do drink other grain milks (rice, soy, oat, etc) without a problem.  However, my son is used to it and drinks it just the same as other toddlers his age drink cow's milk.  I have tried the unsweetened, unflavored, and chocolate versions, but my son didn't like those. Our pediatrician recommended this milk alternative, and she said it was fine to give him the flavored/sweetened stuff.  The consistency is thicker than rice milk (the most common alternative for children who can't drink cow's milk or soymilk), so it works well when I'm cooking/baking.  When my infant baby girl turns 1, we will most definitely be giving her this milk product as well.<br /><br />I really can't say enough good stuff about this product.  I highly recommend it.
