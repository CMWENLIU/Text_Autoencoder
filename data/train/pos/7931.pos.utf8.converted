This powdered sugar has a superior taste to non-organic traditional powdered sugar.  I use it to make homemade buttercream frosting for my cakes and the taste is outstanding!!  Everyone who eats it raves about how good it is.  My grocery store stopped carrying this and I baked a cake today with regular powdered sugar - the frosting is nowhere near as good.  I'm ordering from Amazon today!  Do not hesitate to buy this - it is a better product!!
