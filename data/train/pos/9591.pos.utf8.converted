I got this for Christmas and finally got my package off Italian herb seeds last month. Everything but the thyme is growing very well. The basil is very tall and full. The mint is doing great. Oregano is going wild. The thyme is growing but looks a little sickly. I'm thinking of getting another one after reading that strawberries are now available.
