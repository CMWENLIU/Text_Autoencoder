Move over coffee, I'll take some Morning Thunder.  When my doctor told me I had to seriously limit my coffee, (from 3-4 cups a day to 1 or 2 cups per week) I despaired.  How could I have the energy I craved to jumpstart my day without coffee?  I tried various teas and coffee substitutes with limited success.  When I found mate, I knew I was half-way there because I liked the energy, but I longed for stronger taste.  Hence, when I found Morning Thunder, with half mate and half black tea, I rejoiced.  A steaming cup of this, graced with soy milk, is truly a gift from God.  Enjoy!
