I've always used Red Star, which has worked fine in my baking, but I couldn't resist giving this yeast a try. What a value!<br /><br />WOW....does it make some nice bread. I didn't think there would be much difference, but this gives a faster and higher rise than Red Star.<br /><br />My new yeast. Great price, too!
