I used this for the first time last night.  The order arrived quickly.  I popped 2 cups of raw kernels on a popper that is a metal pot you put on a stove, with a crank that you need to turn while it is popping.  Did it with corn oil.  it was for a party at church, once a month with jiffy pop brand in the past with the same popper and same proportion of corn and oil.<br /><br />1.  Lots cheaper than grocery store price, and it was delivered quickly.<br /><br />2. taste was judged to be as good or better.<br /><br />3. more bulk and less waste than with Jiffy pop brand.
