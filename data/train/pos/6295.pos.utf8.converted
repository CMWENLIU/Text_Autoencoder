I had been feeding my Persian Purina One which he had been doing fine with. We then adopted a Himalayan mix who was constantly throwing up, whether she wolfed down her food or not. She was on original Science Diet. After doing a ton of research I decided that the natural ingredients in Wellness sounded like the way to go for BOTH my kitties. I had considered Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, but the ingredients in Wellness are much more appropriate for a feline's digestive system, so I decided to try it. I slowly mixed their food with Wellness over a week period, and for over a month now they haven been solely on Wellness. I am happy to report my kitty has thrown up only once!! I am so happy.  They both really enjoy it. I also feel better that they are eating food that is so much healthier for them. Highly recommended!!"
