This is the last of the three (elbows with four cheese, shells with aged wisconsin cheddar) that I tried, and I think it's better than the other two. In all, each variation is excellent, but this white cheddar sauce is excellent and has a very distinct flavor.<br /><br />My favorite addition to this is mushroom slices (or whole small mushrooms) seared in butter and garlic. After letting them pick up a golden brown in the frying pan, I douse them with vegetable broth, just to get the flavor stuck to the pan off it, and mix all that into the rotini and cheese sauce. Mmmmm.
