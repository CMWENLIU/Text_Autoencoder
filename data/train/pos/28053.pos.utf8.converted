I served this for the first time a few days ago in a casserole. My family didn't even know it was gluten free. We've been using Barilla Plus pasta for a while due to its higher protein count, but I can no longer have gluten. I was bummed out about cooking pasta for the family without getting to enjoy it so I decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />wonderful!<br /><br />I agree with the above poster that it needs less cook time than stated on the package.
