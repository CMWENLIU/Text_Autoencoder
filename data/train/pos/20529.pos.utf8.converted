Every so often I have used other brands of vanilla for all the usual purposes but I always come back to the predictability of Nielsen-Massey.  My uses range from flavoring oatmeal and whipped cream to baked goods. I am also on a limited income so cheaper brands always exert a siren call. Big mistake. N-M is simply the best.<br /><br /> I almost removed a star because when using the plastic bottle the 32 oz. extract comes in, there is no way to avoid the neck and cap getting crudded up with some of the vanilla which seems both a waste and poor design, so here's what I do. I decant a few ounces into a glass cruet (the kind you would put olive oil or vinegar into) and dollup it out a bit at a time. No mess that way.<br /><br />I think the smell of vanilla is one of the nature's greatest gifts, too. A few drops well applied can make a room smell wonderful.
