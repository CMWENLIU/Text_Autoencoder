This item has been a staple in my pantry for at least two years. As a vegatarian, I find that many foods lack flavor. Many stocks are overly salty and seem to ruin my dishes. This stock however is excellent and lasts seemingly forever. I don't think it is possible to be dissappointed in this stock.
