As promised, a very flavorful authentic bay area sourdough starter.  As with all sourdoughs, it is pretty slow rising and requires some fore planning if you want it for a specific meal, but well worth the effort.  We activated the culture then split it and froze a part of it, eventually we suspect that the local yeast and bacteria will contaminate this non native (to our area) culture and it will become diluted, so we'll be able to restart it and restore the flavor.
