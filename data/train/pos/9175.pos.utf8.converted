I drink green tea every day and have tried many brands and flavors.  This is probably my favorite, rich body without too much perfumy flavoring.  As I write this I feel like I am channeling my great uncle Edmund who was a tea taster in europe and very fussy about his tea.  Yes, Uncle Edmund says "give it a try".
