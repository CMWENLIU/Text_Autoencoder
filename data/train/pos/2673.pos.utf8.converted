I have lived in many places around the world and have always managed to find good Basmati rice, but I have never had anything like Tilda. Another reviewer mentioned that the grains are not stuck together. That is very true (low starch) but the best thing is the flavor contained within this rice. Once it is cooked, each grain is delicious and full of flavor. This is the quality where Tilda shines above the rest. The grains are not just long and separate, they are delicious. When I run out and can't find Tilda, I buy something else from Indian stores in Queens. Some are very good, but not as good as Tilda. When you cook it, the aroma builds up - the scent of sacks and far-away places - like nothing else. It goes very nicely with some quality saffron. I find that Tilda is perfect with Turkish or Moroccan food and is great for pilafs (of all sorts, but especially amazing with lamb).
