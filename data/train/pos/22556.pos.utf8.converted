Deer Off really does keep deer, woodchucks and rabbits from eating our garden plants, shrubs and trees.  It works winter and summer in our semi-rural southern Wisconsin location.  Rain will wash it off, but usually applying it every few weeks does the trick.<br />I recommend using the concentrate.  Keep the bottle in your refrigerator.  No, it won't make your 'frige stink!  We mix it up as needed and spray it with an inexpensive plastic pressurized sprayer.  Diluted concentrate in the sprayer does not spoil, but will freeze in the winter as it is water-based.<br />The concetrate seems expensive, but it's much cheaper than buying the pre-mixed version.  Just a light application on each plant is all that's needed to be effective.
