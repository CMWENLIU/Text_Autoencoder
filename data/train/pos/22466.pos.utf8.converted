I actually purchased 2 sets of this tea. One for myself and the other box for my friend in Saudia Arabia. I decided to try drinking more tea and less coffee and wasn't sure if the switch was really going to happen. I had already purchased several brands of teas from my local suppermarket but nothing was convincing me to give up the coffee until I got this selection.<br /><br />This ain't your mothers tea!!<br /><br />The first one I tried was the Jasmine Flower Tea. The directions say to let it brew for 1-2 mins but as soon as i poured the hot water you instantly get an aromatic hint of things to come. Just a little milk with this tea and your tastebuds are dancing a jig.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the brewing direction of each variety because some require a longer brewing time.<br /><br />I have replaced 3 cups of coffee with these teas and cut down on my sugar intake(not putting as much sugar in the tea as I did the coffee).<br /><br />There is one problem though...I do not know if my friend in Saudia Arabia is going to get the box I bought for him.
