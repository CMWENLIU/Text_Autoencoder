Two other reviewers have already spoken. The most recent one attempting to undermine what the first reviewer had said. Actually, the first reviewer DOES know what he is talking about. Green tea DOES contain caffeine. This from an expert source:<br /><br />Caffeine<br /><br />Although black tea is thought to have the highest caffeine content of all tea, this is actually untrue. Green tea has more caffeine. However it must be understood that because of other compounds, the caffeine in green tea functions in a special and balancing way. The caffeine in green tea is surrounding by tannic acid compounds, which inhibit it from surging all at once into our bloodstream. In a sense, the caffeine in green tea is time-released into our bloodstream. This time-release effect makes the stimulation gentle and quite pleasant. It also allows us to feel the effects of green tea for an extended period of time, and outlasts the effects experienced by our friends, who are drinking coffee or cola. The effect of green tea makes us free of agitation and nervousness, and its blissful stimulation feels good to the senses.<br /><br />Enough said.........enjoy your tea.............
