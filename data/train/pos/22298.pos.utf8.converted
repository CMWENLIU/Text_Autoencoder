These are great for making macaroon cookies.  They bake up nice and crispy.  If you want more finely shredded coconut, you can use a food processor to chop them up.  I make macaroons regularly as a tasty way of adding healthy coconut to our diet.  Since these are organic and unsweetened I use my own sweeteners and other healthy ingredients to make great recipes.  Buy in bulk if you plan to use the coconut regularly.  Note, these are dehydrated flakes, so macaroons made with this are not the usual kind made with fresh, finely shredded coconut.  They are more crispy like a cookie and we love them.
