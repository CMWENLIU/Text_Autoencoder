I just tried this for the first time today.  It was wonderful!!!  I don't know a lot about Indian food but I know what I like and I loved this!  It had just the right amount of spice and flavor.  I cut up a few chicken breasts, added the packet & butter and put it all over rice.  I highly recommend getting this for a quick and tasty meal!
