These Twiglets are straight up OFF THA HOOK. When my girl brought them to my crib, I was like "I don't need no Twigletz up in this bizzy!" Then I reached back like a pimp and smackt a ho'.  But the ho' smaccking got me madd hungiez, so I cracked open the Twiglets... and ZOMG THESE THINGS ARE DA BOMB~!  They sort of taste like a combination of Cool Ranch Doritos, Milk Duds, and Dippy Doo brand Men's Hair Pomade(tm). This is the perfect snak to enjoy with a fine cognac or a 40oz Malt Liquor. But if you gets to snacking on the Twigletz, be sure to keep yo' lavatory well stocked with the toilet papers- 6 rolls minimum.  Trust me on this one peoples :|
