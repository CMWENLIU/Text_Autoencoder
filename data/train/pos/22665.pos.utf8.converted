When I first got a sample of this tea I wasn't expecting to much do to my previous experiences with other pomegranate tea on the market, but boy was I surprised. This tea is a good black tea with a light hint of pomegranate, it is great stuff compared to all the flowery/herbal junk from their competitors.<br />If you like your flavored tea to actually taste like tea then this is the one for you.<br />Ingredients: black tea, natural pomegranate flavour with other natural flavours.
