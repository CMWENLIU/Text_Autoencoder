This stuff is hard to explain.<br /><br />It seems most similar to green tea, but it has an earthier taste, nuttier maybe. I drink it through a high quality stainless steel coffee-like filter rather than the traditional gourd and bombilla. The gourd and bombilla just seem like way too much trouble to me.<br /><br />I have read it has more anti oxidants than green tea, and judging from the thick cloud of green "tea" it can produce I don't doubt that. It actually has some identical antioxidant components that green tea has after I researched it, but they have different ones as well that I won't begin to attempt to understand or explain.<br /><br />It doesn't give me the nauseous feeling that I experience with green tea first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, which other of my friends say they get too if they drink green tea on an empty stomach. Also if you brew it too long, it will not get bitter like green tea gets, which is very nice.<br /><br />This stuff is advertised as having a different kind of caffeine that is more mellow. I do not believe that at all, this stuff gives a serious kick. If you have ever experienced a caffeine headache, this stuff can give it to you in a single strong cup. I do not drink soda by the way, but I do drink coffee, about once a week. This stuff seems at least as potent as espresso to me. I am not a daily intaker of caffeine, so my tolerance to it is probably quite low, but that is my experience.<br /><br />I like it to switch up my regimen of green tea, since I don't drink soda, or much coffee, or juice, drinking only green tea and water can get bland. And this stuff is a welcome change of pace that is a pleasant and mellow taste.
