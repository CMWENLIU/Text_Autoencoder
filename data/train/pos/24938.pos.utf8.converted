I have been highly averse to "sweeteners" ever since I was a kid watching my mom dump equal in her coffee in the 80's. To this day she still uses whatever fake stuff she can get her hands on. I don't like the taste of any of them, splenda, equal, sweet'n'low. ick. For that reason I've only used raw sugar or when I'm low on $$, white processed sugar just because it's not a bag of chemicals, and that's a plus in my book.<br /><br />Lately I've been hearing about the stevia based sweeteners, and figured it might be time to give it a try. Stevia has been a bit controversial, as it was banned in 1991 by the FDA(but isn't anymore) and now is ban in Europe and a few other locations. But the reasons for banning are vague and don't seem completely investigated, just that there was "pressure from the market" to stamp them as unsafe.<br /><br />It was important to me that it be natural, because I go as much organic/natural as possible. I knew I wouldn't be using a boat load of it, so I'm not concerned about the controversy. I compared a couple of the stevia based sweeteners in price at the grocery store and this won out as my first to try. To be honest, it's pretty darn good! From a picky taster to you, this is worth giving a try. Dipping my finger in it, it has a cool(as in, cold)super sweet taste. I'm using 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of sugar in my coffee, and this was about 1/2 a packet or less to make it how I like it. I've only put it in my ice coffee so far, but I'm not noticing a huge taste difference between this and my usual sugar, which is great. No after taste to speak of. The price is do-able and I'll definitely buy it again, but I'll also be checking out the other brands.
