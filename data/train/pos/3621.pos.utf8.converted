This pasta tastes good. It's a little different because it has potato in it. The nice thing you don't have to rinse. I noticed that it's very important to follow cooking time like on directions, so that it doesn't get too soft. On the package it gives you an exact cooking time, and it's best to follow it minute by minute.
