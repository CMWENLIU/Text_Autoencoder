We have a Keurig coffee brewer and are always on the look out for strong but not bitter coffee.  The Emeril Jazzed Up Decaf fits the bill.  It is strong but without that bitter aftertaste that sometimes gets confused with "strong."  You would not know that you are drinking decaf coffee.  We have tried other Emeril K-cups and have been please with them as well.
