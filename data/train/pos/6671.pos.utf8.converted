I am a confirmed salt lover - and this is my favorite salt. I love the taste; after using this conventional salt tastes like the industrial waste that  it is. I keep a shaker at home, in my work truck and in my Jeep. I've been thinking of getting a little shaker that I could take into restaurants with me.<br /><br />FWIW I do not buy into the notion that salt is bad or causes high blood pressure. I use a lot of salt and my blood pressure is low normal. The research that spawned the low salt mania was flawed and it retains its hold because there are a lot of big companies making a ton of money selling "low sodium" products. Follow the money.<br /><br />Give this salt a try - you will love it.
