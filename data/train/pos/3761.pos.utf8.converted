These are the greatest wafer type cookies I have ever eaten. I've also tried the lemon ones which are out of this world as well. They are wafer type but are cut into small cubes (ideal for snack size) instead of how they usually appear as a longer stick. They are very creamy and have a high quality chocolate taste. Awesome stuff. You'll only be sorry when they are gone and you have eaten too much.
