Last night I made a pot of chili using this chili powder, and it was probably one of the best tasting batches of chili I've ever made (been making chili for over 20 years).<br /><br />16 oz of chili powder is quite a bit.  I use about 3tbsp per 5qt pot of chili, and probably make chili about once every month or two...so this will last me probably a couple years.<br /><br />Be sure to have a container to put it in, because it comes in a non-resealable foil bag.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/18/2012<br />OK, so it didn't last me a couple years.  9 months after purchase, I probably have enough for another 6 or so pots of chili, so I'm back to order more.  Less than $10 for one year's worth is certainly a good deal.<br /><br />To make my chili spice mix, I blend this chili powder with Oregano, Basil, Thyme, Marjoram, Cumin, Black Pepper, & Salt.
