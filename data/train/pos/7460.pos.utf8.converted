R. Adams said "The weight of the container is stated to be 10 ounces. It's not! The turmeric powder arrived in 8 ounce jars."<br />R. Adams has confused liquid ounces with dry ounces.  A liquid ounce is a measure of volume whereas a dry ounce is a measure of weight.  Thus an 8 ounce jar, which holds 8 liquid ounces, could hold a variety of materials, each with a different weight, depending upon the density of the material in the jar.  Therefore the only way to tell if there is 10 ounces of powder in the jar would be to weigh the powder.  Imagine if you will that an 8 ounce jar could be filled up with rocks or marshmallows. You would not expect these 2 jars to weigh the same.<br />I'm giving this product 5 stars just to counterbalance R. Adams's unfortunate error.
