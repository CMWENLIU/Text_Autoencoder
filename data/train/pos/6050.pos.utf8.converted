I am so glad I got two of these. The product is expensive for chocolate, but the quality is amazing. It tastes soooo good... I'm not sure what else to say! I'm having a difficult time not eating it all in one night. I can taste the bitterness of dark chocolate, but there's definately vanilla in it. And not fake vanilla; you can really tell all of the ingredients are 100% real.<br /><br />Also the seller provided large bubble wrap (I love bubble wrap), and a free tin of caffenated mints. It's a small object, but a huge gesture. I will definately be purchasing this chocolate again, and definately from this seller.
