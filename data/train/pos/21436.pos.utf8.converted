Anyone following a gluten-free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten-free version of anything - and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good.  This is one gluten-free product I am completely delighted with - both in taste and price.  These corn flakes are crunchy and delicious (I like them better than the glutenated alternatives), and work well for other recipes.  Candies, cereal crumb pie crusts, fried chicken, etc.
