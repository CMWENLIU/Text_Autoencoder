I bought Navitas Maca after I tried a sample of another brand to add to my smoothies. I immediately felt the effect not in energy boost but in a very sharp and clear mind (surely the adaptogen qualities of the maca) a couple of minutes after I drank my raw cacao and maca smoothie and that effect lasted all morning long with just a tablespoon of maca.<br /><br />Indeed you have to let you body rest of maca about one week per month or the effects diminish or vanish. I noticed two weeks ago I wasn't having the same effect as before so this week I took Maca off my smoothies. But tomorrow: Maca again!!!<br /><br />I have never tasted along but in a Superfood smoothie and the smell is very good, almost sweet.
