I got these since they were on sale, I love ramen especially nong shim, but I thought I would give Maruchan a try. Surprisingly, I really liked this ramen. It has a creamy taste, mixed with chicken broth. It reminds me of creamy pasta but not overly creamy, I should say just right creamy taste. If you are looking for NONspicy, "americanized" ramen, this is it. Give it a try. But, please do NOT add 2 cups of water as it says in the bag, I add 1 cup to 1.25 cup of water instead and it tastes much better.
