I do like my coffee on the Dark end of the roasting scale, and this offering from Timothy's delivers.  It is a nice smooth, smoky blend with even a hint of crema at brewing.  It also holds up well to cream if that is your preference.  The Extra Bold delivers the added punch that I routinely seek in my coffee, although I must admit that the 'Espresso' name is a bit misleading, as I have yet to find a K-Cup that delivers the full zing of a shot of espresso.  Either way, in the K-Cup genre, this one is among my favorites!  Give it a go!<br /><br />Pricing here at Amazon is excellent - just wish they offered the variety of makers that I have found at other online sources...
