We love coffee at our house and by way of our son's trips to Austin, we discovered Ruta Maya.  This is amongst the best, full-flavored, smoothest tasting coffee we have ever had.  We strongly recommend it.  But don't get fleeced by paying as much as Amazon charges.  It is $8.95 per pound at the Ruta Maya website [...] plus shippling and handling.  We recently ordered six bags plus a 12 oz. bag to try their dark roast Cubita coffee and S&H was $11.95.  I am amazed at the Amazon price as we are regular Amazon customers and frequently find its prices lower than most other sources of items.
