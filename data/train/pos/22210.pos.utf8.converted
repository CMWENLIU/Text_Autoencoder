I have been looking EVERYWHERE for this catnip spray since I found a bottle of it at a local dollar store. This has to be the BEST catnip product of all time. When I spray it on my cats' toys they go totally nuts! Toys they haven't played with in years, ok months, are drooled & fought over. While I wish I were still paying a buck a bottle for it, its worth every penny just to find it. Can't wait to see them Christmas morning when they find it in their stockings.
