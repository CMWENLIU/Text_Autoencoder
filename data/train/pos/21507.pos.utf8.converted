The best green tea I've had, and at such a good price!  I thought $25 for the same size package was a good deal until I saw this.  I've seen the same size pack go for $40 at a local shop.  The flavor is very floral with no bitterness at all unless you overbrew it.<br />The tea is fascinating to watch when it brews.  The 'pearls' will unroll into little branches, which are the tender shoots of the tea plant.  Because the tea shoots are large, there is no need for an infuser since they stay at the bottom of the cup.  In fact, the metal of the infuser can give the delicatley flavored tea a funny metallic taste.  So I don't reccommend using a metal infuser, if you are squeamish about seeing your tea leaves at the bottom of the cup, go for a nice ceramic infuser.  They make teacups with a built in ceramic strainer, one of those would be ideal for this tea.<br />One caution: it is done when it TASTES done, even if it doesn't LOOK done.  It's a very pale colored brew.  I live at 6500 feet in elevation, and I usually have to boil the water to get it to brew to the proper strength within ten minutes because of the lower boiling point.  At sea level, use almost boiling water.  The directions say brew time is 90 seconds or less, but it usually takes three to five minutes depending on how strong you like it.
