I am hoping this will be included in the Amazon Prime selection soon because as a frequent protein- and nutrition-bar consumer, this one is the best I've found so far.<br /><br />I also like Odwalla Super Protein, Kashi Protein Roll bars, and Atkins Nutrition bars, but they are all 190-250 calories which I find a bit too high in calories for an afternoon or mid-morning snack.<br /><br />This Marathon Nutrition (different from Marathon Energy) bars comes in two flavors, almond nut crunch and dark chocolate, and the dark chocolate flavor is excellent and true to the description.  It has no discernible metallic/chalky aftertaste that many of the fortified bars have (although this includes a good range of vitamins and minerals too), and contains the following macronutrients:<br /><br />Calories: 150<br />Protein: 11g<br />Carb: 22g with 7g fiber and 9g sugar<br />Fat: 4.5g<br /><br />150 is just right for me, and 11 grams of protein with that calories profile is EXCELLENT.  Most of all, it's delicious.<br /><br />The only drawback that I can see in these bars is the relative unavailability in markets (I think it's still new), and its non-organic ingredients.  Overall, excellent, healthy product from a candy brand.
