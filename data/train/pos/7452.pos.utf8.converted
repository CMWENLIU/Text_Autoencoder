McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />This is, by far, the best-tasting instant oatmeal available with a firmer texture (not as mushy) than others. The flavors are clean and not too sweet. I've been buying this product for years; it's the only oatmeal my kids will eat. Most markets no longer stock this product.
