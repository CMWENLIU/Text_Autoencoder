Yesterday I spent my day in the strawberry patch. I picked eight quarts, and while most of the berries were destined for jam, I made sure to set aside a bowl full of berries to make the first strawberry shortcake  of the season.  Shortcake in our family consists of a generous portion of sugar-sprinkled fruit, a large helping of fresh-whipped cream (sugar and vanilla, too, of course), and all served on top of a still-warm biscuit fresh from the oven that must be made from scratch (Bisquick? Blech.....).  We've only been gluten free for just under two years, and for that time I've neatly avoided, and sorely missed, those homemade biscuits.  Last night I grabbed the  Mama's Almond Blend that had been waiting patiently in my cupboard, screwed up my courage, and made my mother's old fashioned biscuit recipe with it.  Using a fresh-layed egg from one of my hens, baking powder, sweet butter, whole milk, and a small amount of xantham gum, the dough mixed up precisely as it would have had I used wheat-based flour.  The biscuits plopped onto the parchment-lined baking sheet like they always used to, and they baked up golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Oh, they were heavenly!  The best part of our dinner aside from the food I was inhaling (and yes, our dinner consisted solely of strawberry shortcake - another family tradition on strawberry picking day) was when my non-gluten-free partner in crime took his first bite, and then looked at me and asked, "How come you're eating these biscuits?  Aren't you going to get sick?"  He literally could not tell that these yummy treats were gluten free!  I've tried many other gluten free flours in my role as a gluten free product tester, and this one is literally the best I've had.  While other gluten free blends are decent, and can produce the end result many are after, Mama's Almond blend is stellar: texture, taste and results all parallel gluteny flours, and in my recipes Mama's outperforms the rest of the pack of gluten free flours.  My little two pound bag is nearly gone - a batch of chocolate chip cookies this morning proved that it is dollar-to-serving worth its weight (and will significantly increase MINE if I continue to bake and eat like this!); the dough didn't even need to be refrigerated like other gluten free doughs before baking.  I'm one happy camper - and this will be my personal go-to choice for flour from this day forward.  It's a marriage made in gluten-free heaven!  Next up for Mama's Almond Blend - cheddar biscuits to go with homemade chili...and with blueberry season around the corner, and peaches ripening shortly after them, I think I'd better stock up - gluten free summer baking never felt so good!
