I have purchased The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg brand peanuts with several different labels.  They are consistently perfect, with a taste and texture as close as you can get to the old fashioned "just cooked, hot out of the oil" peanuts of my youth.<br /><br />This brand is the only one I've found that uses peanut oil rather than the genetically modified cotton seed oil that is used for most other brands.  I think there are a couple other brands "out there" that do not use toxic oils, but I'll stick with this one!!!<br /><br />I like things more salty than a lot of people so I usually sprinkle a little extra sea salt on the nuts when eat them but I think they are just right out of the can for most people.<br /><br />If you really want to splurge and have a good food processor -- these nuts make the best peanut butter anywhere!
