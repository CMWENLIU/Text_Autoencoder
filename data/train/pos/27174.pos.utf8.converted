My family found Veggie Straws a few months ago and are hooked! Incredibly tasty and simple, and better for you than typical potato chips.  These are made with potato, tomato and spinach, along with sunflower oil and salt.  That's it. No crazy ingredients, no weird flavors. My children love them, and we frequently pack them for road trips.  They're middle of the road as far as fat/calorie content - 38 straws (good sized portion) is 130 calories and 7 gms fat (mostly from the sunflower oil).  If you have a Costco nearby, they are a better bargain there - each large bag is $4.99.
