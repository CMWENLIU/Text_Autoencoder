i love the pastry. i love the filling. i love my pop tarts. they are packaged very well and i had very little damage. any damage i think would be from shipping. the two tarts are packaged in an aluminum foil like material for freshness. i just pop mine in the toaster for a couple minutes. i really like the crust alot. i am reordering because i like them so much and the price is really good. always watch for a sale price or special on them.
