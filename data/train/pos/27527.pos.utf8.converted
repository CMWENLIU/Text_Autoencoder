I recently gave up coffee & made the switch to teas.  Lipton & other grocery blends were bitter or weak.  I purchased the loose tea leaves from Amazon at a good price & quick shipping.  English friends suggested PJ Tips (?) tea which we found & ordered from another online site.  Twinning's blows it away.  Both the Earl Grey & Irish Blend are great both on the pallet & to the nose.
