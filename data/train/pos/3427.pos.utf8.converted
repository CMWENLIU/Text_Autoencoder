I'm very active and a huge fan of coconut water and drink 1 or 2 cans a day (sometimes more).  I'm definitely aware of the carbon footprint that I'm leaving as I contribute to shipping coconut water around the world.  But for me, nothing beats coconut water when exercising or when i first wake up in the morning.... I admit my addiction.  I LOVE COCONUT WATER!!!<br /><br />A friend of mine told me about CocoHydro and i was skeptical at first.  I read about it on their website, it seemed like a noble idea coming from a good company, so I decided to order it.  To my surprise, I really like it!  I would have ordered the Original flavor, yet Amazon was out of stock (i've backordered), so I ordered the Pineapple.  It is really good!  Pretty authentic flavor and I can definitely feel it hydrating my body.  It's in my water bottle when I'm on my bike and it works great!  I do look forward to trying the Original flavor, as that will be the determining factor for my ultimate opinion on this product.<br /><br />I do add more of the powder than is recommended on the instructions, as i like a stronger flavor.  I also add a pinch of salt, as I like more salt when I exercise.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be a staple in my kitchen and water bottle!  Its much cheaper than buying cans of coconut water.<br /><br />While nothing beats a fresh coconut cracked open, sitting on the beach of Costa Rica, waiting for the perfect wave to come in, this is a great alternative for us coconut water addicts in North America.<br /><br />I support it.
