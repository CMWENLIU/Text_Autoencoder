I originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe I found that said it was "de rigeur", however I thought it was like any other salt simply grainier.  Of course, I only added a little bit of salt after I had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish.  Can you imagine my surprise when I tasted the fish, only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth.  I must say that I'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore.  Now I understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts...
