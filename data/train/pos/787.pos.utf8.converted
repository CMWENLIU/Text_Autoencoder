I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I've always been so jealous of Nespresso's collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!
