I can't bring myself to make Pizza with regularly available flours.  This stuff makes it easy to roll the dough in a round and make it as thin as you want.  I would like to find it locally though, as the shipping is more than the flour, which is twice as expensive as regular flour as it is.  Still there's no going back.
