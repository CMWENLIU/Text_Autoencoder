I decided to go on the low GI and found that this cereal was low gi and high in fiber.  I get 50% of my fiber from one bowl of this and don't have to worry about the usual added (or hidden) sugar or sweeteners that is in many other cereals that say they are healthy like fiber one.  Also, this tastes very good!
