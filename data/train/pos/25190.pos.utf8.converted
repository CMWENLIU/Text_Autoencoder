This is heavenly in espresso! One pump of this sugar-free dark chocolate syrup and my mornings are now sweeter without sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy this because of a previous experience with a different brand, but I shouldn't have worried. The Amoretti's has a wonderful dark chocolate flavor to it with a touch of sweetness, though not heavily so.<br /><br />Note that Amoretti's customer service is also splendid. I wasn't sure what they meant when they said no artificial sweeteners, concerned that there might be sweeteners called 'natural' (but that really aren't). They called me and let me know the good news - no sweeteners of any kind. Apparently, their (Amoretti's) extract process allows some sweetness through, but they add none.<br /><br />There are a few calories (15) and carbs (4g) per serving, but so worth it.<br /><br />The cost may seem a bit high compared to other syrups, but not only is this of the highest quality, a pump is included.<br /><br />Let me repeat myself - so worth it!
