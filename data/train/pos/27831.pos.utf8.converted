As you may have read, seaweed is a good source of nutrients, and has benefits for your skin and hair. Wakame is a kind of kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads.<br /><br />If you use wakame a lot, this bag will fit your bill. I've been using this brand for years because it's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more. Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I've had in Japan.<br /><br />There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy.<br /><br />Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice. You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo, or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods.<br /><br />Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating, otherwise it'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy.<br /><br />Product of Korea.
