I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong.
