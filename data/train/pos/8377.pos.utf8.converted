This is a great sauce but be warned it is extremely hot.  It uses the world's hottest pepper, the Bhut Jolokia.  Unfortunately, unlike some sites that actually sell sauces online, you don't know the ingredients to the sauce and so for those that like to know before you buy, here it is: Bhut Jolokia pepper, carrots, papayas, lime juice, vinegar, onion, passion fruit juice, citric acid, garlic, salt and xanthan gum.
