This is an excellent green tea. It is unsweetened (which is hard to find in the U.S.), which makes it easy to drink. I keep buying case after case from Amazon.<br /><br />Another unsweetened green tea from the same Japanese manufacturer is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017T2MWW">Ito En Teas' Tea (Oi Ocha) Japanese Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />I can't tell much difference between the two--I order whichever one is cheaper.
