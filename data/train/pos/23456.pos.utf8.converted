I have been using this brand of curry paste for decades.  I usually picked them up at Korean or Chinese markets and at a really good price.  I found them to be incredibly useful for a wide variety of dishes.  A really quick meal could be made by mixing the paste with coconut milk over low heat.  I could then add it to cubed browned beef, chicken, tofu or shelled shrimp, diced potatoes, tomatoes, onions, garlic or a myriad of other ingredients.  When served over Jasmine or Basmati rice I would have tasty meal for my family in less than 30 minutes.  The curry pastes can also be used for more complex stews and curries or even as a rub for a roast (I like to mix the green curry with a little grainy mustard and rub it on a chuck roast.)<br /><br />About 3 or 4 years ago this product (and the others in this line) started to get harder to find.  I have heard this same complaint from friends of mine across the county.  I could purchase something similar, but not the curry paste that I was used to.  I am so happy to have found this product on Amazon.  The price is just a little more than I found at the ethnic markets, but not very much.  I will buying this here on a regular basis from now on.
