Before switching to Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon, my boston terrier seemed to have negative reactions to everything he ate. His stools were consistently soft and he frequently broke out in rashes and would scratch and itch until he bled. We kept trying new brands of dry food hoping to find something that agreed with him. We were amazed how quickly things turned around when we started him on Blue Buffalo. His stools are finally normal and his skin has never looked better. His coat is even shiny! I'm so glad we found this product!
