<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CZ9R1A">Bonsai Boy's Slow Release Bonsai Fertilizer Pellets</a>I received the Bonsai inn excellent condition and before the scheduled delivery date. At first I was somewhat skeptical as the buying this particular Bonsai because it has received some negative reviews in the past. However; my tree has been doing great i take care of it just how the instructions that were included with it say and it has not skipped a beat so far. Really all it needs is good sunlight everyday and a drink of water and it will do just fine. Also i do recommend buying the bonsai boy fertilizer for the tree I have used it and it has worked great for this tree I think that is only around $5.
