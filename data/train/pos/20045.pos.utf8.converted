This gum is pretty decent. It loses its flavor after only a few minutes of chewing, but I don't chew it for the taste. It tastes good, but there are other benefits to chewing this gum and those are more important to me. I generally pop 2 pieces in my mouth after each time I eat and chew for anywhere between 15-45 minutes.<br /><br />I think it does an excellent job of removing the food from my teeth, especially the deep pits of the molars. It helps to reduce cavities by not allowing the bacteria to munch on the leftover food in your mouth.<br /><br />I generally have a nice clean feeling in my mouth after chewing. This gum does not replace flossing - I recommend that people still floss, but the dental benefits of this gum are fantastic.<br /><br />Best of all it's sweetened with xylitol which won't cause your bloodsugar to spike and it does not contribute to cavities because of the structure of the xylitol molecules.
