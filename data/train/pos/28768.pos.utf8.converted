Sea's Gift truly is a gift. Being vegan, I am always on the look out for tasty, nutitious, easy to eat snacks. Sea's Gift has become a staple for lunch. I toss it into steamed rice and vegies or, my favorite, "Avacado Roll Salad." Take one pouch of Sea's Gift, green onion, cucumber, seasoned rice, and avocado. Just mix it together and I swear it's the absolute best salad ever!<br />And, my kids eat it as a snack straight up!
