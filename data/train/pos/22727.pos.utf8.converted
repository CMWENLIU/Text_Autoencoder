<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC4S">Clear Jel, 1 lb.</a>I made some apple pie filling and canned it for use this winter.  My filling remained clear, not cloudy and retained the correct consistency for a good pie filling.  I strongly recommend it over sure jel for canned pie fillings.
