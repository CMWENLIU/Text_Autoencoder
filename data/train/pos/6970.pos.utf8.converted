This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of.
