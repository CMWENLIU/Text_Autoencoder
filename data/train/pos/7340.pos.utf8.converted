Have been trying to track this stuff down ever since I purchased a few bottles in the "Gourmet" (usually nearly outdated overpriced old stuff) food section at Marshalls... I bought 2 bottles. After seeing it and tasting it at home, I searched in every store!  My brain finally turned on and I started searching the internet... but by then it was sold out (usually by July)......Alma Gourmet out of NYC is the best place to buy it and they only charge 9.00 flat rate shipping!........The olive oil is pieridot green, unfiltered and is just the most amazing stuff you will ever try.....buttery smooth with no sharp overbearing bite...some people say olive oil will have either a peppery side or a grassy side......this has neither...it is just very hard to explain...if you call Alma today you  can get the harvest from October 2010 but ya better hurry!!!!!!....If you buy more than one bottle put it in the fridge it will keep till next year.
