Great product.<br /><br />I'm a lousy cook.<br />So this product saved my diner. It's easy to prepare and delicious.<br />I followed the instructions and used some prime beef.<br />Everybody loved it! The coconut NUT and the coconut flavor seemed very fresh and rich. I do not like peanuts... but I could hardly feel it.<br /><br />Great if you want to have something different. So go for it!<br /><br />Suggestion: I like a thicker sauce. So it all depends on how you prepare it. And I like onions, so I put some in it too. Loved it.
