I've tried a few brands of Goji berries and these compare well to the more expensive ones.  I put them in my morning smoothie/shake and they blend up nicely and add a nice texture and taste.  Plus, they are not as hard and overdried as the first brand I tried.  My husband puts them on his oatmeal.  I will buy them again.
