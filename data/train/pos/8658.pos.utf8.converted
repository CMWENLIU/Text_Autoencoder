The regular list price of the 2x9oz Lobster Mac and Cheese, from the Hancock Lobster Co., is Amazons so called sale/discounted price for the same exact product ($33.95).  I find it very misleading for Amazon to make it appear that their price is discounted 43% from "list", when in reality it is the same as Hancocks regular list price.  In plain english, it does not appear that there is any savings offered by Amazon for this product and it is not actually discounted.  I suggest if you want to purchase this item you order the 40oz size instead of one 2x9oz.
