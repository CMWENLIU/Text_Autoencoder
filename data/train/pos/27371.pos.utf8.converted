I breastfeed probably 90%-95%. I bought this formula for the few occasions when I need to leave my baby and I don't have any pumped breastmilk. I was going to buy the Earth's best brand until I read the reviews and discovered that the DHA that is added to it (and all other formulas that have DHA) is extracted using a dangerous chemical called Hexane. Of course the manufacturer claims that all of it is evaporated, but why take a chance.
