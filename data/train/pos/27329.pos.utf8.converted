My wife has suffered with gastro-intestinal pain ever since we first met 16 yrs ago. Nnothing seemed to help except when she would drink some half and half to coat her stomach...that would seem to keep it at bay for a little while...I remembered a # of years ago I had a miniture schnauser whom had eated some chicken bones...he had blood in his stool and was acting sick...I couldn't get to a vet..it was a Sunday so I cut up some alo plants and scraped the juice into a saucer...I held the dog's head and poured the juice down his throat...In the morning, his symptoms were gone and ther was no longer any blood in his stool.....Since my wife had tried all kinds of over the counter remedies for her intestsinal ailment and none of them gave her relief, I told her that story..I have an alo plant...I did the same thing for her as I did for my pup..(except for holding her head and pouring it down her throat)....she did that on her own...beside the fact that it was dreadfully bitter, it gave her much needed releif...One day while shppping in a Big Lots I spotted some small 6-8oz bottles of a alo-pomagranite drink and thought I't get her some to try...They had about 15 bottles in stock @ $.75 per bottle so I bought all of them...The next episode of gastro-pain she had she took a few swallows and a short time later her pain subsided... and it didn't taste bad..in fact, it tasted good too!...Over a period of a few weeks she used it all up and Big Lots never had any more of the stuff...so I got on the internet and went to Amazon.com... There I found a number of companies that sold alo juice products...I now make sure my fridge is stocked...
