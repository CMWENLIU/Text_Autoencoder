I ordered this because I wanted some cinnamon without coumarin - anything else was a bonus. Well, this cinnamon is amazing. It's spicy, flavorful, aromatic... it's so far above the other stuff I can't imagine going back. In fact, I now use my other organic cinnamon on my doorstep to keep the ants out of the house. I'll only use this stuff for our food needs from now on. Shipping was flawless, too.
