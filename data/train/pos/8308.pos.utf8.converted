Sent this as a Mother's Day gift. The lady who received it thought it was wonderful. The 3 decorative oval boxes can be reused. They contain a variety of sweets & goodies that taste good and last a while. Although I had it "gift wrapped" by Amazon, you don't need to do that because the original gift packaging is already decoratively designed without the need for additional wrapping. All in all, a nice gift for a lady with a sweet tooth.<br /><br />A previous reviewer mentions a "watering can" which is NOT part of this gift; this food gift tower comes in 3 graduated size oval hatbox-style containers, not a watering can.
