This cereal is perfectly fine, although I prefer the Erewhon Brown Rice Cream Hot Cereal (organic).  I purchased it because the Erewhon cereal was not in stock, but now I will go back to my preferred rice cream cereal.  It is likely a matter of personal preference, although I enjoy the taste and texture of the Erewhon cereal versus Bob's Red Mill Rice Hot Cereal.  I would not discourage anyone from trying Bob's brand since it is likely a matter of personal preference.
