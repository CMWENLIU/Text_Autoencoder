Finding a cola made with real sugar in my area is quite the challenge. Anyone who thinks Coke made with High fructose corn syrup is the same as Coke made with sugar is kidding themselves. HFCS is a corn byproduct that is so refined and converted that even the food industry admits it isn't "natural".<br />I realize that soda isn't exactly a health food item, but I refuse to drink anything that has artificial ingredients such as HFCS or the poison known as "Splenda".<br />The Coca Cola conglomerate isn't doing US consumers any favors by selling their poison. It's a shame we have to purchase this product from Mexico.
