This is a fabulous, easy to use product that results in large, healthy flowers.  I tried the liquid form and was not nearly as pleased with it because it was much more work to walk around my large yard with the hose and that bulky spray device.  With the Shake and Feed, just sprinkle some around everything you want to feed and turn on the water.  Of course you must be careful not to over-fertilize plants that might be planted in an already fertilized soil.  That's just common sense.
