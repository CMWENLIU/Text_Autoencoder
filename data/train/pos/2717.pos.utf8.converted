I recently bought an espresso machine that had a basket for pods (be advised that you need to have a machine that has a special basket for ESE Pods - if you're not sure, you probably don't have one).  I thought I would give some a try and Pod Merchant seems to carry them all (I lived in Italy for several years and Pod Merchant has some Italian coffee brands that even I've never heard of).<br /><br />The sampler packs are a fun way to try different brands.  Some are better than others, but trying them out will keep you from later ordering 100 of something you don't like.<br /><br />The order was processed quickly and they were delivered no problem via UPS.  There were also a couple of "freebie" pods and a coupon as a thank you for the order which I thought was a nice touch.
