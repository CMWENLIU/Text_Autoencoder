The package directions state, "Marinate 2 cups cut mixed vegetables (like French beans, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes & green peas) with entire contents of Kitchens of India's Vegetable Biryani Paste & 2 1/2 tbsp Lemon curd.  Keep aside for 20 mins. Heat 2 tbsp clarified butter (Ghee) or butter - with entire contents of spice pack (provided along with the paste pack) for 2 mins.  Add marinated vegetables & 1cup water.  Simmer for 30 mins once it starts boiling under closed lid.  Cook for 5 more mins on high flame.  Prepare boiled rice separately, using 1 1/2 cups basmati rice, 2 1/2 cups water & 1/2 tsp salt.  Cook till rice absorbs all water.  Cover and keep aside for 25 mins.  Mix cooked gravy with rice & simmer under closed lit for 3-5 mins.  Serve Hot."  There are also microwave directions, but I've only used the "pan recipe."  Instead of lemon curd, I've substituted plain vanilla yogurt or half-n-half.<br /><br />I've prepared this dish with and without meat, although the package states it's for vegetable biryani.  My favorite mix of ingredients to use are vegetables from my freezer including: cubed broccoli stalks, carrots, peas, cauliflower, broccoli florets, and one fresh cut potato.<br /><br />This is a very easy and delicious meal to prepare, the package states 4 servings.  There are easily four large servings, and the leftovers reheat well.
