This is by far the best tasting green tea I've tried thus far.  I'm well aware of the benefits, but until now I haven't been drinking as much of green tea as I should have.  I've tried the pricey ones and the inexpensive ones before.  The jasmine adds so much aroma and flavor.  I purchased the Endless Journeys Sampler to try Numi.  This one is the most delicious tea within the sampler.  Yummy!
