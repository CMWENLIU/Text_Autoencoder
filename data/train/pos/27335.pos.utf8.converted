The Tastykake "Sugar Free Chocolate Cream Filled Cupcakes" are a very good tasting low carb snack. Each packet contains two cupcakes (1 serving) that has 140 Calories and a low 6 Net Carbs! The flavor is very good, with only the slightest aftertaste.<br /><br />These have only a minimal impact on my blood sugar levels (Type 2 diabetic) as they are sugar free, sweetened with Maltitol and Sucralose. Maltitol, in large doses, does cause some people "gastric distress" so you might want to avoid eating a lot of these until you know how it effects you.<br /><br />Overall, these are great teasting and filling snacks! Highly Recommended! You might also be interested in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023V5KHC">Tastykakes 2 box pack of Orange Finger Cakes SUGAR FREE</a>, which are my favorite!
