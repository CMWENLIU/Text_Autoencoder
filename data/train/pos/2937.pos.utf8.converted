I add this to my kids milk for added protein and calcium.  It clumps together so you have to mix it up in a blender, but it tastes great and is worth the price to avoid hormones in non-organic milk.  It is hard to find around here, and I'm glad Amazon carries it.  They offer it cheaper than special ordering it from the health food store.<br /><br />I add it to homemade icing and ice cream too!
