Vegan. Natural. Firm, refreshing chunks of tropical fruit packed in a light syrup with passion fruit juice, which is a treat in itself. Not overly sweet or thick or heavy. A great choice for enjoying the benefits of tropical fruit year-round. Made with yellow papaya, red papaya, pineapple, guava, sugar, & passion fruit juice. 210 calories per can. Product of Thailand. Highly recommended. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.
