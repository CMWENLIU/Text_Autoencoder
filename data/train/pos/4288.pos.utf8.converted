If you like your tea strong and black, similiar to fine, mild coffee, then this is the tea for you. This tea is not delicate or light in any way. It is bold and robust while at the same time having a pleasant, smooth taste. Yorkshire Tea is unique and wonderful. My day is not complete until I have had a cup or two. Needless to say, I buy it in bulk quantities. I find this GOLD version to be a "touch" more refined than the regular one.
