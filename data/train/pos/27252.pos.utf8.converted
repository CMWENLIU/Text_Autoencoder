To make a long boring story short I was obese and I am still losing some of the last stubbron weight. Being on a diet sucks you feel like your starving and can never have a treat. I saw these and bought them right away. It's a dieter's heaven delcious buttery cookies that are only 100 calories. And even my picky eater kids love these. They are so good and they don't derail my diet.
