I adopted my cat from a shelter about 9 years ago and fed him one of the better grocery store brands without incident. Suddenly, about 9 months ago, he developed an allergy to that food (or something) because his fur got dull and started falling out in clumps. I took him to the vet and ruled out anything healthwise -- the vet pointed to a food allergy. So I tried Natural Balance. Not only did my cat have a renewed interest in his food, slowly his fur began to return to normal. Now it's healthier than ever, the thickest, softest, silkiest fur you could ever want! Plus, he never spits up or gets hairballs. It's worth paying a premium to have such a healthy, content cat.
