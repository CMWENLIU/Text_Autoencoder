I just ordered another jar. I have been suffering form intense heartburn and reflux that no antacid or ppi would cure. I was having lung complications due to aspiration.I went through 4 different types of ppi and even to the hospital for burning so intense I felt like I was dying. This went on for months. Out of desperation I stumbled upon Manuka and since I have tried everything else I thought it was worth a shot. I stopped taking all my ppi's and antiacids and started with the honey. I just finish the jar and I am so relieved to say that w/in 4 days the burn was completely gone! I am going to another round. I read on another brand of Manuka honey's website that it is actually dangerous to consume this honey and in repeated tests in NZ and the UK that no clinical results to heal H pylori have been found. That testing has shown results for treating MRSA and other external infections. This news scares me a bit. It said the it could aid in precursors to cancer causing compounds found in the body so this will probably be the last jar I consume but I do not find it coincidental that it worked for me and many others. When I started using it in conjunction with chamomile tea in the morning the burning just completely dissipated. So my advice is to do your own research. The higher the MGO the higher the toxins in it.
