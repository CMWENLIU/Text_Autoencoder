I've developed a love of anything with pumpkin spice in it over the past couple of years, so when I saw this tea I had to try it.  First of all, I'm a fan of Bigelow teas.  They're always full of flavor and the individual foil packages keep the tea fresh for a very long time.  This tea has become one of my favorites.  It has a great pumpkin spice flavor and I found it's the best with a little milk and sugar.  It's good without adding anything, but adding milk and sugar (or whatever sweetener you may use) makes it taste almost like pumpkin pie.<br /><br />Many pumpkin-flavored beverages out there fall flat when it comes to the pumpkin spice flavor, but this tea nailed it.  I'm glad it comes in a pack of 6 boxes because I'm sure it's going to be hard to find once winter is over.
