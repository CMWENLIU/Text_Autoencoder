These (the Dark Chocolate flavor) are really delicious. I have no desire to ever eat an Oreo again - these are much better. The chocolate taste is fresh and full-flavored without that chemical taste that you find in supermarket cookies. My whole family loves these cookies, too. I get extra hugs from the kids when I pack a couple of these in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />I do think I should warn people that the box is not kidding about these being "intense and decadent." If you like intense dark chocolate in the cookie *and* the filling, there's an excellent chance you'll love these. But if you  prefer a milder milk chocolate flavor, you may wish to look elsewhere. But for a dark chocolate lover like me, these are really awesome.
