Nielsen-Massey organic extracts including orange, vanilla, almond, coffee... These of amazingly good quality. They are extremely concentrated and utterly delicious. I like to use them to flavour coffee.<br /><br />The almond extract is  a product to restore your faith in people.  It  is intoxicatingly delicious. It does not smell in the least artificial. It has a complex odour. It is a bit like Christmas past in a bottle. Nielsen-Massey set out to make the best extract on earth taking no shortcuts. It is potent. In fact, it is so strong, it is hard not to over do it. I found just moistening a finger and rubbing around the lip of cup of coffee is often too much. It should come with some sort of eye dropper for measuring out tiny amounts. I added it to the endorsements on my own personal web page I was so impressed. The orange extract is similarly magnificent and potent.
