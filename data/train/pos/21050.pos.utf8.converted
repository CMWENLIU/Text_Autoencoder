First of all, don't be put off by the price. If you've kept track of grocery store receipts lately or the sharp increase in basic foods over the last year, you may see how this product could save you time, gas and MONEY.<br />At the time of this writing, it cost about $16.88 for four packages of this mix. EACH package easily serves 8-16 people with soup left over.<br /><br />While the instructions note to add 4 cups of water or a water and broth combo, we quickly discovered we had to double or even triple the liquid added. No problem there, because we had more soup!<br /><br />If you don't have fresh veggies or spices around, this will suffice as is and it is thick and satisfying. If you garden, you'll improve the taste by adding fresh chopped parsley, garlic and whatever veggies you want. A can of tomatoes (or fresh, chopped ones) does no harm. This is a mix you can play with, add ingredients and spices.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: this is not a salted mix. It is full of split peas, barley, lentils, whole wheat pasta, dehydrated spinach, tomato, onion, etc. If you don't use salt, consider adding a salt substitute. I also added basil. It was delightful, quick and is now a pantry staple.<br /><br />Nutrition: 330 calories (1/2 cup) only 20 calories from fat. Significant source of iron at 22% of the Daily Value. Protein: 20 grams.
