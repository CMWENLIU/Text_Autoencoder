I never write reviews, that's how much I love this stuff.<br /><br />I don't sleep well. Usually, it takes me at least an hour to fall asleep and get up about 4-5 times in the middle of the night for no reason. And that's a good night. On bad nights I don't fall asleep at all, or it takes me hours to fall asleep and I still get up multiple times a night. Most of the time, however, I can tell when I'm going to have a bad night so, when I saw this in the store I thought it might be able to help (plus I like the normal version).<br /><br />I drink it and 30 min later I can barely keep my eyes open. I sleep the whole night through. Gives me crazy dreams though. Not bad, just weird and vivid.<br /><br />Oh and I took this with Tylenol once because I also had a headache and I woke up in the middle of the night really dizzy. I don't know if the mixture of this tea and the pain killer had anything to do with it, but I've never experienced that before and it only happened the one time I took it with medicine.<br /><br />Other than that, it tastes good, smells amazing, and knocks me out.<br /><br />p.s. Just bought the new vanilla flavor - not as potent but delicious!
