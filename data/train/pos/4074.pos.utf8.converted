I tried this product out of the blue because I live in Japan and am not able to `shop around`.  I basically hit gold on my first try.  The consistency of this pasta is suprisingly good, and really, it is NOT MUSHY.  Follow the instructions i.e cook for 16 minutes then rinse under the tap.  It comes out perfect every time.  It doesnt have a particular strong taste therefore kids wont be able to tell the difference, I couldn`t either.  For those who need to avoid wheat this is a perfect substitute.  This product comes in a pack of pack of 12, so please bear this in mind when you place your order.
