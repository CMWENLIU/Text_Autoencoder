This freeze dried raw food is incredibly good for your dog and your CAT!  Yup, my local store suggested it for my cats too as either a treat or meal.  I do make raw meat patties for the cats already (freeze and dethaw as needed) but this is a great way to work with that diet or simply supplement your pet's present diet.  Raw food is SO much better for dogs/cats.  Smaller, no stink stool, better behavior, better skin/coat, and generally this is what they used to eat before we decided dry or cooked/canned was better! Both my dogs and cats absolutely LOVE this product and honestly, the price is pretty good for the organic - real meat food you are getting for you animal. Another great thing - on this diet, they eat less as they are getting more of what their bodies need - so don't worry about cost as over a week you will notice a decrease in diet and an increase in satisfaction with less.  Both cats lost a bit of weight too (both slightly overweight)!
