We use this Worthington Vegetarian Burger for so many different meals. We make tacos, meatloaf, meatballs, sloppy joe and many other things that call for ground beef. The price on Amazon is an AWESOME deal for 12 cans. I hope they will continue to stock this item because from now on we'll be buying it online instead of the health food store. We also enjoy the Worthington Chili very much and will be purchasing it from Amazon next time. These products are an excellent substitute for meat. Can't say enough about them!
