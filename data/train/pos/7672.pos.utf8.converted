The reviews are mixed. So I have to say that you do get an odd, but favorable taste.  I can only tolerate 1 teaspoon in which I add to my coffee instead of sugar.  If you are a picky eater and can only tolerate things that are sweet and must fit perfect with your taste buds, then you will not like this.  But if you feel that you are a person who can tolerate taste and adjust, then go for it.  I actually look forward to adding to my coffee after two uses.
