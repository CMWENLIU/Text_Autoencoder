First off let me say that I have been eating vegetarian and soy made meals, burgers, and other concoctions for nearly half my life, from the really great tasting to the not so great tasting. So when I stumbled on this burger mix in my local bulk foods section I jumped on the chance to taste this stuff and am VERY happy I did.<br /><br />Making the burgers is very easy, just add the same amount of warm/hot water to burger mix, stir well, let sit for a while, then form into a patty and cook. Very simple and easy to make. What I like to do is make a bunch of the mix ahead and stick it in the fridge so you can enjoy one almost anytime you want.<br /><br />Now these burgers aren't meant to taste like a beef burger, I would say they are an alternative to the "real thing". They are well seasoned and have a great hearty texture to them. Throw them on a bun with some fixings and you have yourself a very health lunch, snack, or dinner.<br /><br />So in addition to my regular veggie burgers that I buy, this mix has become a staple in my health lifestyle and would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to meat or even some of those really untasty soy burgers that are out there (there are a few, I know because I ate them for years).<br /><br />PROS:<br />Easy to make.<br />Doesn't taste like beef or any of the frozen soy burgers out there, so if you don't like beef or any of those soy burgers give this stuff a try!<br />Can be made ahead of time and stuck in the fridge.<br />Very healthy, low sodium, yet tastes very well seasoned.<br />Other things can be added to the mix.<br />The mix can be added to regular hamburger to create really tasty meatloaf.<br /><br />CONS:<br />If not mixed with the correct amount of water patties tend to become extremely crumbly and fall apart.
