This is wonderful cocoa! It has a smooth and rich chocolate flavor. Beautiful dark, reddish brown color. It's the best (and the only cocoa I'll ever use)for coating chocolate truffles. It gives them a gorgeous velvet appearance and is nice when eaten, no bitter or dry feeling in the mouth. Also great to bake with. Makes great brownies, cakes and ice cream. Fantastic!
