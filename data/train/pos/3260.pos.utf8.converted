I have five totally indoor cats, which means that they have zero access to fresh greens.  One of them, aptly named Monster, will eat anything that looks remotely like a plant; green fabric, faux flowers, my floral purse.  Thus far we have tried approximately 5 other brands of cat grass and this one is the biggest hit.<br /><br />The cats all love this stuff, and we are also snipping bits off for our chinchilla and box turtle.<br />The packaging is nice and sturdy so the cats cant destroy it while munching.<br />Greens are thicker and healthier looking than most of the other brands we've tried.<br />Directions are easy to follow.<br />I like that its USDA certified and provides batch information for each bag, including contents, date tested, and type of wheat.<br />Unlike many other brands of pet greens that only target cats, this is marketed towards a variety of animals and includes suggested methods for feeding each.  I am the inventory mgr at a petstore and this allows us to reach more customers with the product!<br />The company, Bellrock Growers, supports animal rescue, adoption and shelter programs, which is an added bonus to an avid animal lover!<br />The only downside is that I have to hide the container while the grass is regrowing!  The cats will go to great lengths to find and munch on it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand of pet grass!
