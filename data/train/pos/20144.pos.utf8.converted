I've had MANY different types, including Godiva, belgian stuff, etc. and these are really the only ones that I like.  I don't know what it is, but these are AMAZING!  Just the right consistency, not too sugary, not too bitter, very rich, not quite like fudge, but not crumbly, either.  Great stuff!  You might want to check out Costco, who also carries this stuff.
