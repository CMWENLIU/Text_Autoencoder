We once randomly bought some of this in a grocery store, and then spent quite a while trying to find it again.  By a great stroke of luck we found it here at Amazon.<br /><br />What we like about it is that we can add lots of great curry flavor without adding too much fire.  We've observed that almost all other brands load up with cayenne pepper or some other inexpensive spice to make it seem that the curry is "strong" or "potent" at the expense of flavor.  If we want more fire we'll just buy cayenne.<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is different.  It gives you the freedom to dump in a bunch and then optionally tailor the fire to the tastebuds of you or your guests.
