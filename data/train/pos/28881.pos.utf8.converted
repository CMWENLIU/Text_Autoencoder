Wow, this is really great coffee.  I generally like strong brews from Diedrich, Peets and Starbucks (and Timothy for the KCup) and was kind of reluctant to try this one as many brands end up being too weak or bitter for me. The Camano Island Brazil Dark Roast is finely ground and makes a strong cup of coffee that isn't bitter at all.  Plus, its organic! I have added this to my subscribe and save and the price is unbelievable for the quality.  I enjoy it every bit as much as my usual brands, even more right now since its my new discovery.
