"It may drive your cat crazy. But if you use it, it will probably have just the opposite effect on you. Catnip is a calming, safe, and mild sedative." ~ pg. 36 of God's Healing Herbs by Dennis Ellingson<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has a few wellness teas for soothing your soul. Tension Tamer Extra has a lemony herbal flavor. Peppermint, cinnamon, lemongrass, lemon flavor, ginger root, licorice, vitamin C, B6, B12, Eleuthero, Chamomile, Tilia estrella, lemon verbena, catnip and roasted chicory make this earthy and lemony with calming power.<br /><br />Licorice is believed to have stress reducing properties and lemongrass makes this a lemony herb tea. Eleuthero, also known as "Siberian Ginseng" is a stress reliever but can also help improve concentration. This tea is not for children or for anyone with heart problems or high blood pressure.<br /><br />Tension Tamer Extra seems to have two effects, first it calms you down emotionally and then it wakes you up intellectually. This tea might be good to drink in the evening if you want to feel peaceful, but you are not quite ready to fall asleep. I find it clears my head and helps me to focus.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
