I've finished my first box of Ganocafe Mocha. It was delicious. Initially, since I had expected a different taste, I found it to be surprising. The blend of milk powders and sugars are just right. It's a smooth taste with the extra melding of the Reishi that enhances the flavor. I can't describe it. It was different enough to notice and pleasant enough to make me wish I had ordered another box before the first ran out. I've also purchased and experienced the taste of the Ganocafe Coffee, without the milk and sugar additives. You can make what you want of it. It has that specific flavor that makes it a special cup of coffee. About the benefits, Reishi is a known adaptogen herb that helps to bring balance to body functions. Reishi's balancing qualities offer support for both the body's immune and nervous systems. Herbalists use Reishi to support allergies, bronchitis, viral infections and hypertension, Its adaptogenic effect also extends to detoxification, mood and appetite, vigor, and mental alertness. There are no side effects-- it's all beneficial. I highly recommend the Ganocafe experience. Its one I think you'll enjoy and make a habit. BTW, there is no caffiene- something I thought I'd miss. I didn't. I guess the taste and results of the Reishi made up for it. Again, it's absolutely DELICIOUS, and given the costs of special coffees, it's one you can enjoy at home at an affordable price.
