I had been buying whole fancy cashews for a bit more money. My kids love them and they disappear at an alarming rate. I got to thinking; do the whole cashews taste any different? No they do not.<br /><br />So... If they are just going to be eaten anyway, why not save the extra cost?<br /><br />So now I get the larger and less expensive can of halves and pieces, and guess what?<br />No one is complaining!
