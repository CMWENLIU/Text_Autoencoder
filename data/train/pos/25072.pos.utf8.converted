These organic cookies are absolutely delicious! The chocolate tastes rich and not overly sweet, and this is balanced nicely by the vanilla half. The nutrition facts and ingredient list are the icing on the cake - so much better for you than Oreos and just as good (if not better) tasting. They may be more expensive than Oreos but it is well worth it. Highly recommended.
