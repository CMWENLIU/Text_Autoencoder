These are great!  I ordered them for my son, who is allergic to wheat, food colorings, dairy, (and a long list of other things) in order to replace regular laces being used at his school for a special snack.  I was only hoping for something passable, but these are really good.  I hesitated though, because the ingredients weren't on the listing.  Amazon, people with allergies need to read the ingredient lists before ordering!<br />(from the package)"Ingredients:organic corn syrup, organic rice flour, organic rice starch, organic concentrated fruit juice: strawberry (3%), apple, elderberry, organic flavour: strawberry.  Store cool and dry.  This product is made with gluten free ingredients and equipment is thoroughly cleaned to avoid cross-contamination."
