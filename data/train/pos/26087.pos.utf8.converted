I tried the Argan oil after watching a documentary on TV. I originally ordered it 1) by curiosity (I wanted to see what the hype was about) and 2) because of it's alleged health properties.<br />I was amazed by the taste. I will never revert back to olive oil, EVER! The  antioxidant virtues are really an added bonus for me, my salads have become amazing and very special. I love the nutty flavor!<br />I also ordered the raw version for my skin and hair, and its equally as amazing. My skin has recovered its elasticity and radiance.
