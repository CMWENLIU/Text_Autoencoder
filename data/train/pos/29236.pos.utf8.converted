My wife & I try to eat healthy chip snacks but most of them are relatively expensive.  We switched over to making our own popcorn for an economical alternative... and this particular brand is top notch.  Pops super even and very little burned even if cooked well done, even if large amounts cooked at once.  We cook ours in a 3 gallon stainless All-Clad pan over gas heat and it's always wonderful.  Weve been through several bags so far and yet to have an issue.  We use sunflower seed oil, and as it just starts to pop we add tblsp butter & tblsp ghee... shake and pop a bit... bout half popped salt a little... when done wipe the condensation from inside the lid, salt a little, cover & let cool, fill up 2 gallon ziplock & start over.  Perfect cheap snack<br /><br />GREAT STUFF!!
