I have trouble getting out to purchase fresh fruit- and then it usually goes bad before i can finish it. so this is the answer to both problems. i can have fruit around that lasts for at least a year. there's no added sugar. delivered for free. keep them in the fridge so they're nice and cold. they are very good. if you can get them for less than $1.25 a can with the free s/h_ it's a fantastic bargain as well. I think i paid $12ish. a couple cans had small dents but they were in manufacturer shrink wrap boxes- so it's not amazon's fault- and they weren't that bad and didn't effect ability to open can or its contents. i would recommend- i got on the auto delivery subscription service for this and the peaches i liked them so much.
