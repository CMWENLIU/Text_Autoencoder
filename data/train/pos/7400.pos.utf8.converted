My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty. I agree it is very sweet. I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast. My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich. It's good, especially for chocolate lovers.<br /><br />________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  This listing is for the 3-pack.  I actually think it's better to buy smaller jars in larger quantities, because the Nutella tends to dry out if used up too slowly.  The listing doesn't state how large the jars are and they do come in various sizes.  Three small jars is better than one large jar.
