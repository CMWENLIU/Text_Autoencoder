These vegetarian "hot dogs" are really good. They have the right texture, which most tofu dogs and the like don't have at all. The seasoning is very good too. They stay firm boiled or grilled, although you cook them less than a product containing meat. They only have 50 calories each, and 3 grams of fat, only 0.5 grams of that is saturated. They have 0 cholesterol and 0 trans fats. They only have 180 mg of sodium. If you're doing Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat to Live" and you're just going nuts for some meat, try grilling one of these babies and slap it on a whole wheat pita bread. It will kill those cravings and keep you from doing something you'll regret.
