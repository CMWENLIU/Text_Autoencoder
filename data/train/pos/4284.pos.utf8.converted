How stupid can we be, buying water, when it come free right out of your tap. That is, until you research the origin of Fluoride and realize, what on earth is it doing in our drinking water.  Until you research what it means to try and shift your body into a more stabalized alkalized state, until you research what all this nonesense concerning alkalinity and acidity and what it means to us. This water is 9.5 alkalized and that's pretty awsome, it's also revearsed osmosis which is the only way to remove fluoride and it is infused with "proper" electrolytes that we desperately need.  Water is supposed to be 7.0 completley neutral, and it's generally understood that below 7.0 resides acidity.  I used to drink Smart Water, which is also reverse osmosis, but upon research I found that the Smart water was a staggering 4.5, NOT EVEN NEUTRAL.  Obviously they did something wrong, so when you consider buying water, please do some research so you will never think that your getting ripped off buying something that you think you can get for free!
