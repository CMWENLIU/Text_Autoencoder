Excellent for pantry storage of 54 K-Cups, I have a Platinum from Costco (came with 60 free K-Cups all for $149) So added a 36 single tray From Bed Bath And Beyond with 20% off coupon placed under the machine for all decaf, and a 30 carosel for variety party selections. Favorites are Half and Half Decaf, Tully's Decaf Home Blend and Tullies French Roast Decaf. Highly recommend all.
