I've been battling against squirrels and racoons for the past 5 years.  They come up on my back deck and rip out any potted plants, knock things over, and kindly poop.  I bought some 1/2 in pvc piping and cut them to three foot sections, attached them to my deck with plastic zip ties, drilled small holes through the tops where I fed through some 16 gauge wire.  Once i connected to the Fi-Shock SS-725CS, the critters stopped coming up.  To tell the truth, the first day i hooked it up, i found two dead squirrels.  the next day, one dead squirrel and one chipmunk.  I'm guessing that this Energizer is really designed with larger pests (racoons, deer, dogs) in mind.  Have-A-Heart(attack?).  Great product.  Thanks.
