CRACKER COOKIE BISCUIT BLISS<br />I'd call these tiny snacks cookies rather than crackers, based on sheer yumminess, but they aren't especially sweet, and I suppose if they want to call them crackers, that is their prerogative.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />Kudos for putting them in a bag rather than in a bag inside an unnecessary box as is usual for products in this segment.<br /><br />TASTE & TEXTURE<br />The taste is appropriately peanutty, somewhat salty and slightly sweet. It brought back childhood memories of Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch Cereal. The texture is somewhat similar to shortbread -- crumbly with the slightest hint of (pleasant) buttery oiliness, which I imagine is coming from peanut ingredients and not from dairy butter (since it doesn't contain butter).<br /><br />INGREDIENTS & HEALTH CLAIMS<br />The ingredients are all pronounceable and recognizable as food. Things you may actually have in your home. Phenomenal. They don't really make any health claims, sticking with 'all natural' and 'no additives', neither of which I would disagree with on the basis of the extremely short ingredient list. Calorically you could do much worse in the prepackaged snack cookie/cracker segment, but this is still a snack food.<br /><br />RECIPE POSSIBILITIES<br />I can see creative cooks using these treats in all sorts of interesting ways -- as a pie crust, in lieu of graham crackers perhaps? As part of a trail mix or dessert bar? If you have used these treats in your cooking I'd love to hear about it in the comments section. :)<br /><br />IT'S FOR YOU IF...<br />- You love peanuts/peanut butter<br />- You prefer products with ingredients you don't need to look up on wikipedia<br />- You like some salty with your sweet (or sweet with your salty)<br /><br />THINK TWICE IF...<br />- You have a peanut allergy (sorry, I know sort of obvious)<br />- You are expecting tiny, soft, peanut butter cookies<br />- You honestly think you can stop eating after 27 very tiny crackers (1 serving)
