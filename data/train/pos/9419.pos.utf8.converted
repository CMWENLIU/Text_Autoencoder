I'm not a gourmet chef so I don't know all the terminology I would need to make this a veritable critique, but as someone who is yet to poison her family with a badly-cooked meal, I can only say this is one of those things you just have to try before you kick the bucket.<br /><br />I first tried Huitlachoche(or Cuitlacoche) some 6 years ago when a very dear friend -who is actually a chef- introduced me to this Mexican delicacy. I was amazed at the silky texture and incredible taste of this deceivingly unattractive corn truffle! I was hooked-- but like most great things in life, it would be a long time until I came across Huitlachoce again.<br /><br />Sadly, Huitlacoche is hard to find in grocery stores in South Florida, but since you can find everything short of a genuine alien on Amazon, I've been able to purchase a couple of cans.  Yes, I know; nothing beats fresh Huitlacoche. But honestly, finding fresh corn smut is going to be difficult under any circumstances.<br />So deal with it.<br /><br />Although Huitlacoche is actually good even from the can, I usually sautee finely chopped onions, garlic, cilantro and a slice or two of Jalapenos and add a dry white wine to the mix.  I then mix in the Huitlacoche and cook over slow heat for about 20 minutes.  You can have Huitlacoche with just about anything-- I served it with Parmesan Risotto and roasted lamb and got rave reviews. Mainly from my stomach- but then again, when it comes to cooking, that's our target audience.<br /><br />Enjoy!
