A little expensive, but so worth it. Makes great cookies. I would save this to use for baked goods where you can appreciate the flavor more and cut back on the sugar high. I think the flavor is somewhat lost in spicy Thai or Asian dishes. I did not get this from Amazon since they have been out of stock for quite awhile.
