I bought this because I enjoy a light roast coffee in the morning + it was on sale for $15.35. I wish I had bought more for that price. This is one of the best light roast coffee's I've ever had. I read a few reviews of this on [...], which gave very high marks, now I can see why.<br /><br />Wow, what a great cup of coffee. Try it if you like any of the breakfast blends available out there. If your a light roast lover like I am, you will love this single origin coffee.
