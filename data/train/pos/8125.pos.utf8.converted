<span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>I bought these because they are low calorie, so I can stuff a bunch into Poodle's treat puzzles without feeling guilty. He LOVES the cheese flavor (the only one I have tried so far). He stays quiet when being groomed if given liberal amounts of them.  Great amount in the bag for the price too. According to their page on FaceBook, they are only 3 calories per treat. In the video you can see Poodle getting treats out of a bottle, it is a mix of kibble, some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQK3QW">Costless Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets, 32-Ounce</a> and Charlee Bear Cheese and Egg treats. You can see that the treats fit whole into the opening of the bottle, so they are not all that big. This is a fun way to get him some mental exercise and I watch him so he doesn't chew up the bottle.
