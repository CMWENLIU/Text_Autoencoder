WARNING: If you drink this, you will never ever want to drink anything else again.<br /><br />I never write reviews. Especially for food, let alone a beverage.<br /><br />I happened upon this beverage by accident. My boyfriend and I love Perrier and we discovered this flavor during an out of state trip to see his parents. It was so good we searched across the internet to try to ship it to our home state, but without luck. Turns out we couldn't find it b/c we were searching "pamplemousse rose" the original labeling. My genius boyfriend decided to search for grapefruit :-) and he surprised me with a huge case.<br /><br />I know this sounds silly but I haven't even had Perrier since we discovered this flavor. It beats all of them and totally agree, you will never want soda after this.
