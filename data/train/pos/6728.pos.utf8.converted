Have used these in two recipes since receiving them a few days ago.  They were delicious in both recipes.<br /><br />For the first meal, I used ground turkey to make turkey burgers.  In a mixing bowl, I combined the crumbs with one egg, chopped red and green bell pepper, chopped Vidalia onion, garlic powder, oregano, and salt.  Mixed it all into my ground turkey and made burger patties, then sauteed them in olive oil on the stovetop.  They developed a beautiful brown crust, and were moist and delicious.  I have to say that they were even better than the way I normally make them.<br /><br />My second time using them was last night, I made baked haddock.  On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, I laid out 2 lbs. of boneless, skinless haddock.  In a small bowl, I mixed crumbs, garlic powder, and oregano.  I had also ordered some Schar GF table crackers that arrived all broken, so I smashed a couple of those up into fine crumbs and mixed them in too.  I sprayed the fish with Pam olive oil spray, topped each piece with the crumb mixure, sprayed the top with a little more Pam, and baked them for 40 minutes at 350.  They were excellent.  I couldn't even tell the difference between these and the crumbs that aren't GF... in fact, maybe these were even better.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, and I will keep a lot of them on hand to use in any dish requiring bread crumbs.  You should be aware that they do contain soy, in case anyone is allergic or sensitive to it.  (The crackers do not contain soy, so if you're sensitive to it, buy those instead and smash them up.  They are a tasty alternative.)
