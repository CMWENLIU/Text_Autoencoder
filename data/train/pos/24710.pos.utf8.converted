Our two Standard Poodles have been on Purina One Rice and Lamb since we got them.  We have had our male for 4 years and our female for over 8 years.  We also had our last two Standard Poodles on Rice and Lamb for even longer.  We originally put them on because we had studied all of the available foods and decided this was the best for their health and well being.  A fantastic thing about the food is that it really reduces the volume of their feces to about 50% of other dry dog foods.  We had both of our old poodles with us when we went full time in our RV for a little over two (2) years; reduced output was a real bonus when scooping all the time.  Overall all four of our dogs were health and happy while on this food and had no problems with their skin or coats.  A recent change was a new formula with the "Smartblend" which seems to have made our dogs eat the food even better.  Both my wife and I believe that this food has helped to make our dogs healthier with the bonus of being easy to find as we travel.  I can highly recommend this food.  If you switch to it, remember to gradually introduce it while reducing the old food.  Feeding all dry is the best way to help prevent dental problems also.
