I am not sure if they have changed their product since the other reviews were written (Back in 2009) or if I enjoy different things. At any rate I enjoy these pears I have ordered them at least half a dozen times and have always been pleased with my purchase. Wanted to let others know that it is worth your time to give them a try and for the price of fresh fruit this is a real bargain.
