I'm not sure why Schweppes is no longer distributing in the United States to grocery stores, but Fever-Tree makes a viable alternative.  The product is comparable.  Not better, not worse.  The taste is very good.  I would say the main difference is that Fever-Tree's bitter lemon does not have lemon sediment swirling around the bottom of the bottle.  I didn't miss it.  This product is expensive but considering the quality and availability, I will be buying more.<br /><br />One more thing... the packaging was excellent.  24 bottles come in packages of four.  The lot is shrink wrapped and tightly packed in a cardboard box surrounded with styrofoam on all six sides.  The bottles arrived in perfect condition.
