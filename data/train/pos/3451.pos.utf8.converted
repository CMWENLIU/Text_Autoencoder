Having grown up in England, I have continued to search for a good supply of Salad Cream since arriving in the US 9 years ago. It has been hit and miss and despite my desire for this product, I won't pay over the top prices and costly shipping..  So it was wonderful to find it being listed on Amazon at such a good price and free shipping.<br /><br />It is hard to describe the product to anyone who has never tasted it. I eat a lot of sandwiches and prefer to have some dressing that stops it from being to dry.. but I do not want the dressing to take away from the flavour of the filling like most of the US mayonnaises seem to do. Salad cream does not do that for me.
