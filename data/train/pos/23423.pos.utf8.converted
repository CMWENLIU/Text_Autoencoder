I have never purchased 30 dollar coffee before so this was kind of splurge for me and I usually drink coffee that comes in 12 ounce bags at about a 5 to 7 dollar range so I wondered how much difference could it really be in quality.  I was looking for some good holiday food and I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and try it out and to my surprise I really enjoyed it and believe me I was expecting quite a bit for 30 dollar coffee.  The 1st thing I noticed was the aroma when I 1st broke into the package and it wasn't the normal aroma I was used to when breaking into new coffee for the 1st time.  The aroma was so much better and it was so much different and pleasing in smell that I knew it was going to be a great cup of coffee.  With anticipation I ground up the beans and made my 1st pot and actually just finished it before this was wrote.  I took my time drinking this coffee and I must say I have drank a lot of coffee in my time and thought I wouldn't be able to tell a difference but I found myself looking forward to my next cup.  The taste was so fantastic and full of flavor that I really didn't expect it so I was really surprised by that.  It was that good instead of with my normal coffee its usually just routine to drink it up even though its good its just not as good as this.  If you are looking for some delicious coffee do yourself a favor pick this one up. If you are like me you might splurge every once in a while on food and even if you do it once you will find yourself missing this bag when its gone b/c I know I will.  I still have about a whole package remaining and I think I will have to break down again later to get another.  Though it is rather expensive I am very happy with this coffee.
