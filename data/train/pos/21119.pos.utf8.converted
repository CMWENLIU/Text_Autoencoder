My cat Hudson is not the most particular cat in the world.  Weighing in at 19 pounds (which is normal for his breed, a Ragdoll), he's no stranger to food and isn't very finicky.  I don't know what is in these treats, but he just goes crazy for these things, much more so than his other treats.  (I wonder if there's cat nip in these, must go check the label!).<br /><br />Only regret is that they were originally $2.99 on Amazon and have steadily increased in price.<br /><br />Hudson highly recommends these, just don't buy so many that Amazon runs out and poor Hudson has to find something else to eat!
