I choose this product, as the best food for my dogs because it is grain free, potato free, and "additive" free. It does not contain "natural flavor" which always contains free glutamic acid, by process. Free glutamic acid is MSG, an exitoory neurotoxin. What it does contain is a healthy balanced blend of optimal, whole food nutrition. Great life is great stuff!
