My just turned 4 year old daughter will NOT, I repeat NOT, eat fruit of any kind.  The last time she ate fruit was baby food.  No joke.  She has food aversions, texture issues, temperature issues, pickiness issues, and has been in feeding therapy for 1.5 years.  She won't drink water unless it's purified (she can tell the difference). I mean this is serious stuff.<br /><br />I bought one of The Yellow Ones and gave it to her, explained that it was baby food consistency but wasn't baby food, and was fruit (didn't lie to her) but wasn't a cold smoothie like the kind Mommy makes (which she does NOT like).<br /><br />She slurped the whole thing down!  Tears came to my eyes I was so shocked and excited.  This whole feeding drama is very trying on my patience and I worry so often that she will have long-term problems.<br /><br />She has been devouring them ever since!  Then she tried these, The Red One.  She likes these just as much!!  I cannot believe that she is "eating" fruit!!!  I am forever a loyal buyer of Ella's Kitchen products.  When my son is ready for solids, I will feed him Ella's baby food.  I cannot tell you how thankful and happy I am to finally get fruit in my daughter's belly!
