It works as well as agar in bar form and the price is good. I do however recommend you use half the recommended amount, so more like 1 tablespoon to 1 pint of liquid versus 2 tablespoons, but you might have to experiment and it will depend on the liquid. But 2 tablespoons I find will make it too stiff.
