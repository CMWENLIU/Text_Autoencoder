This is one of the highest protein canned cat food out there as I found out through a recent web search.  My kittens love it, and it is a great price-comparable to Wal-Mart or other discount stores when you do the Subscribe and Save.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this product, along with the price and the fact that it is delivered right to my door!
