As a college student who lives in the dormitory, I often get bored of the food that school provides. They always have same menus and it does not taste good. Also, as a Korean student, hamburgers, pasta, and bread are too greasy and cheesy for me. Thus, when I do not feel like going down to the school cafeteria or want to eat Korean food, I cook Shin ramen. It is not cheesy or greasy like burgers, and eating Shin ramen makes me feel I am home.<br />On the front wrap of the ramen, it has picture of cooked Shin ramen with Red coloring which indicates it is hot and spicy. On the back of the wrap, it has recipe, ingredients, expiration date, and etc. By just looking at the wrap, my mouth gets watery and I get hungry. I can imagine the taste and its spiciness while I am writing this review.<br />For those people who are not good at cooking foods, you do not have to worry. Cooking this ramen is very simple and it can be cooked in less than five minutes. Basic way to cook this ramen is to follow the direction on the back of the wrapper. First, boil the water and put noodle and two packs of seasonings. Anybody can cook this. If this direction is still hard for you, you can get Shin ramen cup-noodle. You just need to pour boiling water in to the cup.<br />Other than simple recipe, there are many different ways to cook this ramen. The spiciness of the ramen can be controlled by putting how much seasoning is put. Also, adding different ingredients, such as mushrooms, hot peppers, meats, or eggs can make the soup taste much better. My recommendation is putting all the seasoning and adding Kimchi to make the ramen spicier. For those people who are not so good at eating spicy food, I recommend putting raw egg to make the soup less spicy.<br />Also, I recommend try eating Shin ramen raw. Crack the noodles before you open the wrapper. Open up the wrapper, do not put the vegetable seasoning, but put spicy seasoning. After, you shake them up together and make spicy ramen chip. Instead of eating as a meal, you can enjoy it as a snack while you watch movie or TV.<br /> As a ramen lover, I have tried many different ramen from different countries. After I have tasted most of the ramen, I made a conclusion that Shin ramen shows superior quantity and quality from the other types of ramen. Compared to the most common ramen in the United States, the Maruchan ramen, Shin ramen has more filling and spicy. Other than its better quantity, its quality is also superior. Shin ramen has two seasonings, which includes dried vegetable seasonings and spicy seasonings. However, Maruchan ramen do not have vegetable seasoning.<br />Although it shows superior quantity and quality from Maruchan ramen, it is quite expensive compared to Maruchan ramen. It is fifteen dollars per pack of 20 ramen, when Maruchan ramen is fifteen dollars per pack of thirty six ramen. Although the price is higher than Maruchan, I strongly recommend Shin ramen for those who want spicy hot soup with better filling.
