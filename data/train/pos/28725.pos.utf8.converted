I love dates.<br /><br />That will no doubt color my review, but meh.<br /><br />These are wonderful dates.  In five bags (one shipment) I found two pits.  Too many?  Okay, maybe, but not bad.<br /><br />Add to that, these are natural.  No sugar.  No pecans inserted.  No added anything.  Sweet without sweeteners.<br /><br />I munch eight, maybe ten at a time.  I savor them, drink some coffee with them, luxuriate with them.  Some hours later, I am regular.  I will say no more.<br /><br />They are well worth the relatively meager expense.
