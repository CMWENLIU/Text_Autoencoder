For several years I could never understand why I could not get my mother's and grandmothers's old recipes to come out tasting the same way I remembered them to taste while growing up.  I said something to my mom one day and she asked what type of vanilla I was using and smiled when I told her it was just the basic stuff you get at the grocery store.  She told me to get some Watkins original vanilla extract and see if that helps.  Well, that was all it took!  I couldn't believe the difference and will never use any other vanilla again.
