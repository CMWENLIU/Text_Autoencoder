How can I forget (with pennies in my pocket) I used to wait for the schoolbus every morning by the liquor store on the corner and would always made my way in and out with a little pack of these cinnamon toothpicks along the ride to school in the valley. Man oh man, it took me back in time the very moment I start tasting these sweet cinnamon spiced pick! Never thought it lived to this day.
