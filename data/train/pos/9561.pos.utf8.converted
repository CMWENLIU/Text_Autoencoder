Butter beans look like lima beans, but are sweeter and avoid the slime factor of canned limas. These beans are the best I have ever found--they are firm and well-cleaned, ready for use. I have an old Shaker recipe for a butter-bean-potato salad: I use a can of these beans, some boiled and diced red potatoes, and the corn cut from a fresh ear of corn. The dressing is mayonnaise, a little olive oil, and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Eden makes it possible to do this recipe at any time with these hard-to-find beans. They're great!
