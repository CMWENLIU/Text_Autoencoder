EDIT: I edited my original review today because the contents in the assortment have changed. I just got a new box and inside there were:<br />13 - Frosted Flakes<br />10 - Apple Jacks<br />9 - Cocoa Krispies<br />8 - Froot Loops<br />8 - Raisin Bran Crunch<br />6 - Corn Pops<br />6 - Frosted Mini Wheats<br /><br />I don't know why they don't make the distribution of each type more equal (8 or 9), but they don't. I imagine some must be cheaper to make or something. Still, at least the ones with the most (Frosted Flakes and Apple Jacks) aren't my family's least liked ones and it is a little more evenly distributed than it used to be. We used to always have leftover Raisin Bran Crunch and with each new shipment, the backlog of those got bigger and bigger. At least the upped the Cocoa Krispies allotment!<br /><br />Warning: boring review follows! ha ha: I was interested in buying these individual servings of cereal for my family and wondered if the cups, bowls or little boxes were cheapest per ounce.  The cups hold more than the bowls and boxes(usually about twice as much based on cereal type). I mean we would have eaten 2 bowls if it was really cheaper that way.<br /><br />I went to the kelloggs site to compare how much cereal was in the cups versus how much in the individual bowls or the little boxes.  The bowls, cups and boxes all seem to end up costing fractions of pennies of one another ounce per ounce.  I didn't add up all the kinds per variey pack and see which grand total costed pennies more or less based on ounce (I am not THAT frugal), but picked corn pops and frosted flakes to compare.  The prices for all the kinds are very comparable, so if your wondering which type to buy, it doesn't really add up to much difference. I do check these things because sometimes the big "value" sizes are actually more expensive per ounce/gram than the little sizes.  Those marketing people are tricky!<br /><br />Therefore, if you want to have more little bowls or you pick the cups (that have more in each), you can make your choice and know you won't be spending way more either way.  I skipped choosing the boxes because I liked the convenience of the bowls, but honestly the carboard boxes are probably better for the planet (but anyway, I will save some energy, water, and soap by not washing bowls!)  Now all they need to do is sell a cute little dispenser for my counter and I will never go back to boxes!
