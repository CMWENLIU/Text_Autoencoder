i enjoy my sweets, and the haribo gummi gold bears are no exception.  while many gummy bears are much too sweet and taste incredibly artificial, haribo gummi gold bears are the perfect little dessert or snack at any point during the day, as they are light, and they taste more natural than other gummy bears.
