As a health nut and vegan, I wanted something that would provide a good source of nutrition and an array of health benefits. Just then, I stumbled upon maca powder and after much research, I decided to go with Navitas Naturals. I must say, I am now obsessed with this stuff; I can finish an entire bag in one week. However, I will admit when I first tasted maca powder, I was not too fond of the flavor. After trying many suggestions such as mixing it with coffee, I discovered that the best way, and most delicious way is to drink it with soy or some alternative milk. I personally love it mixed with soy milk and a hint of cinnamon powder :D. I have noticed an increase in my energy that lasts throughout the day... this is very important to me as a college student who deals with daily stress and tries to eat as best and healthy as I can while living in a new environment. So, to the people who are curious and interested in trying Navitas Naturals Maca Powder, I hope this review helps!
