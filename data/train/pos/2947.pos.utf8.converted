I read all the reviews before receiving the product, and that was my mistake.  There are just far too many fussy people apparently writing reviews.  I was worried--will it create a dust storm in my kitchen?  Is there some unique method of mixing this like no earlier powdered milk I have ever mixed? And so on.<br /><br />Here's the skinny--take good water, pour in blender, plop in the powedered milk, blend for 2 seconds and enjoy!
