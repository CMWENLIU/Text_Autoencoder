I hesitated to order this avocado oil because I had never heard of this brand before and didn't want to end up with two bottles of bad oil. Well, I am SO GLAD I went ahead and placed the order because this oil is simply excellent.<br /><br />I have tried extra virgin avocado oils from California and New Zealand and this Mexican oil is every bit as good and at a much better price.<br /><br />The oil is clear and has a buttery feel and subtle flavor. I use it mostly for stir-fry because of its very high smoke point (higher than refined coconut, grapeseed, peanut, almond, safflower), but it is also perfect in dishes where the peppery fruitiness of olive oil may be too overpowering.<br /><br />Amazon offers a very good deal on this oil. I just placed two more orders.<br /><br />Great product. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A word about the seller (Kalamala): I have already submitted a 5-star feedback for this seller, but I wanted to let prospective buyers know that the two 1 liter glass bottles arrived in perfect condition. Kalamala carefully wraps each bottle in bubble wrap and adds packing peanuts to the box for extra protection. See the photos I posted.
