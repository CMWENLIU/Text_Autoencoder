I found these at the grocery store, and used one box to make "shortcakes" in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZZGN2">Fat Daddio's 6-Cup Muffin Top/Crown Pan</a> for berry shortcake.<br /><br />They don't rise as much as wheat cake mixes will, but the texture was good, the flavor was very tasty - not packaged at all.  They made an excellent base for shortcakes, and also for scary big ice cream sandwiches.  Oh my.<br /><br />Yes, the ingredients are not listed here on Amazon, and they aren't on the Betty Crocker site either (last I checked), but they do clearly state that the facility is dedicated gluten-free.  Giving a one star review for this lack of info is just tacky, and ultimately very unhelpful to the rest of us.
