This is a MIRACLE tea!<br /><br />I'm a 24 year old, otherwise healthy & fit woman who has always suffered from severe menstrual cramps. Every month, I used to take LOADS of ibuprofen and pamprin for 3-4 days at a time so that I could function and go to work. I saw this in a health foods store and tried it, because I was desperate and it's cheap! I thought the benefits would be as a placebo, or the psychological comfort of drinking something warm when you're in pain. I was mistaken. I feel it actually does a great job of preparing my uturus for "that time" and keeping it relaxed and efficient when the time comes---meaning a lot of effective, natural pain relief.<br /><br />How I use it: I start drinking 2-3 cups of tea per day beginning 3-5 days before my period starts, and then even more if I start cramping. The first day or two of my period, I might have 5-6 cups of tea. This tea TASTES GREAT (not medicine-like at all) and you really can't overdo it. I've been able to wean myself off the ibuprofen to where I'm not taking more than the labeled ibuprofen dosage (about 1/4 of what I was using before). I don't suffer from prementrual symptoms (just agony during menstruation) but I have girlfriends who do and they swear this stuff works for that as well. Amazon has the best price anywhere. Do yourself a favor and try this at least once. If you're a MAN reading this (I know, what are the odds): buy it for your significant other! She'll thank you for life (or until menopause)!
