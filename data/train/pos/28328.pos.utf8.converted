I have been a long time fan of polenta and have used other "instant" products.  The Gia Russa product ranks up with the best that I have tried.  It is very easy and quick to prepare and the flavor and texture compare very favorably with polenta that is prepared the long and labor intensive traditional method.  I will buy it again.
