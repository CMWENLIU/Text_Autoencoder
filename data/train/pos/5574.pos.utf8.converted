My wife and I prefer them just a bit stale - leave them open for a day or so to get just the right amount of chew.  If you don't, they're very, very crisp (but still very good).  Snappy, even.  :)<br /><br />I'll also agree with the comment that they can be inconsistent from one bag to the next, but even when they're off, they're pretty good.<br /><br />As far as flavor goes, one person's spicy is another person's bland.  For my family, they're just the right amount of hot after a few cookies.
