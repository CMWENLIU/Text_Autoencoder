I bought this to try and induce my labor. I drank a few glasses 5 days before I was due to give birth. I started drinking the tea around noon and I had my baby that same night. I was however taken by surprise. Contractions came out of nowhere around 7:30pm.... and they were a million times more painful than anything I felt with my first labor. I didn't want to wait around to time them since they were so painful, we left for the hospital at 8:05 pm, arrived there at 8:30 and she was born at 8:45pm. I didn't even have time for pain medicine or an IV... so a little scary... and I felt things I'd rather not ever feel again...but the tea seems to have done the job :)
