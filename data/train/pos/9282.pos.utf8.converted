When I read one of the reviews that stated that this supplement changed their life, I was immediately excited because this supplement has changed my life as well!  I started taking this supplement as a part of my diet plan (Ideal Protein).  I took it to help me with bowel movements.  Lucky for me, not only did it improve my bowel movements, it fixed my insomnia problem.  I had insomnia and could not fall into deep sleep for years.  Within 2 weeks of taking this supplement, I was sleeping like a new born baby!  In addition, I became more relaxed and my anxiety completely disappeared!!  It did not stop there...my menstrual cycle is regular now and I no longer have muscle twitches.  TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE!<br /><br />I was soo excited about the improvement in the quality of my life, so I quickly spread the news to all my family and friends.  I worked like wonders for all of my family members.  The results from my friends was a mixed bag.  I think that for the people that have a true magnesium deficiency, this is a miracle supplement.  For those that may not have a true magnesium deficiency, this may not be the magic bullet for them.  I hope that this review was helpful.  I was compelled to spread the word about this supplement because it has truly changed my life!!!
