It's always hard to know how good food items will be over the internet, but these pistachios were outstanding.  They were nicely salted, but not overly done, and they were roasted perfectly.  The color was nice and green in almost every case, and there were very few inedible ones.  These are about as high quality as any other type I've had.  I highly recommend them.
