This honey was suggested for my young son's warts.  He had eczema as a baby and rapidly spreading warts is a common link to people with eczema.  At our last count he had over 25 warts on his two hands.  We tried everything to get rid of them from over-the-counter products to several doctor visits to 'freeze' the warts.  Nothing was successful.  Finally a plastic surgeon recommended this honey because of its success in patients with eczema and psoriasis.  Within a week of using the honey the warts were visibly much smaller.  Now that the honey is gone so are the warts!  We are so pleased that our little guy didn't have to go through any more painful treatments!  It is a miracle!
