Initially I bought this tea because I wanted to try something different. For my surprise, I found a tea with a perfect blend of flavors. You can feel a touch of sourness of the cranberries and hibiscus flowers, the refreshing taste of the orange peels, and the pleasant taste of the camomile.. it is just perfect. Now I can't stop drinking it. I highly recommend it.
