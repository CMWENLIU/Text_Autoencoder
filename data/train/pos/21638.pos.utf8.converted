I fell in love with the taste of lingonberries because of IHop which offers a dish of Swedish crepes/pancakes served with lingonberry butter and preserves. The combination is divine. Now, because of Amazon, I just received an order of Hafi Lingonberry Preserves and can order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25S8U">Lund's Swedish Pancake Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and create my own version of IHop's marvelous dish!<br /><br />Ah, the taste of lingonberries--subtle, light, elegant, yet fruit-luscious in each spoonful. Items like preserves and cheeses can be served two ways: ambient room temperature or chilled. I prefer the ambient taste--the chill retards the full flavor.<br /><br />So what does lingonberry preserves taste like? Not strong like blueberry preserves. Not exotic like blackberry or heady like grape or tart like raspberry. Subtle. Sweet enough but nothing near cloying. Perfect.<br /><br />Until the pancake mix arrives, I'll have lingonberry preserves on homemade biscuits. Yum, yum!<br /><br />Note: As this is a product of Sweden and shipped from Sweden, I must mention the packaging. The jar was double-wrapped in bubble wrap. And as a little treat came a tin of peppermint lozenges. Delightful!
