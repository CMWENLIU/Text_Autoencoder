I use this product everyday and I have continued to buy it since I discovered it.  I put it with rice milk, or with fruit in a smoothie, etc.  If you just put it in water and drink it, then yes it is grainy.  I don't do that and don't recommend such.  It really helps to balance the blood sugar and keep the body happy.  It is satisfying in keeping the appetite down.  It keeps my lower tract running well.  It is high protein and has carb balance as well.  Be sure to add it with something to avoid the gritty taste.  It wasn't designed to be drank with just water though a person could do it.  I've tried the more expensive Nutiva blends that have flavors added and they are great.  Nutiva does a good job in producing healthy products.  This particular hemp protein powder is effective and it is the cheapest among the hemp protein lines so I just add my own fruit, maca, etc.  If you want to stay economical and add your own blend to it then you have a program that works great.  If you want a sweeter taste then buy the other types of Nutiva hemp as they have several great flavors. I highly recommend Nutiva hemp.
