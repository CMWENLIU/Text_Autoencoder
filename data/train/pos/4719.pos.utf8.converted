Kraft Parmesan is my family's favorite. We live outside the US and do not have easy access to this product on the local market at a reasonable price. Being able to order 12 small (8oz) cannisters at a price below that of bulk size containers was great -- it makes storing and keeping the cheese fresh much easier.
