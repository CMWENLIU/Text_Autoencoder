I tried these chocolate chips after hearing rave reviews about them from vegan and gluten-free bloggers that I respect.  I can understand why they've gotten so much hype.  They taste every bit as good as chocolate chips that do contain dairy (and in my opinion even better) plus they can be enjoyed by people who cannot have dairy or gluten.  They were also picked as a best chocolate chip by America's Test Kitchen.  After going up against seven other brands (including many popular and premium brands) they were the winner, which reinforces their quality for me.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Evaporated cane juice, unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter, roasted soy flour, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla extract.<br /><br />Overall, these are awesome chocolate chips.  If I had done a blind taste test I would have never known that they were vegan.  They are a litle more expensive than conventional brands, but still in line with premium brands which given they are delicious as well as dairy and gluten free, is worth it for me.
