Ok...Temptations treats are like crack for kitties and if they don't get their little treats morning and night they lock me out of the house.  This is the best price I could find and shipped to my door is great.  As always, the cats nervously watch for the UPS guy and will sign for the package if I'm not home.  Be sure to share with your neighbors so they too will suffer supplying their cats with kitty crack.  Note to self, buy stock in this company.<br /><br />Excellent used as treat when training your cat.  My cat now jumps through burning hoops, water skis and works part time with The Flying Wallendas.
