I have an 11 year old husky mix who started having problems jumping and some difficulty walking. He was on a strong pain killer for over a year and it did ok for the first six months or so, but then it started to loss it's effectiveness. I started to give him Glucosimine Chondroitin tablets and that help a lot. However, giving it to him myself was hard and I didn't always place it just right in his throat so he could shallow it comfortably (2 large tablets a day). I then began to look for something in a liquid form and I found this product and it has turned my boy into a puppy again. It's easy on him and myself and the results are far better than I could have ever hoped for! I have a "save and subscribe" shipment coming every month now. Amazon please don't stop carrying this product.  -Thanks
