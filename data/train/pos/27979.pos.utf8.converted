I was diagnosed with Celiaces about 6 months ago and I've been on a quest to replace some of my most beloved snacks.  I've tried every cheese cracker (and general cracker) that is gluten free with VERY mixed results.  I thought I'd take a chance on these as I had not seen them in stores.  I popped open the bag as soon as they arrived and WOW, these are fantastic, I'd never know they were gluten free. They are triangular in shape and "puffed" not as in puffed rice but just blown up like a hollow pillow so they are very light and crispy and taste EXACTLY like Cheeze-Its which I've been eating for 20+ years.  Totally normal texture and flavor, none of the weirdness you find with other gluten free foods.  I HIGHLY recommend these if you're a CHEESE-IT lover.  These are a permenant on my amazon.com list from here on out.  Thanks Wellabys!
