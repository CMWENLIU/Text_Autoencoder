I picked this up on a whim, stuffed it in a cabinet and promptly forgot it. A few months later, I was pressed for time and had to make a nice dish to take to a holiday party. I rummaged through the cabinets, found this and decided to go for it. I made the bisque, then added some chopped, cooked shrimp. The soup was a hit!! Everyone loved it and wanted more. I very strongly recommend it. It's great!
