Apparently this is made from organic sesame seeds, nothing else added. It is smooth, not too runny at all, and sweet-tasting - which is to say, not bitter. Actually there is just the merest hint of bitter, just enough to remind you that you are, after all, tasting sesame. "Butter, not bitter". Ha.<br /><br />I proceeded to make a great batch of hummus using this. It lends just the right elusive note; a top-notch tahini is the only way to achieve that. A 16-ounce jar really isn't too much though it should be kept refrigerated as anything with high oil content and no preservatives is in danger of becoming rancid, especially in higher temperatures. Somehow the level of tahini in the jar is already lower than one batch of hummus should render it. Could it be that I am taste-testing it rather frequently? If you want to know, it does have a peanut butter consistency but of course a sesame taste.<br /><br />And finally, if you're worried about Amazon shipping a glass jar, you should know that some conscientious employee completely encased mine in bubble wrap, which was secured with tape. And there was packing material in the box. So barring a train wreck, this stood a great chance of getting to its destination intact. Which it did.
