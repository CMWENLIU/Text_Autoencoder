As far as teas are concerned I am partial to the black teas. I have 2 pounds of the Earl Grey and 1 of them says that there is lavender in it as well. When it is in the cup a slightly sweet lavender smell greets my nose which is very pleasant and tasty. I have not noticed a smokey essence as has been reported by other reviewers just a full bodied tea that has great aroma, terrific taste and comes at a very affordable price. And, if you purchase your teas on a subscription basis from Amazon and are a Prime member there is free shipping and a 15% cost reduction for your following purchases. To me all the Davidson's teas we've purchased are first class and organic. I highly recommend them and purchasing them through Amazon.com
