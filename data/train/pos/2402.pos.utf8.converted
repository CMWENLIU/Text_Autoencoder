I am a person who take good care of my health by eating good things. By now, I am very concerning what food should be included in our diets to maintain good health. Especially, high calories food based on carb make me worried about my diet. BUT! Since I tried this product, which is real good, I stop worrying to eat RICE. It's real low calories, healthy organic brown rice, not expensive, and easy to cook (just only 1min. 30sec. in the micro.). Anyway, I really enjoy this product, and of course buy again.
