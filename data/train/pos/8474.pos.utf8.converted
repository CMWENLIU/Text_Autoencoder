We tried these because of my daughters interest in all things Doctor Who , and as most fans of the show know, the Fourth Doctor always had them. Living in the states, you can't buy them here, so when I found them on Amazon, I jumped at getting them. We weren't disappointed, they are different from any jelly type candy we've eaten.  They are a little grainy in texture but softer than any gum candy, and the flavors are natural.  This is the only brand (Bassett's) we have tried, and they are supposed to be the best.  The shipping is a bit pricey because they're imported, so if you order, order several bags while your at it.
