I concur with the positive reviews about this coffee blend.<br /><br />I'm generally wary of medium blends, unless I know the region mix well enough.  Overall, it's a sure bet.  The medley of Indonesian, Central and South American beans, guarantees a light, medium and dark roast roller-coaster in every sip. This is a very even, all-around smooth blend, that's highly drinkable any time of the day -- or night ; ).<br /><br />If you can adjust the coffee-to-water ratio according to your liking before the brew cycle, you'll be able to even accentuate or lessen the "kick" these three sisters pack per cup.  Don't think twice about buying this blend.  It'll be your new favorite for quite some time.
