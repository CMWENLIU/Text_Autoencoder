I have been using this mix for years and have tried many others.  This is by far the best mix out there for chocolate chip cookies, it has the right texture, it doesn't taste artificial in any way and the combination of brown sugar and butter along with the ghirardelli chips is fantastic.  I don't even make them from scratch because this is just as good and easier (at least to me) and I always get compliments on them when I bake some up to share.  Recently all my stores stopped carrying this and I was very upset.  I ordered from a bulk by the case place online but Amazon has the same thing for almost $10 less and free shipping, I am thrilled!
