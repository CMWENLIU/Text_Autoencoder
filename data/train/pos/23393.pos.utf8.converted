Love this tea, I order it regularly for drinking. Be sure to sift it for smoother less bitter taste. Any bitterness comes from clumps; sift your tea before pouring the water. On the subject of water, don't bring it to a full boil or else let it cool. If the water is too hot you will burn and scald your tea!!!!
