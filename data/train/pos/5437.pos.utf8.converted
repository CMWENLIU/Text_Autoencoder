Its great to be able to blend your own chicory coffee.  I use the fresh roasted Sumatra at Costco's with Community Coffee's chicory.  My blend is 8oz of chicory to 16oz of coffee.  If you want a stronger chicory favor, use more.  Use less for a milder blend.  The good thing about blending yourself is the ability to use a good grade of coffee.  I believe Cafe du Monde uses a low grade of coffee.<br /><br />If you don't need 6 bags of chicory, you can order it directly from Community Coffee.  Its $2.99 a bag, plus shipping (at least $6.95) from them.  Clearly Amazon is a better value.  I will usually end up giving a bag or 2 away to friends or family that express an interest.  Storing the rest in the freezer is a good idea.
