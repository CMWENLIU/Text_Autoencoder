I am a little amused by the reviews citing the bad taste. If your toddler is used to milk, there are other options out these for milk based toddler formula that you should probably try first.<br />The Gentlease line is for sensitive babies and contains partially broken down proteins to aid with digestion of milk. It does taste different, but for babies that had milk allergies and are used to the disgusting taste of Nutramigen/ Alimentum and similar hypo-allergic baby formula this is really a big step up. My baby was on very expensive formula because of her allergy and even though she is better now at 20 months will still react to normal formula. She cannot drink cows milk, and we've tried goats milk, soy milk, rice milk, almond milk .... she refused them all. I was in despair till I came across the Gentlease toddler - She loves it, does not react to it, and gets more nutrition than she would with any of the other options. It is also so much cheaper than what we've been spending to date.<br /><br />This may not be for every toddler, but was the perfect option for us.
