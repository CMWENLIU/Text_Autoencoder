I've been working through all of the Hormel Compleats with beef of one kind or another. I work at home and really am not interested in any extensive culinary efforts for lunch. In any event, I really am not much of a gourmet either. I appreciate excellent cuisine, but for lunch I just want something tasty to eat and simple to prepare.<br /><br /> Preparation could not be easier. Punch a couple of small holes in the cover of the container, pop it in the microwave for 90 seconds and let it stand for a minute. The worst part is opening the container. There's a plastic-like sheet acting as the cover. It is miserable to pull back. The adhesive is super-strong. The container is still hot and there is the potential that giving it a hard pull will result in contents shooting everywhere. I've taken to carving off the covers with a knife.<br /><br /> As for the meal itself, this one is yummy. There's a relatively thick slice of tender beef, carrots, potatoes and, I think, some onion. All of this is floating in a veritable ocean of brown gravy. Well, maybe not an ocean, but there's a lot of it. This entr&eacute;e would pass muster at the local diner.<br /><br /> Great for a quick, light, tasty lunch.<br /><br />Jerry
