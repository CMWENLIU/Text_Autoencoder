Have used dehydrated green peppers for many, many years.  They used to be readily available in grocery stores, then they just sort of disappeared.  Knowing Amazon comes through for me all the time, I was able to locate them through Amazon and am again ready for any recipe requiring green peppers.  I seldom re-hydrate them and generally use them in recipes that have enough moisture to begin with.  Very happy to again have this product.
