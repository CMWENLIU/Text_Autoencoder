To give an honest and fair review, I would have to start by saying that the taste and aftertaste of this product is a bit unbearable at times; definitely ruined my salad. However, I will not refrain from treating this product with its well-deserved 5-stars.<br /><br />Although the taste is not nearly as satisfying as a burger, the benefits far outweigh the "light, nutty," flavor. An immense source of omega-3's (an essential fatty acid the human body does not produce), I chose this product to replace certain fish products that claimed to do the same - I found the Oil to be easier to intake and even experimented cooking with it.<br /><br />I am new to the hemp line of products but can account for the fact that my energy levels have shown a significant increase. Proving to myself the necessity of this products ingredients for my body. All hemp products seem to have the same indescribable after-taste (not so pleasant if i had to describe it), but, I am sure that after a month of using this product my body will begin to enjoy the taste, like anything else.<br /><br />All in all, this product was well worth the buy, especially for the low rate they charge. Shipping was on par. Recommended for anyone.
