To say that I have fallen in love with BB is a bit of an understatement. The taste, the smell - all of it. This is the best coffee that my machine has brewed.  Loved the sampler pack as it was really great to try different things. Though, I do absolutely love the Fuggedaboudit! It's strong,It tastes AMAZING and wakes me up (which is important) and makes getting out of the door just a bit easier.<br /><br />Only downside? When I reach the end of the cup!<br /><br />Highly recommend.<br /><br />:D
