This product is wonderful!  I enjoyed it at Christmas, but had to<br />get some more because I enjoy it year round.  If you add a little<br />milk and sugar to the tea, it has a mild flavor of eggnog, which<br />might sound like an odd combination with tea, but actually, is<br />quite good.  I was pleased to know I could purchase it in June,<br />since it was only available in stores around Christmas.  The price<br />through Amazon was much better than the grocery store price, also.
