I love Bob's Red Mill products, especially breakfast cereals.  I like trying new ones every once in a while and i came upon Kamut.  I had never heard of it, but tried it anyway.  The great think about Kamut is that it goes with many things very well (apples, blueberries, cinnamon, etc).  It is very versatile.  The texture is also very unique and it is an overall very good, unique cereal.  Well worth the try if you've never had it.
