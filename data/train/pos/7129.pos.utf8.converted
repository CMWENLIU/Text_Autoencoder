I mix this soy flour with buckwheat flour and all-purpose, gluten free flour to make a great pancake batter. I love the fact that this soy flour is organic and is high in both protein and fiber. That really makes a delicious and healthy pancake mix. I add organic soy milk, olive oil and baking powder to the mix and create delicious vegan and gluten free pancakes!
