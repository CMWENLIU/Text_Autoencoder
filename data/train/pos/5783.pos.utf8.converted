So my child was strictly breast fed until the age of 10 months.  Then I tried feeding her.  I tried just about every organic baby product out on the market, result : BLAH!  She does not like baby food?!?!?!?!  I have resulted in feeding her what she will eat from our meals, or rather what she is allowed to eat from our meals.  I will eventually make all of her baby food but thought, why slave over the stove now if she is not going to eat?  I'll wait until she wants to eat, then I'll slave.  For now, she is nursing OVERTIME!!!<br /><br />Today, at of all places, Lego Land, I see "Sprout" baby food.  It's organic.  I read ingredients . . . . just food!  So, I try it.  I like it.  Tastes like food to me.  Not jar baby food, but like the baby food I made my son.  My daughter LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that she eats it.  Bought every one of the different types they had at Lego Land . . . . now I'm going to order on line.<br /><br />If you like whole, REAL, food . . . . try it!
