I grew up eating homemade stuffed grape leaves so I am very biased, sorry. I have tried so many different brands of canned stuffed grape leaves and found most to be too mushy or too crunchy. These Galil brand strike the best balance. Someone mentioned that they tasted too salty. I did not sense that at all. They have a very mild lemon "zing" on the palate which to me is perfect. I will continue to buy these at a great price from Amazon. Oh, these Galil's are the first canned grape leaves that I could eat and not feel compelled to smother them in Tzatziki yogurt dip. That is a real compliment in my book!
