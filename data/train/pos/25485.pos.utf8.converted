I bought this product becuase i had a infestation of what I called "gnats", in my plant at work. It is a vine plant, im not really sure the name of it. Anyway, I had lots of little flying bugs that multiplied over the last few months, and after getting a nice warning from my boss, i thought i would get something to save my plant. I threw one of these fertilizer/bug killer sticks into the soil, and within a week or so i am yet to see one. Pretty amazing actually, as I didn't think it would actually work. If the bugs look like gnats, and fly around this product will kill em!<br /><br />You also get 10 of them in the package, which will last quite some time
