I have been plagued with a biting red ant problem in a rocked area running the length of my driveway that actually started last summer.  I was reluctant to put poison down and hoped the Colorado winter would eliminate the issue.  The opposite happened and it has been impossible to walk down my driveway this summer without getting my legs swarmed by biting ants.  I covered the area twice with borax - which seemed to send them below ground just long enough to have Town Hall meetings and come out fighting mad.  In desperation I purchased 3 containers of this hoping to make the situation even a little better.  I sprinkled ONE container lightly over the area just to guage the effect.  I kid you not, ALL THE ANTS ARE GONE.  I keep checking to see if they will reappear with tanks and airplanes and cannons aimed at my garage, but they are GONE.  This stuff is amazing.
