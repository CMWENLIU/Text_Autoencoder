I originally bought this coconut oil at a health food store because they had some sort of promotional sale, and I moved soon after, so this big jar ended up in storage for more than a year.  I finally came across it when sorting through boxes, and assumed it would go in the discard pile.  I know how delicate some oils are, and rancid oil is especially bad for you.  So it was surprising that this jar was still as fresh as new - I later read that coconut is one of the most stable oils.<br /><br />At first it was a little alarming that the oil in the jar normally resembles something like shortening or the lard we had on the farm, or it can melt in the jar and be clear when the room temperature is higher in summer.  But I take it by the spoonful right out of the jar.  It is also good for cooking, like scrambled eggs and so on, I use it interchangeably with butter now.  I also really like it on my skin for moisturizing after a shower.<br /><br />I agree that I normally prefer a glass container for almost everything.  I am extremely sensitive to plastic fumes of any kind, partially because of medication I take.  I can't even drink from plastic "glasses" because they smell funny, hard to explain especially when visiting. That being said, I detect no fumes from this packaging, maybe it is a special kind of plastic like that used for my blender jug.  I don't know for sure, but I am fine with this jar.<br /><br />I would recommend this oil to anyone who has made the choice to start getting healthier.
