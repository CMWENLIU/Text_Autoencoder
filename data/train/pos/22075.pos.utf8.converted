I have been using this flavor (Lobster base) for several years and continue to get raving compliments of the dishes I prepare using it. Specifically:  in the simplest context, just include an ample amount in the water when you are boiling fresh shrimp (it works best when shrimp is shelled and deveined first to allow the most surface area to absorb the flavors)<br />  Slightly more complex: I use it to flavor my Salmon Croquette recipe. It is a fairly standard recipe -- although I use only fresh salmon filets (precooked)never canned salmon.  Include this product in your mixture for fabulous flavor! (one note -- this product is already pretty salty, so wait until you have added this stock , then taste your mixture before adding any more salt)<br /><br /> Bon Apetit<br />William Edwards
