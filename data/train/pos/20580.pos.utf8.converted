I don't mind canned beans, but these are better, and I like the varieties. I got all three of the Santa Fe varieties available and my review is the same for each -- easy to prepare and yummy! Forget the cans and maintain these in your pantry. I use them for dips, for nachos, for a sidedish, instead of meat in lasagna, and whatever.
