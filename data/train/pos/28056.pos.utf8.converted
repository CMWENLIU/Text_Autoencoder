We first discovered these bars at HiHealth, but found them a bit cheaper on Amazon. The JayBar tastes fantastic. A lot of bars give you the runs because of the chemicals or whatever, the JayBar does not do that. They taste so darn good. We have only had the Fudge Brownie.<br /><br />Another thing cool, for those that are trying to satisfy their chocolate or candy bar cravings, these do the trick. They also make for quite the filling snack.<br /><br />My husband is a weight lifter, he eats these around mid-day.<br /><br />REMEMBER... they are truley natural, no garbage fillers!!!
