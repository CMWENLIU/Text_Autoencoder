These are tasty. they're not like home made so don't expect that.  they're the top of the line for canned pasta. and it only takes 90 seconds to heat the whole can (once you dump contents into microwave safe container). they are plump with meat- so they are BIG BEEF_ the meat mix is creamy but the sauce has meat chunks in it- like regular pasta sauce might if the meatballs break up in it. the cans came with 1 1/2 years till expiration date- so if you order extra you don't have to eat them all right away- so if they're on sale_ buy, buy, buy. good source of protien, veggies and fiber- i read the label. if you eat the whole can it's about 500 calories- but you're filled up and it's good.
