Saw this at Kohl's and thought, what the heck. I'll try it. Got it home and it was great. Filled up a to go coffee mug with ice (dont want to use glass as it may crack with the hot vs cold) , and then brew it over the ice. Then add more ice after (most melts while brewing), then add my own Vanilla, French Vanilla, or Vanilla Nut liquid creamer, stir it up and transfer it all to a tall glass then put it in the freezer for a bit to give it that icy feeling.<br />YUMMMM!! Im hooked for sure. A bit expensive but worth it and cheaper than Starbucks or even McDonalds.<br /><br />You wont be disappointed so give it a try
