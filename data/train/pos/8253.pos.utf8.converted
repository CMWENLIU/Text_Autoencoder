I surprise myself by rating this cheese my favorite of all cheeses (and I love cheese, all kinds.) But real Parmigiano Reggiano is so delicious. I love the characteristic amino acid crunch (those little white spots are crystallized amino acids produced during the ripening process.) Even though a pound grated lasts a long time, sadly, you may discover that real parmesan can be eaten in chunks, like a good chocolate, and thus, this pound will melt away like snow. Too good.
