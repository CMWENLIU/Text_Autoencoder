If you're a serious chocolate lover, these are for you.  These figs are filled with a thick, gooey, very dark, very rich chocolate.  They are coated on the outside with a soft chocolate shell.  The taste of the fig is still apparent.  Very good.  Although there are only a few candies, they are each a large size, and they are so rich you couldn't eat more than one at once, anyways.
