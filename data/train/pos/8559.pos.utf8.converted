Red Vines are so good. I grew up in the West eating them at the movies. Since moving out East, they are very hard to find and I have found that the majority of people have no idea what they are. I ordered a tub and they were sooooo soft and fresh! I brought the tub in to share with my East coast friends and they hated them...said Twizzlers were much better. Of course that is total garbage. Eating Twizzlers is like eating a candle; they are SO waxy. Anyway, back on the subject, the Red Vines were shipped quickly, and were totally soft and fresh! You must get some!
