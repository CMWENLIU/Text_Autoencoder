WOW. I've been using this product for 3 years now and it can't be beat. I grew up in Germany & loved my gramma's goulash. THIS product is just short of being just as great as my gramma's. I use it with my crock pot, meat that's on sale (it's cheaper to cut that into cubes than buying the stew meat) and serve on noodles, rice or potatoes. My problem is that since Lipton took over the Knorr label this product is extremely hard to find - I can't find it in my town anywhere now. I was amazed that Amazon carries it - whew! I'll order a case :)) & also try the sauer braten mix.
