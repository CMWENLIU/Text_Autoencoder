Well, yes of course vanilla beans would be even better. But I can't afford them. And this is the next best thing. I went through the 3 jars in no time this summer, making the best vanilla ice cream we ever had. And Oh, the strawberry made with seascape berries. MMmm, good! I bought vanilla paste at Trader Joe's but this is a much superior product in flavor. So I just reordered in time for holiday baking. I have not tried other LorAnn extracts as I usually buy organic. For this great product I make an exception. It delivers the goods to your baked goods and custards.
