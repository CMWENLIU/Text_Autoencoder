Oh my good god. These are quite possibly *the* most delicious things I have ever eaten.<br /><br />In my life.<br /><br />I came across these raspberries last year at a Costco here in SoCal, and then - to my dismay - they recently stopped carrying them. I've since been searching EVERYWHERE, and I am THRILLED to finally find them here!<br /><br />No other brand of dried fruit can compare. Their blueberries and cherries are also excellent (and I usually don't care for either).<br /><br />Highly highly HIGHLY recommended!!
