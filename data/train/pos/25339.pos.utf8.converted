I have to admit at the price I was hesitant to mail order, but did. Waited about 4 weeks for this big guy, but it was well worth it. Packaged to survive a major storm, you will have to spend an hour unpacking and cleaning up all the white peanuts, but your efforts will be rewarded. A wonderful, healthy and sturdy plant, mine much like the pic here at Amazon will  be yours to admire and care for. I am very pleased with this offer.
