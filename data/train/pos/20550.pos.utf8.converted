Great cereal.  Similar to, but better texture and taste than Grape Nuts.  Also, these are not made from flour like Grape Nuts.  Great source of protein.  Throw on some sliced bananas and your favorite honey, and this is a treat!  Amazon has these at a price I haven't been able to match (except for the almond flavor), and occasionally has them as deals of the day for a few cents cheaper.
