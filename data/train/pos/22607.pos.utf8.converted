I love me a good white mocha, but at 4 bucks a pop at the cafe and goodness knows how many calories -- its an occational treat.  I am really trying to stay out of Starbucks to save money; enter this very creamy and delicious mix from Ghirardelli.  It is such an inexpensive way to enjoy a white mocha!<br /><br />Ten reasons why this mix rocks:<br />1.  It contains no saturated fat or trans fats<br />2.  Each serving of mix has only 100 calories<br />3.  It contains the coffee and is good on its own, but I add powdered espresso or cold brew for AM kickstart<br />4.  I really like being able to control the milk fat content, it tastes really fresh and not like fake creamer<br />5.  It is good hot or cold<br />6.  This mix is ideal for keeping in your office<br />7.  It contains regular sugar and not high-fructose corn syrup<br />8.  One can lasts me four work weeks, but I don't have one everyday<br />9.  It is good to take camping/backpacking for a yummy hot pick-me-up while "roughing it"<br />10.It is awesome with a shot of dark rum, khalua or other suited boozy add in -- instant winter lifter ;)<br /><br />ECONOMY: At 19 servings a can for $4 (21 cents/serving) + milk (25 cents/cup), each white mocha is less than 50 cents!<br /><br />EASE OF USE: It mixes instantly in hot liquid.  If making an iced drink, stir the powder into a small amount of hot liquid before adding the cold milk and ice or you will have the movie DUNE on top of your iced drink.<br /><br />TASTE: To me it tastes very much of white chocolate, it may be just flavoring but it really works.  Actual white chocolate doesn't have any cocoa in it, just the cocoa butter, so I didn't expect any chocolate in the ingredients list and was not disappointed to see it missing.  If this had actual chocolate in it, it would be a black & white (or tuxedo) mocha mix.  It is important to read all the details and ingredients of a product before ordering to avoid disappointment over assumptions.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Scrumptious and thrifty
