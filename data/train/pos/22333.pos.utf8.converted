I ordered these for my candy dish at work.  I had to refill my candy bowl every day because my coworkers would make several trips to my office to have one or two.  The huge bag was completely gone in less than a month and I've had several requests to buy them again.<br /><br />They have a great flavor, they're soft, and they'll melt in your mouth.  I'm definitely going to have to reorder!
