Today is my father's birthday. If he were alive, he would be 92. He died in 1984 from heart-related maladies. Still, one remembers one's father on his birthday, alive or not, for a loved one is always alive in memory.<br /><br />So why Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper Seasoning? My father was a taste bud fanantic. No, let me re-phrase: My father wanted taste to explode on his tongue. He's one of those who shook Louisiana hot sauce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27IGK">Louisiana Original Hot Sauce, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 36)</a>) or pepper sauce (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UNVXQ">Trappey's Hot Peppers in Vinegar, 4.5-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>)--I refer to the hot vinegar that preserved the hot peppers--onto all kinds of food from fried eggs to peas and beans.<br /><br />Many years ago when I visited for the weekend, I brought with me Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper. Oh my gosh! My father loved that flavor!! I left the bottle, of course. Every time I visited thereafter, there was always a bottle in his cabinet. I lived in another city at the time. My brother, who lived in the same town as my dad, told me that our father raved over that Lemon Pepper many times over the years!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are seeking a great taste sensation, Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper may be just the thing! It satisfied the buds of a man who LOVED his food flavorful!<br /><br />(Note: There is no salt or MSG in Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper.)
