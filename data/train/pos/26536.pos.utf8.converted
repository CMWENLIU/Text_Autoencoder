My 13+ dog has lost her taste for most foods, and lost an alarming amount of weight.  I went through brand after brand of highly rated, expensive foods and each time, my dog took a sniff and walked away.<br /><br />I had my doubts about this dog food, but I bought a can of the adult formula at my local store, and my dog ate the whole thing.  So I ordered a case of the senior formula, and she has been enjoying it ever since!<br /><br />What a relief, thank goodness that I discovered this food!
