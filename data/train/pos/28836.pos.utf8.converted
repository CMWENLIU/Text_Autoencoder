My little dog was the fussiest eater you ever saw.  One day my daughter and I went to a pet expo where animals were welcome and we brought Martini, my chihuahua. They were handing out samples and she practically inhaled it. We used to have to put various enticements on her food to get her to eat, and even then it was hit and miss. We don't have to put anything on this, just break up the freeze-dried patties and she loves it! It's so exciting to see her eat now!  She doesn't like the frozen/raw version of this food, however. I have only tried the chicken so far.
