My family LOVES Spam, and of all it's variations (Spicy, Garlic, Cheesy, Plain, etc) - Hickory Smoke is by FAR the best. If you're not sold on the idea of Spam, try this Spacon recipe:<br /><br />Start with some Hickory Smoke Spam and slice it thin - about the width of an individual sugar packet. Cut those slices lengthwise, so you have long, thin strips like bacon. Pour a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet and get it nice and hot. Fry your Spam slices until they're nice and crispy on both sides, then remove to a paper towel. Serve with eggs, hashbrowns, or whatever your favorite breakfast foods are. It tastes like bacon, but more crispy and less fatty (and much lower in calories).<br /><br />It also makes great sandwiches: Slice thicker, about 1/4 inch, lightly fry it with some Pam/non-stick spray and set it on Rye bread with lettuce, tomato, and Smoked Paprika Mayo (just mayo mixed with smoked paprika). Delicious!!!<br /><br />Also, if you're a fan of smokers and BBQ, try sticking a block of Spam in the smoker with your brisket, pork butt, and ribs. It's unlike anything you've ever tasted.<br /><br />Really - if you love pork, there's absolutely no reason NOT to love Hickory Smoke Spam.
