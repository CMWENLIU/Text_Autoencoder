My great-grandmother made it, my grandmother made it, my mother made it, and now I make it! (I hope my daughters will make it and this chain will never end, connecting one generation to the next through food.)<br /><br /> It is perfect for Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Here's the best recipe that is NOT printed on the packaging:<br />Pour the corn into a big saucepan. Pour milk over the corn (my mother uses whole milk, I use skim. No one can taste the difference.). Cover the pan and put it in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, put it on the stove and add butter (a stick for about three bags of corn. A third of a stick for a single bag, etc.) Add salt, pepper and about a quarter cup of sugar (for three bags of corn). Put the heat on low and stir every now and then for HOURS. Seriously. HOURS. Like, maybe, four hours. Or six hours if you want. It doesn't matter, you just let it stew,  making your whole kitchen smell like family and warmth and happiness and love. Add more milk every now and then when it gets too dry. Add more sugar every now and then, just a bit. Add more salt and pepper before you serve it. It should be the consistency of thick oatmeal. Not runny at all. You can eat it with a fork. It will make you happy. It will make you somehow, through the strangeness of the internet, connected to my family. I'll be happy knowing there are other people out there eating my great-grandmother's recipe.<br />Happy Holidays!
