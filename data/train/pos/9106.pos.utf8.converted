The prunes were wonderful - highly recommended.  Unfortunately, over and over Amazon kept sending us just one little bag instead of the case of 12 bags it is supposed to be that we ordered, despite repeatedly contacting them.  They finally just refunded the price after about the 3rd time around with the same mistake.  I hope they get their system straightened out - or get rid of the constipated employee in shipping pilfering the prunes. ;)
