A chance introduction to Savini Tartufi White Truffle oil has become one our delightful pasta experiences. A light dribble of oil, with a sliver of goat cheese, and our pasta is complete.<br />Heavenly!<br /><br />This Savini oil has the aroma and the finish of a great flavored oil, with the sophisticated delicacy to warrant the price.<br /><br />Other domestic oils finish so harshly as to be distasteful and disagreeable. Having experienced this oil, we know what good food may be experienced,<br /><br />We discovered this oil upon the learning our previous oil was no longer being imported. It too was wonderful, but our need to have a replacement, a superior truffle oil, sent us searching, and we found this Italian export through Amazon.com.<br /><br />For those enjoying truffles, I heartily recommend this oil for eggs, pasta, salads, where ever a premium oil would add a delicate note to the flavors of the dish.
