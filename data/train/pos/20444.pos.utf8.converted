I was having blood sugar spikes and after adding Nutiva's hemp protein to my smoothies, I can cruise for a good 3 hours without hunger or spiking.  This has been a godsend. I chose Nutiva because a few die-hard friends will use nothing else.  Plus I am a Californian, and like that it's made here. I tried a few other products over the months and keep coming back to Nutiva.  I just like it best, and Organic is really important to me.
