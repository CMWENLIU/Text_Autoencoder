Well I just finished my first can and ordered more.  The nonfat stuff you buy in a cardboard box at the supermarket is just plain disgusting tasting-even mixed into sauces or with chocolate sauce added. So I thought maybe this whole milk powder might taste better. Night and day! This stuff is delicious-even just drinking as milk. I don't even use this as a "survival" food. I keep a can in the fridge (I don't know if that's required, but I feel if you can, it probably stays fresh longer) and I use it for all my milk needs, rather than buying a jug of milk and then throwing 1/3 away when it goes bad. I use this for sauces, in cereal, soups-in fact anywhere I want to use milk. And it is, as another reviewer put it: "yummy" stuff.
