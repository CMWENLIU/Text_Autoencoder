I first encountered these crisps a couple of years ago when visiting my sister in California. Sadly, I was unable to obtain them locally when I returned home.<br /><br />I have a sulfite allergy and have a difficult time finding packaged fruit that I can safely eat, so the Brother's Crisps were an exciting treasure. When I recently found them on Amazon, I immediately ordered a combination pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana, 24-Count  Bags</a>, which includes the Strawberry / Banana Crisps, which have become my very favorite!<br /><br />These are "freeze-dried fruit" - meaning they simply have all the moisture removed from them. They remind me of the "Space meals" that were popular during the space era, and which are still available at some locations.<br /><br />Since there is no added sugar, the strawberries are tart, and as expected, the bananas are sweet. Together, they remind me of a "freeze-dried smoothie."<br /><br />With only 45 calories, this is a great little snack that packs a big punch, and because it is freeze-dried, it weighs in at about 1/2 ounce - awesome for hiking or backpacking.<br /><br />Each package contains approx. 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries.<br /><br />These are Peanut/Tree Nut Free * Gluten Free * Soy Free * Dairy Free * Non GMO * Vegan * and Kosher. And, Did I mention they don't have sulfites?
