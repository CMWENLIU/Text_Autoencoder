Stick with the angel hair.  They "chew" much better.  I first tried the thick linguine one and it was like chewing rubber bands.  I took a chance on the angel hair and it was actually very edible.  Satifies the carb crave with no guilt. I get them at the supermarket cause AMAZON does not offer them with free shipping.
