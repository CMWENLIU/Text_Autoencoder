Living in the UK, my husband and I enjoyed Nando's frequently.  However, in The States, there are apparently no Nando's! I am trying to understand how this could be when there are a million other mediocre restaurants here.  KFC's nasty and fatty tasting chicken and sides could be well replaced with Nando's flame grilled peri-peri chicken dishes and their sides are better too... corn on the cob, chips(fries) with peri-peri spice which also taste great dipped in the Nando's peri-peri sauce, garlic bread, and my favourite spicy rice!<br /><br />Seriously, if you haven't tried Nando's sauce you need to because it's the best marinade I've ever tasted.  If you live in The States it will be unlike anything you've ever had before and you'll love it.  My only suggestion is that unless you like VERY spicy and hot foods, try the Medium Peri-Peri sauce first.  The medium is actually plenty hot enough for me.  However, I understand that the more hot chillis one can consume the better for their metabolism and health.  So, Nando's is not only a tasty choice, it is also a healthy one.
