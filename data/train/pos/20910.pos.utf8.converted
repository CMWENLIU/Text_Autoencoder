I used to live on this stuff when I lived in New Orleans for college.  When I saw it on amazon, I was very excited and ordered it right away.  This cool brew coffee is less acidic than coffee so it is easier on your stomach.  It also has a smoother taste.  It tastes GREAT over ice with a splash of milk and some splenda.  Sometimes, I blend that concoction in the blender.  It tastes better than a frapachino...seriously.  I have no idea why they don't sell this everywhere.  It is a fantastic product.
