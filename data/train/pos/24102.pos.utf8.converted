I almost never review anything, but I had to review Horlicks. I have been a Horlicks addict since I was 5. And every single person who has ever lived with me: room mates or boyfriends and now my husband - are all Horlicks addicts too. I cant wait until its time to head to bed with my Horlicks and Kindle. Its the perfect amount of maltiness and sweetness and just heaven with warm milk. Enjoy!
