This is great stuff.  I love using broth in lots of recipes.  But I hate getting the big carton because more often than not - some of it goes to waste because I can't use it all in time.  So I love having the smaller cartons - you can use enough for just one bowl of soup or for flavoring veggies or rice - or you can use more if needed.  The best part is - none goes to waste and it tastes fabulous.  This is something I will always want on hand.
