This is a perfect size to take with you to Starbucks or your favorite restaurant - fits discreetly in your purse, briefcase, diaper bag, back-pack, man-bag, fanny pack, even your little watch pocket (just keep lid tightened!)! Much useful history and information can be obtained at http://www.sweetleaf.com/  Since I quit using bleached sugar, and I never liked the various chemically modified sweeteners, I've had much better results using Stevia (no headaches!). It is diabetic-friendly, dieter friendly, zero calories, low glycemic index, and easy to use! Not sure if it can be carried on board for airline trips, since this is a liquid, but you could look on Amazon for the SweetLeaf packets of powdered stevia to take with you - the powdered stevia is just as sweet and comes in individual packets. I find for most 10-12 ounce mugs of coffee or tea, I like two packets, but it's all based on individual taste.
