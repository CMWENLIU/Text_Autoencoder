If you are looking for coconut milk for making curries, this is the brand to buy. Mae Ploy brand is highly recommended also. Do not settle for less. Please search either of these two out! Warning: Shake the can before purchase. If it sloshes around like water - put it back. Chaokoh and Mae Ploy both are uniformly thick and creamy. Try to find the 19.5 oz can.
