I bought these because I saw a friend eating them the other day, and I remembered how much I loved them.  They are absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*They are individually wrapped, so they stay fresh for longer.<br />*The bag is resealable also, so they don't spill all over the place when the cats start knocking it over (which they will).<br />*2lbs is a ton of these, so you'll certainly satisfy your sweet tooth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*2lbs is a ton of these.  Eat them all and you WILL be sick.<br />*All the little wrappers generate a lot of trash.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Besides the fact that they are tasty, they remind me of someone very special, and whenever I start to miss her, they make me happy.  They get a star for that alone. :)
