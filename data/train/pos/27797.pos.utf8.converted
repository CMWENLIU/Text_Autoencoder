I have a Shih Tzu that will be soon turn 3.  I had her on a grain free Chicken diet until several months ago when she started having allergy problems.  Her constant licking and scratching drove me thru the roof.  My vet put her on a very expensive pill (like $60 a month), and recommended to me that I find her a diet with one "novel" protein.<br /><br />So, I went on-line and did some research.  Wellness was always something I was curious about.  I went on their website and found out that I could get some free samples.  After speaking with their customer service rep, I was informed that this Whitefish and Sweet Potato formula was their number one food recommended for dogs with allergies.  So, the company mailed me two trial size bags of this kibble.<br /><br />Well, it worked.  I've had my dog on this food for about 5 months now and she's completely stopped her licking and scratching in about a month.  I slowly weaned her off of her prescription allergy pill as well.  My vet is very, very impressed.<br /><br />I would give this food 10 stars if I could!
