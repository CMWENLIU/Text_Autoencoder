I bought this one, and the company's orange blossom honey.  I'm a bit of a honey fanatic, and have tried many types of honey from all over.  For a wildflower, though, I love this one.  It's a typical wildflower, but with just a bit more spice and complexity.  Great stuff, very acceptable price if you do the subscribe.  Middle of the road in sweetness, not too spicy, but not bland either.  A very good all-around honey. Could put it in teas or in cooking equally well.  It reminds me of when I was younger, going to a flea market, and getting one of those straight-from-the-beekeeper pieces of honey comb with honey in it. :)<br />I will probably still buy other honeys for their specific traits, but I think this may be replacing the clover honey I bought before it from Amazon, as the clover was a little too pungently, well, "clover".  This is complex enough a flavor, that it's not overwhelming you with any particular flavor.  Also, no bitter after taste like some honeys have. And you just can't beat knowing that it comes from lands not tainted with pesticides, and being a product of the US! :)<br />Containers come wrapped in plastic, just in case of breakage I guess, and it has a little white bit you have to remove from under the squeeze bottle top, which is nice to see.  It looks like it shouldn't have a squeeze bottle cap, but it does, which is nice.
