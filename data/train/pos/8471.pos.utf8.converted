these are the best ginger candies. And I have tried them all. I think. Very gingery and not overpoweringly sweet. Ginger Chimes taste like they grind up real fresh ginger, add sugar and form the candy-which is what the side of the package says they do. Imagine that-a product that really is what the package label claims. If you like the barely gingery very sweet candies these may overpower you. But if you find most ginger candy unsatisfactory Chimes may be your candy.<br /><br />So far one can only buy the smaller bags from vendors who make shipping a profit point, not from Amazon where one could fill out every order with Ginger Chimes to get to the free shipping minimum. I am having buyers remorse about clicking on that buy now button for the 5 lb box! Now I am carrying Ginger Chimes around and giving generous baggies full to ginger loving friends everywhere I go. And occasionally binging myself. At least one can have a Ginger Chimes binge for under 100 calories!
