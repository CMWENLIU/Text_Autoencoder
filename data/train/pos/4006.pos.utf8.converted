This is right up there with Green Mountain Revv for bold, dark flavor. For packaging, it's genius. They figured out how to eliminate more than half the plastic waste involved in making and using K-cups...and without any loss of coffee quality. I end up throwing very little into the garbage by first emptying the grounds into my compost. My only suggestion for San Francisco Bay Coffee would be to use a zip-lock bag to help preserve the freshness of unused K-cups. Give this a try--its great coffee!
