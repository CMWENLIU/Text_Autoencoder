When my cat suffered severe weight loss due to vomiting after a misdiagnosed case of bladder stones, I did extensive research on what the best possible food would be to nurse him back to his former self. EVO dry, Orijen dry and Nature's Variety dry were the three foods that I chose, and both of my cats preferred the taste of EVO (though I'd recommend any of them as excellent grain-free choices). I wanted to integrate canned food in order to help him keep up the best urinary health I could. Unfortunately, he is not a fan of canned food. Until I tried the EVO canned formula! He loves it, especially when I add an extra half can of warm water to the food. It's packed full of nutrition, protein and lots of all-important moisture. Try it and you will definitely see an improvement in your cat's health (skin, coat, energy level -- everything). The first time my other cat tasted it she meowed at me for 15 minutes while licking her chops as if to say, "Yum!"
