I absolutely love "Heinz Genuine Dill Pickles". I have four children who love them as well. Sadly, you can never find them in the grocery stores. It cost a great deal more to order them shipped directly to me, but if I can't get Heinz, I don't get anything. I am more than willing to pay the extra cost if that's what it takes. I hope they never stop making them. They truly are wonderful.
