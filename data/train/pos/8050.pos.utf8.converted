I am, mathematically speaking, middle aged. My body is making some unauthorized changes but the worst has been the swollen ankles. I could not believe how big my ankles could get! I tried everything I heard of to try to slough off the water I retained, some of them quite unpleasant, and I feared that the second half of my life would involve serious cankles. This tea solved it. I drink a cup every day and have no more swollen ankles. I feel much better and now order it by the case. I might even get an ankle tattoo, something impossible just a few weeks ago.
