If you haven't tried this style of balsamic vinegar, do so!  The high price of admission is well worth it. A quarter teaspoon can make even a winter tomato almost palatable.  Its addition to a stew or sauce makes that je ne sais quoi difference to the taste that makes everyday food special.  It is my host/hostess gift of choice for my friends who cook.  The silver label is almost as good as the gold and definitely worth the step up from the red.
