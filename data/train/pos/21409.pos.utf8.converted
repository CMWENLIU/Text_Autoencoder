This food is awesome!! My dog loves it!! He is the perfect weight with this food, has a great amount of energy, the shiniest coat (we get compliments all the time!!), and he has NEVER been sick! I am sooo pleased with this food!<br />Also my mom's pet store near her house had this "quiz" on pet food where you start with 100 points and subtract for things that are bad for the dog... such as fillers, artificial ingredients, etc. and then you add points for really good things... ... this food got the highest score possible!!<br />As for the person un-satisfied with the solidness of their dogs poop... it's shouldn't be rock hard... crappy foods actually put crap in their food to make perfect solid poops easy for you to pick up! not to say loose isn't bad... but maybe try some pumpkin for additional fiber...<br />I recommend this food to everyone I know!!
