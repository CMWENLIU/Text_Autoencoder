Fantastic! Makes the best blood-orange margaritas and martinis ever... and mixed in with a bit of key lime and pineapple juice and a pinch or two of spices, a wonderful Carne Asada style marinade!<br /><br />The frozen concentrate is ultra-easy to use, and a wonderful way to keep fresh-tasting juice that's normally pretty hard to find, close at hand! :)<br /><br />Super-fast and courteous shipping by seller, too! First-rate!
