I get this through the Subscribe & Save program through Amazon & it is such a great deal!<br />I use this tea to brew my own Kombucha Tea.  We go through a TON of loose leaf tea because we brew Kombucha dark & long plus we drink a whole lot of it!  This tea at this price is just perfect for the job!  I can't say how it is brewed the regular way because we don't drink it like that.  My husband did make iced tea with it & he loved it.  I mean really really loved it!  Maybe that's why our Kombucha is so delicious?<br />At such a cheap price it is worth trying.  The subscribe & save is no commitment.  You can cancel any time & adjust how often, how much, & even skip or have your item/s sent earlier.  Totally no risk.<br />Highly highly recommend!<br />Where else can you find ORGANIC TEA at this price?<br />Oh & it's packaged in a brown roll close type bag that is lined with plastic/wax?  on the inside.  I immediately remove it from the bag & store it in glass mason jars in a dark cabinet.  Stays nice & fresh!
