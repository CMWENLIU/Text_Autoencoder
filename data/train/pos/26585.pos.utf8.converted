I have always loved pistachios, but living two or three thousand miles from the nearest pistachio tree, I had never really tasted fresh pistachios. But I didn't realize that until I received my order of Keenan Farms pistachios from Amazon. I was immediately struck by how green and fresh looking the nuts were. When I got the first of three two-pound bags open and tasted them, I was hooked! Each kernel was so plump, so large, so crunchy and fresh and beautifully green I had to remind myself that I was holding a two pound bag and I couldn't eat the whole thing. I will reorder this item often, and recommend that you order them too.
