I really love Tisano organic cacao powder. After searching thru different product reviews and descriptions, I've chosen this one and like it a lot! I add a spoonfull of it to my morning cup of coffee. It smells great, tastes very rich and chocolaty, has a delicious and smooth flavor. I'm a chocoholic, and can tell a good cacao product from great. Highly recommend it. I'm ordering another pack right now. Enjoy!!
