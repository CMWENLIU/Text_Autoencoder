I first enjoyed Yellow Label in the Caribbean 20 yrs ago and have since in travels worldwide been looked at oddly at groceries as I purchased 20 boxes to take home. There it was only tea, in the US it wasn't available...or oddly in London which appears on the label.  A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just "coupons to try our other brands".  Finally, Amazon has it and even better a market in Chinatown here in NYC.<br />What makes it great?  It's the only black tea that is full flavored but not bitter.  It's so smooth that you literally can make a pot of it, leave the bags in, reheat it the next day and still have no bitterness.  This is a tea lover's tea that I have turned numerous travel companions onto for life and something I would be lost without.
