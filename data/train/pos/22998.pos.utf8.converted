As ridiculous as this may be, coca leaf tea is illegal in the United States. If you don't believe me, just call up the local drug enforcement people. It is actually illegal in most countries in the world. The Bolivian government is trying to get the help of the United Nations to change these idiotic laws. From all I have read coca leaf tea is completely safe, non addictive, and quite tasty, though I will have to go to Bolivia to see for myself because it is a felony in my State (and the other 49) and I have no desire to ever set foot in a prison. This is just as idiotic as hemp being illegal to grow in the U.S. even though it was a major crop for most of the country's history. It is the idiotic laws that weaken the other laws of a nation.
