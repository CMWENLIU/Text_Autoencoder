While studying herbs I ran across an eyewash recipe that required red raspberry leaf as one of the ingredients.  I ended up buying the one pound bag because the pricing was so much better than the smaller quantities.  One pound of red raspberry leaf is a lot of herb--at the time, I never thought I'd be able to use it all.  I did some research and found that this herb, when drunk as a tea, is good for a plethora uses.  Nausea, diarrhea, fevers, flu, hemorrhoids (yes, drinking tea helps hemorrhoids!) diabetes, and virtually any problems involving a woman's reproductive system just to name a few. I serve this tea to all of my guests and recommend it to virtually everyone.  The cut and sifted is kind of fuzzy looking, but it works very nicely when brewed.  It has a very light and mild flavor that requires little or no sweetener added.  I just ordered my second one pound bag. Try it--it's wonderful!
