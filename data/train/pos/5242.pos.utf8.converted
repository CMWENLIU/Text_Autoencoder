Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People "extra-bold trilogy"--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey.<br /><br />We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, "Is that as dark as it gets??" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S. You might look into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a> as well. It was the first big hit for us, and still one of our faves.
