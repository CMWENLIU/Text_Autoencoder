I have 4 cats and one of them is a 14 wk old kitten. Great to have one type of food that is GOOD for any age cat. / They took to the food without any complaints. 2 of my cats are very stomach sensitive and have allergies but with this NEW food we've had no adjustment issues./ Despite the higher costs for this food.... it is worth every penny. To know that this food does not have the wheat gluten present that has killed so many other animals. I love my pets and it would just be the the worst thing I could imagine to serve them some food that would cause them harm or death./I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!
