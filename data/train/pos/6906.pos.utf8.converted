I have 3 cats. I bought this after I almost lost my male cat, Gary. My cats love it!!!!!!!!! They eat this so fast! I put it out for Gary and my two females cirlce around waiting for him to finish! I don't have the heart to tell the females this is Gary's special food! I let them all eat it. The females do what aI call "speed eating" they love it so much. Gary likes it best when I mix a little water in it and make it softer!
