I will say up front that this works.  If you have  a gopher in your yard, this will put an end to that.  Just know that this is the end of the gopher/human relationship here.  This is where you escalate things after all attempts for a peaceful resolution have fallen through.  After all, would you play nice with a neighbor that leaves bear traps at your front door?<br /><br />Setting these takes some work, you push the center bars down until you can "hook" the back of them with the hinge portion of the setting rod.  I had to look this up since the package didn't explain that well.  Then, just wander out the the most recent mound of fresh dirt in your yard and start digging.  You should find 1, or hopefully, 2 tunnels.  Place the trap so the Gopher can't go around it and try to cover the hole, don't fill the hole just cover it with a tile or something.  The box says to move the trap after a couple of days if you don't get anything.  I suggest to actually check them every couple of hours.<br /><br />I got one within about 4 after setting the trap.  Likely good that I checked often since the trap doesn't land a killing blow.  Take a close look at the working part of the trap and the tripline.  The distance on them basically tells you that this thing will hit low on the gophers body, thus the catchy name I chose for the review.  Just try to check the trap often.  I am not a fan of gophers, but I am also not a fan of making little furballs suffer.<br /><br />Cleanup is simple, worthy foes may deserve a viking funeral.  Build a small, mole sized ship and immolate it on the water.  Or, place your foe up on a pike in the yard as a warning to others.  Just make sure you get them all before this last idea, last thing you need is an angry gopher child coming back to get you.  We have seen too many revenge movies based on the villain missing a few stragglers.<br /><br />In all, this trap does exactly what you want.  Happy hunting.
