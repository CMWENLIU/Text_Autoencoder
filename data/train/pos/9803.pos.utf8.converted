When Jesus saved all of the holy mesiah from drowning by making Noah build a giant boat, he must have messed up and let pistachios on the boat.  Who creates such a pecular object?  The ackward shell on the outside hiding the hidious greenish brown nut on the inside.  This is the nerd of the nut family people.  Then some of them the shell doesnt have that little helper crack to make it easy to peel.  Then you have to bite it or something and get shells in your mouth.  Its horriable that a nut could be deemed livable, we should all band together and rid the world of pistachios.  Maybe if they called it something cooler i would have different views on it.  How about calling it "The Evil Nut From Hell That's Color Is Best Described As Breen, A Mix Of Brown And Green", then i would have no problem with it.  If we all band together this fantasy could become a reality.  maybe well call it tenfhtcibdabamobag for short.<br /><br />Actually now that i think of it, I love pistachios and the name.  Disregard everything I had just stated and go eat some NOW.
