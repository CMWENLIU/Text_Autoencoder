(Reviewing as I'm chewing)<br /><br />As an avid gum-chewer, I'm always looking for something to satisfy my oral fixation, but I try to avoid the usual artificial sweeteners (i.e. Aspartame, Sorbitol, etc.) and sugared gums (for obvious dental decay reasons).<br /><br />I first ran into Xylitol, a sugar alcohol, in Trident gum, but the amount of Xylitol was minimal - Trident primarily sweetened its gum with aspartame and sorbitol.<br /><br />I later discovered Theragum, a product of 3M-Omni corp., which was 100% Xylitol.  A good gum, but 3 times more expense than Spry gum "and" it seems to break-down more readily than Spry gum.  Theragum tends to disintegrate after chewing the same piece for an extended period of time, which I commonly do.<br /><br />Sprygum, as I mentioned, costs 3 times less than Theragum and seems to hold-up to extended chewing time (further experimentation forthcoming).  I need about 4 pieces of gum to get a decent wad of gum to chew though.  :(<br /><br />I have only tried Peppermint, but have Cinnamon, Spearmint and Fresh Fruit samples to try.<br /><br />Conclusion:  best gum I've found so far and the price is reasonable.
