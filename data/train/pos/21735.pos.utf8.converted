We just adopted an 11-month old and were having the hardest time getting him to pee outside, even after a whole night of his holding it while in his crate.  We were at the point of having to leave him outside for 30-60 minutes, just to be sure, unless we were lucky enough to see him go sooner than that while watching him from inside the house.<br /><br />I saw the Pee Post at our local pet store and thought it would be worth a shot.  I pounded it into the ground, brought our puppy out on a leash to sniff it, and he went immediately!  It's been several days now and it's worked every time:  bring him out, he pees right away, we get to go back inside and play!<br /><br />He's a terrier and terriers are pretty territorial while always trying to dominate other dogs, so maybe that's why it's so effective with him.  The product also points out that it is more effective with dogs "who have not established their marking patterns", which was the case with our guy...
