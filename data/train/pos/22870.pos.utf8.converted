My son was diagnosed with many food allergies over the summer. These have been a lifesaver for us, as they are the only candy he can have. Literally. He can't have chocolate, because that has milk (although we recommend the Enjoy Life chocolate chips) and everything that's not chocolate has some form of corn in it. My son is also allergic to corn.<br /><br />All of my kids love these candy, so they are for everyone. Not just one with allergies. The one they fight over the most is the root beer flavored drops. I hope they start making that flavor in a sucker, also, but they are happy with the drops, too.
