I compared 4 different brands of matcha green teas. Here's how they rate:<br /><br />#1 DO 2nd Harvest, excellent flavor, texture, and color, expensive, organic<br /><br />#2 Serendipi, great flavor, best price for the quality, organic<br /><br />#3 The Tao of Tea, local Portland Oregon company, fair flavor, price slightly lower than DO, organic<br /><br />#4 Maeda-en, available at Uwajimaya. Difficult to dissolve. Less favorable flavor and not organic<br /><br />Uwajimaya has best selection of Matcha teas with several others I have not tried yet. Whole Foods carries both DO and Tao of Tea. New Seasons currently does not carry Matcha. Serendipi is available on Amazon for $17/4 oz. box, best tea for your money!
