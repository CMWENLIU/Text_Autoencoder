I was raised on tea, by a tea-loving mother and English grandmother, however, I do not consider myself an expert. I know you can go further down the tea-fanatic trail than I have gone. Despite my attempts, my own children refused tea, and I was resigned to the fact that passing on love of tea ended with me.<br /><br />I picked up the Traditional Medicinals Organic Peppermint at the now-gone Henry's chain looking to add variety - as a kid my mother plucked mint plants from the field to dry and turn into tea (I was also raised on chamomile tea procured in the same manner), and have never found a peppermint tea with the same flavor... until now. The tea tastes fresh, it is not too sweet or too strong, nor too weak as some brands I have tried resemble spearmint instead of peppermint. It is perfect on it's own, or with a bit of honey and cream to appease a strong sweet tooth. Best of all, I cannot keep my kids from drinking it, and they have begun branching out, and sampling other teas and even chai as well. It IS expensive, however, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the best money-saving option, as it is eligible for Super Saving Shipping and (for now) tax free to my state. I recommend trying one box to see if it is to your liking - I have found the tea at Sprouts, Trader Joe's and Wild Oats, so similar stores should have it as well.
