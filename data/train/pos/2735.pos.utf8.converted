I am a professional chef and work on mega yachts all around the world. This is one of the finest authentic Balsamics available. I always have some whether I am in my own kitchen or working in someone elses. It is great with fresh summer tomatoes, over grilled vegetables or just on some rustic bread with olive oil. Expensive yes, but well worth the price. Used sparingly it should last a few months...
