I'm a 58 year old grandma, and I can say without any reservations that this is the BEST canned tuna I've ever had -- including the home-canned tuna my grandmother used to make when I was a child.  Yes, it's expensive, but I guarantee you will be able to tell the difference, and the difference is worth the price to me.  This product is sometimes found in health food stores, but they are really just starting to expand their distribution, and you may not be able to find it locally just yet.<br /><br />If you want a can of tuna that comes with just Tuna (no phosphates or hydrogenated anything), salt (low sodium) and water, try it.  If you like it, take one of the boxes to your local health food other other local market and ask them to carry it.  Help this company expand, and then we'll all be able to find it on our grocery store shelves -- maybe even at a better price.  In the meantime, I'm putting in my free shipping order today!
