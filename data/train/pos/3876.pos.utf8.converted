Nigella in Arabic are the Seed of Blessing.  The flavor is deep and savory, like a peppered oregano and something you just cannot put your finger on.  Musky and warm, it is pungent and cozy.  They are used from Spain to Pakistan.  If you have had them, it is most likely in string cheese, often from Armenia.  If you are from New York, they were frequently used in stead of caraway in rye bread.<br /><br />If you are a baker, try studding your crust with them, especially if you are using an egg wash.  Nigella love all starch, pasta, potato, rice and bread.  As before, they also fancy cheese.  If you cannot find Armenian string cheese, there are several domestic ones made without the seeds.  But they tend to be on the krafty side.  Trader Joe's may be the best of that lot.  Or go to your mexican market and get Oaxaca cheese, the kind you stuff chilies with, which is a good place to use them since they go with tomato sauce.  Middle Eastern halloumi or akawi work well.<br /><br />Or, go with farmers' type curded cheeses, whole milk cottage will do.  Just warm a spoon of seed in virgin olive oil until it hits your nose, but do not use high heat or you will burn the fat in the oil.  Cool and stir into the cheese.  Crumbled feta or blue are good.  Let it sit overnight or so if you want, just take it out of the refrigerator for an hour or so to bring it back to room temperature.<br /><br />Switch out the pepper for Nigella in your next ratatouille.  My favorite:  use a table spoon of seed in two of oil and two of butter, warm as before and fold in 200 grams or so of gorgonzola (dolce is decadent) and toss with a hot pot of your just drained fettuccine or pappardelle or even black squid ink pasta.  Just do not be too zealous in draining.  Some pasta water is nice.  Add a spoon or two if that is easier.  Garnish with fresh oregano, marjoram or basil.<br /><br />Prefer rice?  Use feta and kalamata olives or feta and small shrimp with blanched spinach.<br /><br />Get to know this seed.  You might see them labeled as charnushka.  Zamouri is a first rate source of highest quality and freshness.
