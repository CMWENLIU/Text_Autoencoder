Let's be honest - 35% of your recommended daily fiber in a "candy bar" that makes you want to eat the whole box is great thing.<br />13% of your saturated fats in one bar? Not so good. I believe it balances out for the most part and there is definitely a benefit to making fiber taste good.<br /><br />Just don't eat more than one until you are used to them.<br /><br />The chicory root fiber that is in these (and FiberOne) and every other clone product is an incredible generator of intestinal gas in many people. People who eat a lot of foods high in fiber will not likely be as affected, but some will be caught quite by surprise with what happens a couple of hours after you eat one. Reports of people scaring their pets and waking themselves and loved ones up from a sound sleep with the substantial and epic flatulence is not as exaggerated as you might think. Marathon farting with longer durations and louder volume than you have ever experienced is fairly common.<br /><br />The good news is, the gaseous emanations are very often "all bark and no bite" (to put it delicately) and so can be very entertaining if you have small children or an immature husband (or wife). Just do not eat them prior to bed, church, yoga class, boardroom meetings, dates, long car trips with passengers, crowded movies, using public transportation, job interviews, dentist appointments, doctor's appointments, family reunions ... well, you get the picture.<br /><br />However, if you get selected by the IRS for an audit, eat a whole box (5 of them) about 1 hour before the scheduled time. This also works for meetings with any government officials or any people you DO NOT wish to ever invite you back.
