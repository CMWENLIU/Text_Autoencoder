My husband is a vegetarian who has not eaten meat since he was 12 years old.  He does not even remember what meat tastes like.  It is very difficult for the two of us to find a meat substitute that I will enjoy as well, and even harder to find one that I am willing to use instead of the real thing.  Hain Gravy Mix is one of those rare gems that I am happy to use.  The flavor is authentic and great, and it is SOOO quick and easy to make.  Plus, it's a lot healthier (which is worthwhile when you don't have to trade in flavor).  This one gets an enthusiastic 5/5 stars.  Highly recommended!
