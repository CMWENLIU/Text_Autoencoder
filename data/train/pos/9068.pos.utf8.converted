We have been buying Coffee Bean Direct coffee for 3 years now and have not been disappointed. We love our coffee but do not consider ourselves brew snobs. For the money savings I do not think you will find a better coffee. [...] This was purchased as a gift. One other comment, the beans are roasted the day of shipping.
