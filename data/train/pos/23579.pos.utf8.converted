I could not believe my prayers were answered when I discovered this product!  My cat was suffering from transient diabetes (caused by steroids).  He was heading for remission as the glucose levels began to drop but as the levels dropped, we had to keep adjusting his insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. I had been monitoring his urine glucose using Keto-Diastix for humans. This involved following him around until he was ready to urinate and then holding the stick in the stream to get a reading. (My cat and I have a very trusting relationship.)<br /><br />We had a holiday trip planned and I was a basket case worrying about how my pet sitter was going to find the time and patience to accomplish this during her busy holiday schedule. My Vet (the guy with the wings) mentioned he had heard of something that you sprinkle in the litter box and it gives you a reading.  He wasn't sure about it and had never seen the product.  An online search brought it up immediately in Amazon and I promptly purchased a package.  Sure enough, this package contained little pieces of confetti which you sprinkle into the litter box.  It lasts for five days and the color of the confetti tells you the level of glucose in the urine.  Genious!!!  We went on our vacation without fear, the sitter monitored the litter and all went splendidly!  By the time we got home, our kitty had gone completely into remission and was feeling fine.  The litter was clear and we were all very happy.<br />This product is a godsend for anyone who can't be there 24/7 to monitor their cat and can't do blood tests.  Let's hear it for Vets with wings, Purina and Amazon!
