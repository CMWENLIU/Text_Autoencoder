I make a beet salad with an orange chutney dressing that really doesn't taste the same without this chutney. Yes, there is mango chutney, but I prefer that with Indian food. We also use this chutney to make curried bananas, Bobotie, curried eggs and Lamb Sosaties.<br /><br />It is so essential to cooking in Africa. If you need a recipe using this chutney, just e-mail me from my site.<br /><br />One of our favorite ways to use this chutney is as a sauce with beef stroganoff. I know it sounds strange, but something about the "peaches" and the "creamy taste" of the sauce just works perfectly.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
