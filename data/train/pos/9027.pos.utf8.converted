I'm a vegetarian. This was my reason for switching my my kitties from meat based food to vegetable based. I was skeptical to purchase Evolution, thinking it too good to be true, but I was so pleasantly surprised. As soon as I set out the food, they took to it immediately. They appeared to be healthier, with fur that was silkier and softer than ever.<br /><br />Taurine and proteins are the main factors for kitty health. Conventional garbage that they sell in the supermarket that is passed off as "pet food" is slaughterhouse  by product including animal s**t. It's true,  they put dried up feces in pet food.<br /><br />If you love your kitty and are concerned for the ethical well-being of all animals, switch to Evolution. Conventional pet food is so stripped any nutritional value that pet food companies have to add synthetic nutrients to give it some form of nutrition. So you might as well give your pets food that is human grade( edible for humans), natural and vegan, and contains the nutrients they need and nutrients they can synthesize. They WILL love the taste of Evolution cat kibble.<br /><br />So people who say cats are supposed to eat meat are just trying to justify their own unethical behavior. It really is about Evolution.<br />Look, we evolved right? So can our animal friends.
