I purchased this to use with my Bialetti Moka, and it is delicious!<br /><br />I like to use 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons in my 6-cup maker, and it makes enough for two (large) lattes.<br /><br />It reminds me of working in Starbucks...that smell of delicious brewing coffee and espresso!<br /><br />(Unlike Starbucks coffee, however, this coffee is smooth and doesn't taste burnt at all.)<br /><br />The packaging was a bit smaller than expected, but a little sure goes a long way!
