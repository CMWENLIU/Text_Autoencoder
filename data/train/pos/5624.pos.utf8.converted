Since I got this for my elderly, frail cat who turns up her nose at a lot of canned food, I guess I'll rely on her judgment for the review.  She thinks it's pretty good.  I bought a case without her even trying it (didn't have at my local pet store) by reading testimonials about it on different sites and because she'll usually eat something with chicken.  I like that nutritionally, it looked like a very high quality, digestible cat food. It worked out, as she's eating it.  Hopefully, it will even help her put on a little weight, but just the fact she likes it and isn't throwing it up is a big plus.  I think getting it on Amazon is the way to go because cheaper AND got delivered quickly and free shipping.
