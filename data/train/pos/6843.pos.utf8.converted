Never thought I would be saying those words. This stuff is Fair Trade (ever hear about the "Darker Side of Chocolate"?), comes in GLASS not plastic, is fluffier and in my opinion more delicious than Nutella. Who ever thought 40 years ago that one day granulated sugar would be considered almost a health food? Well compared to the choices we have nowadays that's the way it seems. My eight year old granddaughter knows by heart the day my Subscribe and Save order arrives, making me "Super Mima" :-) Live a little!
