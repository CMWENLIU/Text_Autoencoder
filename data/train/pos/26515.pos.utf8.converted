<span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:37 Mins<br /><br /></span>Begins with a look of my door, with the screen installed.  Can barely see it, huh?  :)<br />I share the width of my sliding glass door, how it's installed, how it's shipped, and a handful of hints + suggestions.  ...a few things I wished someone had (visually) shared prior to me purchasing it (just to clear up a few doubts I had).  In summary, I dig the product and would recommend it to my friends and family, especially after installing AND returning a screen door I purchased at my local hardware store (that actually cost MORE than the Bug Off screen door!).<br /><br />Hope you find my feedback helpful!<br /><br />- Chevassus Studios
