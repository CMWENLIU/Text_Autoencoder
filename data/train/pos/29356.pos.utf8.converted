My family recently took a trip to Italy & we saw these giant containers of Nutella everywhere. My brother-in-law really wanted one but we had no way to get it home. We sent him this for his birthday & he's in Nutella heaven...even hosted a Nutella party! It is delicious & the Nutella from Italy actually tastes better than the Nutella we can get here in the states...don't know why though. It is so GOOD, don't know why its not more popular in the US cause its everywhere in Italy.
