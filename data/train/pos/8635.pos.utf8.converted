My girlfriends and I were in the midst of a shopping day and got the munchies at TJ Maxx. I saw these chips and grabbed them on my way out the door.  We opened the bag in the car and we loved them so much they were gone in a matter of minutes.  They sent me back in to get another bag and of course we had bought the last one in the store. Hmmmph.  Glad to see I can get the from Amazon.  A perfect chip!
