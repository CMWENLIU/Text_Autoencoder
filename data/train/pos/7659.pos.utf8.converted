First, I have to admit that the taste of this powder takes some getting use to, but I think the results are worth it. I've definitely notices a boost in my libido, mood, and appetite. My sex drive has been off the charts after taking this supplement for little over a week. I haven't noticed an increase in energy, but I would recommend Maca for anyone looking to improve the function of their endocrine system.
