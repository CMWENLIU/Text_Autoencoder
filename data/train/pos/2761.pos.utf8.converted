I'm convinced that I am the world's biggest consumer of gummy bears.  I always have a bag of gummy bears with me wherever I go.  I eat gummy bears for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I even eat gummy bears in my dreams!<br /><br />Seriously though, I've had my share of gummy bears and Haribo Gold Bears are definitely the best.  They are juicy and chewy and PERFECT!<br /><br />If you are looking for some perfect gummy bears, go ahead and order these.<br /><br />Ok, I'm going to go spend some time with my gummy bears...
