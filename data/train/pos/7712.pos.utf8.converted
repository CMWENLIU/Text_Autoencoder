This cayenne pepper is GREAT!  This has real spice to it.  All the other cayenne peppers I've used have had sort of a dirty flavor with not much heat, but this one is clean and HOT.  You only have to use a little bit to get that kick in your food.  Which makes it great for seasoning and very economical.  I recommend this to anyone.
