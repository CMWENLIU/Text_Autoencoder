We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(
