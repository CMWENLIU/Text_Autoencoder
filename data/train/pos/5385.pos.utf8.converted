I never really realized how much gluten was in a 3.5 pound can. I now have gluten for life. Bought this to make wheat bread. It works as advertised and makes the wheat bread rise nicely. Since we have so much I decided to expand our horizons and make some seitan (sp?). That didn't go over very well with the family. I guess I'll stick with using it for bread. At two teaspoons of gluten per loaf of wheat bread, I won't need to buy any for a while.
