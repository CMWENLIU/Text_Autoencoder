Although I usually use bouillon, I was fortunate in getting an opportunity to use the "Better Than Bouillon" which the family had begun using in recipes...Its only negatives are that it is in a glass container which must be recycled and it must be refrigerated once opened..its price is similar to that of Bouillon. 4/12/06  abj
