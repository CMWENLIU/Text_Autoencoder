Everyone knows that Portuguese sardines are the best.<br /><br />Everyone, that is, except the sardines themselves, when they stray into Spanish territorial waters off the coast of Galacia, just north of Portugal.<br /><br />That's where these were nabbed. So while technically our conquistadores are Spanish, for all practical intents and purposes you can consider them Portuguese.<br /><br />Certainly, that's how they taste, and at a price significantly lower than you would pay for their cousins just across the border.<br /><br />Furthermore, these fish are presented in a decidedly upscale fashion. As we learn from the back of the carton, "Artisan fishing methods, old master cannery know-how and the highest quality ingredients produce a sardine that is moist, tender, and uncommonly flavorful".<br /><br />In addition, they are "hand packed" and "100 % natural".<br /><br />After all this my stomach's rumbling. Bring `em on!
