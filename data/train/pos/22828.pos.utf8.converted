I got a new dog this January and I had tried 5 different treats to no avail, cookies, 3 different bacon types, and a some meat type in a bone shape cookie.  He didn't care for any of them.  I love Nathan's hot dogs and when I saw this on my Walmart shelf for my dog, I knew I had to try it.  I was sold as soon as I read "human grade".  These treats aren't compromised with a bunch of weird fillers that really aren't good for our pets.  He loves these treats so much that I have been able to teach him 4 new tricks just by holding the bag in front of him. If you like having home deliveries, I recommend the Amazon subscription, it comes out to almost the same price as my neighborhood Walmart but I enjoy the convience of front door deliveries with Amazon.
