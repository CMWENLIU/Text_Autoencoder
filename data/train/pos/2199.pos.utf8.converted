This is one of my favorite beans available at Starbucks. It has the perfect taste on your palate and a wonderfully pleasing aroma. I freshly grind the beans every morning and prepare it in the french press. Great for morning rush of caffeine or an after dinner leisurely cup of joe selectively paired with a smooth, high % cocoa bar of dark chocolate .
