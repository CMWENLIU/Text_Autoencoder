I have loved tea ever since I was a little girl, and I can honestly say that Celestial Seasonings has been one of my favorite whimsical brands of teas supporting my habit of drinking this healthful and delicious brew. I don't know anyone who can resist the cozy boxes with cheery, charming artwork pleasing to the eye, all printed on 100% recycled cardboard, with the tea bags being large and very plain as their taste once dropped in the hot water is worth the bag looking the way it does while the cover art on the box really make this a better tea than some of the brand out there in their fancy boxes and shiny labels, that taste flat and bitter.<br /><br />Madagascar Vanilla Red is a caffeine free blend of Rooibos, Natural French Vanilla Flavor and Vanilla bean. When sugar or honey or even milk are added it tastes like the sweetest, almost chewy vanilla one can sink their teeth into whenever a sweet craving kicks in. I swear it reminds me of the Madagascar Vanilla I use in all my baking for the intense and heady sweet aroma and it tastes like a bakery treaty in a cup and since it's healthy, easy to find and inexpensive it makes me a very satisfied customer. If I drink it plain, no sugar no nothing it tastes like a delicate exotic tea with a breath of sweetness, and this is one of the very few teas I can drink plain, quite a feat in my eyes.<br /><br />I heartily recommend it for any tea fan, even if they don't think that Herbal/Caffeine type teas are their cup of tea, haha, this is better because its not decaf, its naturally caffeine free, omitting the artificial process and it simply makes me happy when I drink it.
