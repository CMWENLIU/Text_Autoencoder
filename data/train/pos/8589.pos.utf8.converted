Don't rely on that one star review.  If you don't want to taste the sea then don't eat SEAweed foods.  Seasnax is better than Sea's Gift brand in my opinion because they do not use canola oil.  Canola oil is not a healthy oil and the use of olive oil is sooo much better for you. I love the spicy flavor the most!
