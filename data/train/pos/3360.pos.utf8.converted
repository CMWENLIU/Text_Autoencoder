If you don't like BROWN RICE but want to add more fiber to your side dish of rice, this is the one. This rice mix is savory, fragrant and cooks up lightly cruncy and tender. It is utterly delicious. It makes a great pilaf and is good just plain. We even eat it for breakfast with a bit of honey and butter. And when you finish off the rice, you have a nice container for nuts or other dry ingredients for the pantry. This is a terrific blend of rice.
