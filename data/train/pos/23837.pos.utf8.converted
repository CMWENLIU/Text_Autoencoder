These are hard to find in your average grocery store especially at such a good price. If you have had the pleasure of a meal or appetizer with these caper berries, you are likely searching for them as I was. They are large, crisp and delicious just like the ones we have with our favorite restaurant's anti-pasta appetizer. A great find at a great price.
