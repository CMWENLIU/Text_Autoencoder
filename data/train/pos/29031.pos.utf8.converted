If you are looking for a healthier oil to cook with than corn or mixed vegetable oils, try this product. My husband read about the benefits of coconut oil in the book "Patient Heal Thyself" and in "The Bottom Line" publication a few years ago. Previously we have had to purchase this at health food stores, relying on their stock at the time. Now we can order it here and have it in a couple of days. The product itself is wonderful, and arrives in a plastic container, which is safer around the kitchen. As long as you keep it in a cool place it will keep a long time. The only thing I Don't fry with it is garlic. For some reason that combination is putrid, but onions, peppers, chicken, green beans, pork chops, are all delicious and the coconut adds a light, sweet flavor of its own.
