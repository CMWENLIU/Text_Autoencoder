My family loves Bisquick pancakes.  Most Saturday mornings I take one of these mixes, add an 8 oz bottle of water, mash and add a couple of ripe bananas and make the best pancakes you have ever tasted.<br /><br />The ripeness of the bananas directly effects the taste of the pancakes, they must be ripe.  We take ripe bananas, peel them, bag them and freeze them so that they will be ready for pancake day.  If there is banana juice in the bag be sure to pour it into the mix too.<br /><br />Try it, you'll probably love it.<br /><br />This mix makes enough pancakes for about three adults, maybe a little more.
