I am very into health and will research every product I consume until I am certain it's worthy.  I've tried 3 different organic matchas in the past and this is, by far, the best.<br /><br />This is a vibrant green color (very pretty color - especially when made)This is proof that young leaves were chosen and dried properly.  The brighter, the better.  Some matchas are dull green (dirty pea green color) - these are more of a food grade matcha (for baking, ice creams, etc.).  Food grade matchas have a dull taste as well. Ceremonial (drinking) tea should always be vibrant.  This is an excellent drinking tea.<br /><br />The packaging is the best I've seen.  Not only does it come in a sealed pop/top can, but once opened you will find your tea inside a sealed foiled bag. Impressive. A bit of a mess to empty the contents back into the can, but it makes for a very fresh tea.<br /><br />The taste of this tea is the cleanest I've tasty. Not at all bitter as some I've had. This is definitely the only matcha I will be ordering.<br /><br />From my research and own experience. I highly recommend keeping your matcha in the fridge to keep fresh.
