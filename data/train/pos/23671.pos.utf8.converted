I'm lazy. I've bought tons of green tea products over the years, but if I have to heat the water, mix the leaves (or bags), etc, wait for it to cool or pour over ice, I tend to flake and just reach for whatever ready-to-drink bottled or canned sort of beverage is handy, super-healthful or not.<br /><br />This solves my tea-sloth issues. Small foil packet that opens easily via a notch. Mix with water. Voila, a really nice cup of tea you can heat in the nuker if you like, or just go with it iced (or room temp) like I do.<br /><br />The tastes is very fresh, no bitterness (like I can get with making hot tea, cause I'm a tea idiot apparently). It mixes so well (no big clumps). Totally a quality product.<br /><br />I ordered three boxes the first time (August 12, 2008). I'm gonna order even more now, though I still have some left, just to have in stock in my pantry.<br /><br />Not only do I love this as a refreshing beverage (that can be punctuated with lime or lemon, or splashed with a healthful ounce or so of blueberry, cherry, acai, or pomegranate juice), but I started using it as my pre-workout caffeine punch. And know what: It works. Having this 35-40 minutes or so prior to my Pilates hour-long session makes me put in some extra effort so I'm wonderfully sore in the core the next day from the boost of energy.<br /><br />This is unsweetened (a plus), so you can sweeten it to your heart's delight, with honey or stevia or, if you're watching calories, Splenda or Equal. And, hey, yeah, sugar works, if you swing that sucrose way. And though I have a sweet tooth, I've been drinking this unsweetened. It really tastes so...greenly refreshing.<br /><br />Totally love this tea mix. I wish amazon carried it in their amazon prime catalog of products so I could get it with "free" 2 day shipping. Still, my experience with this supplier was great. No worries.<br /><br />Mir
