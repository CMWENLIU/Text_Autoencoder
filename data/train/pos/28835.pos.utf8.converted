I have a yorkie who is very picky with food but he goes crazy for this product and gulps it down in a few seconds...best part is his stool is tiny, firm and virtually odorless!  Finally a food I can feel good giving to him as it's minimally processed, certified pathogen free, contains probiotics and organic vegetables....all flavors are equally good and healthy.
