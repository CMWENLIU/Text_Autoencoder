Bottle Caps really take me back. Back to a kid in the 70's. Back to when candy bars were bigger, and only cost 9c at the local candy shop. When we had 4 different stores where we could go and gaze at all the variety of candy to spend our meager allowance on. If you are looking for nostalgia, try bottle caps. They really take you back to when there WERE bottle caps on the actual bottles!
