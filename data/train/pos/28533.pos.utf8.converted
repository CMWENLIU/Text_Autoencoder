Buying groceries from Amazon has 2 potential benefits: lower prices and access to items not locally available. This product excells in both areas.<br />It took me forever to track down manhattan clam chowder locally. The only product I found was Progresso ready-to-eat. You only got 19 ounces for $3. Since the Chincoteague is condensed you get far more soup per $.<br />As to taste, I compared the soups side by side. The Progresso had a bit more depth of flavor, but it wasn't coming from clams. Even though both soups were only heated until a simmer appeared at the edge of the pots, the clam meat in the Progressor was very chewy and not very abundant. The Chincoteague had plenty of clam meat which had very  good consistency. The broth was well flavored with hints of the ocean.<br />In my opinion, this is as good as canned clam chowder can get.
