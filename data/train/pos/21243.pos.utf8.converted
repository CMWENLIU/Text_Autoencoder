I try to keep one bar of this in the house, as it satisfies the most intense of chocolate craving without having to eat an entire cake/pan of brownies!<br />The blend of chocolate and lavender is truly euphoric, practically instantly-stress-relieving!  Do allow it to melt to fully experience the flavors of the lavender and blueberries.
