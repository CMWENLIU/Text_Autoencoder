Lipton still makes the best instant soup you can buy anywhere. Unfortunately a lot of local grocers including Wal Mart no longer stock this great soup in their aisles. I'm just glad I can still order this product that is currently being manufactured in Canada from Amazon.com. Please keep listing this product as long as Unilever keeps it on the market. I've enjoyed this product for well of 20 years and hopefully for many more years to come. I usually make a double batch since I like soup so much and it is good for the human body. I also add about a dozen or so Ritz crackers to drink up the excess broth.
