Eden black beans are delicious and healthful.  Eden foods beans are the best on the market because they contain no salt (add your own to taste) and they also contain kombu for digestion.  They have no off flavors or smells. (I find canned beans often have strange smells - but not these)<br /><br />These black beans are whole and are great for making hispanic dishes using whole beans. In a hurry, I eat them just out of the can, no heating or preparation required - though perhaps this is not for everyone!  They are also great for making your own refried beans, chili, southwestern salad, or other black bean dishes.<br /><br />These beans are the next best thing to cooking your own - maybe even better, since there's no work involved!
