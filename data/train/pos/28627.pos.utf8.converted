Funny how sugar is considered an anti-nutrient.  Yet, if it's in it's whole form this is not the case!  Whole sugar contains nutrients!  How about that?  Too bad we never hear about it.  Sure organic sugar cane tastes way better in beverages.  If you give it time, your taste will adjust.  This is expensive, but considering what it is, you get what you pay for. I signed up for the Subscribe & Save through Amazon & have it delivered once a month.  I use it to feed my water kefir & for whatever else I decide to replace my organic sugar cane with.<br /><br />Tastes strongly of molasses.  If you don't like molasses you have a problem!  Molasses is a by product of the sugar cane refining process - in-case you didn't know.  So it makes sense that this tastes of molasses.  Because it hasn't been removed from the cane.  This is truly pure unrefined whole cane sugar.  This is what sugar is supposed to taste like!<br /><br />By the way, don't expect the same results as refined sugar.  Besides the already mentioned taste difference, this will turn liquids a muddy/cloudy brownish color.  Nothing to worry about but it might be off putting if you are not used to it.<br /><br />Thank you Rapunzel for this wonderful organic sugar!
