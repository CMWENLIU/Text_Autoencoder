I love coconut water, but every time I try it in the States, there seems to be something missing. I have tried several other brands side by side, and there always seems to be something missing (or they taste like wet socks).<br /><br />SAMU is the only brand I have ever had that seems to embody the refreshing and smooth taste of coconut water brought directly from the plantation. It actually reminds me of drinking coconut water directly from the coconut at a Thai beach resort like Koh Samui - clean, refreshing, and invigorating.<br /><br />The tiniest bit of sweetness sets it so clearly above all other brands, I don't know how I could ever go back to drinking any other coconut water.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about SAMU is the fact it is in an aluminum can. Alot of other coconut waters you will see are in those cardboard-laminate boxes, which are next to impossible to recycle. By putting SAMU in a can, it not only has a familiar hand-feel, but I know I can easily recycle the can as well.<br /><br />Overall, I rate it 5 stars: an excellent product and well worth the money. I highly recommend it.
