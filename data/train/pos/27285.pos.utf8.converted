The folks in the United Kingdom drink more PG Tips tea than any other brand, and perhaps after you try it; it will be your #1 choice, too!  (By the way, the folks in Ireland drink more tea per person than in any other country.)<br /><br />PG Tips Tea and PG Tips Special Blend Tea is our home's standard tea.  There are a few specialty retailers in the USA that now offer the PG Tips Special Blend Tea and hopefully Amazon will do so soon.<br /><br />In the 1930s (the pre-digestive era in history) this tea was introduced by the name "Pre-Gest-Tee" suggesting the tea could be consumed before food was eaten, but it was the grocers who gave it the abbreviation of "PG" - and the company added "tips" (since the company uses only the best part of the tea plant, the two top leaves and bud of the tea plant to make the tea).<br /><br />Many black teas sold in the USA are graded the basic medium grade Orange Pekoe (generally the tea leaves below the top two and bud), which is one of the reasons PG Tips gets higher reviews than most other teas.  PG Tips also uses their pyramid tea bag that allows ample room for the tea to expand as it is infused.  Additionally, in my opinion, PG Tips blends only two blends, rather than blending a wide assortment, thus becoming really good at what they do.<br /><br />Here at Amazon PG Tips is priced at just over a nickel a tea bag (a good value for an imported product) when you order the 240 count boxes in a set of two, and even less expensive in the higher volumes.  PG Tips makes wonderful ice tea too, and that's good news since Americans drink about 80% of their tea as iced tea and only 20% as hot tea.  Worldwide more hot tea is consumed than iced tea, and worldwide tea is the most consumed beverage (next to water), while in the USA it is the sixth most consumed beverage (next to water).<br /><br />A very good question to ponder is "Why this is?"<br /><br />Drinking an adequate amount of tea daily is now being considered to be very good for one's health, and it is much more enjoyable to drink a really good cuppa (cup of tea), especially at the nominal cost of about a nickel a cup when compared to one of those gourmet coffee places who charge upwards of four to five dollars for a large cup of coffee.<br /><br />When we have a guest in our home we always offer them a PG Tips cuppa, and they always say they have never tasted a tea this good - thus, I rate it 5 stars for its quality and very nominal price!
