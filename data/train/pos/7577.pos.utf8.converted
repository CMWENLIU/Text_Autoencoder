This is a good amount of catnip, and looks fresh and green, but I wasn't totally surprised at how awesome it was or anything - it was just catnip.<br /><br />Only, I was keeping it in the bottom drawer of our desk and I had forgotten about it, since we still have other catnip. One day I noticed my cat was really enjoying his time under the desk, which is normally because there's a nice sunny spot under the drawers and he likes lounging in it. However, this time I heard him poking around back there, which was strange, but he's a strange cat, so I didn't really think much about it. Then at some point, I opened that drawer for something totally different (I had forgotten about the catnip) and found that somehow he had gotten his paw over the back edge of the drawer and OPENED THE BAG OF CATNIP. I guess he had gotten little bits in his paw and been satisfied with that. I was blown away. This is good stuff. Strange-Cat-Sam-approved.
