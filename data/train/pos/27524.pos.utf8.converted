Excellent milk alternative. We have been working to cut out cow's milk from our family diet. With 7 kids that can be oh so tricky. They ALL love this milk, though, and agree it tastes much better than the soy milk we usually get. Of course chocolate is the favorite (go figure) and the cute little panda sure doesn't hurt when it comes to encouraging this beverage! I am going to stick with this brand, no doubt!
