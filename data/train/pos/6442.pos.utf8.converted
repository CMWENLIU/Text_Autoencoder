This cat food has almost completely eliminated the daily throwing up that my cat was doing.  Why spend so much for pet food, you may ask? This is a healthier alternative for carnivores. Most cat foods are filled with grains, which are not very digestible for felines.  Cats are carnivores! they do not naturally eat grains such as rice, wheat, and the other fillers, found even in the expensive brands of dry pet foods. I like that this food is dry, does not smell fishy like wet foods do, and I can "free feed" my cat as we always have.
