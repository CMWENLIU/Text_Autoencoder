When I tasted my first Fiber One bar, the only thought running through my head was, "why on earth didn't I buy more of these?"  These bars taste better than any high fiber bar out there.  I had to read and re-read the nutritional information.  There are 9 grams of fiber in each bar.  Imagine eating something REALLY good and good for you.  I can't say that about too many food items.  But, I gladly recommend this product.  Every flavor has an outstanding taste.  Even my three year old loves them.  Need I say anything more?
