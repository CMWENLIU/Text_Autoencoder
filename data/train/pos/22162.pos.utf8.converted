Hojicha is a delicious every day tea. And the Mighty Leaf bags are especially nice because they're silken and won't impart any "paper" flavor into your brew. I hunted down this tea after suffering too many terrible decaf black teas. True, hojicha has a bit more caffeine than a decaf tea, but when I consider the flavor pay-off (nice subtle smokiness, not even a hint of bitterness) I can't really go back. Sometimes, I "decaffeinate" it myself by letting it steep for 45 seconds in hot water, tossing out the brew, and then drinking the second infusion. (From what I've read, the caffeine comes out in the initial steeping). I lose a little flavor when I do this, but it's still much tastier than any commercial decaf I've ever had.
