I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas.
