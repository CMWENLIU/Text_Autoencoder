The "Dynamic Duo," (a male Westie and a female Scotty), have been eating Blue Buffalo's Adult Weight Control Chicken and Brown Rice kibble for more than two years. Well, to be entirely honest, they eat equal parts of Blue Buffalo and Natural Ultramix, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots, and apples - and an occasional can of Halo or Evanger's. So why do we include the Blue Buffalo?<br /><br />First, because it is made from the best ingredients - if you were going to make the stuff yourself, besides chicken, you'd probably include grains like brown rice, barley, oats and rye, (no wheat, corn or soy), and vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and sweet potatatoes, not to mention a few extras like blueberries, cranberries and, (I swear), green tea extract.<br /><br />Second, because they actually like it. And if you've got a finicky dog, you know what I'm talkin' about. Our Scotty will eat almost anything, (delicacy prevents me from going into any detail on this point), but our Westie? This is a dog for whom every bite is a thoughtfully considered proposition. Should I eat this? Hmmmmmm? Maybe not. Perhaps I should move it from my bowl to the living room carpet and contemplate it? Ah.... It's Blue Buffalo. I'll eat it.<br /><br />We generally buy the 6 pound bag - that means that we buy more frequently than we would if we were buying the larger sizes - but it's easier to store and stays fresher.<br /><br />Many people are concerned about feeding their dogs "dry" food - and to some extent, I share that concern. But when it's a quality product like Blue Buffalo and is fed as part of a "menu" that includes other fresh and healthy "entrees," I think that it's an excellent addition to your dog's diet.<br /><br />[This is an up-date to my review: Economic times being what they are, something had to give - so a couple of months ago, we eliminated the Natural Ultramix from our terriers' diets. We also eliminated the canned foods, (my wife is convinced that even a small amount of canned food was contributing to our Scotty's tendency to put on a little extra weight). So we've been feeding them Blue Buffalo exclusively, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots and apples. This change has had no ill effects on their health or appearence - and they continue to love the stuff. I remain convinced that when it comes to kibble, Blue Buffalo is an outstanding product.]
