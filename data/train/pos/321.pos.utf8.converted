I use this in all my recipes calling for brown sugar.  As per the INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, use ONE-HALF the amount called for in the recipe. If the recipe states ONE CUP of brown sugar, you use ONLY ONE-HALF cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend. I am not a diabetic but I do have many family members who are and this is a great substitute for "real" brown sugar, even though it does contain part Splenda and part "real" brown sugar.
