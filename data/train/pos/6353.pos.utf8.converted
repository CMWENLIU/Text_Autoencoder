I have tried this several different ways and every way is so good well yummy and tasty. The first way I added it into my homemade salad dressing or better know as vinaigrette which was so so good hubby really loved it in there. Another way we tried it was putting some in the bottom of a skillet and frying burgers and steaks in it and the flavor it gave to these foods were perfect. I really love the smell of bacon jam plus the smell it puts through my house while cooking is great.
