This is the best tasting apple cider vinegar I have ever tried and I've tried quite a few brands but nothing compares to Bragg's cider vinegar. There is an almost 'malted' flavor with hints of sweet/tart apples and no 'bitter' aftertaste. Be sure to shake the bottle up each time before using [it will froth up a bit when you do] because that incorporates all the little sediments of the 'mother' that settle to the bottom.<br /><br />Yes, it's a bit 'spendy' but so worth it! I even add one tablespoon of Bragg's apple cider vinegar to my pitcher lemonade to give it an extra 'zing'.<br /><br />If you want an energy/immune-system super boost, mix one teaspoon raw apple cider vinegar with one tablespoon raw honey, [check out HoneyPacifica] for the best truly raw cold packed honey on earth] 1/2 teaspoon raw coconut oil [Aloha Nu is one of the best], 2 drops of propolis tincture, 1/2 teaspoon of fresh royal jelly and 2 tablespoons of good quality plain yogurt (my personal favorite is Mountain High brand yogurt).<br /><br />To your health!
