I first tried this unforgetable tea while visiting Ireland for the first time. I was hooked. I never went back to coffee again. It is mild without the usual after taste that you sometimes get with tea. Try it with whole milk for a most satisfying flavor. It is the best tea I have ever had. Since returning to the US I have looked for it everywhere and will definately be using amazon for my future purchases.
