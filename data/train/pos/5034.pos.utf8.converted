My husband is a huge fan of Indian food...  me, not so much.  The dishes in this variety pack are *YUM*!!!  After a long day, whip up a little jasmine rice, and heat a pack up.  Voila!  I quick, tasty meal for 2.  You will likely want a side dish, if you require a large portion.  I originally bought these on sale, but will purchase more, whether they are on sale or not.
