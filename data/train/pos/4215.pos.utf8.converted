I read the previous reviews and was pretty shocked at the great feedback people had for this honey. After going out on a limb and ordering this I decided to try it myself.<br /><br />First - the packaging. The plastic bottle itself is a bit cumbersome - sometimes I have give it an iron grip squeeze in order to get the honey out. It does really give off that "hometown raw" aesthetic though.<br /><br />Second - the consistency & color. My wife and I prefer raw honey and have tried various other brands (whole foods, farmers markets) and usually the consistency of the other brands is an extremely thick goo, which you have to spoon out. What's refreshing about this honey is how smooth it is. Another thing with the other brands of raw honey is the color. The other brands I've tried have a dark amber color (resembles apple butter almost), however, this honey although slightly darker than regular grocery store bought honey, it still has a fairly normal color. My guess for the lighter color is attributed to the raw purity of this kind of honey.<br /><br />Third - and lastly the taste. This is the primary reason why I give this honey five stars. Although as I mentioned the packaging is a bit cumbersome, I'd eat this honey if it came in a bowling ball. Well, maybe not, but you get the point. The taste is what matters. This honey is hands down the tastiest honey I've ever had in my entire life. It's sweet but not overbearing and no bitter aftertaste like other honeys I've tried. You MUST try this honey at least once in your life. It's refreshing to know that I no longer need to look anymore for great honey - I'm a customer for life.
