CARAMOO is a delicious caramel fudge candy that has the look of a caramel and the texture of a crumbly fudge. The milk and butter make them creamy and delicious. The caramels are made in small batches and wrapped in cute Vienna-style wrappers. The honey and the original flavors are both delicious but if you like a sweeter flavor, then you might like the honey caramels. I think I like the original caramels best. They remind me of a vanilla fudge I used to buy overseas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
