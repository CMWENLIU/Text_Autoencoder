Torani Sugar-Free syrups are some of the best in the business. This makes an excellent flavor addition to both smoothies and coffee and it tastes just like the full sugar versions. What makes it even easier to use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09XZG">Torani and Davinci syrup pump</a>. According to my favorite barista at Starbucks, a venti takes 5-6 squirts, although I think I normally use only a couple of squirts to obtain the perfect flavor for my smaller cups of coffee made at home. Amazon grocery currently sells 3 flavors of Torani Sugar Free syrups, Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Caramel, 25.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3), Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3), and this syrup. Since Torani currently makes 27 different Sugar Free flavors, it would be nice if through Amazon they would offer a combo pack of 4 flavors, or just make more flavors available on Amazon. I really enjoy this syrup and have tried other brands, but always come back to Torani. I was pleased to see this available as a auto-ship item at Amazon and will be buying many more bottles through the Subscribe & Save program.<br /><br />I would love to see Peppermint, Vanilla Bean, and Irish Cream flavors added. These also make excellent Italian sodas, and dozens of drink recipes can be found at the Torani web site.<br /><br />Update: I'm pleased to see that Amazon has added 3 new sugar free flavors:<br /><br />Torani Sugar Free Raspberry, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br />Torani Sugar Free Chocolate, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br />Torani Sugar Free Irish Cr&iquest;me, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br /><br />Great price, too! Better than my grocer.
