I am living in Panama, and one of the things I missed was my Cheez-its.  I finally went online and found that I could order them, I was thrilled.  My mail goes to a Miami address and then it is sent via air to Panama.  When I received them, they were fresh and because they were packed wo well none were crushed.  Thanks Amazon and Thanks Cheez-it.
