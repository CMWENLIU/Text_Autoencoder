If you like tuna in oil, you will enjoy this product. Excellent taste, appearance and texture. Keep in mind that not all 'tuna in oil' is in olive oil - this one is. It is sooooo good that many folks will not need to add mayonnaise, thereby saving calories. Free Prime shipping was enough to seal the deal, as this item is heavy. Shipping from Peapod would have cost almost as much as the tuna. Delivered Amazon cost was only about $1.00 per can. We supply lunch to our employess - even if each person eats two cans, this is a bargain compared to the local deli, which charges around $7.00 for a sandwich. All considered, this is a winner and we have reordered several times.
