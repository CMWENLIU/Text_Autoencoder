I priorly ordered the TERRO LIQUID ANTS KILLER, ants digged the liquid. The first time I used the liquid, they were gone for 2 days, then they were back, even more than before. Then I added the liquid dose, a lot more came. This time they were here for over 48 hours, it was like ants invation. So I poured the TERRO POWDER over to the eating-the-liquid-the-moment ants. They were running away, however every single one of them was touched with the powder. 10 minutes later, only few of them were moving, half hour later, none was left. I felt terrible to do so, but there's no choice left for me, only by looking at them I feel itchy, not to mention when the time they crawl onto my skin.<br /><br />I am not sure liquid TERRO really kills the queen, because ants were coming back with more numbers. However the power does kill them, instantly, and other insects too. The minute when all ants were dead, I noticed a spider came from nowhere tried to grab the food, it couldn't reach them because the powder was too toxic for its kind.
