This is one of the most popular of all  rice mixes. The best foolproof real(not parboiled ) rice mixes ever.  Try this  as a side dish with leg of lamb or with Mexican food. The company is Louisiana founded  and beloved by Louisiana natives. I send these to all my friends every Christmas. Try the Red Beans and rice or Black Beans and rice mixes also. Much better than Zatarin's  I use them myself often. a New Orleans native.
