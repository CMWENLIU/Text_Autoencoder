We've tried a lot of different catnips over the years... but Kong Catnip Spray is the best - by far!  We can take any toy, even one our cat no longer has (or even never had) an interest in ... and give it ONE spray of Kong Catnip and WHAAMM!!  Suddenly, he's playing with it like it's the best toy in the world!!  Tried it on a his scratching post... and for the next 20 minutes plus, he's rolling, flipping, scratching, jumping off it... pretty funny to watch!  Just a spray or two is all it takes... and it lasts for a while too!  I always felt a little frustrated when I'd go a buy a toy only to have my cat take little to no interest in it.  That's all changed thanks to Kongs spray on catnip.  Really glad we found this!!
