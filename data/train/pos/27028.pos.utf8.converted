I received this bonsai as a gift.  I was very wary at first, because I have killed numerous bonsai in the past, but this one was different.  Well established, it thrived even when I forgot to water it for a few days.  It has a healthy growth, a nice planter which comes with it, and a decorative rock.  I would definately recommend this bonsai for those who really want to try a bonsai but haven't had much luck in the past!
