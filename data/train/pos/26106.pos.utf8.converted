I've loved European soft drinks since being introduced to them in Sweden as a teenager--"sockerdricka," a banana-flavored carbonated beverage, was my favorite.  Far more variety than their American competitors--and less sweet!  For a buck a can you can't beat a Limonata with its foiled cover (so chic, lots of cachet conveyed to the consumer even before the first sparkly sip) and its crisp, just-sour-enough flavor.  Count me a subscriber of this one (if only American beverage-makers weren't so terrified of marketing anything that wasn't loaded up and down (the adrenaline pattern of the consumer's blood sugar counts) with dozens of teaspoons full of sugar (call it fructose, honey, sucrose, dextrose--it's still gratuitous, unhealthy, taste-neutral sugar!).<br /><br />This has quickly become my second favorite drink available from Amazon.  The first is Blenheim ginger ale.  (Don't even consider any other brand, regardless of its price or "exotic" origins.  It's all bland.)  Blenheim is the only ginger ale that will clean out your sinuses, ream out your internal plumbing and, as James Brown used to say, put pep in your step and gut in your strut.  Burn, baby, burn!  (Could just as well be Blenheim's motto.)
