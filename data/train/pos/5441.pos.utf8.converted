I add 2-3 tbls. of this to my grounds when I make cold brewed coffee and the results are WONDERFUL.  It adds body and richness to every batch, no matter what beans I am using it always turns out very smooth and dark.  I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NG922U">Bodum Bean Ice French Press 1-1/2 Litre Iced Coffeemaker, 51-Ounce, Black</a>, it is the easiest way I have tried to make a delicious cold brewed coffee concentrate, the addition of chicory has turned the flavor it up to 11!
