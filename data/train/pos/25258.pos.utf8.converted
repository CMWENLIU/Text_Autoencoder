One review said this tea tasted like dirt which, in all respect, tastes more like grass that has been in dirt.  As funny as that review was, Oolong tea is an acquired taste much like coffee or other teas.  Once you've acquired the taste, it's actually one of the better oolong teas I've tasted and probably one of the most genuine.  You get 100 bags for under $10; you can't beat that.
