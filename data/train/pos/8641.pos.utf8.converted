I am a cancer survivor, and I purchased the Hemp Oil for the high quality and incredible omega benefits of the product. The shipment was very quick and I love the taste. Sometimes I take a spoonful without mixing it into any food and it is very tasty. It has a nutty aftertaste, and is lighter than most oils in your cabinet.<br />I am already feeling the benefits as I have colon cancer, and the Hemp oil has helped regulate my system and kept my energy levels up.<br />Thanks again for a great product and great service.
