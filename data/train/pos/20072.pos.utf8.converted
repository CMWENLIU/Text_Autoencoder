These biscuits are really tasty.  They're more for adults than children because they're not too sweet. They stay crisp, have a good mouth feel, and are very satisfying.<br /><br />If you can find them at your grocer's, get them there.<br /><br />I bought the 7-pack option, and they arrived with two or three cookies on one or both ends of the packages crushed to dust.<br /><br />I'm not asking Amazon to replace them because I'm going to put the crushed biscuits in breakfast cereal, and we're going to eat them. They're quite good that way too. But I will suggest that Amazon take the fragility of these biscuits into account when shipping them in the future.
