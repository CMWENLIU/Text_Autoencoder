This is a great additive to my daughters formula.  It keeps her filled up more than formula alone.  The can is very handy, only wish they had included a scoop.  I just use the scoop from the formula can and it works great too.  This is much easier to measure and a lot less messy than the box rice and oatmeal cereals!
