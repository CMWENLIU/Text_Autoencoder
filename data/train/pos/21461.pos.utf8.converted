These moth traps really work.  I had a serious infestation of clothes moths in my apartment when I took my grandmother wool coat out of my closet and released a bunch of moths accidentally.  These few moths bred and then I had a moth problem. I didn't think I could get rid of them.  You have to give the product some time to work.  I set out 7 traps in my apartment.  I saw moths being caught little by little over a period of a few weeks.  I probably caught 60+ moths in these traps.  I think I finally have my apartment back under control with the help of these traps and extensive vacuuming and cleaning.
