Solid product at a very reasonable price.  Pound for pound cheaper here then other places and overall a good product.  Only downside of my experience was I ordered during the summer when it was 100+ degrees which is my own fault Jelly Belly's don't hold up in the heat very well.  I'll definitely be ordering again when it's a little cooler out.
