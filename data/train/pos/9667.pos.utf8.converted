This is by far the most delicious gluten free flour blend I've used.  It substitutes well into any gluten free recipes I currently use (not from Gluten Free Mama's cook book) and is fabulous!  I've used it also in recipes from her cook book successfully as well.  From now on, this is the gluten free flour blend I will buy, no question!
