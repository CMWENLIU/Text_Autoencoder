Let me start by saying that I'm a lifelong tea drinker and I love tea, and I've tried all sorts.<br /><br />I started out years ago with Lipton's before all these different designer brands and flavors came along. Black Ceylon tea was what they called it.<br />Then when all these designer brands and flavors came out I tried all the exotic flavors I could get my hands on, mango, vanilla, raspberry, chocoloate, peach, whatever. I tried different brands, I tried expensive teas, inexpensive teas, organic teas, the standards such as Earl Grey, Darjeeling, Assam, etc.<br /><br />Finally, I came back to this tea. It was like travelling around the world in a circle and coming back to the start. I love this tea because I've found all that other stuff, apple, peach, raspberry, just detracts from the true flavor of tea. This tea is just pure tea, without any other distracting flavors and that's what I love about it. A stong tea, a robust tea with full strong flavor, for a man (or a manly woman).<br /><br />Words can hardly describe my feelings about it. When I make it just right, the right temperature, the right strength, I can just feel the tea molecules infuse every part of my body. So far, I have not been able to find another unadulterated tea with such a full and strong flavor. I love it. 10/10. I imagine this is what the British conquered their empire on. I can imagine some British explorer brewing this tea in a battered tin pan before conquering some mountain top, or the the Artic, or some jungle or facing a mutiny. Cheers, old bean.
