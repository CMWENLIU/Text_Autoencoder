I am a hot chocolate connoisseur and have tried many different cocoa powders and drink mixes.  This has to be one of the best I have ever tried.  The second you open the bag, the most intense chocolate scent wafts up to you nose. Try that with regular cocoa.  I take the powder, add a few of my own spices and then I enjoy it for breakfast all winter.  I haven't ever made cookies or anything else with it, but I imagine it would be just as delicious in those recipes as well.
