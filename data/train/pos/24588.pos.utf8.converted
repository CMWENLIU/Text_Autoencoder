I don't mind having lots of bugs in my yard as long as they stay out of my house and don't bite me.  I enjoyed a peaceful co-existence with the ants until they decided to break all the rules.  They attacked me while I was mowing the lawn, and invaded the house and helped themselves to the dog's food.<br /><br />This meant war.<br /><br />After doing my research, I decided to buy the Terro Ant Dust.  It was the cheapest, and had high marks from my fellow Amazonians.<br /><br />This stuff works.  I sprinkled it on the dirt ant hill, and watched the ants go crazy and die.  To speed things up, I poked their colony with a stick.  This made hundreds of them pile out of their ant hill and walk all over the white powder.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Terro Ant Dust works.  It doesn't look like the ants eat the stuff.  But, die they do.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Every single time I applied the Ant Dust, I took care to not get it on my hands, eyes, or to breath it in.  Still, I felt sick after each application.  Next time, I guess I'll wear a haz-mat suit so that I avoid all contact with the Ant Dust.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 24 hours, most of the ant hills are without activity.  BUT - new ones have popped up.  Huge ones.  These ants are active.  I hit the new ant hills with more Terro.  Next step - Spray the entire yard with indiscriminate bug killer.  A man's got to do what a man's got to do!
