i fell hopelessly in love with this style of cookie while participating in study abroad in 2000 (again in 2002). while there are a few companies to which americans have access in the states, La Mere Poulard is the original and best!<br /><br />these are rich and not too sweet. individual packages of 4 cookies per package ensure freshness so that one can savor just a couple at a time--i forget the calorie/point value, but 2 will be satisfying, and will not devastate a diet.<br /><br />the tin is adorable, too!
