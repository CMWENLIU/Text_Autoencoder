I love this combination. The ginger's spice (fairly gentle, in my opinion) is a great counterpoint to the slightly sweet marzipan and dark chocolate.<br />Niederegger produces a truly excellent, and consistent, product (see my review of their plain marzipan in dark chocolate on chocolate ratings dot wordpress dot com).<br />Amazon's price is far less expensive than anyone else's and my bars arrived in pristine, fresh condition.
