You are what you eat, this also applies to your pets too. If you are a healthy eating individual, do the same for your pet and give them healthy food that are good for their body.<br /><br />There are many choices of dog food out there, and about half of them are as healthy as your local fast food restaurants. Grocery brands (what you find at __mart and supermarkets) are the aforementioned. Castor & Pullux is NOT one of them.<br /><br />C & P makes great dog food that a dog's unique body chemistry needs and will actually be absorbed, not crappy filler ingredients that is just gonna slide through and out the other end. Dogs need protein and water mainly. They have little to no use for corn, starch, rice, or random blended animal parts and the likes. With C & P, you know exactly what your dog is eating. This puppy mix even comes with real fruit bits!<br /><br />Just remember, fillers will only make them full but is not what they need. The more fillers they eat, the more comes out the other end. You get what you pay for.
