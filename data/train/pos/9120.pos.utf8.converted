If you're from Brooklyn there's really only one chocolate syrup for your milk or egg creams. Fox's is THE cult favorite dating way back maybe even before trolley cars and the original TROLLEY DODGERS! No bona fide Brooklynite or ex-patriate, such as myself, would ever consider a substitute. Hershey be da----!This is the real deal; accept no substitutes. My only regret is the shipping cost from this purveyor. It's cheaper to get on a train and visit the nearest NYC Gristede's; and you get a day in Manhattan to boot! 5 stars plus for this wonderful, unbeatable product. Zero stars for the not to be believed cost to get it home. Demand it of your local super market manager.
