Discovered Heinz Salad Cream on trips to England.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Heinz does not market if here in the US so it's necessary to go to English sources to obtain it.<br /><br />I'm also unable to find the "Pack of 6" offering on Amazon on my most recent search.  This was a very good deal.  Hopefully, it will return.
