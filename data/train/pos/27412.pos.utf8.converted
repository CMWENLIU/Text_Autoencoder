My wife and I are dark chocolate snobs (Scharffenberger and Organic Trader Joe's Dark are our favorites) and so when we went low-carb we began hunting for alternatives.  Everything we tried was sorely lacking, either with an odd taste, bad texture, or causing serious stomach upset.  But, we tried this one out and lo and behold, it's excellent!  If I was going full carb, I'd still take the Scharffen, but for low-carb or sugar free this one is oustanding.  On top of that, their customer service was proactive, excellent, notifying me of a slight delay in shipping and actually refunding my shipping costs!  You don't find good service everyday and this was GREAT service.  <p>Great product plus great service = winning combination for me!  Try them for yourself.
