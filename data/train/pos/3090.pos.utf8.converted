Like nearly everyone I know, I grew up with the neon red cherries. They had a distinctive taste, and maybe the distinctive taste made me think they were good. Try these, and you'll understand what the other reviewers are raving about. Incredible, densely-flavored and delicious. They're expensive enough you'll probably save them for your special cocktails, but you'll be glad you did.
