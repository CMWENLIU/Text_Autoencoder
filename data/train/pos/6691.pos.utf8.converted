I grew up eating these yummy chocolate malt balls in Hong Kong.  The chocolate is rich and creamy while the honeycomb malt center is so crisp!  I love them!  I tried the Whoppers and they were no comparison to the Maltesers.  Too bad they're so hard to find and sold out here on Amazon.  My local Cost Plus World Market carries them.
