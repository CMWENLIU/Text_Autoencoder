The variety, not the brand, was recommended by a friend. Five stars is given with the caveat that other brands were not tried for comparison. The Choice Organic Russian Caravan blend seems to be the only such blend easily available in tea bags.  The unit cost of the product is an excellent value here on amazon, compared to other sellers' offers.<br /><br />The tea is a bit more delicate than one might expect, based on description. Steeping five minutes is recommended, for a full-flavored experience.  The flavor is delightful -- a good black tea, but with a distinctive smoky quality.
