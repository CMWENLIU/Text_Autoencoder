Having tried tried many brands and varieties of Yerba Mate over the last 3 years, I have developed a strong liking for the Guayaki brand after 2 years of enjoyment of their product. They are a quality brand producing fine Mate.<br /><br />I don't find the Guayaki Mate quite as strong as other brands, having less of that Mate kick, however I do find the smooth, rich flavours very satisfying. I have several different ones in my kitchen right now - they're good for 2 to 3 cups a day. Their Mate drinks are similar to the Aviva brand in the range of flavours, however Guayaki is clearly a superior brand. Between Taragui and Guayaki brand Mate, I am hooked on this drink for its uplifting, positive effect on my health and well-being.<br /><br />I am a native of South Africa, the home of Rooibos (Red Bush) tea - and while I enjoy it, this Mate has a more profound effect. And tastes a darn sight better than Green Tea.<br /><br />The appeal of this and the other flavours will depend on your own taste preferences, however I enjoy them all and recommend the product whole-heartedly. It's got a permanent place in my kitchen, my work bag and car, with me wherever I happen to be.
