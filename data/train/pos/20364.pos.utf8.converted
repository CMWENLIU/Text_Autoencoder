I like the chocolate, but then I also liked dark chocolate to start with.<br /><br />I had a taste for 85% sweetened with sugar, but after enjoying the stevia 98%, I think that 85% tastes a little too bitter. This stevia-sweetened recipe tastes like 70% sugar-sweetened dark chocolate to me. Much less bitter than the really dark sugar-sweetened stuff. It must be because stevia is so much sweeter than sugar when compared by weight.
