We have been adding edible flowers and other vegetables to The Collard Patch lately.  The rabbits ate our eggplants, beets, tomatoes, carrots, sunflowers, and okra!  They skipped over the collards, garlic, and romaine.  All that work!  It seems the rabbits could at least wait  until the crops are grown so they would have more to eat.<br /><br />Then we discovered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A0VOD2">Deer Off DF32RTU Deer, Rabbit and Squirrel Repellent Ready-to-Use Spray 32 oz.</a> and stopped those boy and girl rabbits from eating.  Now they can spend their time elsewhere.  Maybe if they don't get so fat, they'll enjoy some of the other things that rabbits are known for, such as teasing dogs.<br /><br />So far this product is working.  It uses the flavors of rotten eggs, capsaicin, and garlic to repulse the rabbits, who are  . . . believe it or not . . . picky eaters.  This concoction is supposed to be weather-resistant.  So far with our frequent rains in Louisiana, it is still working.  When we get new leaves, we add more spray.  It  is supposed to last three months, and we are supposed to stop using it two weeks before harvesting.
