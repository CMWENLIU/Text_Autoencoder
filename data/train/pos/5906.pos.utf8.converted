Roland Kosher anchovies in olive oil from Spain are a great buy of a really high quality fish product. The reviewer who said they are high in Sodium apparently hasn't used processed anchovies before- these are no more saltier then other canned anchovies in oil and much less then anchovies packed in salt. I highly recommend this product to anyone using anchovies for cooling, in salads, making dressings, etc. If you are concerned about sodium to the point where you cannot use a product naturally high inn sodium and additionally processed with salt, learn about that product before making comments that are derogatory and untrue in nature.
