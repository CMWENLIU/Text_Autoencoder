I buy Xylitol chewing gum for my grandson, in particular, who had had extremely severe ECC at one time in his young life.<br /><br />When he was only 18 mos old he was diagnosed with ECC, at that time the ped dentist had him scheduled for $3400 worth of dental work - everything from extractions, to root canals, to straight fillings like 16 of them. But fortunately for him they could not arrange for an immediate operating room for the surgery... PTL!!<br /><br />Through research I discovered Xylitol, and as time progressed discovered Xyloburst with more Xylitol in them! Then just recently when buying this jar of the gum I found out I could buy it more economically in larger doses, 500 pieces.<br /><br />The ECC? My grandson is cavity-free now [he'll be five soon], did he have to have any dental work done? Yes, one extraction [he fell broke the root and it caused a draining abscess] and one filling [a very large cavity], cost? Under $200.<br /><br />We always carry Xyloburst chewing gum as well as one other flavor of Xylitol chewing gum everywhere with us now. Xyloburst has more Xylitol in it and it really tastes GREAT!<br /><br />Worth every penny spent on it! A great buy!
