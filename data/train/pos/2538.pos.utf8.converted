I purchased these for my grandsons, but had to try one for myself.  They are delicious!  The texture is like a soft textured oatmeal cookie.  I loved the taste of the fruit, too.  It was not too sweet, almost like homemade preserves. The size is just right for a child's snack.  They have whole grains and 3g. of fiber, a healthy addition to anyone's diet.<br />ps.  the kids loved them too!
