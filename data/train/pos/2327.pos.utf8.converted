This is by far my favorite of the all the raw foods bars I've tried. The coconut-cashew dominate most of the flavor and texture of this delicious, rich and unbelievably nutritious bar. I had to keep reminding myself that it's organic, vegan, and raw, because it sure doesn't taste like what you'd expect something in that class of food to taste like! Don't pass on this bar whether you're into raw food or not. Superb.
