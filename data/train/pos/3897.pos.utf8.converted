This mix makes the most excellent cupcakes/cakes, you would never know it was gluten free.  It's very easy to make but one strange thing happens when you are beating it. The batter seems to climb up the beaters, but it doesn't matter, the end product is a wonderful treat for people who can't eat gluten-typically cake mixes are very dry, however, this one seems to be perfect!  My hats off to Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Vanilla Cake Mix!!!
