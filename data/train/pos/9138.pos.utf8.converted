This is really good coffee. I bought it a couple of weeks ago at Walmart because it was the least<br />expensive K-cups they had. I loved it! When I went back to get some more they didn't have any. I checked Walmart.com<br />and ordered it for $9.98 for 18 ct. Checked Amazon just to be sure I was getting the best deal and couldn't beleive<br />they want twice the Walmart price! Seriously?
