I received the dry starter in the mail and immediately fed it. Within a day I had a bubbling mixture. Baked with it a few days later and was impressed by the taste but it was not very strong. So I kept feeding it for a couple weeks and now it has blossomed into a wonderfully strong culture. The aroma makes me smile every time I feed it. I live in South Florida and there must be really great little critters floating around to help it grow. Thanks for the great starter but now I think my 'pet' has graduated into the big league.
