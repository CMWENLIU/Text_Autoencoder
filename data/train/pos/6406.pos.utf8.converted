I tried this tea after reading some favourable reviews and I really enjoy it.  It's similar in strength to the English Breakfast, but I think it's a bit sweeter in taste.  I think it has a nice, rich scent to it.  Usually I drink the English Breakfast tea, but some mornings I'll drink this one when I want something smoother, less bold.
