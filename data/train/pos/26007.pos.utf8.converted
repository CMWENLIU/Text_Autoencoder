I've been eating Nong Shim Neoguri for about 20 years... I was introduced to it in high school by a Korean student, and I've been slurping them ever since.  Back in those days, a case of 20 at the local Korean market was $7.  Now, they're $20+ on Amazon.  Still worth it though.<br /><br />There are really three things going on in the package:<br /><br />- The noodles: The heavy buckwheat Udon-style noodles have superior flavor and texture compared to ramen and other instant noodles.<br /><br />- The soup base: Very salty, very (red) peppery.  Not too complex, but tasty, and if you want complex from a bag of instant noodles, you might need to adjust your expectations.<br /><br />- The seaweed: I don't like seaweed, but I like this.  I don't know why that is.<br /><br />Because I like spicy, I typically use much less water than called for (I use about 1-2 cups depending on how brave I'm feeling) to produce almost more of a sauce that coats the noodles than a soup.  In my opinion, these noodles are at their best if you can eat them with a fork and still have minimal broth left over when you're done.  You may want to bring Tums to that party though.<br /><br />These are, in my opinion, as good as it gets in the instant noodle market.  I.e. they are five-star instant noodles, not five-star food.<br /><br />Downsides: The sodium and saturated fat are really high, if I still ate these like I did when I was 18, I'd be dead by now (37).  Also, merely reading the list of chemicals involved out loud may cause an allergic reaction in organic eaters.  I harbor a dim suspicion that ingesting enough would varnish one's insides in a way that may be of interest to anyone interested in bringing mummification back into fashion.
