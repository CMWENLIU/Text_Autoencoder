My 10-year-old daughter and I both love these.  Depends on your personal tastes, I guess, but we both really like the moist, chewy texture and they're really sweet without any added sugars or other sweeteners.  I can see where they would be great for baking, but we buy them for snacking -- I like the fact that because they don't need to be refrigerated after opening, I can take them on long car drives for a healthy snack (and one that doesn't make a mess and leave crumbs in the car!)  A serving of these along with a bottle of water makes a perfect mid-morning snack - quick, easy, healthy, and filling.
