I am very happy with these crackers and cookies. Why? Because they where shipped right which means no broke cookies,,,they are fresh and taste great and the big excitement is the price. Let me explain that. If you go to the store and pick up and buy one of thes crackers or cookies one at time you will pay between .60 and .75 cents but this product cost .33 cents a piece and you always have some to eat when you want a snack. Great price and great product.
