This is a high quality pure cocoa powder, it's rich and has a great taste. It is sugar free, which for me is a great plus. I have used it on a variety of recipes, including chocolate bread (machine made), cocoa shake and chocolate and oat biscuits. Now I can make my recipes using the great Xylitol which is the **ONLY** sweetener that does not feed Candida Albicans (yeast). Delicious! Highly recommended.
