I didn't buy this from Amazon, but I did buy a six pack of it, put it in the fridge, and have a cold can today - and let me just say it's wonderful. Its sweet like "the original red can" we all compare cola to, but not heavy or overly syrupy. It has a great cola taste, and no aftertaste that I can detect. I like it a lot and will be buying it again. Its nice to have a "naturally" sweetened cola that won't add to my waist line - a nice, smooth, light, sweet treat.
