I got a sample of these in the mail and I tried them one night after ravaging my pantry for something crunchy and tasty. Boy, did these hit the spot they are so good they have now replaced my love for cheetos and jax. They are crunchy and cheesy and OMG they are just unbelieveably good and good for me too. What more could a girl ask for?
