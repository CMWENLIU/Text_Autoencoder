I use the Natural Brown, 2 cup Melitta filter paper and a Melitta cone to make the best coffee this side of anywhere. Of course, it is necessary to use the best coffee, and that can only be found at Peet's. The coffee must be ground very fine, and since I like strong coffee, I use two scoops to make one cup.<br />OK, here's the rest of the drill: First insert the filter paper in the cone, position it over the cup and fill with hot water. The hot water rinses the filter and preheats the cup. Next, add two scoops (or one and a half if you like your coffee weaker)and lightly tamp it down to pack it but do not tear the filter. Pour the hot water out of the cup. Replace the filter and coffee over the cup and add a small amount of hot water, wetting the grounds. DO NOT USE BOILING HOT WATER! Boiling hot water dissolves acids and makes the coffee bitter. The water temperature should be about 180 to 190 Fahrenheidt. After the first bit of water had drained into the cup, add more water.<br />Even if you have been used to adding sugar to your coffee, please try it without. There will be no bitterness and in fact, you can make the coffee stronger than you ever imagined and there'll be no bitterness.<br />You are welcome!
