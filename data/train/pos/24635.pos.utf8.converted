We got Linda's Lollies at our office a few weeks ago. They are simply the best! The tree comes with more than 50 flavors, my favorite is German Chocolate cake. There's Key Lemon Pie, Peanut Butter, Cherry Cheesecake, you name it. The flavors are for real. They last for over an hour. I thought that was an exaggeration, but it is not. A perfect and ORIGINAL gift for a family, a loved one or a client. I got a tree of lollipops at my desk... everyone comes in and talks here more often now. I wonder why. :o) They are great.
