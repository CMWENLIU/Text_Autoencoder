I think I may have tried just about every major brand of pod coffee available.  Some are good, some just OK, and some can only be described as bilge water.  I've wanted to try the Melitta One brand for quite some time, but they never seemed to be in stock.  When I finally was able, I gave Buzzworthy a try, and I have to say, I'm not disappointed in the least.  This particular roast is strong, aromatic, heady and a real pleasure to the palate.  Being a fuller pod, it fits much better in the double pod holder - don't forget to wet the bottom of the pod before pushing it firmly into the holder.  This seems to do the trick, with consistent, dark, rich cups of coffee being rewarded each time.  I feel this coffee is at least as high a quality and flavorful as Wolfgang Puck's strongest brews, so give Melitta a try if you like Puck's product (I do). Buzzworthy is a much more cost effective cuppa Joe without sacrificing anything in the taste or caffeine department.
