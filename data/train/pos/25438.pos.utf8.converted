I discovered Cattlemen's Tangy Gold on a turkey sandwich wrap at WaWa (gas/convenience store).  For years I searched for it on grocery shelves and finally saw the waitlist here at Amazon.  You don't need much to get a load of flavor.  I use it instead of other condiments on sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, pork chops, ribs, chicken, and meatloaf. Lately, I've been adding it to prepared salads like tuna, egg (also deviled eggs), potato, and pasta.  It adds a unique flavor and beautiful color. I hope Amazon continues to offer this product.  The 6-pack means I can share with friends (or not).
