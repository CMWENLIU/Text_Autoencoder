A lot of foods make me tired or make me feel 'off' after I eat them.  This is the exception--I feel good after eating buckwheat groats both right after and hours later, so I suspect it's good for me. :)  It tastes mildly nutty. I eat it with bananas and other fruit mixed in.  If you're looking for a healthy new cereal to try, give this one a shot.
