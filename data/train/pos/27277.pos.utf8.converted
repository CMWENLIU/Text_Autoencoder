I fell in love with these delicious little hard candies after a trip to a small Japanese import store. If you've ever enjoyed tres leches cake, eaten a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk straight from the can, or delighted in the taste of dulce de leche, then you will likely adore these candies as well.<br /><br />About the size of a small marble, these cream-colored hard candies melt slowly into a rich, sweet milky flavor that manages to avoid being too cloyingly sweet. If you're the kind to crunch your candies, these will offer a pleasant resistance and crack/crunch satisfyingly under your teeth. The flavor is superb; I prefer to savor mine slowly, sometimes enjoying one along with a rich cup of dark coffee to enhance the sweet milky taste.<br /><br />Unlike any candy flavor found in traditional US markets, Japanese milk candies are a special treat. These Mikakuto Tokuno UHA 8.2 milk candies are the cream of the crop--the best of the best!
