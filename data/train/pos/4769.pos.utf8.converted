Being a vegetarian for 19 years, I could barely remember what beef stronganoff tastes likes.  This is one of the best tasting, high protein and easiest meals I've ever made!  Since I use one package of the Morningstar Farms crumbles, there is no need to cook the meat first.  Just add the pasta, flavoring mix, water, "meat" crumbles, and milk (I use skim) all together!  Enjoy!
