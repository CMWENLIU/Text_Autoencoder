A few months ago I was searching Amazon for sugar-free products when I came across this one. My husband grew up with raw, unfiltered honey often given as gifts from his grandparents. Two years ago he was diagnosed as being diabetic making regular honey off limits. Strangely enough four months ago I developed a severe allergy to honey (I didn't know that my grandfather was allergic to it as well), and promptly broke out in hives.<br /><br />When I first saw the imitation honey I simply didn't believe it, I started researching it waiting to find the catch. Being vegetarian/borderline vegan I was concerned about odd animal byproducts that creep into the strangest things. I emailed the company discovered that Maltitol Syrup (the main ingredient) is malted from corn. I have used other sweeteners, mainly Splenda, and have been frustrated with the fact that it doesn't act like sugar, leaving a pronounced aftertaste in most foods. Upon further research I found that I could buy an individual bottle of this brand of imitation honey at our local Walgreens (I wasn't going to buy a case of something and find out that it was unusable or tasted horrible). (Update: Walgreens no longer sells this product, either locally where I am or on their website there is no listing for it any more.)<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that it's about half as sweet as honey (a plus in my opinion) but the texture is the same. It's relatively easy to get used to, especially if you haven't had real honey in some time. I have to admit that the first shock I had was when we made pigs in a blanket with veggie hot dogs. I couldn't believe what I saw when pulling them off the pan, the imitation honey had crystallized when it was baked! This is the first sugar-free sweeter I have found that mimics what sugar does, and often makes a LARGE difference in baked goods. The only thing it doesn't do that sugar can is brown cookies and such.<br /><br />I have made whole wheat bread and sugar-free peanut butter cookies with this, Hubby said that the cookies were JUST like the 'real' ones, and even my non-diabetic brother said that even he couldn't tell the difference (he's very picky about his food) and half of the flour was even whole wheat!<br /><br />So what's the best part? Where we get it locally it costs 2 for $5 and standard honey costs about $4.50 for a single bottle of the same size. And buying it in bulk from Amazon (with the super shipper savings) saves me the time and gas money as well!<br /><br />As for David S. Robbins' comment:<br /><br />Yes it is Sugar free (does not contain sugar) and if a diabetic is being responsible and monitoring their food intake as they should, there is no reason to avoid this brand. For the peanut butter cookies I made there was less than 3g carbs per cookie from the imitation honey. Maltitol Syrup is often listed in the ingredients of the Murray's cookies, one of our favorite (but pricey) brands. As with anything, use in moderation because how you use it is just as much of a factor of how much you use.<br /><br />I checked on the Carb Smart website to look at the product you recommended and it may have a significantly reduced carb amount, but not only is it more expensive that even regular honey, there is "natural honey flavor" listed in the ingredients making it prohibitive to me because of my allergies.
