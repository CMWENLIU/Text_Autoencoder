My friend gave me Jamaican Curry for a gift, but I couldn't find another one, so I ordered this one. This is perfect with chicken and potatoes. I'm sure it will work for other meals, but I'm not the most creative or adventurous in the kitchen. Though it says "hot," I did not find it so.<br /><br />Because my husband and son "hate curry," I've been calling this "Jamaican pepper," just to get them to eat my baked potatoes. I don't know how long I'll be able to get away with it. Maybe by the time they catch me in my lies, they will be converts.<br /><br />Great buy for the price and spice.
