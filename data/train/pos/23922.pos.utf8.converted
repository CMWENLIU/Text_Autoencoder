I was a little trepidatious drinking anything black, just because it's hard to wrap my mind around the idea that it would taste good, but it was great!  I love all the benefits I get from drinking it, and to be honest it feels pretty cool to drink something that looks so mysterious. People at the gym all do double takes, but inevitably I get lots of people asking what it is.  I am hooked now, and it costs less then the smartwater I used to drink, plus it comes with so much more.  It's just fun!
