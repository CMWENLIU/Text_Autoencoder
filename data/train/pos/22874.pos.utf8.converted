I had received my venus fly traps a few days ago and couldn't review immediately after I got them because I had to go to a camp with my family. When I opened the box, I had received 4 venus fly traps instead of 3! They were all healthy and 1 of them was pretty big. I was emailed before I had received the vft and on the day I did. I recommend this seller and will be sure to order more from them in the future. I will upload a photo later and update this review(:
