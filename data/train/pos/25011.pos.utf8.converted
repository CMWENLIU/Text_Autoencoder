I have been using this product mostly in bread and pancakes for a while and it works well. I like that the shelf life is much longer than what is stated on the package. Also, it is convenient to add the powder to the flour and then I add more or less water to the batter depending on desired thickness. Another nice thing about using buttermilk in pancakes, rather than milk, is that I can then use just baking soda rather than baking powder (due to the acidity in the buttermilk). Oh, and my shipment was delivered without incident.
