We've used 8'oclock since Consumers Report named it #1.  We buy the ground version, and brew with a Mr Coffee, just routine.<br /><br />Some months ago we decided on more exotic coffee.  Bought a French Press and a whistling pot, and a grinder, and tried numerous brands of fancy coffees.<br /><br />We set up a "coffee log" to keep track of all the various coffees and the details of the brew (amount, time of brew, degree of grind, etc),<br /><br />My son has a several thousand dollar machine which makes all kinds of coffee, espressos, and so on, and he is quite the expert in knowing about all the coffees out there, so we had good guidance.<br /><br />The results of all this experimentation?  We use 8'oclock ground, 4 measures to 5 cups of filtered water (important!), normal brew in Mr Coffee.  There is nothing that can beat this for strength, flavor, after-taste, and convenience.<br /><br />And you can't beat the price if you have Amazon ship 4 bags a month, automatically.<br /><br />There is really no other choice than 8'oclock.<br /><br />Dan
