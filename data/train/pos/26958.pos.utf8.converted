I ordered the chocolate last time, and this time opted for the strawbery banana. Ordered it and got it within 2 days, and it arrived solid as a rock frozennnnn. They must have packed it with a ton of dry ice because I had to let one of the pints sit out for at least 20 minutes before I could eat it. As for the taste, really good. It reminded me of an italian gelato, it was really creamy. Really surprised me for being so low calorie and fat free to taste as good as it did.
