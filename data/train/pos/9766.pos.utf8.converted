I've always had problems pumping enough milk from the very beginning.  I went from pumping around 3 ounces at work to 4 or even (sometimes) 5 ounces.  I've always aimed to get 3 pumps of 4 ounces each and I was always coming up way short.  Now, I have enough to give my son extra milk each day.<br /><br />I can tell that I get more milk after I've had some tea verses when I've had very little tea.  I have more milk at noon with the tea, than in the morning after hardly any tea.  I have more milk later in the week after 3 days of tea, than on Monday morning after a weekend of no tea.<br /><br />I usually have to have 3 to 5 cups of tea a day.  You do get used to the taste.  The only side effects I have noticed is that it makes me thirsty (more than likely from producing more milk), it gives me hot flashes, and it makes my son's toots really smelly.  :)
