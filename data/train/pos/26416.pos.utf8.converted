This is a very good choice for canned tuna.  The taste is excellent.  The texture is far superior to typical "supermarket" chunk light canned tuna  brands (have you noticed in recent years they seem like a can of sawdust instead of chunks of tuna?).  While it isn't quite as "moist" as tuna packed in oil, it is far more "moist" than tuna packed in water.  There is some liquid in the can (but far less than in cheaper brands or water packed tuna), but the liquid is literally just tuna juices, like a tuna broth - no added water or oils are added.  I don't even drain the juice off, I simply mix it back in while flaking the tuna; the juicy broth is reabsorbed.  All the omega-3 fatty acids are retained this way - why discard all that goodness down the drain?Wild Planet wild skipjack light tuna consists of larger and firm filet chunks, yet easily flakes with a fork.<br /><br />I could buy this very same tuna at a local store, but at much higher per can cost.  I prefer the convenience and lower cost of case buying via Amazon it's always ready for an easy and nutritious meal or snack my 5th grader can prepare himself or when I need multiple cans to make tuna casserole, tuna skillet pie or loaf, tuna patties, or tuna fritters for the family.  When I get down to the third can, I reorder for fast free Prime delivery to my door.  Saves time, effort, and money.<br /><br />As far as I've been able to determine (subject to change if I learn otherwise), if one is buying canned tuna, this is a good choice for sustainability (better catch methods) and lower mercury (smaller tuna species).  The can lining is BPA-free, too.
