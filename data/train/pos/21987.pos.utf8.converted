At Whole Foods they sell a rice salad which I really like but it's $11 a pound !! so I decided to make it myself. That is how I became familiar with Lundberg Farms. This blend or Countrywild will do. Simply cook the rice as directed then stir in 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and 1/4 cup of golden raisins after removing the rice from the heat. Leave it covered for 10 minutes. It's delicious.
