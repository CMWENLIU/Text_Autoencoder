I was skeptical when I received my Orange Blossom honey and noticed how clean it was for being raw and unfiltered. Most raw and unfiltered honey is creamy tan/brown so, I gave the company a call. I spoke with John and he was just the most helpful person and he explained their filtration process was very minimal (which was what I need) and yes indeed, the honey IS raw and has all the goodness of raw honey, without all the waxy material and other things that could get into honey during the collection/pouring process.<br /><br />But the taste- Oh, the taste is magnificent! It is probably the best honey I ever tasted and goes GREAT in brewed cinnamon tea. It has a real light smooth flavor (not "bitey" like some honeys). And with the squeezable bottle- The only thing better would be letting the honey drip right off the comb into your jar, it's that easy to squeeze!  You can't go wrong with this honey!
