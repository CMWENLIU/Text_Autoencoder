Okay, fine, grits are (is?) not for everyone.<br /><br />It takes time to cook them, including some pamper time.  Stirring frequently is de rigeur.<br /><br />When they're laid on the plate, next to eggs and a couple strips of bacon, or some sausage, and a nice Southern biscuit... oh, Gawd, take meh now!<br /><br />These are good grits, and if you have no patience for this type of food, or no taste for it, pass on by.<br /><br />If you like grits, it gets no better than this.<br /><br />In fact, one may cook these grits, and toward the end of the cook cycle throw in some eggs.<br /><br />Num.
