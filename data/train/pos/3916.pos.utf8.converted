Works like a dream.  This and Guar Gum are the only thickeners I use. This gives my lotions a nice, spreadable quality that makes my lotions feel moist with out being wet or greasy.  Be careful, if you use too much it will clump and leave a slimy feel.  Excellent product.  "Xanthan Gum! WOW!"  Anyone get that reference? :)~
