This sourdough starter is probably the best thing I've ever ordered on the internet.  I'm not a novice baker, but had thought that sourdough would be too long, too messy, and end up like my first sourdough loaf (when I made my own starter), hard as stone and sour as vinegar.  What a surprise!  I followed the very clear and well-written instructions and voila!  Two loaves of incredible bread.  We love it!  Now we don't buy bread at the grocery any more.  At $5.00 a loaf, for the healthy nutty kind, it's far below the quality of what I can now make in my own kitchen, and I know exactly what goes into it.<br />  I have discovered that the kind of flour does make a difference.  The first dozen or so loaves I made were a mix of King Arthur whole wheat and Gold Medal white.  Then I bought a bag of King Arthur unbleached white whole wheat flour and found that the dough did not behave or rise nearly as well as with all whole wheat or a mix with regular white flour. I can't find any of the more exotic flours in our town but plan to order some to experiment with.  My variation on the basic recipe was to add chopped nuts, raisins, cinnamon and sugar.  These ingredients did better when I kneaded them in, rather than add them during the sponge stage.<br />  Do try this starter.  It's really spunky stuff, and so much fun to work with!
