I had my skepticism, I start with that because if you like what you already drink what could an aerator do to it?  Well it does enough for me to keep this little tool out and nearby my good alcohol.  I did the old side-by-side non aerated to aerated single shot taste test.  For the really cheap clear alcohol all I can say it does is make it have less of a burn while drinking and actually smooths out the after taste to a nice fade off.  As for higher end, scotch in my case, I tried a 12 year single malt & a 17 year old single malt.  Starting with the 17 year old scotch, this stuff is smooth and great to begin with, the side-by-side test concluded with the aerated scotch being much more floral/aromatic, the after taste was MUCH more enjoyable as it seemed to melt into a buttery feeling and just faded off into bliss.<br />The 12 year old scotch, it's good on the rocks and a splash of water.  With the aerator it turned a 12 year old scotch into a very close 15/16 year old scotch.  All the little notes of flavor came to live, I won't way it is perfect but a cheaper bottle of scotch in my cabinet just payed for this little aerator.  All the harshness and lingering after taste of the 12 year old scotch, just melted away.  Again not on the same level as the 17 year old but pretty darn close.  I can put the max of 2 full jiggers, or more :), and know that what comes out will be a nice drink all around.<br />For the $$, I'd suggest you give this a shot (or 2) if you like to enjoy a fine liquor.  I know I will defiantly be keeping this at close hand when making my drink, or drinks for others.  I'm very tempted to by a few for some good friends and family to spread the enjoyment.  The stopper and release button are NOT mechanical!  An ingenious and fool proof design of two opposing magnets creates the opening effect while the weight of the magnet closed the stopper.  Truly is machine washable and pretty durable.
