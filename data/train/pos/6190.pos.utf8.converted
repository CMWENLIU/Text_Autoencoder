I've been doing the weight watchers program for about 6 months now and  have lost over 40 pounds.  Every morning I have good old fashioned peanut butter and jam with this great product.  Love it!!!<br />I keep ordering it over and over.  Its so nice to have peanut butter again without all the fat and calories.<br />This is good stuff.<br />Just a note, it does have to be refrigerated after opening.
