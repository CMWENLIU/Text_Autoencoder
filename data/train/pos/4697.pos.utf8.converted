Update: 3-9-12<br /><br />Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of Whisper's attack.  It's hard to wrap my mind around that with an objective perspective.  He's going to get steamed salmon filet to celebrate, and I will celebrate by trying to continue to spread the word about this wonderful tea!<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there is a bulk package available through amazon.com that makes 14 gallons for $70.00.  The bulk essiac came yesterday.  It is in four packets of ingredients, with 2lb burdock root, 1lb sheep sorrel, 4oz slippery elm and one ounce Turkish rhubarb root.  Those are the ingredients in both my books on making it yourself.  The Flora product also includes kelp,blessed thistle and red clover, none of which other than red clover are mentioned in either book that I have read, although they suggest adding a bit of bloodroot for hard cancers.<br /><br />I should be able to accurately measure out portions to brew whatever amount I like at a time.  I'm probably going to try for two quart batches and see how long that carries Spirit and me.  Whisper will remain on the Flora product. I can be pretty scientific about the preparation, but I'm going to quote an Ojibwah medicine man from "Essiac, A Native Herbal Cancer Remedy" by Cynthia Olson.<br /><br />"I use a big handful of chopped, dried burdock root (My hands are kind of big.  This weighs about 3 ounces.).  Then I use a big handful of sheep sorel. This weighs about 1 ounce.  Then I use big pieces of dried rhubarb root, amounting to about 1/2 ounce (I use bige pieces so the laxative effect is not boiled away).  Then I add a wad of slippery elm (inside bark) about the size of a golf ball.  This won't move most scales (about 1/18 of an ounce).  This makes about one week's supply, so boil in one gallon of water, then let it soak overnight, strain it in a one gallon apple juice jar and store in your fridge.  Drink one 8 ounce cup twice a day.  More if you feel like it.<br /><br />Don't dillute it.  That some whimpy white man's health food store thinking.  It tastes kind of thick and slippery.  If you heat it, do it in a small saucepan on a burner.  Don't ever use a microwave or it will be useless.  By the way, when you drink it, pray that your body will get back in harmony with The Great Spirit."<br /><br />I think this may be the best way for me to prepare it, although I will probably see what my particular hand measurements amount to.  Also, it looks as if everything in the packets is pretty well powdered, so it may force me into weight measurements.  I like the medicine man's philosophy.<br /><br />Also, since for spirit and me, it is more for purification than "cure" (knock on wood!), we will probably take a couple of ounces per day, each...we'll see what the results are and adust it.  I'll keep you posted.<br /><br />Six-month portraits of Whisper will follow!<br /><br />Update: 1-31-12  I've added two more photos of Whisper, taken this evening.  I don't have much to add, other than the fact that his blood-work is normal, and I continue to give him daily doses of Essiac tea.  I will always do anything to keep Whisper and Spirit in my life, as long as theirs have quality.  I can ask for no more the joy they give me daily!<br /><br />Update:  !2-4-11  A picture is worth 1,000 words, and if you look at the photos I just uploaded, you will see two sweet critters who are the pictures of health!!!<br /><br />Update:  10-26-11  Whisper continues to thrive!  I have not seen him act so playfully for a couple of years, at least.  He is happy, accessible and loving.  His appetite is very good.  He threw up once the week before last, which was scary.  The vomit was dark brown and the consistency of espresso coffee.  Although it was unnerving, he seemed fine afterward.  It was a single incident, and may have been part of the process of his body purifying itself.<br /><br />Spirit has not needed Rimadyl and continues to be extremely playful.  I have been taking a couple of ounces per day a couple of days a week, and even at low-dose, I feel more energetic.<br /><br />Tonight I added photos of the brewing process.  It isn't the simplest thing in the world, but it takes about fifteen minutes of your actual attention.  Remember, the Drs at the emergency hospital told me Whisper had only days...or weeks, at best before he would die.  When he came home, I had almost no hope.  Yesterday, I received my second box of tea.  We haven't consumed all of the first.  I've given a portion of it to friends who also have animals with serious illness.<br /><br />We live in a toxic world, and Big Medicine will try to separate us from our money by nuking us with toxic chemicals and procedures while draining our money if we let them.  There are viable alternatives.<br /><br />Essiac Tea is one of the most potent, but there is also colloidal silver as an antibiotic that is gentle, effective and works over and over, unlike prescription products.  Olive leaf extract also fights many infections safely, and for UTIs, try Usnea and Uva Ursi tincture.  Just those few remedies, with the recent addition of the essiac tea, have kept me disease-free for years.  Don't forget to eat healthy food, never smoke, and if you drink, do so moderately.  Exercise daily, drink water, and thank the earth for all of the tools we have to keep healthy naturally.<br /><br />I will update this review as the treatment progresses.  So far, so much better than I had hoped!<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />On September 10th, 2011, my 12-year old cat, Whisper suddenly became near death.  I had seen him about 4:00 and he seemed fine.  At 6:30 I went to find him to give him his supper and I found him in the bathroom with his belly inflated to the size of a volleyball, a look of horror on his face, and screeming weakly.  I rushed him to the local animal emergency hospital, and by the time I got him there he was almost gone.  They rushed him to their ER, relieved the pressure and got him on multiple IVs.  The next day, they did extensive tests and determined that he has aggressive lymphoma.<br /><br />I was devastated.  I had lost his sister, Shadow, in June to a different attack, apparently from the same cause.  The vet who came to euthanize her said she thought that a large lymph gland in her abdomen had ruptured and caused a huge infection which was untreatable.<br /><br />In Whisper's case, they told me that with chemo, he might have weeks, and without it, he probably had days.  They managed to get him stable enough to take home with steroids and a special compounded prescription to restore function to his bowels, but the prognosis was grim.<br /><br />A friend of mine who had a cat who was diagnosed with a hard-tumor cancer, given two months to live and when put on essiac tea, lived 18 months and passed peacefully of heart failure told me about this brand and recommended I try it.<br /><br />I ordered it, and by the time it arrived, although he was still alive, he had become anorexic, lethargic, and I really didn't think it would do any good.  He also had caught an upper respiratory infection in the hospital.  I gave him his first four doses with an irrigating syringe, and he started eating again, coming out socially and began taking it with juice from canned salmon.<br /><br />Now, just over a month since he was released and three weeks into the tea protocol, he takes two doses with salmon juice and he and my dog, Spirit, who I found out at the same time had a mass on his rectum, both get it in one of their water dishes to drink during the day.<br /><br />Whisper has gotten back to his old sweet, loving, playful personality, has a great appetite, and plays like a kitten, running to me like a puppy!  Spirit has responded to the point that I can't locate the mass.  I've been able to take him off Rimadyl.  He was starting to have soreness after hikes and play. He can travel up the stairs with no problem, jump into the back seat of our SUV, and doesn't have the risk of upset stomach he had with Rimadyl.<br /><br />This is amazing stuff!  If I ever develop cancer, I will use it first, and ignore chemo and radiation therapies.  Until now, I had simply believed when cancer was diagnosed, it was going to get you someday, somehow...sooner or later.<br /><br />With essiac tea, I believe we have an amazing weapon, which, if it doesn't outright cure it, works better than anything I have ever seen with anyone or any animal diagnosed with cancer and from reports I have read may actually cure soft cancers such as lymphoma.<br /><br />I don't know how advanced Whisper's is, but I have seen pretty much miraculous changes in him over the shortest of times.  I will update this review as we continue using the tea, but in three short weeks, I have come from feeling despair and huge grief to believing he may be with me for a very long time!  I bond to my animals almost as much as my daughter, and I am still not over Shadow's passing.  If I had lost Whisper, I don't know what would have happened to me emotionally or spiritually.<br /><br />Over the last fifteen years I have lost nearly everyone of importance in my life except my daughter, and I am saturated with the pain of loss.<br /><br />Essiac tea has already bought me more time than I expected to have with Whisper and the fact that he has become so vital again in such a short time gives me hope that we will be together for a long time to come!<br /><br />I will update this review as I watch Whisper's progress, but right now this may be the best $25.00 I ever spent!  It cost me almost $3,000.00 to find out what he had and stabilize him.  If I had known about this when Shadow passed, I would have started him on it prophylactically.  If you or a loved one are suffering from any form of cancer, please try this.  It's a bit of a project to brew, but worth every penney and every ounce of effort!
