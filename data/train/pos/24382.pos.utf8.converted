I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product.  This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it.  The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules.  For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes).  That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'.  Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years.  I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it).<br /><br />This is actually a good starter size box.  For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe:<br /><br />3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker.<br />1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume<br />1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc)<br />Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso<br /><br />Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.  This is the 'kitchen sink' soup of Japan, meaning just about anything might land in there though the items are normally pre-cooked leftover bits.
