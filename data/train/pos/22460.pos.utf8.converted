The Vegetable Variety Pack provides an opportunity to find out what your baby likes.<br /><br />We have twin 7-month olds and their favorite is the sweet potato followed by the carrot jars.  They love those.  They like the winter squash.  We could not get either of them to eat the peas with brown rice despite numerous attempts.<br /><br />They like the brown rice cereal we give them though, which we get from the same brand, Earth's Best. They really dislike the peas and will not eat that one.<br /><br />You can get this variety pack at the subscription price, which when considering free shipping is fair enough.<br /><br />You can also get any of these flavor types individually in packs of 12 for the same price and with the same subscription arrangement.  You can even get lentils with brown rice under the same terms, so scroll and see all the types of jars they have.  Therefore, once you know what your baby likes and will eat, you'll know which subscriptions, if any, to sign up for.<br /><br />For us it makes sense to go with subscriptions since we're buying for 2 babies.
