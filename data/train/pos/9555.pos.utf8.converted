Just received this in the mail from Amazon (actually, it was sent directly from retailer CarbSmart).  Simply put, Heinz's reduced sugar & reduced carb ketchup tastes just like regular Heinz ketchup, making me wonder why Heinz doesn't make all its ketchup this way.  Anyway, this controlled-carb enthusiast is now regularly enjoying ketchup on his (alas, still mostly bunless) burger patties again; just using mustard was getting a little tiring.  While some low-carb versions of previously favorite foods take some getting used to, this one doesn't, so don't hesitate to order this product.  The price isn't all that bad, either.
