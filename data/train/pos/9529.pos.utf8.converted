Just a note to my existing review below. There was a piece of day old Rosemary Bread on the counter.  I remembered so many people saying this tastes good on bread so I decided to try it.  I admit I stood my the garbage pail because I was expecting to throw the piece of bread with coconut oil spread on it away.  I love this stuff but didn't think I'd go so far as to eat it straight out of the jar.  Wow.  It had a nice smooth buttery taste.  Ate it all.  By the way, Subscribe and Save is the way to go.  Doing it for a year now.  Very satisified with the service.<br /><br />Besides the cooking benefits of coconut oil I've discovered other benefits that make this a must have in my house.  For more years than I can remember I had a wart on one of my fingers.  It would come and go but finally got to the point that when it flaired up it would split, bleed, and get infected.  It was getting very hard to keep under control so had decided that I would finally have to go to a specialist and have it removed.  The last time I had an episode with it I decided to try one last thing...coconut oil. I had read coconut oil had anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties.  Within 2 days the infection had started to clear up.  In less than 10 days the wart had shrunk to practically nothing.  It's been months now.  I use coconut oil on my hands every day...several times a day and haven't had a single new flair up.  After dealing with this for more than 15 years, I can barely feel where the wart was. I've used coconut oil on burns, cold sores, and callused feet (smooth as can be now).  It's also wonderful for keeping my gray hair very soft and manageable.  I had read an article about "oil pulling" and tryed it with coconut oil.  I won't go into that here.  Just go to Bing or EHow and check it out.  It has really improved my oral health.  The articles I read suggested oil pulling with sesame oil but I used coconut oil because of it's anti-bacterial qualities.  This is a product I wouldn't be without now.
