This is my go-to item when it is getting late and I just need a little something to keep me from going to bed hungry.<br /><br />Rice is one of the most digestible foods that exists.  It is "clean-burning" and light and it will not tax your digestive system like protein will.<br /><br />The seaweed adds much-needed minerals to the typical American diet.  A lot of our topsoil is eroded, so it is wise to incorporate sea vegetables into your regimen.<br /><br />I always make sure to have a supply of these crackers on hand.
