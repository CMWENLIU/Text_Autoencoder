This popcorn is a very refreshing change from either the dry "healthy" popcorn, or the over soaked "movie butter" popcorn.  The pepper is very nice, and can give you a nice burn by the time you're done with the bag (this is a good thing).<br /><br />At first I didn't like the idea of mini bags, but it turns out they are really the perfect serving size for an afternoon snack at work.
