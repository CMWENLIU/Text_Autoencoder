I love this stuff. It mixes very good instantly. It tastes healthy and eases hunger. I take it in the morning for a quick boost that really does last till noon when I then mix it up again to drink with lunch. I have a peace of mind knowing I have my required veggies and fruits. I have saved $9.95 by ordering on line vs buying at Whole Foods stores. This product is great.
