I have tried close to 20 different kinds of cat foods over the last 4 years for my now 4 year old cat. This stuff is hands down the best I have ever used. All natural, he loves it. Keeps his coat soft and the low calorie really does work. After feeding him crap food full of fillers (pedigree, purina, etc) I switched to this about a year ago and it has been a nice slow and steady drop in weight for the cat. He absolutly loves this stuff, he is ussually standing at the bowl waiting for me in the morning all excited! Now that he has thinned down I will be transitioning to the indoor cat food.<br /><br />The best part is you can save a few bucks on amazon or if you need it in a pinch Petco always has it, but its ussually a few bucks more.
