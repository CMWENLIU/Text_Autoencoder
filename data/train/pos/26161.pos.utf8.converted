After losing two full belt holes of girth around my middle in only 2 weeks after following the Wheat Belly diet  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609611543">Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health</a> ) I decided to give up wheat flour entirely, and have had some trouble finding a suitable flour for baking.<br /><br />I originally used chana dal flour (also known as "gram flour," "garbanzo bean flour," or "chick pea flour". This flour, made from chickpeas, is available at any Indian grocery or here on Amazon under one of those names).  I continued to lose weight by using chana dal flour but it has a somewhat bitter taste.<br /><br />I then tried the Chebe line of flours ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ACNWY8">Chebe Bread All-Purpose Mix, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)</a>  ) which is manioc (tapioca) flour.  Very good, highly recommended, but the dough gets very chewy.<br /><br />I then tried cooking with just this coconut flour, in total disregard of the package instructions, which recommends not using this flour on its own but instead substituting a quarter of your regular flour with this.  Big mistake to ignore the package directions.  It wouldn't stick together and soaked up a huge amount of water.  Total disaster.<br /><br />I'm now doing as the package recommends and I genuinely love this flour.  It's totally delicious and I wish I could use it on its own, but it's just not realistic.  I'm now using a coconut flour-Chebe blend, with occasional coconut flour-chana dal flour days.  And I keep losing weight without any other changes to my diet.
