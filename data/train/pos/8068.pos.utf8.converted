You will always find these in Chinatown because Chinese people and Filipino people love these, and why not?  So buttery is the toffee!  The little nutty covering feels funny on your tongue and I think they just put it there to keep the toffee from being sticky as it does not contribute much to the overall flavor.  These are not the deformed ones that they sell cheap--each one is beautiful and perfectly-formed.  Buy a can for yourself and any Chinese or Filipino friends you have, and even for your girlfriend for Valentine's--the pink tin practically SHOUTS "Happy Valentines Day, I love you like a little toffee candy!!!!!"
