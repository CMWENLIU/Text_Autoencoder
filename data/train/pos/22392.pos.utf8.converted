We keep this in stock at our house, and make iced tea with it three gallons at a time.  It takes 15 bags to make three gallons, so this bulk packaging is excellent.  The tea tastes great, and the flavoring is subtle.  Unlike some other flavored teas, the tea is still the predominant flavor here.  I definitely suggest giving this tea a shot.
