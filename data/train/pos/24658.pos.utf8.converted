I tasted millet a long time ago and didn't like it.  However, upon adopting two pet mice, the care manual recommended that it be a part of their diet, alternating with tiny pasta and barley.  I chose this particular brand because it is organic, and I wanted to provide them with natural nutrients as much as possible.  I had absolutely no intention of making it a part of my own diet, or even tasting it.  It simply didn't interest me.<br /><br />But as a curious homo sapien, when filling their tiny bowls with this offering, I found myself tasting a small spoonful myself, thinking it's flavor would send me to my toothbrush to refreshen my mouth.  I have to confess that, after serving the mice their portion, I ate the entire leftover amount and wished I had cooked even more.<br /><br />It is light and fluffy and some millet I know has a grainier texture.  So the liking of it depends on one's taste.  It is very close to the texture of Lundberg California Brown Rice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CEQ8X">Rice, Brown, Short Grain, Organic, 25# Bulk</a>, although lighter in substance.  The flavor is slightly sweet and nutty.  After cooking for 30 minutes, and fluffed up with a fork, it is irresistable.  Even my mice eat an amazing amount of it considering their tiny size.  There is no such thing as leftovers!<br /><br />The recipe on the package is interesting.  It is titled "Millet with Sweet Corn & Gomasio."  I had no idea what Gomasio was; however, a search engine informed me it is a dry condiment, similar to furikake [a condiment of roasted tan and black sesame seed, green nori flakes, and dried pickled red shiso (beefsteak) leaves], made from unhulled sesame seeds and salt.  It is sold on the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />I decided to temporarily bypass the gomasio and just heat up a little frozen sweet corn on stovetop, adding it to my portion of the millet at the end of cooking (as corn isn't good for mice).  Because of its lightness, it is a perfect compliment to the millet; someday when I'm feeling brave, I may even try the gomasio.<br /><br />Millet is also extremely healthy (the package says it has a complete essential amino acid profile).  So one is getting that added benefit as well.  It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has become a welcome constant staple in my home.
