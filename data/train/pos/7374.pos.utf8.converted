I have updated this mixed review due to the currently outrageous high shipping does NOT justify this product's value. Although This is the best gluten free sour dough bread I have sampled thus far it is much too expensive to pay upwards to $30 for 3 loaves.  I have shipped baked goods to military family priority mail for a flat rate of under ten bucks in the past.<br />Company states they will reduce shipping charges in the future but that doesn't help me or others currently eager for this product.<br /><br />As for the quality/consistency of this bread, It is fluffy compared to ther bakeries and has not molded after 10 days.  It toasts well and easily makes grilled sandwiches delicious.  The nutritional content is as follows :  1 slice is 140 calories, no saturated or trans fats, total fat 2 grams.  Cholesterol 20 mg, sodium 190 mg, total carb ( for one huge slice ) is 29 grams, fiber 1 gram , sugars 1 gram , protein 2 grams.  This has definetly a great sour dough flavor and is not gritty like other gluten free baked goods from other bakeries..I only wish the shipping costs were less with this and all other gluten free baked goods.
