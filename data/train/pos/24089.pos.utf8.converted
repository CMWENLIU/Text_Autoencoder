Vegetarian Sloppy Joes have always been a challenge for me. Many a time I've combined veggie grounds with BBQ sauce, only to find myself with a sickeningly sweet, and often inedible, concoction. My vegetarian Sloppy Joes have been so bad they'd drive Moby to ribeye steaks and Orlando Bloom to cheeseburgers. Then.... I found the Fantastic Foods Sloppy Joe mix.<br /><br />Fantastic Foods' Sloppy Joe mix is FOOLPROOF. It's incredibly simple--all you need is water, oil, and tomato paste. It's an incredibly versatile mix as well, as the recipe on the box shows (the variation has diced tomatoes,diced onions, brown sugar,chili powder) The result is delicious. It goes great with potato chips and pickles. It's a wonderful substitute for those going meatless for financial or social reasons. It'll please the carnivore,the vegetarian,and the vegan alike. These Sloppy Joes are NEAT!
