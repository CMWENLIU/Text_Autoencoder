These noodles are the best low carb noodles I have ever eaten.  Everytime my  grocery store get a shipment, I go and buy at least a couple of bags.  They cook in minutes and they absorb the flavor of whatever you add them to.  I made chicken alfredo,and tuna noodle casserole. Everything I have tried with these, has been a hit.  I even use them for non low carbers and they can't tell the difference.  Try for yourself.  They are absolutely wonderful.
