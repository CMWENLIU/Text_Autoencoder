I lived in England for a short time and was introduced to PG Tips there.  Since returning to the states, I can't stand American tea.  It's like drinking hot brown dirty water!  PG Tips is rich and satisfying, a cup of comfort.  You immediately see the difference when you pour the hot water over the bag.  The color is dark and the essence is intoxicating.  I have it with milk and sugar and it puts me in a relaxed and warm state of mind.  I can never go back to that other tea!  Believe me, there is a vast and improved difference you will appreciate to the fullest.  A most satisfying cup of tea.
