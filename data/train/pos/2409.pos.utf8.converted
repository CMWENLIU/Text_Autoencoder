I purchased this to send to my daughter at university as a pick me up.  We had visited a tourist town during the summer where they made their own taffy and sold it.  She really had a good time there.  When she was having a rough finals week I got on line and found this to send to her.  She loved it!!! She said it was so good.  I told her to share with her room mates and her sister who is there also.  She had a hard time doing that because she said it was so good she wanted it all for herself.  I am thinking of sending her more for next finals week =)
