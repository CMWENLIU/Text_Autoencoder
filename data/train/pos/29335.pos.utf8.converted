i buy hot sauces for my friends to try i like them as well this stuff is the reason a little bit goes a long way was coined as a phrase when ni got the bottle i did the finger test where as you put your fing over the bottle and shake it that was a grave error on my behalf i have never had something that could cure cancer before but this stuff may be the answer i dont have or never had cancer but this stuff is so hot that my friend who would drink hot sauce couldnt handle it he was asking for bread and milk and what ever else i had to take the burn away so read the label and believe it
