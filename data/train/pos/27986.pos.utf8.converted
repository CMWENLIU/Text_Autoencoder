This is my favorite k-cup and I have tried many of them.  I like strong coffee and use the smallest cup size.  Midnight Magic makes a perfect strong, rich and flavorful cup of coffee.  Not bitter.  Very tasty and it holds up to half & half.  I have a cup every night after dinner for "dessert".  It also makes a great iced coffee since it holds it's flavor and does not taste watered down.  Love it.
