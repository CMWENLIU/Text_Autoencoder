I'll let these crackers speak for themselves (they're the best if you like rice crackers - as far as I can tell, these particular crackers are the ideal platform for high quality cheddar).  Needless to say, this is a great deal - two bucks a box with free shipping.  Can't go wrong here, since I recently saw (and yes, bought) these same crackers at the local grocery store for nearly four bucks.  Buy some, but make sure you leave some for me.
