My cat's vet strongly recommended a wet food diet because she's pretty chubby. (4 pounds overweight.) He promised that the weight would just fall off. He wasn't kidding. After two weeks she has lost a whole pound.<br /><br />Per my cat's vet, the feeding instructions on the can aren't quite right. He said that a cat should weigh 10 pounds or less, so one can per day should be enough. Half a can in the morning and half at night seems to work pretty well.
