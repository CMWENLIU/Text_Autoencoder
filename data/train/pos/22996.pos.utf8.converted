Three months of inhalers I recieved in May, since I have been drinking the tea I only used the inhalers three times (was doing yard work and allergies got to me).  It is legal in the States I checked, I would strongly urged anyone that wants to try the tea to do so it works so well for me, my wife and I are asolutely amazed.  My symtoms of asthma is all but gone like I said my inhalers are in storage.
