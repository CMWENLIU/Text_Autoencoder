My brother and I grew up during the 70's, and I thought it would be fun to send this to him for a housewarming gift  I didn't get a chance to see the item myself (he lives in another state), but here's what he said in his thank you email:  "It really cracked me up and was delicious. They really nailed it with the retro contents, right down to the fake cigs with the pink tips. The wax lips really brought back memories, especially when inserted. It was the first package received at the new address and I was like "what the heck is this?", and then started laughing upon opening. Good call."
