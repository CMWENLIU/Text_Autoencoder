Yes, my cat loves this stuff. That's besides the point. Really, this is not meant to be cat food. I put this on my rice, my ramen, my tofu, etc. and I eat it. This can also be boiled to make a fish stock, although it doesn't really give a super strong stock unless you use a lot of the flakes. The flakes are very meaty, taste mild and very good. For those of you who don't like fish, this isn't for you. However, you probably have had bonito fish stock if you've had miso soup before. I love this stuff. I set aside a small batch for my cat because he loves it too and it's a great treat for both of us that is not salty, preservative laden, or fatty.<br /><br />tl;dr: Great taste, can be used as a healthy alternative to cat treats, but it's really meant for human consumption.
