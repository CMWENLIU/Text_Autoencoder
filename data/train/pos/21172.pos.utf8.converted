I live in Japan, a land of excellent green tea but when it comes to brown (the Japanese call it red) I prefer British. The only British teas sold here in Japan are Twingings and Liptons. I don't like the fussy leafy taste of the most "prestigious" big British tea manufacturer, Twinings. The Liptons sold here is weak, and other brown teas here taste like cardboard. I import tea bags from Britain.<br /><br />The British drink a lot of brown tea. I guess that this means that they have the purchasing power to get the best ingredients shipped, processed and packed most efficiently. Of the big three British teabag producers in order of retail volume, PG-Tips, Tetley, Typhoo, the former is for me a little too leafless and rounded, so thick it is reminscent of Cocoa and in that sense perhaps the most "British". I prefer the the "fresher" taste of Ty-Phoo and PG Tips. They are almost fruitily fresh. All are excellent and will change your perception of tea if you have not tasted tea from the small island.
