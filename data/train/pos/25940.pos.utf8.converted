If your diabetic, you must try this product for baking.  As diabetics know you have to careful as to how you choose the type of carbs and how much of them you eat.  I make blueberry pie, muffins, cake, pancakes, etc.  and does not affect my sugars.  May not be the same for every diabetic but sure is worth the try!  Delicious too!
