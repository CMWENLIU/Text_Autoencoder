Pure protein, no sweeteners or flavors but tastes great. It tastes like malted milk w/o the sugar. That most protein powders are sweetened flies in the face of trying to be healthy. You don't need the additives and you certainly don't need to train your body to always crave sweets. The best part is that, without any flavoring added, Jarrow's Whey Protein tastes delicious with plain milk.
