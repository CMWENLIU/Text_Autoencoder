Both of my parents and my husband all drink this coffee, along with myself, and we all agree this coffee is really really good.  We are pretty picky about our coffee too.  Yeah we are coffee snobs.  The flavor is really bold and the tasters notes are to the T.  I would highly recommend this coffee.  I just wish it was in stock on Amazon more often :(
