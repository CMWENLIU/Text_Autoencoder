If you go through lots of coffee like I do this is great and prices are usually among the best. It is packaged fresh and you can drink leftovers the next day and it still tastes fresh[I am serious!] I have tried several flavors and enjoy them all. My favorite part--leaving it on my steps and not paying grocery store prices.
