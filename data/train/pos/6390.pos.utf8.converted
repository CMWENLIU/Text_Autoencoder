How HEAVENLY are these? I can honestly say that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are my VERY favorite candy! I absolutely LOVE these! Maybe it's because they remind me of childhood.  My mother used to always buy me candy once a week at the market and I could pick out whatever I wanted.  Guess what I picked week after week?  Yes! You guessed it, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<br /><br />These are at a truly discounted price for a box of thirty-six (36) with two pieces in each package. (Just like if you bought them as a single package) Which actually makes a total of Seventy-Two (72) cups. This is definitely enough for the entire family to have for quite a while. And to be quite honest, I was worried at first that maybe they were discounted because they would come stale or smashed during shipping or broken. But, I thought at this price it was enough for me to want to take the chance.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that they were fresh, and delicious.  They came double boxed in the mail and very quickly.  I have dealt with this seller several times and have NEVER, not even ONCE had a problem.<br /><br />If you are thinking of ordering these, or any type of candy from this seller, do not hesitate.  They are always pleasant, prompt and very professional.  A *Perfect* transaction every single time.<br /><br />You can also freeze these, put them in the refrigerator or add them to ice cream.  We love these in a variety of ways.  Enjoy!
