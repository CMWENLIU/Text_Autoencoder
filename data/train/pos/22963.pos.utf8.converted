I have avoided making real hummus for years.  I made a white bean/olive oil variation because I couldn't make hummus that tasted as good as what I bought in stores.  I believe this product will save on my grocery bill considering a tub of hummus averages $5.  I found and tweaked a recipe online and now people request I bring hummus to gathering.  Many don't believe I made it until I give them the recipe.  I use three tablespoons of the Al Wadi Tahina to one can of garbanzo beans, among other ingredients.  The product comes in a plastic container with a wide mouth making it easy to stir.
