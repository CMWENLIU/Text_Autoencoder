I purchased this little machine after spending a fortune (.50) for each 8 oz. cup of coffee using the Senseo coffee pods.  This Pod Maker is marvelous!  Not only does it make pods using whatever coffee you like, it makes pods for an 8 oz. cup of coffee!  Senseo pods only make a 4 oz. cup of coffee, so you have to use two pods if you want to have a decent size cup of joe.  You fill the pod, fold over its top over the coffee, and then seal the pod in 2 to 3 seconds with the pod maker.  Incredibly simple.  I also have used the Ecopads, which are great also.  However, you have to empty and clean the Ecopads each time you use them.  It also takes 2 Ecopads to make 8 oz. of coffee.  The Perfect Pod Coffee Pod Maker is the better choice.
