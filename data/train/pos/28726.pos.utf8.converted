I have not had the pleasure to eat other dates but I have fell in love with these.<br /><br />Yes they are dry and can be tough but fantastic out of the package but heck I like beef jerky which is far tougher, love these chopped then mixed into yogurt or left whole in a cup of yogurt for a few hours ... just like a big sugar cube.<br /><br />I will have to try others and sure will as I have fallen in love with these and golden raisins, prunes and imagine I eat a diet that a gorrila would love.<br /><br />Hooty
