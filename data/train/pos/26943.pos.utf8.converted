I bought this to detox from mercury (bad dental work).  It is an alternative to chlorella which made me so sick I threw up all night.  Yes even the so-called split-membrane chlorella made me just as sick.  EDTA did not make me throw up but made me so nauseous I had to stop taking it.  I had no problem whatsoever with the sodium alginate.  I bought some empty capsules (large), fill them up, and take one or two a day.  From the start my mental clarity has improved.  Without the constant brain fog I can actually plan and get things done.  It is not a miracle improvement but I can tell the difference. I do take cilantro sometimes too which is helping to get it out of the tissues, and then the alginate binds to it to flush it out of the body so it doesn't just recirculate.  I still have one huge filling left which for various reasons I am not ready to have taken out right now.  So I don't want to take huge doses of anything that will start pulling mercury out of the filling.  The sodium alginate is gentle with no side effects. As far as physical symptoms that might be tied into the mercury, they are improving gradually. (Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, adrenal fatigue.)
