I've never been a fan of stevia until they started mixing it with other natural sweeteners to make it more palatable. I've tried them all (I think) and I live the PureVia much better than the main competitor, Truvia.<br /><br />I use it to make limonadas and on fresh fruit and find that it tastes quite like sugar. I used to use 100% erythritol, but it takes so much of that to sweeten anything that the cost is prohibitive. With 2-3 packets of Purevia (I like my beverages VERY sweet), I'm fine.<br /><br />Definitely a better price than buying the 40 packet boxes at the grocer.
