I ordered these from Amazon to give them a try. I was very pleased.<br /><br />They taste good just plain -- dried cherries or cranberries is the closest comarisson I can think of, but the Goji is a bit pinker and larger, more like a berry. They are slightly sweet but not sticky. I'm sure they'd be great in pancackes, trailmix or ice cream too.<br /><br />They are low calorie and have good vitamins, plus some fiber and protein.<br /><br />It's like having the culuture of the Tibetan mountains shipped to you.<br /><br />Very good stuff.
