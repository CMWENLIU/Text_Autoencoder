I moved to the US after living in Europe for almost 9 years. While living in Europe, I always had Ovaltine on hand; it's great to have with warm milk at night. After moving to the US, I bought Ovaltine here and was horrified to find so much sugar in it. Why must everything in the US be laden with sugar??? Anyway the "European" formula is great and I'm relieved to know I can still get it.
