There's nothing you can't do with ramen. It makes a pretty good soup. You can remove the flavoring packet and use it in casseroles or on top of pizza. Ants like it, too. The noodles can be used in a seemingly infinite number of dishes--three ramen casserole, for example. It's great camping, dorm, or space food. The noodles can even be crunched up and used as a faux buckwheat pilliow. Ramen makes a very good loofah, although be advised it's for single use only.
