There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee. There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee. There is no such thing as a perfect instant coffee.<br /><br />Now that we've made that perfectly clear, Starbuck's Via is the best there is. The Italian Roast is absolutely amazing...for an instant coffee. I drink it when I teach, and it is so much better than the watered-down rat pee in the teachers' workroom. Incidentally, that an instant coffee is superior to a brewed coffee is a sad reflection on the quality of coffee brewed at the workplace, but I digress...<br /><br />The rich flavor of this coffee is an unexpected treat, and although it is recognizably instant to the taste of a true coffee-lover, it is not bad. The quality and character of this coffee are incredible... for an instant coffee.
