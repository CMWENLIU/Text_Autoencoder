I own three Miniature Schnauzers and have fed them Innova's Evo chicken forumula for years.<br /><br />About a year ago the oldest dog showed signs of developing pancreatitis after a week in the vet's clinic due to extreme diarrhea and vomiting and the vet wanted me to place her on a Science Diet brand dog food which was extremely low in fat.  We fed her this for about two weeks until I found Innova's Low Fat formula and she's been fine since.<br /><br />Innova's Evo has extremely high amount of fat in it which my oldest can't take so I didn't want my second oldest to also start developing pancreatitis as well so I switched her to the next best thing in my book which is from the same exact company but with a formula which has grains in it.  I agree that dogs do not need grains however the formula helps to lower the amount of fat and protein which some dogs need.<br /><br />I have had no problems on this formula and my second oldest (the one who is on this) has never turned her nose up to it.<br /><br />I trust Innova, they are an independent dog food company which has their own manufacturing plant unlike hundreds of other dog food brands which produce their products in the same plant along side other brands. Some which maybe use the same exact recipe and call it different things or even the same source of ingredients.<br /><br />Innova also has won quality certifications from companies I've heard of before this shows me they really do care for their product.
