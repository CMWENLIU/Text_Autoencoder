This is my first time trying thie item.  I tried splenda which is good but each dry packet is 1 carb.  I'm on a low carb diet so I was using all my carbs via a two cups of coffee cause I like my coffee sweet.  Then I tried liquid Stevia and it has an after taste.  At first I thought it was okay but after say 4 drops it gives a sour taste.  THen I was on lowcarb friends.com and read the reviews about this item and thank GOODNESS.  This has no after taste!! NONE....I added 10 drops to a cup of coffee and no after taste.  I will have to buy this forever.  I bought two packs and I am so pleased. I am so thankful for amazon because this item is not in my area.  But I want to restate - this item has no after taste.  IT IS PERFECT!!!
