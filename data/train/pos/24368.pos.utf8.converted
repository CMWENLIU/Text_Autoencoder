I bought this for my boyfriend and had it sent to his house.  He says it came in so much packaging that he had trouble getting it out! (Which is a good thing, meaning it is well-protected during shipping.)  When I came over and saw it, I had expected some little twig in some ugly pot.  To my pleasant surprise, it was a beautiful, bushy, adult-looking tree in a pretty blue pot complete with moss, some small plant, and a rock!  The pot came with a dish and white stones for underneath -- it looks like a work of art!  The tree came with tweezers and bonsai food and I don't know what else (since my boyfriend received it).  I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in having (or giving) a cute little tree for your or someone else's home/office/whatever.  It's adorable!
