I won't call myself a tea expert.  Organic green tea is pretty much all I drink.  I'm known as the "tea expert" in my social circle because I know of the existence of white tea (although I haven't tried it yet).  Onen day, I was in a Natural Foods store, and the attractive package and appealing description of this Numi tea caught my eye.  Since I was on vacation, I splurged and bought the box.  Tried it as soon as I got home.<br /><br />And I've never looked back.  I admit, the first cup wasn't eye-popping.  It had a pleasant taste, but I decided it wasn't worth the $10 I had to spend on the single box (Amazon sure has a nice deal going on).  Except, the next day, I found myself looking forward to having another cup.  It WAS good - such a unique, warm taste.  Over the next few days, I discovered that - in my opinion - it tastes best after brewing for 5+ minutes in WARM water, not boiling.  I just let the faucet run on hot, and fill up the cup with it.  That's probably not the "right" way to brew tea, but<br /><br />I've since had a steady supply of this tea - it's just delicious.  Highly recommended!
