My 70lb pitbull mix can chew through just about any toy.  I dream of the day when I find him a soft chew toy that outlasts his jaws of steel, but for now, the only toy I found that lasts for a substantial amount of time is the Galileo Nylabone (Souper size).  He has two that he has been chewing on for about 2 years now and while he has certainly been able to chew away a bit of them, for the most part they are still intact.  He actively searches out his Nylabone at least twice a day and chews on it for no less than 20 minutes at a time.  The nice thing about this toy is that you NEVER find large chunks of it coming off while they play---just as the company describes, nothing larger than a small grain of rice ever comes off during a chew period.  Once in a while, to sterilize the toy and to add a little 'wow' factor back into it, I boil it in a big pot of water containing a couple chix boullion cubes---he LOVES this!!!
