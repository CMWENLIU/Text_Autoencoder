Born and raised in America, I had no idea what I was missing until living in Denmark and discovering wine gums.  Since returning to the states 10 years ago I have done my best to find the same brand that I would buy there.  The search continues but my first order of Gustaf's wine gums arrived today and I just may give up the search.  These are excellent wine gums:  tangy, tart, chewy--just about perfect.  Plus, they are noticeably larger than the wine gums I was used to in Europe.  If you like gummi candy it doesn't get any better than this.  Sorry gummi bears, but it's true.
