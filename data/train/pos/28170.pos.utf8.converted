This sweet and smooth spread is a delicious topping for your morning brioche or your evening ice cream alike. If you have never tried this before, it is like a honey of creamed chestnuts. Even that description does not do it justice. Perhaps try to imagine a cross between Nutella and honey, but with no hint of chocolate. It spreads easily over breads, though I highly recommend you try it on something that is not coarse like American toast and not too sweet like a muffin. Let the flavor of the spread speak for itself by trying it on a sweet roll, brioche, or similarly basic bread. It is difficult to find in the United States, so I am delighted that Amazon sells a variety of Creme de Marrons.<br /><br />The container itself is good, resisting cracks or damage during daily wear and tear. Since this is a food that appeals to children, it makes sense to not have it packaged in glass or another breakable material. This tin and its classic paper label are so darling that I cannot bear to part with it so I wash it out to reuse as a pencil cup.<br /><br />This food product is not recommended for someone with blood sugar tolerance issues or trying to lose weight.
