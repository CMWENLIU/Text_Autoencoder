I love brownies but I hate all the fat and unhealthful ingredients.  I found this box on the shelf with all the "bad" box mixes and decided to give it a try.  The first time I made it I substituted half the butter for yogurt.  They were moist and delicious.  I still felt guilty about the added fat of the butter so the second time I used all yogurt.  They were fantastic!  Please give these a try, they are filling but not as heavy as you would expect, considering they are whole grain.
