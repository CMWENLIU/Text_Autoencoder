I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.
