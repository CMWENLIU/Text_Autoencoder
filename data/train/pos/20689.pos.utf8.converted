My kids have tried all three flavors of the Peter Rabbit Organics Fruit Pouches and they LOVE them! I have a 16 month old and a 2 1/2 year old they went nuts eating the fruit pouches. It was really easy for both of them to figure out how to squeeze out the fruit so it wasn't messy at all. I love the portability and no choke cap but most of all I just loved watching them eat them since they get so excited. My littlest started sobbing when I took the pouch away when it was all gone and my oldest wanted another one when he was done! Highly recommend and I plan on ordering more! My only wish is that they sold a variety pack on Amazon.
