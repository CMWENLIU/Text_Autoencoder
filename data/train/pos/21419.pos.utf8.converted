I love the flavor of this cereal and it is a good source of fiber also.<br />Since I have had to change my diet to gluten free foods it has been a challenge to absorb the extra expense. I was buying this cereal at the local natural market and was paying $8.15 per bag plus tax. I am now purchasing this cereal in bulk on a delivery schedule and am saving  a lot of money. I usually eat this cereal once or twice daily and always enjoy the taste.
