I was having trouble building up my milk supply so I could both nurse my son and pump milk to store in preparation for my return to work.  A friend recommended this tea to me.  I only had to drink 3 cups of this tea before I saw an increase in my milk supply, and I only need to drink 1 cup a day to maintain that supply.  I wasn't sure I would like the taste, but it is surprisingly pleasant, not too sweet or artificial. Try it for yourself.
