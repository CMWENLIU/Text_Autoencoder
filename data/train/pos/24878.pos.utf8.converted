My cat loves toys.  She wasn't too crazy about Petmate's Cat Crazies toys, but these Looney Loops are her favorites.  I brought these home and she abandoned her previous favorites (which is good since they were stuffed mice which were falling apart) and actually gets upset when she slides one of these toys under the furniture and can't reach them.  She hasn't lost interest in them in over 6 months.  I originally bought them at PetSmart, but they've either been out of stock or no longer carrying them.  I'm very happy to find them on Amazon.<br /><br />These are great because they move quickly across the floor and she can bat them atound.  And they're QUIET, which makes them great for her night-time play sessions.  If you step on them you won't get injured (a rule for any cat toy in my house.)  They're durable.<br /><br />I don't know how they'd do on carpet -- I image they're a hard-floor toy.
