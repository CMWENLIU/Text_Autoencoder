These figs are excellent, firm and sweet.  I found the figs sold on Amazon in the smaller cans in a 6 pack rather mushy, tho no doubt it is a matter of taste and some may prefer a soft fig. Since I only eat a few at a time, I transfer the big can's contents into two smaller containers and refrigerate them.<br /><br />One thing tho, these cans are enormous and very heavy. Don't order them with anything else in the same order or they'll crush the other items - even books may be damaged.  And the cartons are really not strong enough -they usually arrive in pretty bad shape tho the cans themselves have never been damaged. But great figs tho and worth it.
