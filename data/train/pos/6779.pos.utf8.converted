I love this cake mix and the other 3 mixes as well.  They are incredible & amazon offers the best price around.  I am so thankful for Betty Crocker for coming out with these mixes since my 3 year old has celiac disease and can't eat gluten.  This makes my life so much easier since friends and family can also purchase these products as well and no one can tell the difference between the gluten & the gluten free!!!
