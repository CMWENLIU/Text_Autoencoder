If the people who reviewed it gave it 1 star, its likely because they didn't READ THE BACK OF THE PACKAGE ON HOW TO PREPARE THEM... likely dumped them in a bowl, liquid and all, nuked them, and dug in. The back of the package is written in English for a purpose. Yes, the liquid they are packaged in has a strange/bad odor. Just rinse the noodles, i prefer to parboil them 3 minutes vs. microwave. Just my preference, after that, no stink.<br />As for the product itself, its been featured on the Dr. Oz show, sampled by an audience member, who made no foul face when eating them, Likely because they were PREPARED AS DIRECTED.<br />I buy them myself for a guilt free diet food, and enjoy them as a main course, or side dish. They are a good source of protein, low carb, and go great with pasta sauce, or a little seasoning.<br />The only thing more i would want out of this product would be to be priced at 25 cents a package like their Ramen noodle counterparts. =0)
