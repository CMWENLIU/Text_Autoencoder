I adopted my cat from the local shelter about 7 years ago. We bought him the standard Purina dry cat food from the grocery store and he was fine for a couple years, until he started throwing up a lot. His stomach would hurt so bad he would hide in a closet or a corner and just moan. We took him to the vet and they told us he had a sensitive stomach; they said we either needed to change his food or he would have to get steroid shots every couple months--obviously we opted for new food, which they recommended as science diet sensitive stomach (only available in dry). His symptoms got better but he still threw up a lot and his coat was dull and full of dandruff.<br /><br />So, we did our homework, and found out that science diet is the fancy brand for Purina--full of fillers and unidentifiable ingredients (and costs the same as higher-end, natural foods to boot!). After much research we chose to try Natural Balance canned food due to it being relatively inexpensive and also full of natural ingredients. Right away we noticed a difference in our cat. He hasn't thrown up since, his coat is full, shiny, and beautiful, and he loves the taste of it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Trust me, it's worth the cost to keep your cat healthy and strong! Couldn't be happier with the results.
