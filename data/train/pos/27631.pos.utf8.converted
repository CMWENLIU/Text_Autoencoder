I've suffered from sleeplessness for many years and refuse to try any medications or pills to help me. After trying more than ten variety of tea brands (all still sitting in my kitchen!) to help me better sleep at night--I have found this one to work like wonders! I have been able to sleep soundly and even after waking up in the middle of the night, I am able to go back to sleep quickly. I drink a strong cup when I get home from work and throughout the evening w/dinner and have a cup sitting on my table near my bed. Even if I'm out late, I have a cup before bedtime and noticed I am able to sleep without waking up in the very early morning. I'm not sure if this will work for others who have also suffered from many nights of sleeplessness, but it sure has for me!  : )
