First of all, I would like to comment on the previous review for this item.  The customer gave it rave reviews but said that the gum came with a "grainy coating" that's horrible.  Of course its horrible.  Its a special type of sand!  YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT THE SAND, YOU HAVE TO RINSE OFF EACH PIECE BEFORE YOU USE IT.  The sand is a testiment to the excellent quality of the product.  For over 3,000 years, the gum has been harvested the same way.  The trees are scared and the "sap" drips down to the ground.  The ground is covered by harvesters with a special, clean, white sand to keep the "sap" from becoming dirty when it hits the ground.  After it hardens into "teardrops", it is then collected.<br />Mastic Gum kills bacteria that cause plaque and other dental problems.  Whitens teeth.  And it tastes absolutely natural....similar to the way patchouli smells.
