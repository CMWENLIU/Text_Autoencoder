This is a great popcorn, though it IS very salty.  Our family loves salty snacks, so it's perfect.  I like that there are no artificial ingredients, and no milk products.  It is hard to find kid friendly snacks without wheat/gluten/dairy, and this is a winner.<br />*********<br />I'm updating to emphasize the SOY in this popcorn.  I honestly don't think it originally contained soy, but now it does.  We can't eat this anymore, but I'll stand by the 5 stars for tastiness.
