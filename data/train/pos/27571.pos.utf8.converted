I LOVE LOVE LOVE most chocolate. I have a weakness for double stuffed oreos but know they aren't the most healthy option. I came across the Chocolate Yumnuts and decided to try them and they are the best healthy chocolate fix ever. They have a real chocolate flavor, are nice and crispy and come in a decent size bag. I never feel guilty eating this chocolate.
