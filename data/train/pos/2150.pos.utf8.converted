My daughter is allergic to everything this item is free of.  She is so happy to be able to eat bread again.  She says it is delicious.  We love namaste products because they don't make her sick and they all taste good.  How awsome that now I can buy them for so much less at Amazon I was paying $6 a bag a the local co-op.
