You know after reading the other review I was shocked to say the least of their disatisfaction.  As a child my father was in the Air Force and we lived on base in Germany and we would visit the "Gummi Store" as I called it - my sisters and brother giggle at me as I was 5 years old and trecking to get to the gummi store was through a forest as I believed to get our Haribo candy - that forest as I know now, is a park.  The store was real and so was the candy and to this day - every holiday we always gift the family and friends with Haribo.<br /><br />I gave up soda long ago but love the taste of the Happy Cola - you have to watch as Haribo sells two different kinds - Happy Cola are the little ones and the one you really want. The other ones "Coke Bottles" think they are called are HUGE and who wants to eat something that big - Happy Cola is about the size of your pinky (finger).<br /><br />Above and beyond the Happy Cola is the Haribo Gold Bears and they are by far my favorite and coming in second the Happy Cola.<br /><br />Try it yourself and you will love it - get a small bag if you want to try it out first instead of getting the 5 pound bag - Rite Aid sells the small bag for a little more than a dollar I think - I do not tend to look at the price but the quality of the product.  We have never had a problem due to freshness etc.  I do not work for Haribo nor am I affiliated with any retail environment but a stay at home Mom who knows her german candy.<br /><br />Enjoy.
