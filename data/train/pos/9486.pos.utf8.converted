I like my coffee dark, strong, bold and black, no sweeteners, no cream.  This is thus an ideal coffee for me.  If you like a much milder coffee, say medium roast, you may not like it nearly as much as I do. If you like cream and sugar, that may just ruin this coffee as it will dilute its strength and "strong" is what this coffee is all about..  The statements made in the description of this coffee here at Amazon are correct, i.e. the taste of an Italian roast with hints of chocolate overlaying it. Lately I've been able to buy mine at Sam's Club locally in a big bag for $16.
