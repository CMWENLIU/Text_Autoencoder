I have tried going back and forth between cat foods for my kitten, who is almost 1 year old and close to switching to adult food. All around, this is the best one I've tried. I mix it with a wet food to make it a little more easily digestible, but even with this, my cat won't eat a lot of other brands, even the more expensive ones. I guess she's a picky eater. She always chows down on Purina, though, and I also don't have any problems with extreme litter box smells, as I did when experimenting with one other brand. Yikes!
