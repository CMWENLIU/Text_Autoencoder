I have been looking for a long time for a decent salad dressing. The store-bought dressings haven't done the trick (unhealthy oils, mysteriously long-named ingredients, odd to no taste, etc), the mixes we've tried haven't been much better, and I have yet to find a really terrific homemade dressing that is similar to what I can get in my favorite Italian restaurant. So, I was a bit leery when I saw these. But the price was right and so with a "sure can't hurt" attitude, we bought the Italian mix.<br /><br />Oh my! It is very tasty with just the right blend of spices and "zing" (not a hot and spicy zing, just an "awaken the tastebuds" zing). We all loved it and so were inspired to try the other varieties. There is no disappointment here! All 3 are simply delicious and have me wishing that, like a cow, I had more stomachs so I could eat more of the stuff ;o)  I find myself craving salads at all sorts of times and it makes a yummy marinade also.<br /><br />Seeing how our family recently found we need to go gluten-free, I contacted the company to ask about their GF status. The reply was that though the bottles are not yet labeled as such (they soon will be) they are most certainly gluten-free. So, one more thing we restricted diet people can have to enjoy. YAY!!<br /><br />It's great to be able to make up our dressings with the healthy oils we enjoy and to be able to understand every ingredient on the label. Our family appreciates that. Along with it being economical, I'd say you can't go wrong. Try them out. And if you don't like them, well, you can give them to me ;o)<br /><br />Bon Appetit!
