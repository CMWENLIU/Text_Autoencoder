Vegan. Organic. Medium consistency. Not super thick and not watery. Enjoyable style. Nice pieces of potato, onion, carrot, and corn kernals mixed  in the delightful black bean soup base. Nice overall black bean flavor with an assortment veggie flavor notes. Approx. 260 kcal, 12g protein, 3g fat, and 860 mg sodium per can.
