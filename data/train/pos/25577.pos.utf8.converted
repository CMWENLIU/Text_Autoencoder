I was always disappointed with how quickly whipped cream seemed to "fall apart". This product solves that problem perfectly, and doesn't change the flavor or appearance of the cream. However, I find that using one packet per pint of cream is more than sufficient to give me long-lasting whipped cream. The mfr recommends two packets.
