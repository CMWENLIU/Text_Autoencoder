This may be not the best deal, but it is very convenient get groceries delivered to your door. Cooking instructions are somewhat OK, but if you like barley to be little softer I would suggest soaking it for about 3 hours before cooking. Set you fire to the lowest and let it simmer until most of the water is gone. Add some butter or margarine and you got yourself nice "kasha"
