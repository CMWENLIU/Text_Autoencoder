I love these waffles! They are better than the full-carb waffles I used to make from scratch, and better than frozen waffles.<br /><br />Mine cook up nice and crispy. I don't understand how someone could have them raw in the center unless they don't know how to cook. I brush my waffle iron with a bit of oil before cooking instead of using Pam - save the planet!<br /><br />I could eat this every day!
