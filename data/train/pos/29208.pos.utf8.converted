I have both a Dolce Gusto "Piccolo" machine, and the Tassimo coffee maker. I have tried making cappuccinos on both machines, and by far I prefer the Dolce Gusto. For my palate, it has a much more authentic cappuccino tast. I think that this is because the Dolce Gusto machine uses a high pressure, 15 bar system and the Tassimo does not. The Tassimo does make a delicious drip style coffee, especially from the Starbucks selections. I generally do not like sweetened coffee drinks, and again for me, the main difference between the Dolce Gusto "Cappuccino" and the "Skinny Cappuccino" seems to be the sweetner added to the milk capsule of the regular cappuccino. I really look forward to my daily Dolce Gusto Skinny Cappuccino and highly recommend this product.
