I purchased this product to try and remedy my extremely dry hands and bleeding, cracked cuticles.  I am a nurse and I wash my hands A LOT at work.  Lotion was just not doing anything. My cuticles were like Black Swan, seriously!  I was in pain and putting myself at risk for infection from my patients.  I purchased this and put some in a squeezy tube and started bringing it to work and putting it on several times per day.  MY HANDS ARE HEALED.  Cuticles are normal again.  I put this on at least once per day in order to maintain my hands.  SO happy with this product.  It smells great.  Also I have occasionally put it on my face before bed and I have been getting compliments on how great my skin looks.  Love it! Love it!  Love it!<br /><br />UPDATE: I do not recommend using a squeezy tube during cold weather.  It was hard to squeeze out.  In the summer it was fine, but now I keep it in a small twisty topped jar.
