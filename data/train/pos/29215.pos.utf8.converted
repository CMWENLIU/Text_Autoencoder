I first became aware of black soy beans when I read the Atkins low carb diet plan.  I had been using black beans in various dishes and I thought I would try these instead.  I tried to find them locally in my hometown health food stores but they did not carry them.  So I took a chance and ordered a case of 12 cans here.  They are great!  They're not exactly black the way regular black beans are - they are sort of a faded red color, somewhat similar to a kidney bean in appearance.<br /><br />Just so you know, in a half cup serving they have 120 calories, 6 g of fat, 8 g of carbs, 7 g of fiber, and 11 g of protein.  So run to your pantry and grab a can of regular black beans and compare!  I no longer have any regular beans in my pantry so I can't compare for you.<br /><br />Also, Eden Foods has a custom can lining that has NO bisphenol-A (I believe they are the only canning company which has done this), so that's another really good reason to get these beans. I am so happy with these beans and since I do use canned beans on a pretty regular basis, I have signed up to get an automatic shipment of a dozen cans every few months.<br /><br />Fear not. It's simple. These are great.
