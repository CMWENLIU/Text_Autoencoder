I've always liked Royal Crown Cola, better known as RC Cola.  It's the alternative to Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  I first tried this stuff when I was a little kid in the mid-'70s and liked it.  It definitely has its own distinctive flavor.  If I were to participate in a blindfolded taste test with Coke, Pepsi, and RC, the oddball one as far as taste goes would be RC (and I mean that in a good way).  RC is harder to find these days.  Of course, every product I like is either discontinued or hard to find.<br /><br />If you can find it, I recommend RC as an alternative to the big name colas.
