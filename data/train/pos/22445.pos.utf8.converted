I love Smart Fries and plan to order a bunch more for the start of school. They are great as a lunch box snack for my kids. My mom, who has Type 2 diabetes, can have a reasonable size portion as a snack without doing wacky things to her blood sugar, even. And I can have a late-night, TV-watching, salty-crunchy-yummy snack without feeling guilty. Can't beat that! They are very tasty and so light that the single portion bags actually give you A LOT.
