Sure they are more like instant coffee than freshly ground, and there may even be some artificial sweeteners in there, but the truth is, they're delicious. And for those of you who don't want to put these things in your body, feel free to send them to me. I'm not that picky. I'm a healthy eater all day long, 2 cups of fakely sweetened, fake coffee a day isn't going to kill me. And if it does, so be it, a life without taste is a waste!
