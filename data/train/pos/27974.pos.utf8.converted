I bought 5 bottles of this about 10 days ago (23oz bottles). Between my brother and I, we have gone through 4 bottles already. This stuff is GREAT! I was searching for a sauce similiar to the hot sauce that comes with Domino's Chicken Kickers... I wrote them and the individual who replied recommended this sauce. After trying over 40 different sauces, this is by far the closest one. I love it! I LOVE IT!
