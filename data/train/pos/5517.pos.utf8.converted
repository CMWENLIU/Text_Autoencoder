After searching for a cheaper coconut oil than in the stores, I found this one. It tastes even better than the more expensive store bought brand I bought. I use it for so much stuff... Coconut chicken, eggs, in my hair for deep conditioning, in my coffee (it's sooo good!), and I even make "chocolate" with it since I'm on Atkins. I use 6 tablespoons of the oil, 1  tablespoon cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon Splenda, and 1 tablespoon of natural peanutbutter... Put it on parchment paper in the freezer and enjoy :)  It's a nice treat. You can also use it to make "hard shell" for ice cream since the coconut oil hardens or softens from temperature.<br /><br />I'm sure if you try this you won't be disappointed. It has a great flavor, and the price is unbeatable!
