Wow my cat just loves this food.  I love that it doesn't have grains.  I used to feed my cat Iams and then the other innova's and she just wasn't satisfied.  I have to feed my cat three times a day, small amounts because she throws up when she gets  too much.  This food she is satisfied with and she has only thrown up 2x since I started her on this 3 months ago.  This is worth the money if you love your cats!
