Title says it all.<br /><br />I'm a vegetarian and have been missing marshmallows, and not just for cocoa.  I used to make a fantastic fudge but with no marshmallows, well, no fudge.  I picked up a bag of these at my local natural food store.  I've been looking at them suspiciously for a couple of months now and finally caved last week.<br /><br />These are the best ever!  I've been eating them like candy.  Oh, wait!  They are candy.  I'm picking up some graham crackers and will be fixing some s'mores real soon.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon gets some soon.<br /><br />November 2011 Update:<br /><br />I am tempted to take away a star for changes that I've experience with the Dandies marshmallows in the past few months.  They've become smaller in size.  Not having any of the older ones handy (not surprising), my guess is that they are 1/3 to 1/2 the size of the earlier Dandies.  They also appear to be using less of whatever they were using to coat the marshmallows.  For the past few months, the Dandies have been stuck together.  Now that is not a problem if cooking with them is the plan; however if the plan is for s'mores, cocoa topping, or even just munching, it is a problem.
