As a long term vegan I use this product for salads and sauces not as a source of B12 (nutritional yeast doesn't contain B12 unless it's fortified with it).<br /><br />I love the quality and consistency (I've been a long term buyer). I would highly recommend you check out Barry Farm for gourmet and hard to get foods (no, I don't work for them or have any investment in the company).<br /><br />I live in a area where it is impossible to get wasabi, nori or other specialty Asian products, so I'm forced to purchase online. I'm glad that there is a Barry Farms in cyber space.
