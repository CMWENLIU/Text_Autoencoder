I have been using this product for approximately 3 years.  It definitely fends off any critters (large or small) from eating your plants.  The solution is very strong, so I use it mainly on flowers and shrubs as opposed to vegetables and or fruits.  I imagine it would be ok to use on edibles, depending on the permeability of their skin, however this is one marinade I would absolutely pass on.  The residual effects of the application last for quite a long period, at least 6 weeks to 2 months.
