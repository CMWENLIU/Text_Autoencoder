Even after altering his diet, my husband still couldn't get his triglycerides down. Not only that, his blood sugar went higher. I was mystified and started to inspect everything he ate. What a shock I got.. all his "health food section" cereals with high fiber were filled with sugar. Some of the "healthy" cereals had more sugar in them than a kid's cereal! Even a certain cereal that is all bran contained High Fructose Corn Syrup.<br /><br />Enter Uncle Sam. 7 ingredients, less than 1 gram of sugar, and has 10 grams of fiber. Oddly, my husband enjoys the taste of it, too. As someone else pointed out, though, if you need something sweet with it, just add some fresh fruits.
