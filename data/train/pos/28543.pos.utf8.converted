When my local co-op stopped carrying this product in bulk, I was nearly in despair.  In my opinion, this is the very best refried bean product you can ask for.  I often mix the prepared product with TVP, ground meat or sausage ("real" or vegan) and salsa for a very tasty pseudo-Mex-curry type dish served over rice or tortillas.  The only draw-back is the sodium content, but I can live with it.<br /><br />This arrived in 3 individual plastic bags in one cardboard shipping box.  I'm very pleased and I hope Amazon keeps this configuration available.
