As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room.<br /><br />I'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits, but most of them had sugar added, something I try to avoid. I ordered this product (Orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. Wow, was it!<br /><br />Aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop, it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more.<br /><br />I'm extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy.
