My dog has been enjoying the Bench and Field Canine treats for many years. Until recently they were available nationwide at a popular grocery discounter. Now, the only economical way to get these, at least on the East Coast, is from Amazon.com. I expect Amazon will be getting lots of orders for them now. The treats are very healthy and fit nicely into the rubber kong toys to give a dog lots of chewing for clean, strong teeth and exercise. My dog also eats the Bench and Field dogwood and is healthy and energetic at 11 years old.
