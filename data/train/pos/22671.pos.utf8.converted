I purchased the book "Artisian Breads in Five Minutes a Day" and used this flour as directed for the Semolina Bread.  Delicious, Easy and well worth the investment.  Get the book, you won't believe how easy it is to bake fresh breads, and this recipe should not be overlooked. Not just for pasta!  If you can find semolina flour in your supermarket, the Hodgson Mill brand is still the best!  The loaves were full of flavor and came out fluffier and more delicate.  Well worth the extra effort.
