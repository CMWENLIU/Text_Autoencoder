i was going through a tough time in life where it seemed like everything i did, every situation i got into and basically all that i experienced seemed to rustle my jimmies.  one day i was walking through trader joe's looking for remedies and stumbled upon this cereal.  i like chocolate, i like peanut butter...why not?  i ate the entire box and i've been rustle free ever since.  i see people i hate, jimmies remain unrustled.....my favorite team loses, jimmies stay unrustled...my favorite band announces a tour and leaves my city off the intinerary.....guess how my jimmies react?  they don't!  excellent product.  5 stars.
