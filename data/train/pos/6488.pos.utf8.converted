My cat is 17.5 years old and had been fed canned Science Diet food for years.  She seemed to like it and ate well.  But about a year ago, she just refused to eat any Science Diet flavor I gave her, mainly chicken.  I tried some other 'premium' brands to no avail.  This is the ONLY cat food she will eat now.  She eats three or four small meals each day and can't be fooled.  If it's not Fancy Feast, she absolutely won't eat it.
