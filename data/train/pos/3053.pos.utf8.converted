Gorilla Munch has been a real life-saver for me.  Having celiac disease, I have gotten used to cereals that taste and feel like soggy cardboard.  Gorilla Munch is extra crunchy, which in and of itself is like a treat, and it keeps its flavor even when milk is added, which almost never happens with gluten-free cereals.  It's more affordably priced than the other gluten-free cereals on the market and is very filling, at least for me.  I usually mix in a teaspoon of FiberSure to help make it a little more nutritional, and sometimes I add fresh fruit, which goes very well with it.  For those who do not like the crunchiness of Gorilla Munch, I've found that using unsweetened almond milk rather than cow's milk seems to soften it up almost instantly, for some reason.<br /><br />I take issue with the idea that Gorilla Munch is nothing but junk being targeted at children.  This cereal is marketed to children who cannot eat gluten, meaning they're mostly children who are used to food tasting terrible (those with celiac disease or wheat allergies) and children who are /positively/ stimulated by bright colors and designs (those with autism).  They are already on strict diets which require that they watch their nutrient intake, so having one mostly fluff product is not going to hurt them.  Children on gluten-free diets aren't exactly the ones you worry about eating doughnuts and cookies every day, and with all of the bland, soggy food we're stuck with, they deserve a treat once in a while.  And with almost no other brand making fun-looking gluten-free items geared at children, it's good to have at least /something/ to look at, especially something that's educational.<br /><br />Additionally, EnviroKidz is a great company to support.  They spread awareness about important environmental and animal rights issues through their products, they use only environment-friendly organic products, and they give 1% of their proceeds to related causes.  When I have called their customer service line in the past, they have been exceptionally helpful, once even giving me a full refund for a product that was only slightly damaged.  I would much rather give them my money than some of the other lines out there.<br /><br />In brief, Gorilla Munch is a great cereal that helps put some life back into a gluten-free diet.  It's nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal again and not have to be reminded of my special diet and how restrictive it can be.  Thank you, Gorilla Munch!
