I have had this three times, gotten a full eight hours each time when I needed it.  They are cheaper at the store, though.  Neuro's site has a map that will show you where to get them near you.  I buy them for $2.50 at the store.  If they weren't available in my area, I'd gladly pay $3 a bottle for when I needed sleep.
