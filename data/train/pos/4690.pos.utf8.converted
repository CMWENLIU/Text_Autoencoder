I believe this tea really works. Ten years ago I had cancer in my throat. I went through the usual "cut, burn, & poison treatments." Then a friend who had cancer in both lungs sent me some Flor-Essence to try. I used up what she sent and bought more. She told me her story that convinced me to try it, They were going to do surgery on one lung at a time. When that one healed they would do the other one. While she was recovering from the first surgery she started drinking Flor-Essence. When it was time to have the surgery on the other lung they ran some tests to see how bad the cancer was. There was no cancer where there had been before.<br /><br /> Recently I went in to have them check my prostate and after having a biopsy they found cancer. (less than 1%) The Dr. wanted to do surgery right away. I declined and went to Amazon and ordered the tea. I'm not saying you should do this but after the treatments I took the first time and how it has taken my strength, destroyed my thyroid, and having to have all my teeth pulled. I don't think my body could go through that again.<br /><br /> To sum it up. I for one believe it works. If you want some interesting reading get "The Essiac Report" It deserves to be read.
