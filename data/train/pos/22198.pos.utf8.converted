Boylan's Bottleworks Root Beer has a thin-necked amber bottle that harkens back to the days of real root beer...the kind made with bark and roots. OF course, the proof is in the taste, and Boylan delivers here too. While it has a moderate head of foam, the taste is dryer than the more popular root beers, and seems more authentic.  Another reviewer commented on the cane sugar sweetening, which also imparts a less syrupy taste and texture than corn syrup; I concur.<br /><br />The root beer has a fresh, clean taste, that seems to cut through lingering food flavors. It's a very satisfying, and truer tasting drink than the diluted "hint" of root beer offered elsewhere.  There is a distinct peppery aftertaste which is only partially moderated by ice; I enjoyed this  although it took a while to get used to.  (This taste may be due to the yucca extract.)  ALl together, this is both a thirst quencher as well as a unique "brew" that can be sipped slowly for the utmost enjoyment.<br /><br />Root beer was invented in 1875 by Mr. Hires (the name may be familiar to you), although precursors were available many years earlier. It's estimated that there have been over 2,000 root beer brands. Boylan's, based in Haledon, New Jersey, is also well known for its birch beer, a related product.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Carbonated water, cane sugar, natural and artificial flavors, caramel color, natural yucca extract, citric acid, and soium benzoate as a preservative.<br /><br />Nutrition Information per 11.6 fluid ounce bottle:<br /><br />165 Calories, no fat, 35 mg of sodium, 41 grams of carbohydrate, including a whopping 41 grams of sugar, and no protein.
