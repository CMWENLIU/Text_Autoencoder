I could not recommend this product more highly. I have a 12 year old german shepherd who suffers with arthritis. Our vet had prescribed Meloxicam, an NSAID. However, that category of drugs carries significant risks (ulcer formation as well as kidney or liver damage or failure). In my companion's case, it caused an ulcer even though I gave him Pepcid before each dose of Meloxicam.<br /><br />A store owner recommended this product, and within less than one week, there was so much improvement I was able to completely discontinue the NSAID, and my dog is now even better than he was when he was on the NSAID medication.<br /><br />Please note though that this is not the best concentration for large breed dogs. I learned that Liquid Health's 'L-5000' is designed for large dogs and is more highly concentrated. It too, is extremely effective.<br /><br />I strongly urge the use of this supplement before resorting to medications that can cause serious to fatal internal damage.<br /><br />My dog also finds it palatable, and I have not had any trouble feeding it to him, I just mix it in with his kibbles twice daily.
