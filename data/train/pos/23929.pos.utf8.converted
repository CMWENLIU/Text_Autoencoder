These rolls are great.  Bake them and then add some butter.  Who needs wheat, anyway?  They are not too dry or too hard.  They are just right.  I am going with an egg sandwich tomorrow morning.<br /><br />The downside is that they are pricey in the store ($1.00 per roll).  It's hard to believe they really need to be priced like that as it is a very simple product.
