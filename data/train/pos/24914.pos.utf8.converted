My best friend has Celiacs disease and when she heard I was making cupcakes she challenged me to make Gluten Free cupcakes. One of my most popular flavors is my S'mores. I am so impressed with this stuff! I tasted it before I used it in my cupcakes and couldn't taste any difference from regular graham cracker crumbs. I highly recommend these for any recipe that calls for it.
