I was a huge fan of Jell-o as a kid, but have been vegetarian for 8 years now, so no mo Jell-o. When I came across this product, I was skeptical but excited. With Amazon's "Customer's who bought this item also bought" feature, I also found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047F7M6Y">Unflavored Vegan Jel by Natural Desserts</a>.  I've since made both jelly deserts, and am happy with the results of each! Some finer review details for this product:<br /><br />Clarity: A+. There's no murkiness to the color, it looks very clear.<br /><br />Firmness: A-. Definitely a nice solid, but some droop when the desert dish is tilted. The "Unflavored Vegan Jel by Natural Desserts" was firmer, and closer to what I remember of Jell-o. Don't let this discourage you too much, it's plenty enjoyable. I bet a little reduction in the volume of water used would help as well.<br /><br />Flavor: A. I've tried the lime and orange so far. They're exactly as you'd expect from an equivalent Jell-o flavor.<br /><br />Ease of making: A+. The directions are in the product description. They're painfully easy to follow and you're done in less than 10min.<br /><br />I can't say much about the probiotic aspect, as I don't really have digestive issues.  I'll leave that for another reviewer.
