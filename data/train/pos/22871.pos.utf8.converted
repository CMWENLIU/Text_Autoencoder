This variety pack, as well as the fruit version (Lower Sugar Peaches & Cream and Strawberries & Cream) are in my desk.  I make a packet every morning when I get to work.  It takes about 15 seconds to prepare (we have a hot water dispenser so I don't need the microwave). It's the perfect breakfast in this respect.<br /><br />This stuff is great. Half the sugar of the "normal" version, but still tasty.  My favorite of the three is the Apples and Cinnamon, but I don't dislike any of them.  The important thing is that they taste just like I remember the "normal" variety tasting, although it's been years since I've had those. If I did a side-by-side comparison, I don't know how it would turn out.<br /><br />Anyway, it's good. Get it. :)
