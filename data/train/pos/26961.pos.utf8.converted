These peanut chews are addictive but very hard to find--Just Born needs to get its distribution act together.  They taste great--not too sweet, and the molasses in the caramel that binds the peanuts together really goes well with the dark/bittersweet chocolate coating.  They also have a great "mouth appeal" when you bite into them and then choose how you will savor each half.  I've tried the milk chocolate coated ones too, but they are not half as good.  Enjoy!
