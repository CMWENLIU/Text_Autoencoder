I am glad to see that more and more companies are manufacturing xylitol, because the sooner it catches on nation-wide, the sooner the prices will drop and become reasonable. Hopefully, xylitol will eventually replace sugar as the sweetener of choice. It shouldn't cost more than sugar does.<br /><br />I like this brand because it is USA made from birch, not corn and not China. No offense to China, but since almost all of our jobs went over there, the quality of Chinese products can be, well, BAD. I try to avoid "made in China" as much as possible and I look for "made in USA." This product satisfies both requisites. And it's excellent.
