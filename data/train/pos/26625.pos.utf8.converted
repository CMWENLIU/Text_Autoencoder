I bought this product as part of a research project for a chapter in my new book, Be Rich, The Aspiring Millionaires Guide. I was pleasantly surprised when this product showed up packaged in two #10 cans (think BIG coffee can).  The product itself is as unromantic as you can get, we're talking eggs here but that would be the point. Throw a dozen eggs into a blender and compare them to this product, they taste the same and you don't need to deal with the shell!
