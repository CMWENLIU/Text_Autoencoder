I picked these up at the Seattle Uwajimaya. The chocolate is good, and it tastes a lot like pocky, but there is more chocolate with each piece.<br /><br />The box is crammed full of pieces in a little foil-plastic pack, and the box itself can be sealed close with a clasp to keep them from falling out.<br /><br />Great snack, for when you need that chocolate fix.
