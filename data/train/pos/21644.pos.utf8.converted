I add this to our smoothies in the morning (mixes easily in a blender).  It has given me the energy boost I need AND it seems to balance my blood sugar.  I have been trying to lose weight and w/2 scoops of this stuff my appetite is nicely suppressed for a large part of the day.  Incredible stuff!  Taste isn't bad either :)!
