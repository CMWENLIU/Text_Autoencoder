After having diffuculty finding this locally tried a couple other brands of chipolte.  I wasted my money.  The amazon price for 3 is what I would have paid for 2 at the specialty shop that doesn't even carry this anymore.  Great smoky flavor and of course that bite.  I use it not only in mexican food but in Itaian meals with great success.  Actually I use it on anything that I need a little smoke and a little burn!
