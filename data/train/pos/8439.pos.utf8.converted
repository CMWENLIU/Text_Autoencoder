I was leery about buying 25 lbs. of flour but after reading the other review decided to try it.  I can definitely give it 5 stars.  Yesterday I ordered another bag of it.  The price from Amazon, which includes shipping, is so much better than buying in bulk in the health food stores .  It comes neatly packaged in a cardboard box and the actual flour sack easily opens with the tab top. As soon as I received it, I portioned it into resealable bags and put them in the freezer, refrigerator, and pantry so there wouldn't be a bug issue.
