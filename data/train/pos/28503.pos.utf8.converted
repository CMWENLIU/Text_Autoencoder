I have had Blue Popcorn before, so I KNEW what I was buying (unlike previous reviews.).  The kernals are significantly smaller, but then when you make the Popcorn...you just "ADD more" kernals in your pan!!!<br /><br />This Popcorn has superior "crunch" and flavor compared to ANY popcorn I have EVER eaten.<br /><br />I do consider myself a "Self-Proclaimed" POPCORN ADDICT!!!!  I could live on this food only the rest of my life!!!
