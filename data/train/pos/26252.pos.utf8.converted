I have been suffering from a bloated stomach--looking like I was ready to deliver any minute--for going on 2 yr.  I have had MRIs and blow-in-the bag tests and gastric emptying tests and upper GIs and on and on and none showed a reason for the bloating.  Even had my gallbladder out since everyone (me too) thought that was the fix, but the bloating remains long after the gall bladder is gone.  So here I was bloated like a pig with pressure and pain and general misery, searching for yet another solution. Doctor had none. I ordered the fennel tea thinking yeah, sure, but what the heck--a total skeptic.  It arrived this morning. By the time I finished the first cup at least 70% of the bloating was gone, taking the pressure and pain with it. A couple of hours later I am practically "normal." So I am a believer (although I need to see if it continues to work) I am not good at putting things in my mouth that taste "funny" but this is not a bad taste at all (as in I didn't have to gag it down).  I am going to be excited to see if this really continues to work.  Right now I am thinking it is magical. Oh as an extra bonus--their customer support person was terrific, competent, kind, and American.
