Peanut Butter & Co's Mighty Maple Peanut Butter is delicious!!  It makes an amazing healthy snack with sliced apples and a spoonful gets me through my sweets cravings.  The tiny little crunch in the texture is what makes this flavor so addictive for me.  I LOVE that little crunch along with the creaminess.  (Another reviewer called it "grit".) If you want it without the tiny bit of crunch, get the honey flavor - it is yummy too, and smooth and creamy.  GREAT STUFF!!  I'm glad Amazon has this brand for a good deal.
