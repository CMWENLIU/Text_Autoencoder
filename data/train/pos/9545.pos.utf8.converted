I've been a Bonsai hobbist for more than 10 years.  I have personally visted the Brussel's Bonsai Nursery in Alabama.  IT's about 40 minutes away from Memphis Tn and well worth the drive.  I've purchased LOTS of trees from Brussel's (at the nursery, by mail and at bonsai shows) and have always been satisfied.  You get great trees at really resonable prices.  Pay particular attention to if the tree is rated for indoor or outdoors.  Outdoor bonsais that are brought indoors for more than a few days will die.  I love the Chinese Elm variety.  It has tiny vergated leaves just like the mamouth elm trees that used to blanket Chicago neighborhoods.  The Chinese Elm can be kept inside during the winter. but ALL bonsai's will do much better if you let them enjoy the summer weather outside.  If you fertilize them, they will grow profusely, thickening the trunk and developing more character and allow to enjoy your had at shaping your tree to what you define as Cool.  Dive in and Enjoy!
