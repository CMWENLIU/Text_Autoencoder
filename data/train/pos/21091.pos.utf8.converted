The Red Star Champagne yeast is very similar to the Lavin EC-1118 yeast. Both are fast fermenting.  I have used both brands in making rootbeer. After leaving the plastic bottles at room temperature for 24 - 36 hours the bottles are rock hard. Once refrigerated the yeast go dormant and any further carbon dioxide creation is stopped.  The nice thing about these strains of yeasts is if a bottle of rootbeer goes flat all you have to do is screw on the top and give it a day for the yeast to re-carbonate the liquid. Then refrigerate and you have carbonated rootbeer ready to go.
