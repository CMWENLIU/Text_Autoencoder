I have to say, truffle salt will elevate your dishes to new heights. The 3.5oz jar seems small, but it is strong, and a little goes a long ways. great on buttered popcorn like everyone says, but it's even better on lamb or beef. If you're looking to try truffles without breaking the bank, my vote goes to truffle salt.
