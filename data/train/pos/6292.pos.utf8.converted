After a terrible accident killed one of my two cats, I got very concerned about her surviving sister's well-being.  Call it obsessive, but I started reading books on cat first aid and cat health and nutrition, and one day I was filling her food bowl and I happened to glance at the ingredients in her dry cat food.  It was then that I realized that the dry food I was feeding her was JUNK!  No nutritive value at all!  (She was eating Meow Mix, because she seemed to like it, but not anymore.)<br /><br />Cats don't need cornmeal or veggies or soy or "natural flavoring" (by the way, I found out that most pet products are "naturally flavored" with manure...that's right, MANURE).  Cats don't need fish flavored cereal.  They need high quality protein, plain and simple.  And this is probably the best stuff I've ever found.  No grains, no by-products, all natural, and my cat loves the stuff.<br /><br />Before I started her on this food, she was sedentary and overweight, and she was throwing up a lot.  I always thought it was hair balls, but really I think it was her diet.  Since I switched her to this diet, she seems to have a lot more energy, she runs around and plays a lot more, she's lost weight, her coat has gotten shinier and silkier, her eyes have cleared up, and she never throws up anymore.<br /><br />It's a lot more expensive than other kinds of dry cat food, but really, you wouldn't feed your kids junk food with no nutritive value just because it's cheaper, so why would you feed junk to your pets?  I honestly think it's worth the price.  It's a great product, and I think I'll be feeding it to my cats for many years to come.
