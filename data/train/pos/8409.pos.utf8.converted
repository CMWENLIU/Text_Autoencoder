I heard some amazing things about this particular product on a forum website so I decided to purchase it.<br /><br />Weight loss? I am already a healthy eater and dieter, so I'm losing weight regardless. But this product completely took away my sleeping problems. I wake up about 4-5 times a night. After the first day of using this product in my morning drink I slept soundly the whole night, and continued to sleep wonderfully as I used it.<br /><br />Energy? It replaced coffee for me. It keeps me energized and I'm surprised. I haven't felt this good since high school.<br /><br />Texture? It doesn't dissolve. It's definitely kind of gritty in a sense, but I like the texture to be honest. It tastes pretty interesting. I add two scoops to 4 ounces of unsweetened plain soy milk and a small amount of artificial sweetener and drink it like a long shot.<br /><br />Would buy over and over and over again.
