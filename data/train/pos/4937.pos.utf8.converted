Sylvia's Chicken Fry Mix is simply the best! My husband and I once found it by chance at a local grocery store, and absolutely loved it.  Unfortunately, the store stopped carrying it soon after, and we were never able to find it again at any other area grocery stores.  Rumor had it that if I drove to the South Side, I may have been able to get it... but that was not a drive I wanted to endure.<br /><br />So, one day I had an amazing idea: "Hmmm... Amazon is a place where I can find almost anything, and since I'm a Prime member, I can get free second day shipping."  I gave it a shot and there it was! My day was made!<br /><br />Now I have a nine pack of Sylvia's Chicken Fry that should last us for quite some time, and the product is as great as it ever was!
