I have to admit I'm floored by this product.  I'm originally from the West Indies so needless to say I love coconut.  I've tried other extra virgin coconut oils and wasn't impressed, they tasted and smelled more like vegetable oil than anything, and forget about trying them straight.  I was very skeptical about Nutiva but reading some good reviews and being hounded by my vegetarian friend who swears by it, I said what the hell.  It arrived from Amazon and it was in liquid form, which was to be expected as it's 96' in the shade here in Florida.  I removed the lid off the jar and before I even took the seal off, I was entranced by this wondeful coconut fragrance.  I stuck my finger in and even in liquid form, I was tasting nothing but melted coconut.  Later, when it turned into solid form I tried it again, a dap on a teaspoon, once again, nothing but coconut.  Definitely will buy this coconut oil again.  Nutiva did a great job of impressing an Islander ;)
