I was looking forward to experiencing this bacon sauce.  It really looked like it was going to be a great product.  So, I cook up three racks of ribs, and smother the bacon sauce all over it.  Great idea, right?  Wrong!  This bacon sauce did not taste good at all.  I have definitely had worse BBQ sauce before, but this was in the bottom five, for sure.  Then I looked at the label and I realized I was doing it all wrong!  It is not bacon sauce, it is bacon dog sauce!.  Once I tried the bacon dog sauce on an actual dog, it was much better.  This sauce really brings out some of the natural flavors that a dog has.  I would recommend this product to everyone!  Just make sure to do it right.<br />- Guangzhou, China
