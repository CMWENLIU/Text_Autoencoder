This is my third Vino Italiano kit and I made a double batch of this Tuscany Rosso Magnifico to fill a 40 liter oak barrel I have ... I want to give this kit every opportunity to shine.  It's going to be my "house table wine" to enjoy with everyday meals while I wait for some of my upper end wine kits to fully mature.<br /><br />A couple of hints to better appreciate these Vino Italiano wine kits:<br /><br />1. Have realistic expectations.  These kits make a nice light to medium-bodied wine.  Beautifully red and brilliant in the glass, they are light and food friendy wines (and not necessarily great representations of their varietal).  But if you're expecting something full-bodied and inky dark like a Napa Cabernet, you're setting yourself up to be disappointed.  Keep in mind, this bottle of wine cost you $1.50 to make.  (The cost of bottles doesn't count ... you can reuse them over and over - stay green!)<br /><br />2. These wines will improve with time in the bottle.  While it's hard to resist dipping into your supply for weekly tastings, six months to a year in the bottle will make for a much nicer, less green-tasting wine.<br /><br />I'll add more to this review after I bottle this wine, but I will say that it is drinking better than the Valpolicella did at this early stage.  Less dry than the Valpolicella with a nice balance of both fruit and tannins.  I think I'll be proud to call this Rosso Magnifico my "house red."
