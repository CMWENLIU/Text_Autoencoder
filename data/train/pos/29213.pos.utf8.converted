A great alternative to just drinking water. Oolong or Wu-long is known for its medicinal properties but if this is medicine it's the best tasting medicine on the planet. I found it at my local Asian grocery store, bought a case and then couldn't find it anymore so thank you Amazon for providing a way to access it. I subscribed to get a case a month. I agree with the other reviewers about its taste, smooth and excellent when cold although I picked one up from my last case and drank it at room temperature and found it to be just as refreshing. The packaging is different in stores and the bottle looks like the Oi-ocha green tea from Ito-En but with a yellow/tan label. Happy drinking.
