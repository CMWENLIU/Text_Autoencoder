My family eats extremely healthy natural foods and we try to stay away from a lot of sugar and white flour.  I tried these when they were on sale and I have to say my kids love them.  I make them in my mini muffin pans so there are more of them.  I have also taken them to a friend's house and all my girlfriends there LOVED them.  I suppose if you are used to eating store bought muffins or mixes with all kinds of sugars/white flour in them you might not like them.  If you are used to eating more natural foods I think it's a good choice.
