So many online stores specializing in British foods are selling Heinz beans, but the shipping costs are astronomical.  I can buy these in my local Cost Plus World Market but it is $1.99 a tin.  By setting up a recurring shipment every 3 months from Amazon I am getting them for about $1.38 a tin including shipping to Colorado.  This is by far the best price I've found!<br /><br />Now, if Amazon starts selling English pork sausages and black pudding I'll be in hogs heaven.
