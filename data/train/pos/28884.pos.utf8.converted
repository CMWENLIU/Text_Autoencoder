Been an addict to this stuff when I was a kid, growing toward adulthood. Buying the rods for 10c. And I had a stroke when I found out they didn't sell them anymore in a bag. Had to buy a billion other garbage flavors in order to get the watermelon. Now, thanks to me doing a lil' hunt (and recently having quit smoking), I've gotten my hands on them.<br /><br />Worth every penny, and then some. Such a rush that these little pieces of sugar bring me to my knees, every time! Either you like them or you don't. No sense in trying to convince people of buying a product they don't want. Watermelon's always been my fave, and always will.
