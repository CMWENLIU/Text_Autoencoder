I find this product to be a fantastic alternative to the energy drinks I usually consume to get over the mid day hump. While it will not facilitate all nighters, it enhances my mood and increases my ability to focus.  It has a very clean taste with non of that chemically after taste you experience with Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, or even VitaminEnergy.  I truly feel happier, and more productive after a BrainToniq.
