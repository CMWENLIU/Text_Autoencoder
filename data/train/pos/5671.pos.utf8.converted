Yogi Tea's Mayan Cocoa Spice is a delicious blend of the spicy and sweet. Imagine the legendary Mexican mole in a cup of tea. As mole is a blend of spices with cocoa, so it is with this tea. It's got a small bit of caffeine in it. It makes one think of the savory recipes in Laura Esquivel's sensuous "Like Water for Chocolate",or the chili/chocolate blend Vianne gives to her French customers in "Chocolat." It's enchanting. It's hot chocolate disguised as a tea. Mayan Cocoa Spice is full of chocolate,spice,and everything nice!
