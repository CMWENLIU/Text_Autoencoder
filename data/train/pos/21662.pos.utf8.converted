I add this powder to a smoothie consisting of 1 cup water, local honey, and blue/purple berries.  I add a small banana as I believe this smooths out the texture.  I have a VitaMix blender and have had no problems with texture.  The berries' "grit" is more noticeable than anything.  The green taste is not unpleasant, appealing in a "fresh cut grass" versus "pond scum" way.
