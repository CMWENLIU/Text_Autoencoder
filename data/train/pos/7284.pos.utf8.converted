I too read about hibiscus tea and blood pressure and wanted to see if it works.  Well, two weeks later I can attest that it does work as my blood pressure dropped seven points!<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure if all hibiscus tea is similar in flavor but, WOW, this tea is delicious!  No honey needed!  Just brew and enjoy!  Best tea I've ever tasted!  It has a fruit-like flavor that somehow tastes semi-sweet.<br /><br />Finally, I really like the fact that this product is Fairtrade certified and organic.  It's nice to know when you purchase this product you are supporting the best farmers at fair wages.
