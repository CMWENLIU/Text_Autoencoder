I normally buy a different brand of grain-free dry cat food but I wanted to try another brand that had some different flavors and came in smaller size packages so I could rotate the flavors more often.  Both my cats love this brand and just dive right into it as soon as I put it in their dish.  I feed it to them in the morning and give them canned food in the evening, but I get the impression from them that they would rather have the dry food all the time : )  I will continue to use this brand in the future.
