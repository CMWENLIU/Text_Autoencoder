This is the first time I have ever used coconut oil and I love it!<br /><br />I first tried cooking with it--I used one tablespoon in the pan, added onion, garlic, mushrooms and peppers.  I usually use EVOO so I was a bit worried about the taste difference.  It defininely smells like coconut, but surprisingly, it is not overly strong.  The taste was pleasant with my veggies.  First try: delicious and easy.<br /><br />Next, I put some on my face as a moisturizer.  Again, the smell was pleasant and mild.  In the past I have also used EVOO on my skin because it is a milder moisturizer than a store bought facial moisturizer.  EVOO takes hours and hours to soak in, so I only use it at night before bed.  I thought the coconut oil would be similar.  I put in on in the evening and sat down to watch a movie.  It was completely absorbed before I even hit the sheets!  And by the time it was absorbed, the smell was gone (not that the smell of coconut on the skin would be a bad thing!) So it is lovely as a facial moisturizer.<br /><br />Then I read on the label that it could be used in place of butter, so I spread some on a cracker and tried it that way.  It was delicious!  I love the oily texture--similar to butter, with the coconut taste.  So it is a wonderful substitute for butter.<br /><br />I am sure I will find more uses for this incredible product and I can't wait to try it again.
