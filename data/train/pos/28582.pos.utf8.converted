Whoah! I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named "Double Sugar" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix.<br /><br />First, the good stuff. There is no doubt in my mind that Ghirardelli continues to make a distinctive, excellent quality chocolate. The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.<br /><br />Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)<br /><br />People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.<br /><br />Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.<br /><br />Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed. But overly sweet. If you don't like supersweet cocoa, pass this up. If you do love extremely sweet hot drinks, you will absolutely adore this mix.
