With only one exception I'm a serious fan of Eight O'Clock coffee. I usually maintain a supply of the 100% Columbian and the French Vanilla coffees on hand at all times.<br /><br />I also drink my coffee black so that requires the coffee to taste good with no outside help allowed; nothing to kill the taste of bad coffee. Both of these Eight O'Clock coffees perfectly fill the bill in that regard. I consider it a treat to be able to switch between the two and one time will have the Columbian and the next time the French Vanilla.<br /><br />Oh yes, the one exception is their decaf; I've discovered I prefer Melitta's Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated.<br /><br />The French Vanilla is a delightful alternative which I recommend highly; so do yourself a favor and give it a try!
