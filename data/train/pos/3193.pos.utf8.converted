I'm crazy for Thai Iced Tea, somehow my boyfriend's affinity for Malaysian food has let me this amazing drink, now I can make it at home, my joy is hard to describe. This tastes just like the tea I used to order, the sweet, date like taste of milky, caramel-y creaminess is best drank cold, this mix is insanely easy to use and believe me, tastes like the real thing. There's something alluring to this slightly harvest-spice like drink that is creamy and cool at the same time, it's like visiting India and Antarctica at the same time. It might sound strange but I promise it's easy to drink, in fact too easy, I can drink it all day.<br /><br />The tea comes in a large bag, looks just like the one pictured, inside is the loose twig like tea with small dried leaves with lemongrass pieces and spices. I heat it up in a stainless steel pot on the stove, one cup of cold water per one heaping teaspoon of tea. Boil 5 minutes, then strain through a paper towel lined mesh sieve, then cool it in the fridge. Once cold, it should be sweetened, I add simple syrup since it dissolves faster than sugar ( boil equal amounts of sugar and water, then cool and use to sweeten anything) and mix well, then pour over ice and top with evaporated milk. I drink it though a straw, and even add bubbles ( tapioca pearls) for a bubble tea like drink. This is sooo tasty and really easy to make in large amounts that I see myself making one now, good thing I have a batch chilling in the fridge as I type.<br /><br />Great and refreshing drink that is simply addictive, but still good for you, hurray!<br />- Kasia S.
