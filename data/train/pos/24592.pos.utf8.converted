I'm pretty much in concordance with Will the first reviewer. I use to drink Costa Rica Tarrazu when I bought it through Gevalia's coffee program. So when Amazon had it on sale I bought a two pack just to see if the two brands were similar. I can report yes they are. I brew mine in my B40 7.5Oz setting and what a wounder coffee it is. I love the aroma when it first starts filling my cup. A light roast with a mild after taste. Never overpowering. I drink my coffee with cream and a sugar substitute. This one wins a spot on my 10 top most favorites list<br /><br />If you like a light roast, this coffee is for you. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Hint #1 I highly suggest that you get some type water filtration system for your coffee water<br />Hint #2 I immediately remove the used K-cup after brewing and leave the K-Cup holder open to avoid<br />  the accumulation of that stale coffee smell to permeate the k-cup holder.<br /><br />UPDATE I just purchased another 2 pack of this coffee :)
