100% Raw Kelp Noodles are EXCELLENT! I use them to make the raw Pad Thai from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0825305845">Vegan Fusion World Cuisine: Healing Recipes and Timeless Wisdom from our Hearts to Yours</a> They don't need to be cooked. The best are the unusual green tea flavored ones. All they need is a good peanut sauce, fresh fruits and vegetables, and it's a filling feast. Kelp noodles, on the surface, sound icky and gross. They have the same texture as regular noodles; they're also good for people with gluten free diets. Kelp noodles are a taste delight from the sea!
