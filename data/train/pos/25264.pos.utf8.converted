This Ribbon candy is beautiful: very thin, colorful and delicious.  The candy is part of our Christmas tradition, but all the stores sold out early in our town. Ribbon candy is very fragile, yet few of these pieces were broken.  Also ribbon candy tends to melt in humidity, yet this candy was perfectly dry.  It looked beautiful in our holday candy dishes and was quickly eaten.
