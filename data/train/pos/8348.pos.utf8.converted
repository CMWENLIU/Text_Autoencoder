These used to be hard to find but is getting more available now. It is an Italian gourmet item with a gourment price, long a staple of Italian resteraunts and other resteraunts. San Pellegrino mineral water is very refreshing and comes in Lime, Lemon, orange, natural springwater, and other flavors. The variety shown here is orange. It it has real orange juice mixed in and tastes very fresh, and it includes a light amount of pulp. It is not overpowered with too much lemon or tons of sweetener like a soda, but very balanced. The spring water used in this makes it have a natural carbonation, similar in fizz to a soda. The unflavored variety is too bitter for some people, more an acquired taste. The lemon, orange, and my personal favorite lime, are good on the first sip. I reccommend the glass bottle over the cans. I prefer Orangina from France to this orange by a very slight margin, but it is very, very good.
