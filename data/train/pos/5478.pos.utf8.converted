According to two other reviewers: "The taste is remarkably fresh for canned" and "The Japanese would describe it as Umami." I quite agree with both of these observations. Some cautions, however:<br /><br />You can't just open a can and eat it as if it were a can of sardines, or even a can of oil-pack tuna. The product is extremely oily -- in fact, it is 60% oil (richer than triple-creme brie)! It happens to be a healthful oil with vitamins A and D and Omega 3 fats, but it is still a bit much. I compared the nutritional values to a somewhat smaller can of oil-packed sardines. The cod liver had less protein than one might expect -- 9 grams versus 16 for the sardines -- but off the chart on calories with 1165!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the instructions on the can (if you can read them -- they're in four languages and the tiny print requires a STRONG magnifier to see) say, "Must be consumed immediately after opening." I strongly suggest a skeptical regard to that. The "remarkably fresh" taste does change quickly even in the refrigerator, but the result is not unpleasant. A little fishier, perhaps. I kept some for over a week and it was still tasty.<br /><br />By the way, you ought not to waste the oil. It is of course sold separately as cod liver oil and is a fine nutritional supplement.<br /><br />So, I suggest a strategic approach to consuming a can. You don't want to eat it all at once (even if you have help), regardless of what the label says.
