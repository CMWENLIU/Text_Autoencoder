I became somewhat addicted to Mango Madness at work. There was a coffee shop at my office that sold the delicious smoothie for $5.50 to $6.50 depending on the size. I'd get a smoothie at least twice a week. Luckily, one of the staff members told me which brand they used before the coffee shop moved.<br /><br />After searching the Internet I discovered the smoothie mix on Amazon and it happened to be a special item for that month. I ended up purchasing the Mango Madness, Peach Pizzazz, and Pineapple Coconut smoothie mixes and got $20 discount. The products are great and well worth the price even without the $20 discount. I spent more than the regular price in a month  just on smoothies from the coffee shop.<br /><br />The smoothies made with this mix have a bright mango flavor, and you can vary the amount of smoothie mix to change the sweetness. Best of all there's no high fructose corn syrup and it's loaded with vitamin C.  If you're like me and have smoothies often from a smoothie or coffee shop then the product pays for itself after using the first bottle which makes the two pack a great deal.
