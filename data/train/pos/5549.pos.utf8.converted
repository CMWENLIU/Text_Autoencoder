Extremely fast shipping. This hard to find dessert is sort of like a cross between jello and pudding, but easier to make and absolutely yummy. 2 cups of water in a microwave bowl, nuke 2 minutes, stir, nuke 2 more minutes, stir, and it's ready. Directions call for 6 minutes, but we only needed 4. I especially like it in a graham cracker crust, hubby likes it straight up. Excellant product.
