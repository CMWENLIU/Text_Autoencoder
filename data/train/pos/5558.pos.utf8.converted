Ok, Starbucks is awesome too, but this coffee is an acquired taste and is without the doubt the most unique and great tasting coffee.<br /><br />Since it has chicory, you do not mix as much as you would normal coffee. (To be precise, you would mix about half as you normally would).<br /><br />However, even know it is robust, it still contains less caffeine then normal coffee. By the way, chicory is extremely healthy for you.<br /><br />Try it today, taste what New Orleans has had for well over 140 + years.
