If you are a loose leaf tea drinker then this little gadget should be a permanent part of your life. I bought several. Work, home, car, travel bag. Cleans easily, folds up small and handy, works great. Cannot ask for more than that. A pleasure not to depend on tea bags in a hotel. Of course you have to carry the tea also for most of the places. At home I use a multi-cup tea maker but once in a while I want just one quick cup and using this steeper is perfect.
