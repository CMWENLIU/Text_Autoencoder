We just love this mustard!  Excellent flavor!  Great deal on Amazon.  The subscribe and save plan from Amazon is great & you can cancel & change your plan anytime you want.  It is well worth it.  Organic!  Only one bad thing about it, it's in plastic.  If it was in glass (like Eden) then wooo weee!  Simply perfect!  I have a awesome recipe you can try out using this mustard.  I was thinking that a pack of 6 might seem like too much mustard for most.  But if you try this delicious recipe, you might find that 6 aren't enough!<br /><br />Roasted Potatoes Dijion<br /><br />1/2 C Dijion Mustard<br />1/2 C Olive Oil<br />3 Lbs Red Potatoes, Cut into 1 1/2" pcs.<br />2 Med Red Onions, sliced (aprox. 1.5 C)<br />Chopped Parsely for garnish (if you don't have fresh parsely it rocks without it!)<br /><br />In a small bowl, combine mustard & oil.<br />In a large bowl, combine potatoes, onions, and the mustard mixture.  Toss to coat well.<br />Spread evenly on a baking sheet.<br />Bake at 400F for 45-50 min. or until potatoes are tender and crispy.<br />Garnish with chopped parsley.<br /><br />Yum!  Enjoy! :o)
