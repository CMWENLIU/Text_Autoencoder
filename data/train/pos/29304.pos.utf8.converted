This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, "Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink."  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!
