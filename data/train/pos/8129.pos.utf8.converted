Very Smooth taste.  To me, this acai & pomegranate is very good. The pineapple flavor is still my favorite, with the acai second, and the mango peach is my least favorite of the 3 flavors.<br /><br />This flavor is light and refreshing, like water with a smooth berry and coconut flavor added. It doesn't taste phony either. It is 100% natural and it tastes natural. Too good to be just flavored water. It tastes more like a light fruit juice. I had mine chilled. It is imported from Brazil. A plastic twist-off cap allows you to stick in a straw easily, without hammering the package to punch it through. A single package is about 6 inches high, with 3 inch diagonal square shape.<br /><br />One paper coated package contains 17 fluid ounces/500 ml, marked as 2 servings. Per serving stats are 60 calories (so 120 calories total per package), 0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 30mg sodium, 515 mg potassium, 15g sugar, 4 % calcium, 4 % phosphorus, 180 % vitamin C, 8 % magnesium, 1 g protein. Ingredients, as listed in order on package are: natural coconut water, mango puree, peach puree, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The package states it is 100 % natural, has more electrolytes than leading sports drinks with 15 times the potassium, and has more potassium than 2 bananas.<br /><br />So--- it is good, refreshing, healthy, easily packable, and easily openable. (It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on "potassium" before the heat gets here.
