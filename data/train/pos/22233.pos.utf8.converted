I received this red palm oil about 3 days ago. It is absolutely delicious. We consume it straight from the jar as an anti-oxidant supplement.<br />It smells like a mild spice but when consumed tastes like carrot puree. And since I love carrots, this is awesome :)<br /><br />The only bad thing is that I didn't order more...
