I've been enjoying black, green, and herbal teas for years. Normally I keep a good supply of both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BN4">Bigelow English Teatime Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRM6">Bigelow Decaffeinated Organic Green Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> in the pantry. Recently my wife was given a "Variety Pack" of Good Earth teas and this particular tea was included. I'm a morning coffee drinker but after my two cups of French pressed Colombian Joe to get the motor running I switch to tea; normally a cup or two of the aforementioned Bigelow English Breakfast tea and as the day progresses I like to decrease the caffeine intake so I switch over to the Bigelow Green which is a decaffeinated tea. However, as teas go, green tea is relatively low in caffeine so the idea of switching to a regular, caffeinated green tea, really didn't bother me. Anyway, as soon as I enjoyed my first cup of this particular tea I new I had to make room in the cupboard; at least until I finished my supply of the Bigelow green.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed and enjoyed about this tea was the wonderful bouquet like aroma. Just like with a fine red wine the initial aroma/bouquet is part of the experience of enjoying good wine and flavored hot beverages. After the delicious aroma test passed with flying colors it was not surprising that the taste test would be at least equally if not more satisfying. Indeed it tasted delicious.<br /><br />As with any good quality green tea the flavor was fresh, light, and a bit grassy or "green". I was previously not familiar with "Matcha" or "Sencha", two of the three flavor additions to this tea but thanks to the internet, information about darned near anything is always nearby. I'm not going to Wikipedia you about Matcha and Sencha but suffice it to say they are both other forms of Japanese green teas that do in fact pack a powerful additional punch of antioxidants genuinely verifying the company's advertisment of "...more antioxidants".<br /><br />Allegedly this tea has 70% more antioxidants than their "Standard Green Tea". This claim though, stretches the truth. Comparing the two products nutritional information: Good Earth's Super Green Tea has 162mg avg. antioxidants per serving whereas their Standard Green Tea has 108mg avg. per serving. According to my calculator that's 50% more (162/108 = 1.5) It annoys me when companies make misleading claims. In cases such as this though I find it simply hard to understand why they would stretch the truth. Based upon the product as it stands, they really don't need to inflate this percentage. The tea is delicious, it's got more antioxidants, why don't they print that or print that "our Standard Green Tea has 67% fewer antioxidants than our Super Green Tea! LOL. Okay so that whole thing I wrote about the percentage of antioxidants is really pretty irrelevant, I know, but I had fun doing it. Sorry if I lost you, it's just all in good fun.<br /><br />The real FLAVOR FLASH in this Super Green Tea is the ORANGE. I think it's great. It tastes like they've added just the right amount of fresh orange zest to set this green tea apart from unflavored ones and it's a combination that works. And why shouldn't it? Citrus flavoring with tea is certainly nothing new.<br /><br />Now the claim that follows is my own and it is supported by the following facts and data: At the time of this writing there were eleven customer reviews on Amazon's Web site for this product. Ten of those reviews were positive (i.e. 4 or 5 stars) and one was neutral (3 stars). By my calculator that means that 91.7& (rounded) of the population really like this tea and NOBODY dislikes it. Based upon the facts and data I think it's safe to buy some for yourself. But, you may well be an outlier and not like it at all so, to be really safe and smart, if you haven't already tried it, buy a box at your local grocery store. If you like it come back to Amazon and get in on their Subscribe and Save Program.<br /><br />I like buying Bigelow brand teas primarily because I like their flavor and believe they use fresh high quality teas, but also, and nearly equally as important, is because of how they are packaged; that is each tea bag is individually packaged in a fully sealed foil-like pouch. While this certainly adds to the cost it also helps assure freshness is maintained; an absolutely essential element in ensuring a good cup of tea. This variety of Good Earth tea is packaged in the same, high quality, freshness maintaining manner.<br /><br />Just a final general note on brewing green tea: Just as you would brew any other kind of tea, whether you have bagged tea or loose green tea, one thing to watch out for: Don't use fully boiling water. Green tea is more delicate than black, so it's best to keep the water a little cooler. Brewing when your water is just about to hit the boil is ideal.<br /><br />Bon appetit!
