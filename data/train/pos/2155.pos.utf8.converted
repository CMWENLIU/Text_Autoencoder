This is among one of my favorites out of the other Gold Kili drinks. Since it's sweetened with honey, the taste is more natural and I don't feel as bad drinking a lot of it. I mostly drink it cold, like any other beverage, but it's also good when hot. I think it's the best remedy when I get indigestion; it's very soothing and really settles my stomach.
