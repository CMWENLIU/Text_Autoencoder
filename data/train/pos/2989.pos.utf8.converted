A couple years back I developed an intolerance to caffeine that sent me to the emergency room.  I have been seaching for a substitute but nearly every similar product contains varying amounts of caffeine.  Even decaf coffees and teas still contan a small amount of the drug.  Two months back I ordered two 100 bag boxes of Windsor and it has been a great substitue for my morning coffee.  I still miss that kick I got from my morning cup of coffee but that is one experience I do not wish to repeat.<br /><br />Coca tea has a very delicate taste but the taste is enhanced with a small amount of sugar is added.  Honey has such a distinctive flavor of its own that it would totally mask the flavor of the coca tea.<br /><br />I spent over two years in Bolivia with the Peace Corps and the tea brings back fond memories of my days in that country.<br /><br />Would I purchase the product again?  Yes!  In fact, I have already ordered two more boxes.
