These are, by far, the best Ramen Noodles I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I practically lived on this stuff when I was in college.  A packet is included containing the spices which allows you to control the level of heat in the dish by adding more or less of the contents to the noodles.  One important note, the spices provide a tasty spicy hot, not a hot-just-to-be-hot flavor.
