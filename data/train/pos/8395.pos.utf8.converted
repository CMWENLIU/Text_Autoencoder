I've owned a Senseo machine for three or four years, and I generally like most of their coffees.  This breakfast blend is particularly good.<br /><br />Though I don't much like the pretentious phrasing one sees in reviews by experts, I can say that the breakfast blend is just a bit more robust than the ordinary medium roast, but a bit less than the dark roast.  It's a great coffee to have with a breakfast roll while you're reading the paper.<br /><br />I learned by experimenting that one breakfast blend pod and one decaf medium roast pod make a very good cup of "half-caf" for those who are prone to the caffeine jitters if they drink regular coffee.<br /><br />In summary, the breakfast blend pods combine the convenience of the Senseo system with a very good morning coffee.<br /><br />One bit of advice:  If you use Amazon's "subscribe and save" system, you can save a considerable amount of money on Senseo pods.  You get 15% off of the regular price and free shipping; the net savings on a 4-bag box of the breakfast blend is about $[...].
