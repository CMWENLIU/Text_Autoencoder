I am going to reveal my secret for the most awesome cup of coffee, guaranteed to make any woman love you.<br /><br />1. Get a Bialetti Mokka Pot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVC9JW">Bialetti Moka Express 3 Cup Espresso Maker 06799</a><br /><br />2. Get a Saeco Conical Burr Grinder. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V64IRO">Saeco GT-1 Titan Conical Burr Grinder</a><br /><br />3. Get some Lavazza Crema e Aroma beans.<br /><br />Procedure:<br />1. Grind the beans FRESH in the conical burr grinder. The Burr Grinder makes a HUGE DIFFERENCE since it gives an even grind and SQUEEZES out the oils from the beans. Cheap grinders just "blade smash" the beans. You can taste the difference, trust me.<br /><br />2. fill the mokka pot with the fresh grind, BUT DO NOT PACK IT IN.<br /><br />3. Set on stove, high heat, and wait for the sound... you'll know it when you hear it.<br /><br />4. Pour and serve.<br /><br />Three guarantees:<br />1. best cup of coffee ever.<br />2. the woman you make it for will love you forever.<br />3. You'll be awake for 8 hours.<br /><br />Your welcome.
