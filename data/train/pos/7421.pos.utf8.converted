This gelatin tastes great and is very simple to make. I usually make it (at the last minute) and put it in the freezer for about 90 minutes and it is ready to go.  I like that the flavors are natural and not artificial, like Jell-o.<br /><br />The cost is higher than Jell-o, but it is worth it. Tastes better, no aspartame, "high" fiber, and natural flavors.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who already enjoys Jell-o but is looking to get away from aspartame and the other chemicals in Jell-o. Even if you eat the entire package, it is only 80 calories!<br /><br />I would also would recommend this to anyone on Atkins, since it easily fits within the induction phase (and all other phases). Nice way to get a sweet treat and stay on track with weight loss.
