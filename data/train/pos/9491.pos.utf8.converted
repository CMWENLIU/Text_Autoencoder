I was searching for a great hot chocolate mix to replace my beloved Ghiradelli mix. I had recently learned that most American chocolate companies are still buying cocoa from slavers.  (Forbes Magazine ran a recent article about it.)  I couldn't find a good fair trade cocoa in town, but Omanhene was on amazon. I ordered it and loved it! It is not as sweet as i am used to. I use three tablespoons to make a cup.  But it is delicious, and as far as i can ascertain, the farmers involved don't enslave children.
