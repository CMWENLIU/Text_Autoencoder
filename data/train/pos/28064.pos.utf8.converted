We're always looking for healthier alternatives to carbo and sugar loaded snacks for ourselves and our kids.  Jerkey is one they seem to really like as do we.  I have been a long time consumer of SnackMaster's Turkey and Beef Jerky.  Unfortunately, my grocery store stopped carrying it so I decided to order it online.  If you check the ingredients of SnackMaster's Jerky there are fewer chemicals and preservatives then other leading brands of Jerky.  That's why we continue to be satisfied customers.
