I'm pretty picky when it comes to waffles.  We spent a small fortune on our waffle maker (Chefs Choice Pro 850) and was determined to find the perfect waffle recipe as well.  So when my husband bought this MIX, I was hesitant - how could anything out of a can be better than homemade? Well, I soon "ate" my words and needless to say was delightfully surprised.  This mix is just as good - if not better - than anything I've made from scratch.  Yes, it's THAT GOOD.  Nothing compares.  I could eat waffles for every meaal thanks to my new waffle maker & Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle mix.  Can't find the mix in local grocery stores so we order it online from Amazon to get free shipping.
