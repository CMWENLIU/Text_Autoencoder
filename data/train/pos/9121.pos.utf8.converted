My husband and I recently took a 1 day trip to NYC and while there we tried to get the best NY dining experience, so we ate at Carnegie Deli, where I had to try the "egg cream" - I loved it!  When I got home, I tried to replicate the drink with hershey's syrup - it was horrible!!!  I went on line and learned that true New Yorkers used only fox's u-bet, so I ordered some.  It did not disappoint!  This syrup is not gritty like Hershey's tends to be, has a fudgy taste and best of all stays emulsified in the milk and doesn't settle to the bottom of the glass.
