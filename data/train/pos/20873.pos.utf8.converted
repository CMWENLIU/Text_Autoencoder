When I was a kid, I used to buy boxes full of bubble gum balls and chew them while poring over my latest haul of Marvel and DC comic books.  Other gums have come and gone since then, but these days Dubble Bubble is my favorite gumball - although now I chew them while looking at a computer screen.<br /><br />Awhile back I discovered that a local department store chain stocked 20-ounce milk carton-style packages of Dubble Bubble.  I immediately began buying them for work so I could freshen my breath in an enjoyable fashion after drinking coffee or eating lunch.  Soon, one of my coworkers got addicted to them as well.  So we worked out a deal.  He buys the donuts, and I buy the Dubble Bubble.  Nice.<br /><br />As for the taste - well, back in the day I used to eat them by color, and my favorites were the red (Cherry) and pink (Strawberry).  But now I just take whatever spills out of the carton because they're all good to me.  Yeah, the flavor goes away fairly quickly, and I wish it lasted longer.  However, it's a good excuse to pop in a couple more balls.<br /><br />And what about blowing bubbles, you might ask?  Well, I've never come close to the massive bubbles I used to create with Bubblicious.  I just blew one the size of an orange with a ten-ball wad of Dubble Bubble, so perhaps greater feats of bubble creation are possible.  At least now I don't have to worry about getting gum gnarled in my hair - one of the perks of male pattern baldness, I suppose.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble gumballs are a great pick-me-up, and they smell better on my breath than stale coffee.  Of course, they aren't the healthiest snack around due to the corn syrup flavoring.  But then again, life is 100% fatal, and it's usually the little things - like bubble gum and comic books - that smooth over the rough spots and make it fun.
