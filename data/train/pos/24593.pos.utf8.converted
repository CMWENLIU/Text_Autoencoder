Amazon placed the Van Houtte blends on sale recently.  I had tried Van Houtte coffees on a trip to Canada and really enjoyed them. I figured the K-Cups would probably stack up to the batch brewed coffee I had on my trip.  My thought turned out to be correct.  The Costa Rica Tarrazu is a very smooth, medium roast. It has a bright, slightly sweet and lightly acidic flavor, followed by a pleasant, lingering finish with no bitterness. The aroma when brewing is pleasant. I don't use milk or sugar in my coffee, so I'm not fond of really acidic roasts. This is one of the better K-Cups I have tried.<br /><br />Not for you if you like a very dark roast. But if you appreciate a good City roast, definitely put this one on your list. I'll be a repeat customer.
