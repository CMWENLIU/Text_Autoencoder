I always have a couple of these in my diaper bag!  We bought the case for our recent vacation and they worked out so great! No washing bottles at the hotel or needing a refrigerator or cooler.  I reccomend that you buy a 3 pack of those super cheap evenflo bottles just to use the nipple and ring.  We bought a pack of these for $2.99 and use the rings/nipples everytime since our Avent ones don't fit.  Love these ready to feed bottles!!
