What could be more reflective of South Louisiana than a cup of Community Coffee? No smooth, suave Starbucks. No flavored creams. Just the pure, bold taste of Community Coffee.<br /><br />You know how the reptilian brain "remembers" aromas you "forgot"? Bring on a taste or odor from years ago and the reptilian brain will recognize it. That's what happened yesterday when I had coffee at my mother and brother's house. My brother had switched coffee brands and made a pot of Community. At first whiff, my brain raced back to my grandmother's house and the Community in her drip pot. Pure bliss!<br /><br />And, yes, my brain flashed back to Lake Charles, where I taught for the first five years of my teaching career. The -ex's grandparents and aunt lived in Lake Charles. They, too, drank Community Coffee. There really is no accurate way to describe the taste and aroma of Community, other than: It tastes and smells like South Louisiana!<br /><br />The package itself says Community is made from 100% imported Arabica beans, roasted, packed, and distributed out of Baton Rouge. "Then through generations of roasting experience, we achieve a full-bodied, yet smooth flavor that reflects the extraordinary culinary traditions of Louisiana" (taken from the back of the package). I chose Medium Roast (rich and smooth) from selections of Dark, Between, and Medium.<br /><br />Just brew, pour, and enjoy! You have a cup of South Louisiana to savor.
