OK, writing a review for a ceral seems silly for an adult. But I really like Skinner's Raisen Bran, and it's hard to get. My local supermarkets will sometimes carry it for awhile, but then stop carrying it, leaving me "high and dry." They all carry Uncle Sam Cereal from the same company: US Mills. Having Skinner's available here on Amazon is great.<br /><br />Skinner's Raisen Bran claims to be the first raisen bran, introduced in 1926. That may be, but what's unique about it is that the cereal flakes are not formed by grinding up the grain, making it into a paste, and then forming it into flakes. Skinner's uses toasted whole grain wheat flakes complete with the bran and germ. It's a refreshing eye-opener after spending a lifetime eating typical American cereals and other brands of raisen bran.<br /><br />In addition, Skinner's doesn't seem to coat their raisens with granuals of sugar. Who needs sugar on a sweet raisen?! Well, apparently just about all major brands of raisen bran think that you want it. Look at the raisens next time. It's quite silly. Plus, it's really just wasted sugar calories if you're watching such things.<br /><br />Skinner's is not for everyone, though. Since people are used to the more processed flakes in other cereals, they may not like the crisp, clean crunch of Skinner's. I prefer it. The un-sugared raisens are a bonus too. Personally, I think the "health food" supermarket isles and stores should all carry Skinner's. They carry other "healthy" brands of raisen bran, and those are horrid; they taste like eating cardboard! Give Skinner's a try!
