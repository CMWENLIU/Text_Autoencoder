My review of the literature suggested xylitol gum to reduce or prevent ear infections. My son had several ear infections after bouts with allergies and one dose of penicillin for the infection nearly landed him in the hospital due to a severe allergic reaction.<br /><br />My choice is to be proactive and reduce the bacteria in the mouth that migrates and causes ear infections. The gum tastes great and he hasn't had an ear infection since. WE bought him the toothpaste too and he brushes all the time with it.
