Each steamed green tea bag contains a dozen or so roasted grains of brown rice.  I'm a fan of rice in general, but I've never had it as an accent to tea before this.  It's delicious, giving off an earthy aroma I've grown to crave.<br /><br />The green tea leaves themselves are also excellent, delicate and super-fresh, effectively quadruple sealed inside the tea bag, then the airtight aluminum wrapper, then in plastic-wrapped containers of several tea bags each, then inside the main package itself.<br /><br />Freshness, full flavor, great hot or cold . . . great when concentrated, regular strength, or watered down (like in an iced tea pitcher) . . . I just placed my third order for this item.  It will remain a fixture in my home.  Everyone who has tasted it has been impressed.<br /><br />I have had some green teas which were more refined . . . but none tasted as good.  If you enjoy green tea, order with confidence and enjoy :)
