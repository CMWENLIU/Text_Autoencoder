This tea mix is just like the real things you get in thai resturant.<br />I'm so glad I read the other reviews and bought this.  I also made this in the coffee pot, 1 teaspoon per 1 c. of water.  Excellent.  I then used condense milk to sweeten it.  AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWesome!<br />Excellent service from Import Foods.  I placed the order on Monday and received it, priority mail on Friday.  Very pleased with the product and the company.
