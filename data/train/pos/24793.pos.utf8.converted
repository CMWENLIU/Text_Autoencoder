Previously, we usually stayed away from whole wheat pasta because we didn't like the texture of those we tried (they tended to be either too chewy or too "grainy" for our taste, no matter how we cooked them). The bionaturae Organic Whole Wheat Fusilli are a whole different story. Not only do they taste great, but the texture is also very similar to that of good regular pasta. That's not to say that the texture is the _same_ as that of regular pasta, but it's a very good texture. So if hang-ups about texture kept you away from whole wheat pasta in the past, you may want to give this one a shot.
