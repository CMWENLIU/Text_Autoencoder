*****<br />This Ginkgo IQ Tea from Yogi Tea is a delicious herbal blend. It has a slightly sweet taste---due to organic licorice root--and is herb-y and complex. Ginkgo IQ Tea is formulated for "Clarity of Mind", or, in other words, "to help stimulate cerebral function by refreshing brain cells with an abundance or blood and oxygen". I'm not sure if it does this for me; however, it certainly is refreshing. My husband likes it too, and his tastes are away from healthy-type drinks, preferring high fructose corn syrup sweetened juices and aspartame (which he adds to Ginkgo IQ Tea) sweetened sodas; still he will drink this tea, which is saying something.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Ginkgo IQ Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea is another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />The ingredients in this herbal teasan are: organic ginkgo leaf, organic ginkgo leaf extract, organic rhodiola rosea extract, and 14 additional organic herbs. It also contains organic lemon flavor and ascorbic acid. Altogether, the tea is 98% organic.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially as an alternative to caffeine.<br />*****
