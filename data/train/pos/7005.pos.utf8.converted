If you have never tried this product with an interesting name...do so.  I had it on a recent trip to Moscow, Russia and immediately searched for it once I returned to the USA.  It is a very tasy and versatile food.  I have it for breakfast, cold with spices, chopped veggies and mayo as a salad and reheated with veggies and pasta for a quick snack or light meal.
