Absolutely delicious and super handy shelf-stable asceptic lowfat organic milk. Saves time and gas money when I'm out of milk and but need a cup or two; an easy way to live a "greener" life by not driving unnecessarily. In the Olympia area, the cartons can also be recycled; check to see if they can in your area.<br /><br />These little cartons have earned a permanent spot in my pantry, in fact I've signed up for Amazon's subscriber service where they will automatically send out a box of them at an interval I chose. What could be more convenient?
