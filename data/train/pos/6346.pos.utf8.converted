I discovered Redline by accident and am glad to this day that i did discover it. I have tried every energy drink on the planet and non work, I'am able to drink 5 Redbulls and still feel nothing. Redline on the other hand WORKS! It has a great taste, tastes super sweet when its warm. If you ever need a quick energy rush Redline is for you, sip it over time to get an intermediate energy hype or slam the bottle and in about 20 minutes you will be bouncing off the walls and will not be able to stop. The only problem is if you do slam it after about 2 hours you'll crash pretty hard, but to counter that drink a lot of water and eat spoon fulls of peanut butter (not joking). All in all Redline works unbelievable wanders for those in need of amazing amount of energy, this stuff should be sold illegally in alley ways its so powerful. What could it hurt to just try it?
