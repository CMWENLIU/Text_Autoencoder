I only use Arrowroot now for thickening sauces and gravies.  It works much better than other gluten free flours and you use less so there is less chance of adding an unwanted flour taste to the end result.  And of course I LOVE Barry Farms; their delivery has always been trouble free and the communication is excellent.  The product is always exactly as described and I'm fully confident in all their gluten free products!  Love you guys.
