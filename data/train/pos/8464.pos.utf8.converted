I agree 100% with "nuttinbutdtruth"--this coffee is great and, thankfully, does not have the Starbucks "burnt" flavor which comes from roasting the beans to a higher internal bean temperature (i.e., burning them).  The Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is smooth with a real coffee flavor.  I have also bought Eight O' Clock Original coffee, and it tastes similar to the Colombian--both are great tasting and apparently are American Roast ("American Roast is a light to medium roast...This roast results in a full bodied, acidic cup of coffee.").<br /><br />Starbucks coffee, on the other hand, tastes to me like French Roast ("French roast is similar to Espresso roast only a little bit darker. This roasting style produces a full bodied coffee that has low acidity and a dominating bittersweet flavor.") or maybe Italian Roast ("Italian roasted coffee beans are nearly completely black in color. This roasting style produces a coffee that is very weak bodied with strong burnt flavors and low acidity.").  Each to their own, but according to many coffee experts, "...acidity is a good thing when it comes to coffee", and as stated on one coffee website: "In actuality the medium roast better preserves the true coffee bean as the darker roasts burn off some of the natural coffee oils and cause it to have a harsher taste. The medium roasts allow you to better savoir the way the coffee bean was intended to taste."  Also, according to the same website: "A darker roast can actually make a lower quality coffee bean taste better. The bean no longer relies on the flavors from its origin and leans more on the burnt flavor that results from the darker roasting process."<br /><br />According to another coffee website: "Maximum aroma and flavor, is generally found at the lighter end of the dark range. At the darkest end of the dark range, coffee has lost all of its acidity and has a distinctly burnt flavor."  And according to Wikipedia: "At lighter roasts, the bean will exhibit more of its 'origin flavor'; the flavors created in the bean by the soil and weather conditions in the location where it was grown. Coffee beans from famous regions like Java, Kenya, Hawaiian Kona, and Jamaican Blue Mountain are usually roasted lightly so their signature characteristics dominate the flavor. As the beans darken to a deep brown, the origin flavors of the bean are eclipsed by the flavors created by the roasting process itself. At darker roasts, the 'roast flavor' is so dominant that it can be difficult to distinguish the origin of the beans used in the roast."<br /><br />As a fan of American Roast coffee with a truer coffee bean flavor, I think this Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is extremely hard to beat.  It is also reasonably priced.
