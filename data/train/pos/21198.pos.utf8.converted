Okay, so you have to add your own onion and bread.....adding these fresh is a good thing.  This is meant to be a starter mix of seasonings, not an add water and eat soup.  The flavoring of this mix is excellent!  I tried this out on friends and added homemade italian bread and sharp white cheddar cheese and we decided it was the best french onion soup ever!  I have tried onion soups from MANY restaurants in search of the perfect french onion soup and have found ones equal, but none better than this combination.  A friend who also tried this mix has worked at several high end restaurants and with our combination of bread and cheese, she said none of them can match the quality of our homemade soup!  Yes, we could tinker with seasoning combinations to try to match Cugino's, but why bother when Cugino's has already put together the perfect blend.<br /><br />Okay, the sodium content is high, but most good french onion soups are.  And I would agree with the other reviewer to double the amount of onions added because one onion is just not enough.<br /><br />The proper bread and cheese do make a big difference for french onion soups, so don't skimp on quality there and you should be very pleased with this mix.
