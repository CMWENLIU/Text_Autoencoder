Before I bought this sprouter, I used a jar with a screen lid on it and had failure after failure. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but it seemed like I never could get those alfalfa sprouts to "sprout maturity"! Since I got this baby, I am the green queen of sprouting! (at least I feel like it...)I was a little concerned about the plastic stuff, but it seems very stable and does not impart any plastic "flavor" to the greens. I am so pumped that I am moving on to other sproutables. It is very easy to use, and I rinse once in the morning and once before I go to bed. That seems to be enough, but you can rinse more often. I have good water (no chlorine or fluoride) and with this tray my sprouts grow, grow, grow!<br /><br />When I'm ready to harvest them, the "mat" they form is easy to sort of peel up. I put them in a large salad spinner and fill it with water and sort of loosen them up, freeing the hulls to float on the top. Then I get a small strainer (everyone has one of those, right?) and put it over the kitchen sink drain and pour out the water into the strainer. That's where the hulls go (then into the compost bin) instead of down the drain! Then, I whir the salad spinner and get the sprouts "dry" and in they go to a container in the fridge with the lid cracked--so they can "breathe" a little bit.<br /><br />I have been doing this since I started growing with this sprouter. I understand you can actually stack these to grow more, but I will have to wait a bit before I become that adventurous.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, one more thing....After you soak the seeds for 6 or more hours (directions come with the sprouter or you can go to their website) and have them in the sprouter, I adjust the lid so it's open about an inch. Gives them room to breathe.<br /><br />Get it! Your body will thank you for growing LIVE food for it! Be good to yourself and discover sprouting---so much CHEAPER than the stores!!
