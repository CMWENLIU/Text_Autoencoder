I have 6 cats and I love this product.  I don't have to worry about the clay getting digested by my cats or my family for that matter.  One of my cats was getting sick from the clay, so I tried this since it was natural.  Voila, healthy kitties!!<br /><br />Sure it may not work in new fangled litter boxes but I don't think it was made to do that.  It's a scoop litter that must sit for probably more than 10 min. to stay in a ball.<br /><br />I love it and that's all that counts to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Plus this price is awesome.  I usually have to travel 2 and a half hours to get this so the shipping is worth my gas and travel time!!  Thank you!!!
