I have being pilling my cat, Kushka, who has chronic renal failure quite successfully for the last couple of weeks using salmon flavored pill pockets. The salmon flavor in them appears to be quite strong, strong enough that it brings all 4 of my cats running from wherever they are in the house whenever I open the packet; and strong enough to overcome the taste of the pill. After I give Kushka her pill pocket, I immediately start handing out salmon flavor Wicker Lickens treats to my other 3 cats, including 4 or 5 of them to Kushka.  The treats for my other cats are so not to show favoritism, but they still think Kushka is getting the best treat (but since other treats are only around a dollar a package, the pill pockets are only for pills).  I do really love the pill pockets, for  Kushka has been a real terror to pill, even when I used a piller;  beside scathing and fighting me, she also bit, and not friendly bites either, but bleeding puncher wounds (this from a normally very passive, affectionate Himalayan). I had never had to give her a pill before she was diagnosed with CRF 2 months ago, she had never been sick before in all 12 years of her life. Now, with the pill pockets I just open a packet and she comes running to get it.  I have even stated given her night dose of pepcid AC in a pill pocket as her reward for being good during her nightly subcutaneous injection of fluids.
