If there is a Heaven, I know that one day I will be happy.  I say this because if there is, it is filled with these fantastically amazing treats.  Seriously, these are the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  And I am fat.  I've eaten lots of things.  Buy them.  You won't be disappointed.  You might punch someone who thinks you want to share them.  That's the only real downside about them.  They are so good.  They are so good.  Oh, yes, they are sooooooo good!
