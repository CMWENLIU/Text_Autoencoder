I've always had to acknowledge that I can drink bad coffee but I can't drink bad tea. That means, when I go to a restaurant, I always order coffee as I can live with it if it's not great. I can't do that with tea so I only drink tea at home.<br /><br />The blend of teas that Taylors have put together for this bagged tea is phenomenal. Nothing comes close in my opinion and I drink about 5 cups of THIS tea a day. I've given up trying other blends as I'm invariably left disappointed and always end coming back to the original "Yorkshire Tea".<br /><br />For years I've asked my parents who still live in England (actually in Harrogate since they retired) to ship me boxes of this tea regularly as it wasn't available over here in the US (unless you wanted to pay a fortune for it). Now Amazon has made it easy for me to get the ONLY tea I enjoy drinking and at a price comparable with the junk you'll find at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Buy this tea, you won't be disappointed. Don't get the Gold blend thinking you're getting something special. It's an entirely different blend and not as good as it tastes very bitter in my opinion.<br /><br />To enjoy to the fullest, drink with milk and sugar. Oh, and buy a tea pot as the bags make up two cups.
