I'm not an avid consumer of energy drinks; I occasionally drink Red Bull or, more recently, FRS to get me through tired spells at work and into the gym.  Those helped, but you felt a noticeable loss of energy and attention after the effects wore off.  I don't know the science behind Orbana - I understand it is the most healthy, natural of its kind on the market (although I never really believe those claims) - but what i can attest to is a heightened energy level over a sustained period.  You don't notice the come down; rather, there is no come down. And you don't become dependent on it.<br /><br />In short, it works. And for me at least, its better than Red Bull, Lucozade, Gatorade or FRS. 2 thumbs up!
