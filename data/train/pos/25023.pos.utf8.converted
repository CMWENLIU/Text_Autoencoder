i have 3 senior dogs who are very fussy eaters that have refused to eat any can foods that i have bought at the store. a friend told me about canidae, i took a chance and tried it, and my dogs loved it! they have gained weight, which they needed, and are acting much more youthful, i will keep buying the food for them! the ingredients are very nutritional, and are much better then anything i can find at the local stores!
