Love this stuff. But as you notice, the price jump from around 4 dollars with S/S to 8-10 dollars the last week or two is just amazon trying to catch subscribers that sign up to pay for double the price.<br />I wish amazon would lock in the prices on subscription stuff when you purchase it the first time (lock in price) , but they don't , so buyer beware.<br />If you can get it for around 4 dollars get it. :)
