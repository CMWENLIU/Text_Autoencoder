I love this taco seasoning!<br /><br />Growing up, my mom always bought taco seasoning in this bulk container because we had taco's so frequently.<br /><br />I didn't realize why she used the bulk container for seasoning until I had to start buying my own groceries - and I realized that taco seasoning was over a dollar a package!<br /><br />I like this container because you can customize how much seasoning and spice to add to the taco meat.  I also cook my taco meat with onion and I drain the fat before adding spices.  I add enough water to cover the meat before adding spices so the meat is all equally flavored.  I just cook on medium head until the water evaporates.<br /><br />Very yummy flavoring - I recommend to everyone!!
