I eat this everyday for breakfast, always with yogurt. This is no BS stuff. There's nothing but goodness listed on the ingredients.<br /><br />Some serving suggestions:<br />-Muesli + Yogurt + Honey<br />-Muesli + Yogurt + sliced, canned peaches<br />-Muesli + Yogurt + tablespoon preserves<br /><br />Gave a bag to my mom and she has me ordering more already. She made the cookies from the recipe on the back of the bag and even those were delicious.<br /><br />I keep one bag out on the counter and the other 3 in the freezer until needed. They've held up perfectly in there.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
