For those that are looking for the ingredient list check out the Betty Crocker website - they have a great gluten free section for the new products.<br /><br />When mixing the ingredients don't be alarmed that the batter is very crumbly.  We used a round ice cream scoop when putting on the baking sheet - worked fabulously!  The result is a buttery, chewy delicious cookie!  My daughter made them with her friend and her friend brought some home to share with her family...they had no clue they were gluten free.  I would buy this over and over again!
