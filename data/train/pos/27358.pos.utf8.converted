My senior (14+ yrs.) MinPin has severe digestive issues.  Natural Balance L.I.D. food has been the only thing she can tolerate so it has literally been a life-saver for her.  She is a very picky eater but she loves the duck & potato formula and eats this food better than any others we have tried. I truly believe we would have lost her long ago without this food.
