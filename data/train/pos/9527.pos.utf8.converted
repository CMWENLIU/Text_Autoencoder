This product is awesome.  It has a wonderful taste and gives baked goods a tender texture.  It remains solid at room temperature, so I scrape what I want out of the jar into a plastic container, then microwave it for 30 seconds and pour it into my batter.  It will lend a slight coconut flavor to baked items, which works with just about any kind of muffin, cookie, or bread.  It looks promising as a skin moisturizer, as well, though I haven't yet tried it for that purpose.  Smaller jars in the grocery store are quite expensive, so buying it from Amazon in the larger jars is more economical.
