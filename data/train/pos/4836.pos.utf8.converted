I love these noodles.  The quality is a cut above cup-o-noodles.  However, if you use the entire seasoning package they will be too spicy for most Americans.  Fortunately, you do not have to add all of the seasoning.  So most people who like spicy food should be able to enjoy these.  I will watch the sales and buy them again.
