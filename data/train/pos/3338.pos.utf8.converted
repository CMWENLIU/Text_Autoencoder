There is no better pectin around!  I've used Certo, Sure-Jell, even Pomona's (which is the messiest, least user-friendly product ever) and MCP is the only one worth my time!  It makes no sense that it's always so unavailable.  Walmart used to sell it here in Vegas, but even they have stopped carrying it.  I either have to get my mom in California to buy me some or purchase it online--the price and the convenience of purchasing it on Amazon.com is far superior!
