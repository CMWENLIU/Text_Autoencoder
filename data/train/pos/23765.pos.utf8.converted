If you never tried Watkins vanilla before, I suggest you do.  Take a bottle of Watkins vanilla and a bottle of other vanilla bought in the grocery store.  Smell the Watkins, then smell the other brand.  The other brand ends up smelling like medicine compared to the wonderful vanilla fragrance of Watkins.  I think it makes your baked products taste better.
