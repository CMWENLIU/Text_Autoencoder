Cornbread is something that people think they're not fond of until they have a really, really good one. I made a really, really good cornbread... and then figured out I couldn't eat it.<br /><br />When I went about preparing this, I modified it to be more similar to my own... and I have to admit it is pretty fantastic. My teenage "real-food" kids ate more of it than I did... They love the texture.<br /><br />My cornbread is on the moist and sweet side. It can all be done in a mixing bowl and greased pan of course, but I like a rustic cornbread in a cast iron skillet, and the a warm skillet helps to shorten the baking time. This is how I prepared it:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 375.<br />Melt a stick of butter in a cast-iron skillet on low- just until melted and turn it off.<br />The next steps move quickly to keep the pan warm but prevent the pan from cooking the ingredients before you get them incorporated... Not as hard as it sounds. Just have it all ready to go. =)<br /><br />sprinkle 1/2tsp baking soda over 1-1/2 cups buttermilk and do not mix<br /><br />Whisk into the pan in this order:<br />1/2 c sugar<br />3 eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each<br /><br />At this point, using the rule of thirds, add a third of the bag of mix, then whisk the soda into the buttermilk and add a third, then another third of the mix, the buttermilk, mixing well after each until all is added and well blended and consistent in texture. I usually scrape the mix off the sides of the pan back into the center for better visual appearance... and then place on the center rack in the oven.<br /><br />Bake until the top is brown...not just golden... Be brave. =) It took about 40 minutes. If you don't bake it until it's medium brown, too much moisture will remain, and it will be more like a cornbread pudding... which is okay... Just tell them you meant to do that. =)
