8 years ago, I was desperate trying to find a natural remedy for my brother's early phase liver cancer since surgery would almost destroy the body and my brother won't live long after that and he was too young to lose life.  Luckily my coworker suggested me to try Essiac Cancer Remedy. I did a through research on Essiac and believed this tea was going to save my brother's life and it DID. He is still well till now.  Later I suggested this tea to a few more cancer patients and the results were promising.  Two of them with early cancers were healed; the doctor just couldn't find any cancer trace on the pre-scheduled surgery table.  There are 2 late phase cancer patients (late means cancer had been spread to different organs and the person was dying), who drank the tea and lived a few more months and died peacefully without any pain and sufferings, which proved what said in one of the Essiac books that the tea helps with a painless death if it's a Terminal cancer. I also learned that the results are much better with patients who eat little or no animal products because animal food acidifies the body, speeds up cancer spreading and weakens the immune system --- in 1931, Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that "cancer thrives in acidic conditions."  For more information about this tea, you may read related books on "Essiac".  I hope more western people will believe that the best heal is often the most nature and simplest which God created in the very beginning.
