I bought the 1 lb. bag for something like a trial-pack, and I regret not buying more! This was the first time I had ever used oat bran, so I was not quite sure what to do with it, but I have found that it works EXTREMELY well when mixed with old-fashioned oats (for my typical breakfast of pumpkin maple oatmeal =]) The oat bran is finely ground, but it does a great job thickening up oats and giving it more texture as well as a little additional fiber. I highly recommend this product, and I look forward to purchasing more from Barry Farm
