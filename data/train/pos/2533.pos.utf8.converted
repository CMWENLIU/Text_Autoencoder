I purchased this product because I thought it would be convenient to have on hand.  I live alone.  Each package makes six nice sized biscuits.  Water is the only ingredient to add.  What can be more simple?  I found I did need to add a little more water, but it may be because I live at a higher altitude.  The biscuits are light and taste great.  They do not even require butter, honey, or preserves.  They taste perfect all by themselves.  These are a nice accompaniment to a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter's night.
