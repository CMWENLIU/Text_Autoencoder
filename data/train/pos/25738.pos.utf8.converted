This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.<br /><br />I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.<br /><br />Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it "Treats short-term stress", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value.<br /><br />Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful.
