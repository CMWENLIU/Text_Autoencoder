I have tried numerous products before trying Gu and was not happy with them.  I could not find any where I liked the flavor, consistency, or the burst of energy that I needed.  I bought a few Gu packets before a long run one day and really helped during the run.  I thought this was fluke, so I tried Gu for about a month on my long runs.  I found that I consistently do better with Gu than any other product.  While I don't care for the Chocolate flavor (like eating frosting), all the other flavores are very good.
