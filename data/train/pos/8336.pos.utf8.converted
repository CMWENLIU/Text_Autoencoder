Easily 5 stars if you like vanilla. Its much cheaper than whole beans, and tastes very much like pure vanilla, with none of the bitterness or alcohol taste of extract.<br /><br />It's a bit different in texture than I expected...it is more of a thick syrup, due to the other ingredients (sugar basically).<br /><br />I bought it initially because we make homemade tapioca, but I have been putting a drop in my coffee also!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />I would love to hear a comparison with the other vanilla paste brands on Amazon...as this is the only one I have tried so far.
