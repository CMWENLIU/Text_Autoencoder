I couldn't honestly care less about flax seeds and all the other mumbo jumbo on the packaging.  I guess I can just trust that it's all good stuff.  With a brand name like "Kind" it's a leap of faith I'm willing to take.  What I do know, however, is this stuff is tasty.<br /><br />The smell from the bag is earthy, with a little cinnamon, a little oat.  It reminded me of family drives as a kid when we used to roll down the windows while passing the Quaker Oats factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Very inviting.<br /><br />Smell is not sufficient, so I had to eat this bag of goodies.  VERY impressed.  One thing I hate about a lot of granola (oat clusters) is that it's crumbled too much.  You end up with thousands of tiny chunks.  This is not true with the Kind brand.  There are big and small chunks, with the right texture and crunch.  Added to that is a simply delicious flavor; it's like health-food candy.  Each bite is like cheating a diet.  Delicious cinnamon flavoring without being overpowering.  I highly recommend it in milk as a healthy alternative to sugary cereals, or in handfuls while hiking through multi-colored forest landscapes that pleasantly make time disappear.
