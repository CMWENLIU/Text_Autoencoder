I bought several single boxes of Tulsi Tea in several flavors and the original one is my very favorite one. The other flavors (vanilla, ginger and lemon) are just ok to me. For an unflavored herbal type tea, Original tastes very good. My only regret is that I only bought 1 box. I drank 3 cups a day until it was gone and although I still have the other flavors, I miss the original! I will be buying the Original by the case from now on. I found that with the other flavors, I have to add honey to be able to drink it but with the original I love it just as it is.
