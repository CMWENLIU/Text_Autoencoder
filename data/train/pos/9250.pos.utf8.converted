I love giving this food to my cats, but more importantly, they love being fed this food!  It is a coarse pate and I have learned that you have to be careful when you open it, or you will get the liquid surrounding the food on you and the counter.  I just open it carefully and empty the liquid in the bowl first and then cut up the main food.  I have read some reviews where customers didn't like it being so dry, but I'm OK with that.  I always add a little water to my cats food anyway so I'm not worried about them not getting enough.  I would rather pay for food and add my own water than to get some of the foods that are over 80% moisture.  I feel like I am paying for water with those, but not with this.  Good deal for a very good food.
