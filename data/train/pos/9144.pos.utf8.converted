This is a fantastic invention.  If you save your old K cups, rinse and dry them, and refill them with your favorite coffee and top it with this little my Kap, you have a perfect K cup at a fraction of the price. We were spending over $50 a month on K cups,so you can save a lot of money with this gadget.  We use the old K cups at least 10 times.  If you line it up so the bottom hole pops into the puncher, it prolongs the life even more.  The only thing negative I can think of is that it is quite overpriced for a small piece of plastic, but since someone was smart enough to come up with this, I guess they deserve to make some money!
