I like this olive oil for a couple of reasons.  It's the best I've found in the price range I'm willing to pay.<br />It comes in a tin, which I think protects the flavor of the oil longer.<br />I will not buy oil in a plastic bottle!<br />When I buy I always buy a pack for my friend, who is a chef.  She swears by it.
