Local BJs had this on sale for $28 per 80 cups.  Thought It would be worth a shot.  Well, after getting it home, I was pleasantly surprised on a couple notes.<br /><br />First, the coffee is delicious.  Good body, bright flavor.  Really nice cup of coffee. (I don't use cream or sugar.)<br /><br />The second surprise is that the K-cups aren't full cups. Plastic is only used for the rim to provide rigidity so the cup will hold up under the pressure of the brewer.  My guess us that they use about 66% less plastic - less waste, less mess for the landfill. Aside from the rim, there is the filter material, which seems to be a better filter than in the full plastic cups.<br /><br />Finally, I've used the Eco-Cups over the years and really liked them, because I could use my own coffee.  The only problem is that cleaning them is not easy.  I had tried the MyCaps so I could refill the original K-cups with my own coffee.  While they worked well, cleaning the cups was messy (hence switching to the Eco-Cups).  These cups work GREAT with the MyCaps, since they are so easy to clean out and not messy at all.  Instead of trying to rinse out the used coffee, I now just peel the foil, and push the used coffee into into a container so I can compost it.  Then, with a simple rinse, it's ready to refill and pop on a MyCap and brew again.  What's great is that the coffee, itself is excellent and you can reuse the filters over and over with your own coffee.  Now, I keep a box of this coffee around for when I don't have time to do a refill, and refill when I want a little variety.  Best of both worlds.<br /><br />By the way, refilling them with the same grind-your-own, whole bean coffee also saves money (a lot of it).  You can do that by buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RO5M1Q">San Francisco Bay 100% Organic Coffee Rainforest Blend Whole Bean 3 Lbs</a> from Amazon. How can you go wrong?
