If you bake for someone who is gluten intolerant and get a little discouraged with the "gritty" consistency of your baking, you must try this flour! I received mine today and mixed up a batch of Wendy Wark's GF flour blend, using the superfine brown rice flour for both the brown and white rice flour called for in the recipe. I then made a batch of chocolate chip cookies. Let me first say, I am a gluten eater, my husband is the one that needs to eat GF. So I have had wheat based homemade cookies very recently. I have been trying new GF recipes for him during the 2 years since his diagnosis, trying to get as close to what he was used to as possible. This is the first time that even the raw cookie dough tasted like wheat based CC cookie dough!<br /><br />The cookies baked up beautifully and looked like regular. The taste and "mouth feel" was nothing short of miraculous. These did not elicit a response of "they're fine" but rather, "These are great!" When my kids came home from school, they saw cookies and had a couple. When I told them they were GF and I had made them for Daddy, they didn't believe me. I think I will have to make some more very soon as the ones I made today are almost all gone, thanks to my husband and the kids!<br /><br />I now have a flour that has given me that "perfect" GF CC cookie recipe to file alongside the "perfect" GF brownie recipe and the "perfect" GF pizza recipe. Maybe I will have to tackle bagels next? I only hope a store near me starts to carry this or I will go broke on S&H! But I will gladly pay the S&H to have this product available to me! I can't wait to try it in other recipes.
