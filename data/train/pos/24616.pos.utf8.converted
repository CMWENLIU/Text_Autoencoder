I have been feeding Nature's Variety Instinct, turkey and duck, to my German Shepherd for almost a year now. He has suffered with allergies (both food and environmental), and has a very sensitive stomach. I am very happy with Nature's Variety, and my guy does great on it. I recommend it to anyone who has struggled with finding a food for a dog with allergies. I also appreciate Amazon selling it with a repeat delivery service. It is really nice not having to go out and buy it every month!
