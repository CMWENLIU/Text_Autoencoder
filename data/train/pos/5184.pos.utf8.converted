I don't know if most people know this or not, but in Japan we put loose green tea leaves in a pot and just keep pouring hot water over it until the "taste" is too weak. All the water must be poured out after no more than 3 minutes or else the tea will be biter. Thats why most Japanese tea sets are so small. Green tea isn't meant to be left in a teapot like english teas. So my first cup of green tea was actually a little stronger than I am used to and I actually got 3 uses out of ONE k-cup. I highly recommend using them more than once if you are making the tea one cup after another....and it will save you MONEY!
