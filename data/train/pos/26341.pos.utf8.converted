WILD-CAUGHT fish are free of any diseases that may pop up, even in the huge, (but not as huge as the ocean!) tanks used for farm-raised fish.  Salmon is supposed to be heart-healthy, and has far less, (if any), of the mercury found in albacore tuna.  And....salmon tastes yummy....especially sockeye salmon, (that is in these cans) -- which is reputed to be THE best-tasting salmon of all!<br /><br />REDHEAD salmon, made by the PURE ALASKAN SALMON COMPANY, herein being reviewed, is very, very, Very, VERY tasty!  The ingredients are simply "Wild Alaskan Sockeye Salmon and Salt".  This is not the (much!) more expensive fileted canned salmon -- but the skin and bone content is kept to a minimum.  (Skin and bones -- which are in themselves very healthy eating -- can easily become almost unrecognizable, upon simply combining the salmon with other ingredients and mixing.)  Sodium content here is medium -- 270 miligrams per can.  The sodium helps to keep the salmon fresh, (a natural preservative, if you will), but it can easily be washed away by taking the open can, and pressing the just-removed top in, whilst you run cold water over it....<br /><br />Sockeye salmon is RED salmon, (hence the name, REDHEAD).  Red salmon is slightly more fatty -- but much more tasty, (at least to me), than the pink variety of salmon.  (The extra fat gives the redder colour).<br />THIS brand of sockeye salmon, (REDHEAD) is amongst the tastiest sockeye salmon I have ever eaten!<br /><br />This salmon comes in a nice, golden coloured can, with NO SEAMS!  Seams in cans containing any food have been known to leach toxic materials into that food -- but there is no worry of that here.  I bought my REDHEAD salmon on 9th September, 2009 -- and the expiration date reads July, 2012 -- so this salmon will stay fresh for a LONG time!  It also bears the "OU" symbol of the Orthodox Union -- meaning that this product meets the highest in kosher quality.<br /><br />As attested to by the enclosures, (company priorities for safe, organic products, and serious stewardship of the atmosphere and planet -- plus some yummy recipes), the PURE ALASKA SALMON CO., which makes REDHEAD and other salmon, is totally committed to not only fine products -- but to the survival of their customers, (and all other human beings!), who inhabit this planet!<br /><br />This is salmon caught in ALASKA.  It is made by the Pure Alaskan Salmon Company, of Burlingham, WAshington, 98225.  It is therefore a TOTALLY AMERICAN-MADE PRODUCT!  For those who care about such things, (like me!), this is VERY important -- and can even make the salmon tastier! : )<br /><br />All in all -- and for so many, many reasons -- a very good choice to make when preparing salmon dishes!  Highly recommended!
