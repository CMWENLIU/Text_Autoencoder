I have been eating this fake chicken since I was a kid; hence using the word fake. We in our household just love this. It is easy, healthy and it tastes wonderful. You can eat it out of the can or cooked in many ways, as you would real chicken. It tastes better than real meat, but does take acquired tasted.
