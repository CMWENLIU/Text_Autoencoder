Enjoy as an appetizer or serve with a warm, crusty bread to make a satisfying lunch.  I have even enjoyed it chilled during the Summer.<br /><br />As with other delicious Imagine products, the secret lies in quality, complementary organic ingredients.<br /><br />Since no nutritional information is listed on this page as of this writing, I will include it here:<br /><br />Serving size:  1 cup (240 mL)<br />Servings per container:  2<br /><br />Per Serving:<br />___________<br /><br />Calories:  60<br />Total Fat:  1.5 g<br />  Sat Fat: 0 g<br /> Trans Fat: 0 g<br />Cholesterol: 0 mg<br />Sodium:  440 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates:  11 g<br />  Dietary Fiber:  2 g<br />  Sugars:  1 g<br />Protein:  2 g<br />Vitamin A:  8%<br />Vitamin C:  50%<br />Calcium:  4%<br />Iron:  6%<br /><br />Ingredients:  Filtered Water, Organic Broccoli, Organic Potatoes, Organic Tapioca Starch, Organic Celery, Organic Leeks, Organic Onions, Sea Salt, Organic Garlic, Organic Expeller pressed Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil and/or Canola Oil, Natural Flavors, Organic Onion Powder, Organic Spices.<br /><br />Nutritious and delicious soup in a convenient, recyclable, shelf-stable package.
