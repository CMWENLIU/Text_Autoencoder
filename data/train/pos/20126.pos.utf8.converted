I like all the Hodgson Mill products I have used but I never had couscous, Hodgson Mill or any other brand.  I wanted to start to eat healthier so when I saw this was whole wheat and and on subscribe and save I ordered it. I thought I would give it a try.  If I hated it I could always add it to home baked goods. Well I love it. I sauted an onion and added some beef broth and 5 minutes later it was done.  It was a side dish tonight but it would make a nice lunch. I am happy I purchased this.
