This is the only food my ancient cat will finish that also keeps her digestive system working normally.<br /><br />I also like the portion size, the lightweight, easy open containers, there's no disgusting back splash that sometimes happens with pull tab cans.<br /><br />I recommend this food for people with cats who just lick the gravy off of chunky foods, won't finish their wet food or will suddenly stop finishing a wet food that was fine the day before -- highly irritating habits of my cat that were solved with this food.<br /><br />I agree with the poster that the recommended feeding allowance seems like a lot of food and also, it's not the most aesthetically pleasing food to come down the pike, but if my cat doesn't care, I try not to care.
