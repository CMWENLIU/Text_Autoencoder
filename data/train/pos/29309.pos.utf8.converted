This flavor and the Barbecue seem to be my dog's favorite, although he does love the liver flavored one as well.  Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like.  I usually put one flavor in one side of the Everlasting Treat Ball and another flavor in the opposite end.  These treats are hard and durable, allowing the dog to scrape off small portions of the cookie at a time.  It usually takes my dog a week of constant, daily chewing just to get through one cookie insert.  These cookies are the BEST!
