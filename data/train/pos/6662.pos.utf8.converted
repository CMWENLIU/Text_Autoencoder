Bought a pack of this on ebay recently,WONDERFUL texture and flavor, I use this in my power shakes along with the cocoa butter in the morning and it leaves a wonderful rich creamy flavor packed with antioxidants. This company is the first and only to import organic certified cacao from venezuela, trader joes had a chocolate bar i loved called Ocumare and the stop selling it, this cacao is made from the same bean. Awesome flavor, no acidity. I love it.
