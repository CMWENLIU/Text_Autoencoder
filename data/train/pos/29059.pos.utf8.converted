One more personal testimonial to add to the rest. My Siamese has been prone to bouts of vomiting all his life, but 7 months ago it became chronic. He wouldn't eat or even keep liquids down, and in addition to many vet visits (totaling over $1500), my having to give him sub-Q fluid therapy myself, and a prescription diet, he was not improving (they tentatively diagnosed pancreatitus).<br /><br />In desperation, I combed the internet and saw many references to vomiting cats having corn allergies. As corn was listed as a major ingredient in both my cat's regular diet (the expensive Royal Canin Siamese food)AND the vet given Rx food (Hills), I searched for an alternative to try. I read a review on this page for Blue Buffalo and tried it out. Long story short (perhaps too late), it is 6 months later and my cat is happy, healthy and has vomited only twice in that time (yes. hairballs).<br /><br />It makes perfect sense. Cats in the wild do not eat grains. End of story. And my cat, notoriously fickle, took to it immediately. I highly recommend it. It's a little pricey, but cheaper than vet bills and a miserable cat.
