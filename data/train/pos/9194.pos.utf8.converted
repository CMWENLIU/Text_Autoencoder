I admit it, I am a coffee snob and Ruta Maya  makes one of the best roasts I've ever had.  I've enjoyed their coffee on visits to their original Austin, Tx.shop for over 15 years.  Now I get my hook ups from Costco.com and in store.<br /><br />I am sad to see the price on Amazon to be such a rip off, I love buying from Amazon and most often their sellers.  Do yourself a favor, get some coffee, try the dark or medium roasts or their new Cubita but shop around for it.  There are better values where a seller can make some money but not rake ppl over on the transaction.<br /><br />Indigo
