This ZERO calorie rice substitute is the answer to every no-carb dieters prayer. The liquid they are packed in has a distinct fermented odour and they recommend rinsing them well. This doesn't really get rid of the smell but, after some experimentation, I found that drizzling vinegar over them and letting them sit for a minute, then rinsing again, removes all trace. After they are rinsed, fry them with a bit of cooking spray to dry them, this gives a better texture, then add your favorite sauce or just stirfry veggies, noodles and soy for an almost no-cal snack anytime. They do have more of a gel texture than a grain texture but hey! for zero calories, it's a great meal stretcher or afternoon snack for dieters.
