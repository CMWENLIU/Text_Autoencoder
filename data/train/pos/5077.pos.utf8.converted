These treats smell good. I actually bought them for my rabbits because I didn't know dogs eat pumpkin, and like it. When the rabbits hear me open the package they run to the cage door and climb over each other to be the first one to get a treat. And, the dog loves them too, although he is jealous of the rabbits so I don't know if he eats them because he likes them or because he doesn't want the rabbits to get any. I actually ate one myself to see what the fuss was about only to find out they are rather bland, but the crunchiness was nice. As long as my pets are happy, then I am happy. Thanks for the speedy delivery and the discount prices.
