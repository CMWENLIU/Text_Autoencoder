Family loves this old-fashioned dessert.  Hard to find the large pearls.  Altered the simple recipe - more tapioca ( 1 cup with 3 cups of water to soak) and do not separate the eggs - to make a thicker, richer pudding.  Homemade with only 1/2 cup of sugar and two eggs, it qualifies as a reasonably healthy yet satisfying dessert.
