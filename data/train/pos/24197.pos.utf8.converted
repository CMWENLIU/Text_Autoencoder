I've been buying Lakewood organic cherry juice for years. I drink it everyday for gout control. I usually buy the non-concentrated version but the full size version is difficult to carry with me on trips. This product is an excellent alternative. The 12 pk came in a very well cushioned package and tasted just fine.
