My cat loves these so much that I bought ten packs of them just in case they stop making them.  Seriously.  She purrs the minute I pick one up.  She likes to play fetch with these so any time I'm around she brings one to me and meows until I throw it for her.  Then she has a great time chasing it around the room until she catches it.  I have to put them away at night, though, since she'll bring them to my bed and meow for me to throw them.  This is the best cat toy ever.
