I was not really sold on the fact that a specific olive juice would make a dirty martini better... I was buying some cheap olive juice at BevMo! Then I found this one on Amazon and after reading all the reviews decided to give it a try.  It truly does make a difference!!!  It is more expensive than what I was paying before, but it is well worth the money!  Give it a try... you won't be disappointed.
