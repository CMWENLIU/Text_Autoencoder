We bought a new waffle maker and I saw this batter first at Williams Sonoma. They don't carry it anymore though, but I am glad I found it here at Amazon. My husband absolutely loves the waffles made with this mix. They are so light they melt in your mouth. Excellent stuff! No more Bisquit waffles for us!
