I have had cats for many years and have used several brands of litter.  When Feline Pine came out I tried it and instantly loved it.  I recently have mixed Tidy Cat Crystals in with it and have found a perfect combination.  Half of a small bag of Feline Pine with one third of the jug of Tidy Cat Crystals for one cat for two weeks.  It doesn't stick to the feet and track like the scoopables, it swells and turns to sawdust as it's used and the smell is very limited especially if you use a covered litter box with swinging door.  I don't scoop or do another thing to it until it's time to dump, rinse, and start all over.  You will find some saw dust outside of the litter box at the end of the two weeks but not tracked all through the house.  It is the best!
