Been chewing this gum for years, very good taste on all 5 different ones and as other person said flavor doesn't last long as aspartame gums but it doesn't totally disappear in minutes like some other gums.  i buy at whole foods but soooo expensive so this price on line is much better.  i have 4 kids and we will go through 4 bottles a month easy but it' sbetter than chewing the aspartame crap that everything else has.  the green tea flavor is pretty awesome and so is the fruit.
