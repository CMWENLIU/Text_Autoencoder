The flavor is the best of all the chocolate soy milks I have tried; not too sweet, not too thick. At only 150 claories per serving, it's great to take for a breakfast commute when you're running out the door. And the recipe on the side of the carton is a great quick, easy breakfast as well. Blend one 8.25 oz serving with one frozen banana. Great way to use up overripe bananas (peel before freezing and toss in a ziploc bag) - they're not just for banana bread anymore!
