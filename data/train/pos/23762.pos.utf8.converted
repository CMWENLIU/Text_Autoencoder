When I was in catering one of the most extravagant appetizers we served, at all of the best parties were crimini mushrooms stuffed with escargots, parsley, garlic, serrano ham, butter and bread crumbs made from sour dough bread.<br />Now, with these Burgundy escargots available tinned and cooked,this recipe tastes even better. I served them recently at Easter with a huge bottle of Schramsburg Rose' Champagne and my family flipped: in food goodness ecstasy, that is.<br />I've also used this product in empanadas with red onions, garlic and manchego cheese.<br />Yes, I know they are snails but these are the Rolls Royce of snails: not your garden variety type...as it were.
