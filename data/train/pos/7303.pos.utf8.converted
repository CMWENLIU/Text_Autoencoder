The Baby Brezza is a super easy to use baby food maker.  You can literally throw in the ingredients and within 15-25 minutes, you have homemade baby food.  My only complaint is that being a mother of twins, the baby food maker does not have the capacity that I would like since I have two babies who eat a ton.  (My workaround is making multiple batches of the same thing and/or similar mixtures which seems to work.)  My suggestion for Baby Brezza is to add a "Blend time" button.  (So I can set to blend for 30 seconds after I have drained excess water or added non-steam ingredients like bananas.)  Overall, worth the money.  Easy to use, easy to clean!
