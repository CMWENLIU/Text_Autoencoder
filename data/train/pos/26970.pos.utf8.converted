I wouldn't dare argue the "nutritional" value of salt in a diet but for those that do enjoy the flavor of salt on foods I've found this salt to be MUCH better than any salt I've had in the US.  I particularly enjoy this salt lightly sprinkled on an authentic, buttered, french baguette!  C'est tres bon =)
