I can only add three things to what others have already said - the aroma of this rice mix will fill your home and you will love it.  Comparied to plain brown rice that I buy at the store (Mahatma) this mix has three times the fiber per serving.  And lastly the cooking directions on my bag differ slightly from the directions here at Amazon - the bag does not say to rinse first (so I don't), and the bag says to cover AFTER you have brought to a boil and reduced the heat.  Other than these comments I can only agree whole-heartedly with the first five reviews, that this totally wholesome food item is scrumpdiddlyumscious.
