Finally, a guilt free version of one of my favorite spreads. You can read up on the nutritional info, how they make this as well as find recipes on the manufacturer's website [...].<br /><br />In short, you get all the flavor and all the health benefits with a fraction of the fat calories. I don't find the chocolate version very chocolaty but you do get a hint of dark chocolate specks.<br /><br />I have used this the regular way on sliced bread as well as in baking. Try a chocolate PB2 bread pudding or even stir a teaspoon into your morning oatmeal. The opportunities are endless.
