With four boys and a husband who are all carnivores, I don't have much of a chance! Raised a vegetarian, I now know how to cook meat and will eat some select items, however, I just can't handle eating meat hot dogs. Just not knowing what is in them is very disturbing to me! Well, we finally found a hot dog that the whole family LOVES! Yes, loves! Even my husband will eat these! I feel so much better about feeding these to my family instead of the "who knows what is ground up in here" kind!! Thanks Loma Linda! (by the way, my youngest and I love to eat them right out of the can...no bun, no heating...just some mustard to dip it in!)
