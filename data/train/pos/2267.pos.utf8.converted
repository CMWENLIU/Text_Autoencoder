They're just like corn pops without all the sugar! And if you want 'em sweet, just throw a spoonful of Splenda on top and there you go. I sometimes mix them in with more calorie-dense breakfast cereals just to increase the volume without increasing my waist line. They also make a great snack if you eat them plain. I basically love this product.
