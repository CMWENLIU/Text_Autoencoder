After buying this product, I have to say it is the best thing.  Plus it is not loaded with salt, to which is an added benefit.  You get the iodine requirements and benefits easily.  I add 1/4 teaspoon to my protein shakes.  I have been using this product for a few weeks now and can definitely tell it works on my metabolism wonderfully and the iodine assists with thyroid & pituitary function.  I am very pleased with this kelp! It would benefit anyone having hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism as well.  For those having hyperthyroidism, I would consult with your doctor.  People are so low on their iodine requirements, why not do it naturally instead of a pill??  I'm keeping this product in my spices for a long time...
