I really love this sparkling water. It is very satisfying and quenches thirst quickly with a slight flavor. It isn't sweet and is calorie free with out disgusting fake sugars. I have been drinking these instead of soda and it has really helped me kick that bad habit. I am so happy that I can buy them online with a subscription!
