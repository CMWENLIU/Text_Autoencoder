I have always hated red wine and the bitterness of it, but as someone previously mentioned, this wine is a perfect starter wine for those looking to get into red. It's sweet, not dry and tastes WONDERFUL! I highly recommend this bottle of wine for red beginners or just wine lovers in general. And yes it is a wine specific to Olive Garden but you can find it at local suppliers or online.
