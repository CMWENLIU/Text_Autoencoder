I GRIND OUR COFFEE EACH MORNING, SO AM A RATHER PICKY COFFEE DRINKER.THIS COFFEE BEATS OTHERS I'VE TRIED HANDS DOWN. THE PECAN FLAVOR IS JUST RIGHT, COMPLIMENTS THE COFFEE WITHOUT OVERDOING IT. LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING OTHER CAMERONS COFFEES OFFERED AT AMAZON, ESPECIALLY WOODS AND WATERS. THANKS TO AMAZON FOR OFFERING SUCH A QUALITY COFFEE AT A AFFORDABLE PRICE.
