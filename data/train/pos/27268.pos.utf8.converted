As a cat with a discerning palate, I only eat Fancy Feast.  It is a fragrant delight of tasty morsels covered in a delicate and lip smacking au jus. The texture is viscous and balanced.  In fact, it is so delicious, I wait until no one is looking then knock over the trash and dig out the empty can so I can lick the sides. (I would not recommend this however as it sometimes gets me thrown outside).<br /><br />I put this at the top of my list!  A++<br />Steve<br />,,,^..^ ,,,~
