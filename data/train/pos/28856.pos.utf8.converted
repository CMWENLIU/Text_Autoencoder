My perfect Sazerac recipe:<br /><br />- 1 1/2 oz Rye<br />- 3 dashes Peychauds bitters<br />- 1 sugar cube<br />- splash (1/4 oz) Absinthe<br /><br />Shake the Rye, bitters, and sugar cube with ice in a cocktail shake. Let sit. Pour the absinthe into an Old Fashioned glass. Tip it to coat the whole inside of the glass. Then strain the ice out of the mix and add it to the glass.
