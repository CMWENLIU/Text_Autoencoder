I love white mochas, but at 4 bucks a pop at the cafe and goodness knows how many calories -- its an occational treat.  Enter this very creamy and delicious mix from Ghirardelli.  This mix is WONDERFUL!  It contains no trans fats, no high-fructose corn syrup, and each serving of powder has only 90 calories AND NO FAT!!!  It even contains the coffee, but I also add a bit of powdered espresso for an extra kick.  I like being able to control the milk fat content and don't have to worry about harmful additives.<br /><br />ANOTHER PLUS:  It is such an inexpensive way to enjoy a White Mocha!  At 22 servings for under 6 bucks + cost of milk, each white mocha is less than a dollar!  This mix is ideal for keeping in your office.
