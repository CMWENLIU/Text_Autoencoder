These mashed potatoes are incredible.  Quick, easy and taste like homemade.  The only issue is the cost.  This same box was about half the price at Costco, however it's apparently a seasonal item for Costco and they won't be carrying them again until Fall.  Other than the price, the service from Amazon was great.
