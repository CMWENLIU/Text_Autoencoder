This is a very unusual tea with a combination of flavors that I've never heard of before (peppermint, cinnamon, ginger, chamomile, lemongrass, licorice and more).  It smells divine and it tastes great.  I drink it everyday after work and through the evening.  It has added b vitamins to help with stress, and the ingrediants are also good for digestion (I originally bought this to help with digestive problems).  This tea becomes very addictive due to its unique flavor and smell.  My husband doesn't drink tea, but he loves the smell when I brew it.
