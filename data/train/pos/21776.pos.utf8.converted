My two cats are very picky eaters. Up until recently, I was feeding them Royal Canin indoor cat formula. They loved the food, but one of the cats had constant diarrhea and bathroom problems, and the other would occasionally throw up undigested kibble. I began to research the food they were eating and kept finding a bunch of reviews about how the food is garbage for cats and very overpriced for what you get. I tried converting them to different types of wet food, and also a version of a Blue Buffalo cat food. They would not touch anything else and refused to eat. A couple of days ago I decided to try again, this time with Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in Turkey. From the time I opened the bag to when it was in their bowl, they showed interest in it. I guess the recipe is very attractive to cats. I've slowly begun mixing it in with their old food and hope that they will be fully transitioned within a few weeks. They don't show any aversion to the new food. In fact, I think they're going to the bowl more often. They almost never finished their daily portions (I follow the food portion charts) before, and now they do. I also have not experienced any sensitive stomach problems from either of them during the transition. I have my fingers crossed that this will be the food I was looking for. So far it's a keeper.<br /><br />Update a year later: My cats are still very much enjoying this food. The one that was throwing up undigested kibble hasn't done it since being switched. The other that had constant diarrhea and bathroom problems has also completely changed. They also seem much more energetic and playful than they were with the old food which also means they get into EVERYTHING but a healthy, happy cat makes me a happy owner. Thanks so much Halo! I couldn't recommend this food more.
