With 5 cats I need to buy cat food in bulk!!  Having it delievered to the door is a absolute must, so I love the delivery of Amazon.  Just switched cats to this food - females are weight ok but the males seem to eat too much so hope this will keep them trimmer. Have all long haired cats - and who likes hariballs coming up??  Not me. Have one cat show has been on this for year - and have not had hairball #1 out of her. Definitely recommend buying from Amazon - aLOT chaeper than any other place I have found.
