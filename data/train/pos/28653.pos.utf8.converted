I have used Manuka honey for a couple of years now.  My respiratory doctor had recommended the honey to me when I had a very bad cold.  I tried a few different brands but I have found this brand to be ABSOLUTELY the best.  The honey has therapeutic properties and really helps with colds, sore throats and acid reflux.  It is a great homeopathic remedy.<br />The honey comes from the tea tree and the best/purest comes from New Zealand.  I was told some brands repackage their honey in the USA and put regular honey in the mix.  The pure manuka is really the prize in the honey.
