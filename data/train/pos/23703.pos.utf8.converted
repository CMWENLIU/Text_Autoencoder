These flowering teas are a wonder to behold and fun to watch.  The tea ball, right out of the package, looks like a funny colored nut with the scent of tea and jasemin.  Place it in the bottom of a tea cup or tea pot (the best show happens in an all glass one), and add hot, but not boiling water, sit back and watch.  It's amazing to see it open up into a beautiful bouquet.  The green leaves are the tea (green scented with jasmin) and the flower are one a 12 different selections.  As one person said to me, "tea flowers make you sit and relax in a go-go-go world."  I would recomend this to anyone who loves tea.
