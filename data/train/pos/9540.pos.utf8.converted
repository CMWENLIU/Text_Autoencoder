I've been searching for a product like this for a while now.  A business associate of mine brought me some "pepper spread" that his Italian mother makes and it was great.  So I started looking for a similar product in grocery stores and specialty shops.  This is the first one that I would buy again.  It's quite hot and delicious!  I love to spread this on crusty bread and eat it along with dinner.
