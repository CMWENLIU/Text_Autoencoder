Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell
