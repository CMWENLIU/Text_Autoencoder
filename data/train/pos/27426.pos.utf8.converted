Over the past 5-6-years, I have truly enjoyed this seasonal rice for a simple, tasty breakfast. We just moved to Omaha, where I was unable to find the rice locally. After some searching on the web, I located a small supply at Amazon. Thank you, Amazon.<br /><br />The rice will also work in soups, stir frys, and casseroles, but I try to save it for my breakfasts. Just prepare the rice as instructed and keep it in the fridge. Take about 1.5 cups of cold, cooked rice. Put it in a breakfast dish and add some raisins and brown sugar. Stir it up and microwave it for 1 minute. Add some milk to cool it off and enjoy a nice breakfast.
