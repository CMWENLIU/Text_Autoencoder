This sunscreen is great.  I have sensitive skin and need to wear sunscreen daily because of my acne regimen.  I use Alba Hawaiian SPF 30+ on my face every day underneath makeup, and I absolutely love it.  It has a light, non-greasy, almost whipped texture, which absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any residue.  It has never irritated my skin, clogged my pores, or made me break out.  The scent is a mild green tea/floral fragrance; it doesn't smell at all like typical sunscreen.  Additionally, I love its high SPF rating (30), when so many facial sunscreens only give you SPF 15 or 20.  Best of all, Alba doesn't test on animals, and this product contains no animal ingredients.<br /><br />A few months ago, my tube of Alba Hawaiian ran out.  Wanting to see what else was out there, I tried another natural sunscreen (Aubrey Organics Natural Sun SPF 25) just for kicks, to see if I liked it better.  Ugh, I hated it!  It smelled bad, came out of the tube separated as oil and goop, and -- worst of all -- left a chalky residue on my skin (fine for beach-going, but not on my face underneath makeup).  I ordered another tube of Alba Hawaiian that very day and have never looked back.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who want a sunscreen that is literally perfect!
