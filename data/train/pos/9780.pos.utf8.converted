Many folks are scaling back on the cost of gift-giving this year, and I highly recommend a gift basket or gift bag including an inexpensive Christmas mug plus a can of this Maxwell House International Coffee in the Peppermint Mocha Latte flavor. Remember that Amazon sells a pack of 4 for the price! It makes a smooth, creamy instant cup of coffee with rich chocolate and cool peppermint notes... sinfully delicious!<br /><br />You can bake with this, too. I stirred two rounded tablespoons into dry packaged brownie mix (9 X 11 inch pan size) before adding wet ingredients, then folded in chocolate chips and broken peppermint candy pieces. You could skip the fold in part, frost your brownies with chocolate frosting and top with broken pieces of peppermint candy as a special dessert or treat for holiday potlucks. Consider stirring a tablespoon or two of the dry mix into your chocolate sugar cookie recipe for a hint of coffee and peppermint flavors.<br /><br />In summary, this instant coffee is a yummy, affordable splurge for the upcoming holidays. Enjoy!
