I went to Hawaii many years ago and fell in love with their coffee and have been looking for that flavor again.  For the price of this coffee it can't be beat.  It is very close the taste I have been looking for.  When I first ground the coffee in an old grinder it did not taste the best, not bad but.... I bought a new coffee grinder and ground it supper fine and BOY what a difference that made!  I would have never thought, since then I have been ordering this coffee on a regular basis and also have given it for a gift to my sister.  I will buy this for many years to come.
