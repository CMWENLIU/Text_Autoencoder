For the most part, I found myself not generally a gun person. I would chew a piece or two a day to have decent breath, but if I could get my hands on a breath mint then I would opt for that instead. Now, the original trident never really suited the taste I was looking for- it was a sharp and strong mint flavor that, to me, was simply unpleasant. Of course, it was good for your teeth, so I grabbed some everyone once in a while anyway.<br /><br />Eventually I heard about this stuff. Supposedly amazing for your teeth (helps the enamel which means it isn't quite as sensitive to cold and heat), this gum caught my eye in the store and I had to try it... I fell in love at first chomp. It tastes, to me, like a combo of chocolate and mint. It has become my anti-chocolate, with an added bonus that it helps my teeth out! Unfortunately, it is pretty hard to get your hands on, so I order mine online in bulk. :)
