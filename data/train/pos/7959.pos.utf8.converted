I tried this product on the advice of a friend who became constipated after surgery and does it works. If I have a couple of days of no or little bowel movement, I take this and it really works, without fail, It might be the afternoon of the next day when it works, but, believe me it is a  smooth move then, and for a day or so after wards. To me the taste is sort of bland with an licorice after taste. Certainly not unpleasant. Beats laxatives and stool softeners.
