I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.  I use it to make a chicken liver pate that convinces even the best palletes that it's duck liver pate.  This is enough duck fat for about 1-2 pounds of raw livers (depending upon your fat tollerance).<br /><br />My secret pate recipe:<br /><br />5 ounces rendered duck fat<br />1 lb chicken livers<br />1 large shallot, peeled and coarsely chopped (2 1/2 tablespoons)<br />1 tsp herbs de Provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme work well)<br />2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed through a press<br />1 tsp sea salt<br />1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper<br />1 tbs cognac or dry sherry<br />One loaf of 2"x2" rye or pumpernickel bread (look for this at the deli counter)<br />Olive oil<br />Garlic salt<br />Pate: Fry the first six ingredients until the livers are cook thoroughly.  Allow mixture to cool slightly so you don't melt your food processor.  Add cooked mixture to food processer and blend away.  Adjust seasoning and add cognac.  Cool in refrigerator.<br />Bread: Heat oven to 400F.  Coat bread slices with olive oil and place in a single layer on a sheet pan.  Sprinkle with garlic salt.  These cook quickly so check them after 3 minutes.  You want a hard crouton-like doneness.
