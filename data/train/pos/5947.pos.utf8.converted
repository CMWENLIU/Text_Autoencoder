We love Reeses peanut butter (though we loved the crunchy even more,  but it was discontinued a few years ago)  However it's really hard to find in Manhattan for some reason,  every supermarket and bodega around me doesn't carry it, and we've tried countless other brands but none of them were salty, sweet and creamy enough,  (and Reeses is never oily!)  So I was thriled to buy this 6 pack from Amazon - we can get our fix and not get anxious as the jar empties... there's another one waiting in the cupboard!  Arrived very quickly and we'll definitely order again!<br /><br />We ordered this again in March 2011 and it came quickly and reliably.
