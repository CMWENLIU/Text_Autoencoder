I really LIKE RED BULL, but at 150 calories a can - there was no way that I could have it very often.  I had looked at Costco and other places for the Sugarfree RED BULL to buy in bulk and they didn't carry it.  I was really pleased to discover it at AMAZON at a great price with free shipping.<br /><br />I love this stuff. At only 10 calories it is a great energy boost and definitely keeps you from eating because it really provides a tangy, sweet alternative.  Highly recommended for dieters!
