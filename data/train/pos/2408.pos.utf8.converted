I started a High Fiber diet in order to lose weight/feel better at the beginning of the year. I am not a vegan or vegetarian,just a woman on a busy schedule who is trying to overhaul my eating habits.<br /><br />This is a very good product,easy to take to work,school,etc.It is a lot more convenient than cooking brown rice for close to an hour,especially on nights when you are busy and/or cooking for one.I throw some stir-fry seasoned veggies on top,and just eat it from the bowl.Also,with a little brown sugar,pecans and raisins it makes a great alternative to oatmeal in the mornings.Before this,I had tried Uncle Bens quick brown rice pouches that you microwave,which were nasty--salty ,oily and too much fat. All I can say is just try it,you will be pleasantly surprised.
