After reading on a blog that coconut oil is good for the skin, I had to order this product and see for myself. I have combination skin that is fairly sensitive and I would ALWAYS use moisturizers/facial products that are "oil-free"... so I was a little skeptical about putting oil on my face and I truly thought I might break out from it.<br />Well, 5 days later, after applying it in the morning and evening, my skin has never looked better or felt softer! I haven't developed any pimples at all (and if I were going to, it DEFINITELY would have happened after only 1 day for me). I didn't use a lot of it and made sure to dab any excess oil off with a tissue when I finished applying it. Also, I found that it works GREAT for razor burn or minor skin irritations. I've got my mom using it too and she loves it.
