My sister-in-law introduced me to the Wellness products in Palm Beach FL.  After reading the ingredients I had to buy a bag and try it for my 6lb Yorkipoo.  She loves it!  She used to be a finicky eater with a sensitive stomach.  On Wellness - no problems, and she's very healthy.  Only down side is I couldn't find it anywhere around where I live.  Thank goodness it's easy to order on-line!
