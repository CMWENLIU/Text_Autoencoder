Last July, my husband and I were in Williams, AZ and had prickly pear margaritas for the first time.  We fell in love with this wonderful concoction, but had no idea where to find the ingredients.  After some research, we came upon this syrup which is now a staple in our home.  You get a lot of margaritas out of one bottle.  The product is great and the seller has also been very rapid with shipment!
