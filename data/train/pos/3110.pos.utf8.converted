By far, this has been the best kit ever. The frosting is already made to go (unlike some others where you have to mix the powder). Also, the frosting is truly sticky and holds the gingerbread parts super well. Every other kit I've ever worked doesn't do so good. Also, there is this tray where the base of the house goes and holds it well. It was just the best. I plan on buying the same one next year.
