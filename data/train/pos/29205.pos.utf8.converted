This sauce is so good! It's like Worsterchire sauce but with the consistency of ketchup.. It's really delicious..<br /><br />You're supposed to use this on your Okonomiyaki and takoyaki, but you could use it for anything, even steak! It's really delicious, and I would recommend just keeping a couple bottles around, because once you taste this, you'll want to have it with you always, it's that good.
