Morton should be commended for producing this wonderful salt product. On my Sodium Chloride Saltiness of Salt Scale (commonly known as  SCSSS) this product ranks a full 10 which puts it right at the top of its class. And the packaging is first rate. I mean, a cylindrical box with a metal pull up spout -- it just doesn't get any better than that! I no longer use a salt shaker since it's such a kick to sprinkle it straight from the box. A dinner guest erred once and dumped about 4 tablespoons on her fillet mignon steak but it was her fault for not paying attention and being careless. I no longer date much as it has taken me years to recover from this trauma.<br /><br />This salt has a great salt flavor. It is especially good when you want to add a salty taste to food. If you want to prepare a salt water gargle then just add some of this salt to water. Works every time!<br /><br />GREAT SALT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
