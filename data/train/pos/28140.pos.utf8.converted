Most microwave popcorn tastes great when you eat it hot, but tastes greasy and bad when it is cool, because the hydrogenated oils used in the popcorn solidify once the popcorn cools.  However, this is not the case with Newman's Popcorn.  This popcorn tastes great, hot or cold because of the oils used.  Highly reccomended!
