Fleur de Sel is the best finishing salt there is. Don't use Fleur de Sel in a soup, but on a crisp salad or on sprinkled on a soft-boiled egg. You want to taste it not melt it. It's worth the money! My favorite is a raw freshly rinsed raddish dipped in the Fleur de Sel it's the perfect combination!
