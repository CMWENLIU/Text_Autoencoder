I have loved Cream of Rice for years and have been searching for it in the stores forever with no luck.  I decided to look on Amazon and low and behold, there it was.  I just love it for breakfast with butter, sugar and milk.  It fills me up and yet I don't have the bloated feeling I sometimes have with wheat cereals.  I have had ileostomy surgery and this product is wonderful for me in that regard as well.  I am so glad I found it again after years of doing without.  I tried putting dry rice in a mill to grind it, but it sure is a lot less work getting it pre-ground this way.  It works well as a binder for meatloaf and also as a thickener for soups!
