Welch's Fruit snacks appear to be a healthy, nutritious snack food for children and adults alike. They're made by Welch's, a company in the fruit juice business since 1869, and on the colorfully designed packages brimming with pictures of luscious fruit, we see that this wonderful snack is made with "REAL FRUIT", and no preservatives. Each 2.5 ounce package contains 100% of the daily vitamin C requirement, 25 % of vitamin A, and 25% of Vitamin E. Try to top that Snickers or Three Musketeers!<br /><br />I've been enjoying this delicious snack for years and never grow tired of them. My two favorite flavors  might be concord grape and mixed fruit; I don't have a least favorite. In my last bag of mixed fruit I observed mostly red pieces with a few orange and only one concord grape piece. The different flavored snacks are colored and shaped differently, many with pebbly texture on top to simulate berries. They are soft and chewy, but not overly so. Their sweetness is satisfyingly pleasing but not as intense as one might experience with a piece of candy. The tastes vary with the flavors, but in the bag of mixed fruit one doesn't distinguish distinctive flavors.<br /><br />I've always thought of the Welch's Fruit Snacks as a guilt free treat, like eating a piece of fruit. Well, that's not quite true. The first ingredient, you'll notice, is fruit juice, not real fruit, followed by corn syrup and sugar. The fruit part, actually a fruit puree, follows the sweeteners and the modified corn starch. Also in these fruit snacks are artificial colorings like red #40, yellow #5, and blue #1. Some of these colors can trigger hyperactivity in children. Yellow 5 use to set my daughter off like caffeine.<br /><br />The Welch's Fruit Snacks are not sticky to the touch like some other fruit based snacks. At work I sometimes share a bag or two with students who universally enjoy them as much as I do.<br /><br />Overall this is a good, nutritious snack, maybe a bit heavy handed with the sweeteners. I like the ingredient list better than that of other similar snacks such as Fruit Roll-ups. For what it's worth, Fruit Roll-ups have 373 calories per 100 grams of snack. Welch's Fruit Snacks have 325 calories per 100 grams.
