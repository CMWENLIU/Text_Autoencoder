Our Bernese Mountain dog had always been on another highly rated food (Nature's Variety Prairie), but his stools were really soft and he was prone to diarrhea.  Our vet suggested finding another food with less fat and more fiber.  Although this food has similar fat content, it has double the fiber.  He has done amazing on this food since we switched.  His stools are normal now and he has so much more energy!  We have been really happy with this food.  It's expensive, but worth every penny.
