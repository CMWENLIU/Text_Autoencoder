Believe it or not, my great dane can be a really picky eater, but she loves anything topped with a can of Homestyle Merricks canned food. She is not as big on the original style, the homestyles are like stew and you can recognize the meats and veggies. She especially likes the thigh in the Smothered Comfort.
