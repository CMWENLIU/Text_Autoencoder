After years of imbargos on Iranian products, we're finally able to start enjoying them again in the US.  Safron from this region is so much better than the Spanish variety, and infinatly better than the dust particles you'll find in your local grocery store.  Long, fragrant threads that infurse incredible flavor that is unrivled.  No matter safron used to be worth more than its weight in gold - bricks of it used to be used as currency back in Marco Polo's days.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about safron - time to go cook something.
