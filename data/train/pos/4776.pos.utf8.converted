So we're all supposed to drink lots of water and I don't know about you, but the plain stuff gets old for me after awhile. I don't always want to drink unsweetened tea because of the caffeine. A lot of the other "water additive" packets out there are full of artificial sweeteners - aspartame in particular, which gives me migraines. So I picked this up, and it really does solve all my issues with the other water additives I've tried. It gives water a nice authentic orange flavor (not at all fake, like kids' powdered drinks can be), it's not sweet (no sugar or sweeteners), and no calories. It just makes water very refreshing and good to drink, plus it has vitamin C. I am now ordering the True Lemon and True Lime because we never manage to keep lemon juice around for long in our house. I have even given water with True Orange in it to my son; I would never give him water with any of the artificially-colored or sweetened powder in it, but I feel perfectly OK giving him this, and it makes a nice change for him too. This is one of those "why didn't someone think of it sooner" products that I just love. Very recommended if you're trying to drink more water and want to jazz it up a little. Is also great in tea!
