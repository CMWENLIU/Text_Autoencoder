I grew up in Hawaii and often ate coconut in many forms--fresh out of the shell (yes, I laughed at Tom Hanks' inability to open a coconut in "Cast Away"--I could have told him to look for the soft spot near the top), in baked goods, as haupia (a Hawaiian coconut dessert), and of course in pina coladas. Now living on the East Coast, I became disgusted with the overly-sugary, fake-tasting coconut flakes found in typical grocery stores, so I was delighted to find this product. I mix these coconut flakes with some of the coconut milk powder and warm water, and after letting the flakes soak for a few minutes, I eat the mixture straight out of the bowl. It tastes almost like fresh coconut this way. I will eventually get around to using these flakes in baked goods, but it's so good plain that I'm reluctant to mix it with anything else.<br /><br />i will definitely order more when I finish my current supply.
