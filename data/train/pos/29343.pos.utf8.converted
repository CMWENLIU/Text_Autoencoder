This plant was shipped to me very quickly, however it was mailed during winter and arrived nearly dead. That explains the COLD part of the title. I found the contact number for the company and called them but they did not answer their phone. I was surprised since the company has a 5 star rating. Now comes the HOT part of the title. No, it wasn't me getting hot under the collar. Imagine my surprise when they called me back in about 1 hour! I had not left a message, or a number, but they called! Next thing I knew they were arranging for a replacement to be shipped in the warmer months! Now THAT is customer service. By the way, before the plant completely died I noticed that it has a unique scent to it. I found it a very "green and earthy" scent. I am really looking forward to spring!
