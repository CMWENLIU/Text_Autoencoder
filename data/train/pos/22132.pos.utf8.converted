If you have problems with Aspartame (which is in every gum out there...not just sugarfree gums) and you love to chew gum then SteviaDent is really the only option unless you want to eat TicTacs.  It is really good although quite expensive, but completely worth it to me so as not to compromise my health.  I chewed every gum out there and lots of it, but had recently started to notice a painful lump on the roof of my mouth. My immediate reaction was...of course cancer, but I had 2 dentists and an oral surgeon check it out and all confirmed it was not. Not only that, Aspartame upset my stomach to the point that I had an extreme amount of bloating and gas every day.  I didn't initially attribute either of these things to Aspartame, but when I started to notice the lump was bigger and more painful upon chewing my old gum, I started doing my research and Aspartame turned out to be the culprit. I ended up ordering a case of the SteviaDent and pitched everything I owned that contained Asapartame.  The lump on the roof of my mouth disappeared within 2 days of not ingesting aspartame and my stomach bloating and gas completely went away.  Worth spending the extra $ until more gums start making their product with Stevia instead of Aspartame.
