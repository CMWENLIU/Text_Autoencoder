I still can't believe I'm paying this much for salt, but it is definitely worth it.  Every time I bypass the salt section of my grocery store, I see the salt for 98 cents -- Oh well, I'm worth it to have the best salt on earth.  If you've never had Himalayan Pink Salt, you have missed a lot.  It has a great salt taste that leaves out the "bite" of regular salt.  Also, I have an ayurveda practitioner friend who told me to use this salt always because it doesn't have any of the bad effects of regular salt.  It apparently doesn't effect blood pressure as bad as regular salt, and there are many health benefits from all the minerals in it.  Health benefits aside, this salt just tastes amazing.  You have to try it to know what I'm talking about, because words lack the means to describe the smooth, silky, full salt taste with a gentle robustness that surprises the palate in ways that only Himalayan Pink Salt can.  Buy it once, and you'll be hooked on the goodness...
