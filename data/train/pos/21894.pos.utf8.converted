This recently redeemed saturated fat is an unusually elegant offering. Liquid above 78 degrees, when below that temperature this exotic substance solidifies into a white, wax-like, creamy fat which for my tastes is even more versatile, flavorful, and healthful in culinary concoctions than coconut milk [though I LOVE everything about coconut].<br /><br />Since other reviews have effectively detailed health benefits, varieties of uses, and comparisons of brands, I'll work another angle and design a recipe specifically for the assets of this oil as my experience with it conjures...<br /><br />Imagine melting this creamy solid as you might do with dry chunks of fresh, unsalted butter dropped easily into a chef's stainless steel [or cast iron] skillet.  After the coconut lard has melted, coating the pan with its clear, wavering liquid radiating from mildly searing heat [not over 350 degrees], carefully sizzle in a half-dozen large, cleaned prawns and a fresh salmon steak.  Prior to hitting the pan, the sea morsels should have been eased from a state of cool moisture into a warmer, drier presentation, to avoid spattering when placed into the heated oil, and to avoid cooling the oil to a temperature too low for an immediate, light searing to occur on the surface of the ocean-plumped, sweet-pink edibles.<br /><br />Think of the sweet, paradise-rich flavor of coconut, coating a crisp, caramelized surface onto the salty tang of the shrimp and salmon meats... [Your mouth might be watering now. Mine is!]<br /><br />Put on a CD with the happy 40's tune of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005MWP">Rum & Coca Cola</a> sending dancing notes around your stove-top, putting an upbeat rhythm into your head ... from down in Trinidad.  [Your feet will be making up their own motions now.]<br /><br />Crack a bit of sea salt crystal over the hissing ocean treats. Overlap that seasoning with cleaned, halved garlic cloves dropped into the skillet, followed by large sprigs of fresh dill, fennel stalks, and a half-cup of shelled, dark walnut meats.<br /><br />After the pan's contents have been seared golden on all main sides, pour in about a cup of dry white wine [enough liquid to retain itself without simmering away into steam, but not so much as to smother the meats and dissolve the top layer of dark, caramelized coating]. Squeeze a fresh lime into the steaming liquid in the pan, followed by a splash or two of quality blackberry juice and a sliced, fresh, ripe peach [which will stew into the concoction, coalescing into an almost unimaginable flavor of sweet, sour highlights held by a texture of pulpy fruit]. Simmer and swish the heavenly blend maybe a minute, taking care to heat all participants but not overcook the shrimp or salmon.<br /><br />Crack fresh black pepper over the brew in the skillet, then serve onto a large, multi-colored, festive plate, over a mound of Quinoa [see my review  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0C56M">Alter Eco Fair Trade White Quinoa from Bolivia, 16-Ounce Boxes</a>] which has been cooked, then warmly toasted in Macadamia Nut Oil [see my review of  Macadamia Nut Oil 16 fl.oz] with garlic bits and chives, adding fresh mint as a last touch.<br /><br />Garnish the presentation of Quinoa, Prawns, and salmon steak with sugar snap peas which have been sauteed in almond oil [see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LVFSU">NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil, Edible, 16 ounce</a>] with slivers of red onion, angle-sliced celery, toasted, halved almonds, and sprigs of fresh cilantro.<br /><br />There you have a culinary rainbow, from a Shelnutt dreaming in Eden's Sea Breeze Garden.<br /><br />Before taking your first, saliva-rich bite, with your "Rum & Coca Cola" CD still dancing through the air waves in your gorgeous, eat-in, gourmet kitchen, be sure to have your KINDLE to read at the table, with a story ready which will rhythm your thoughts into the 50's, when songs from the 40's were still dancing in the minds of the cooks of the world, COAL & COCA-COLA, a short, true story with photos, about a bakery opened in that vintage era.<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />This review gives a complement, contrast to a video review I've posted on Dr. Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a>.
