My dogs have been eating Evolution for about the past 5 years. People always remark about how gorgeous their coats are and ask me what I do, that I must brush them and bathe them all the time. I do neither. People also can't believe my older dog is 9 because she looks and acts so young. They still love the food after all this time. I usually mix in a little canned, which Evolution also sells. The only thing I wish for that could improve it would be for it to be organic.
