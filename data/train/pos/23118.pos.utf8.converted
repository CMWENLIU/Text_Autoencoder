I've been using this deodorant for 2 years now. I am a person that shops by smell when buying deodorant, so other features don't matter much to me. I first got a small sample of this deodorant and brought it along on my vacation. I came back associating my vacation with the smell of this deodorant. It smells amazing and reading the other reviews here, I felt compelled to write my bit in agreement. When I put this deodorant on, I feel like it would last until the end of the day. I would never have to worry about re-application ("24 hour protection"). It gives you confidence and makes you feel good knowing that you smell great, not to mention that it is composed of 1/4 translucent moisturizer ("smoother underarms in 5 days. go sleeveless!").
