I wasn't too sure what to expect with this product and purchased it with the Cooking with Coconut Flour book by Bruce Fife.  I have made the coconut bread recipe over and over.  It tastes like a not so sweet pound cake.  It is great for breakfast plain or with honey.  It has a lot of staying power with the fiber and eggs (and yes the butter!).  I did try the pancakes but must have done something wrong because they were very flat albeit tasty.  Cooking solely with coconut flour is a totally different experience...certainly not as easy as wheat flour.  Although I can eat wheat, I do have issues with blood glucose levels slowly rising with age and the fiber in coconut flour is supposed to help with spikes.<br />I don't like having to sift the flour for each recipe so I just go ahead and sift the flour for the bread recipe with the baking powder and make seveal at a time and store in the freezer--just one less bowl to clean up when I make the bread.
