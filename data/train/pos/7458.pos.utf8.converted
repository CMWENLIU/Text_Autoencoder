The turmeric arrived much faster than expected, and the quality was far superior than expected.<br /><br />I have used turmeric in my cooking for many years, both for Indian-inspired dishes and also for the coloring effects it adds to certain dishes or components of dishes.<br /><br />A few month ago, my mother got me into taking turmeric for the health benefits.  She was having extreme respiratory issues and problems with severe arthritis.  She had several traditional medical treatments and nothing seemed to be working.  After she did a bunch of research, she found a bunch of information regarding the health benefits of turmeric.  After taking turmeric twice a day for about 8 weeks, she was able to be taken off of oxygen and she no longer has problems with her arthritis.  She is no longer taking any other medications and has no further problems as long as she continues to take her turmeric every day.<br /><br />If you are planning on taking turmeric for the health benefits, I highly recommend you do some research first.  The basics are that you need to take about 1 tsp of turmeric mixed into a liquid that contains a fat (such as whole milk) along with about 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper (the black pepper helps with absorption and the nutrients in the turmeric need the fat because they are fat-soluble and not water-soluble).  Do the research before you begin and don't just take my word for it... there are a lot of very respectable medical institutions currently conducting research on turmeric for treating such things as arthritis, acne, joint pain, pain management, respiratory problems, and even cancer, so you should have no problems finding more information online.<br /><br />I usually just take powdered turmeric in a not-too-revolting mixture recipe that I got from my mother: I mix 1 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric in a 12oz glass of V8 along with 1 tsp of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 Tbs of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic.  (all that's missing is the vodka)<br /><br />The bottom line is that this turmeric powder is not only great quality, but it is also very inexpensive and in a much larger volume than you might expect.  Shipping was also very fast and I will be buying from this seller again in the future.
