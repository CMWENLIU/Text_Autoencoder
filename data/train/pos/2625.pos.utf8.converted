This tomato paste makes an excellent spaghetti sauce. Try it with Lawry's thick and rich spaghetti sauce.  It is a bit more expensive than pate in the stores but does taste great and with Amazon prime you pay nothing to have it shipped to your door.  Comes with 24 6oz cans perfect match up to the 24 packets of Lawry's spaghetti sauce packets.  This also beats lugging lots of little cans back from the store.
