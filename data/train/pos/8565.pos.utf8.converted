I'm trying to reduce sodium in my diet and saw this at the grocery store on sale, so bought two kinds (the regular and butter-flavored kind; there's a garlic-flavored one but I couldn't find it).  When I first opened one, I tasted it, just put some grains in my hand and licked it.  It tasted horrible.  Then I read on the bottle that it shouldn't be eaten directly, and tried it on food.  The food tasted saltier.  It's not exactly the same as table salt, but it works, especially if you use it with something you're cooking.  Just don't taste it on its own.
