Contrary to it's name, this is actually a seed and is gluten free.  Very easy to cook, cooks like couscous: add hot water and leave to cook, or you can simmer at low heat for no more than 10 minutes.  Ends up soft, not fluffy, and I usually add a vegetable stock like mushroom, or chicken and it absorbs the flavors.<br /><br />I also use this as a substitute for bulged in recipes and acts as a great combo with any meatball dishes (reduce the meat content) and is a great filler.  We can't taste the grain in the meatball at all!  Use instead of rice or potato.<br /><br />A little goes a long way, so although each packet appears small, you actually find a cup of grain wil feed at least 6 people.<br /><br />I wished amazon did a smaller amount like 6 per delivery for those who do not have a lot of storage space.
