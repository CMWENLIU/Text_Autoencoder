Like all California Natural foods, the herring and sweet potato flavor is great for dogs with allergies.  Our dog is allergic to something in even the highest quality foods--we think it might be beef or chicken, but we're not 100% sure.  Either way, his constant itching and biting his feet cleared up within two weeks when we switched to the California Natural Lamb and Rice.  I wanted to have another option to switch it up with, so we tried the herring flavor.  Still great for his allergies, but I think I know why it's not carried in our local pet store: it STINKS.  I don't know why I wasn't expecting that... it's made with fish, after all!  But our dog loves it and it will make a nice change when we want to switch it up.  I highly recommend trying the California Natural foods before trying any expensive allergy medications or "prescription" foods from the vet.
