My six year old son has Celiac disease. He loves these pretzels! He sees his siblings eating pretzels all of the time and wanted some that he could eat. I've tasted them and they are really tasty! My 15 year old daughter that doesn't have Celiac disease is always saying that she likes his pretzels more than the regular ones.
