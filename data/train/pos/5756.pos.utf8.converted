I wanted to try these for the great benefits I have read about. As a vegetarian, I don't get my Omega-3's from any fish source, so I normally depend on Flax seeds. I have read that Chia seeds contain an even higher amount of Omega-3. . I mix 2 tablespoons with a small glass of orange juice and drink it down. You have to drink it quickly, because they absorbe the liquid quickly, and become very thick in no time. I love the idea of this happening in my intestines, and the benefit there was definitely obvious, so as a fiber source, I also highly recommend them. I even tried them as an egg substitute, something I had also read was possible, and in banana bread, they worked out just fine. I love that they are ready to use, Flax seeds have to be ground, so Chia seeds are really perfect to take on trips.I will definitely continue to buy and use these.
