I'm so glad I went out on a limb and tried this soup.  Even though it it more expensive than most tomato soups, it is actually worth it!  It is now the only tomato soup we buy.  It's just creamy enough, and I love the seasoning!  My toddler son is a very picky eater, but he loves this soup and requests it often.  What are you waiting for... buy this soup- you won't be sorry!!
