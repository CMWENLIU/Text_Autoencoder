If the wines are a little watery just make 5 gallon instead of 6, you will be plesantly suprised in the difference. Because, corks, labels, shipping is all free it's still around $2.00 per bottle. I always keep extra yeast in the refrigerator so if the date is expired I just grab 1 of them. I am rather impressed with the Vino Italiano brand.
