I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this.  And I hesitated and hesitated...  But, I'm glad I finally got this!  This tastes delicious and it was so easy.<br /><br />You get 6 individually packaged boxes and each package has the directions. The packages contain one foil packet of the paste.  I first melted the butter with the water and then mixed the paste in. Then I added the chicken and cooked until ready.  That's it!  It was really all I did and it came out great.  The smell in the house while this is cooking was heavenly.<br /><br />I used a little less butter than the recipe asked for and it still turned out delicious.  We served this over rice and we really enjoyed it.<br /><br />There is also a Microwave Oven recipe for those folks that don't have a stove or would rather use the Microwave.<br /><br />The expiration dates on these were all well out into late next year, so I have plenty of time to use these.  But, there is no way they are going to last that long.  I'm sure I'll use these all up in the next month or so.<br /><br />Because of the great success with this item, I ordered some of the other items from this line.  I'm eager to test them out and see if they are as wonderful as this one.<br /><br />I have always wanted to make a tasty Indian dish at home and just didn't know how to go about it.  I'm so glad I found these.  Big taste.  And big money saver versus going to my local Indian restaurant.
