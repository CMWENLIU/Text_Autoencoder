My oldest daughter is very into natural healing and products. She suggested Manuka honey. It has a very good taste and can be used externally as well. My youngest daughter had a place on her arm we applied the honey, the next day it was completely gone. We also did this on a cat, who was having skin problems.This is an excellant product!!
