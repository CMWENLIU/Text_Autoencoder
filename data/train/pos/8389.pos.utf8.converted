I have two Chi's and they LOVE the rough rawhide ones but they ignore the smooth ones.<br /><br />I bought the two of the toys that these rings go with and they could care less about those.  I just give them the ring and they toss it, chase it and chew it.  I only wish they sold a pack of only the rough rawhide.
