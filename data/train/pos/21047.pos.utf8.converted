This dish has wowed me so much that I now crave it.  It has a wonderful sourness (green chili and tamarind) that is tamed by the pureed almonds and peanuts that make this dish so rich.  I love the chili flavor, and it is one of the few Kitchens of India dishes that actually has ghee listed on the ingredient list. I feel completely satisfied by this dish.  It is a taste experience I want again and again.  My husband also likes it very much.  Very,very delicious.
