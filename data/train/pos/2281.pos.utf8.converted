I recently purchased a case of these for myself, and was surprised to find out that my children prefer these to rice krispies treats. They love the chewy texture and sweet taste, and it makes a convenient breakfast on the go or after school snack. I like the fact that these are whole grain and convenient to take anywhere. The price at Amazon is amazingly low compared to the grocery store!
