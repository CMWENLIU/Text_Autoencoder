I bought this on a lark after seeing that it was an energy booster. They're not kidding. I'm a grad student and rarely get enough sleep (and really, how many of us do?), but after a smoothie with a spoonful of maca in the afternoon, I fell asleep effortlessly that night and then nearly exploded out of bed the next day (badly startling my poor bf, I'm afraid--he's always been a morning person, but I generally am a hard sleeper and require lots of loud noise, multiple alarm clocks and strong coffee in the morning to get going.) I've been charging out of bed every morning since. Yet there's no caffeine jitters, no crazy buzz; you can sit quietly or go work out or read or whatever you normally do.<br /><br />The taste--well, it's got a little bit of an unpleasant bite, and I find myself adding more fruit, agave nectar or stevia to my smoothies to compensate. Maca is also sold toasted (or maybe roasted?) and is supposed to be sweeter and much tastier that way, so if the taste is bothersome and you don't care if it's raw or not, that might be a good option.
