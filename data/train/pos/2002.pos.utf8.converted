This product delivers on exactly what it promises.  The pens have a nice fine tip on them so that you can make delicate designs on food items like fondant cakes and figures.  I really can't imagine a food designer that does not have a set of these pens around to add creativity to their cakes, cupcakes or cookies!  The colors come out so evenly and the tones are very vibrant.  A truly wonderful product! A+++++!
