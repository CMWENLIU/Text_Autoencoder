I always take it when I run 10 miles or more.  I carry it in pockets in my fitness shorts or shirt (they are coming out with more fitness clothes with pockets, and it's really convenient).  It makes recovery faster and I find my legs feel a whole lot better if I take it.  I also like that the caffeine in it is not that much.  I can't even tolerate a small cup of coffee, but the amount of caffeine in GU is just enough to give me a little fast energy while running, without giving me a "caffeine rush".  The chocolate outrage tastes pretty good too.  It can be messy too, so be warned and have somewhere to put the empty packets (because you wont want to carry them in your hand).  I wash it down with some fluids and stick the empty packet in the empty bottle.  If the bottle is not empty, I put it in my pocket.
