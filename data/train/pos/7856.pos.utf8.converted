IMPORTANT:  This Review is for Royal Canin "Gastrointestinal Fiber Response" and I'm not sure that's what this one is...(see other reviews). I did not buy this here...<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />I've tried laxatone, lax'aire, catlax, and cisapride.  Though my cat loved the taste of them (except for the laxatone which he eventually got sick of), none of them fixed his constipation problem.  He was struggling to go and going anywhere and everywhere in the house.  I mixed this food 50-50 with our regular Science Diet Mature Formula and now he actually has diarrhea.  I've cut down to about 40% of the new cat food and we almost have it right.  The cat's poop stinks horribly, but at least he can go and it's in the litter box. It's only been a couple of weeks so I don't know about long-term results...<br /><br />UPDATE (Sept, 2012):<br />  Long-term results are great! We call this the pooping food. :) This still works fantastic and I have all of my cats eating it, even though only one of them actually needs it. They also all love the taste and seem to mine for this cat food when I have it mixed with another one. The cats have adjusted to it so they could probably eat it straight now (no more diarrhea), but it's so expensive that I think I'll still mix it (FYI, you can find this cheaper elsewhere online or possibly from your vet; it's not in regular pet stores). I'm at about a 50-50 mix again, partly just because the cats like this stuff so much. I quit mixing with Science Diet since the formula seems to have changed and it smells awful now (neither I nor the cats seem to want to tolerate that). We've sometimes had problems (e.g., throwing up) with the cats when the cat food has run low in the dish because the cats already ate all/most of the royal canin, but that might be from the gross Science Diet formula. I've gone to 1/2 meow mix now, with no ill effects, but the cats still try to pick out the royal canin. I'll probably try to mix with a more generic royal canin one next. I guess the point is that it doesn't matter what you mix this stuff with, as long as your cats like the mix.<br />  Although I'm completely sold on this cat food since I no longer have to worry about being on the lookout for poopy surprises (yuck!), there is a drawback. If your cats tend to throw up or get hairballs, this cat food seems to stain the carpet more than other foods. Sometimes I can't get the yellowish stain out even with my tried and true SpotShot spray and PetBot machine, which have never failed me before. Good luck. If you're reading this, you and your cat are probably very frustrated. Hope this stuff helps you too! I'm throwing away all of the prescription and OTC laxatives I bought because I haven't used them once since I started this food. They better keep making this stuff!!!
