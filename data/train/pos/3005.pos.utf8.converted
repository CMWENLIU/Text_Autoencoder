If you've never tried this French Vanilla coffee, then you're in for a real treat.  I took this into work the other day and literally, it looked like one of those weird commercials when people are floating towards the coffee room!  Everyone went crazy over this stuff - it smells so much like caramel when it's brewing and when it is done, the flavor is just so very rich that I just drink it black.  I really cannot recommend this one enough, and everyone that I know that has tried it, now keeps it on hand all the time.  This is my morning breakfast coffee now - lot less calories than a doughnut with the same effect (well, sorta!).  This is a little pricey here though.  I pay four dollars for it at my local hardware store (yes, I did say hardware store!).  This is the number one brand of coffee in the country, per consumer reports. Highly, highly recommend!
