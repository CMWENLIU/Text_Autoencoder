I'm mother of twins and without this tea I wouldn't be able to get enough milk to feed them both. I drink 4 cups a day for 5 months already and my milk supply is stable. I am pumping every 3 hours during the day and every 4 hours during the night. Before that tea I was getting 3oz from 1 pumping session, with that tea I am getting between 7oz to 8oz of milk. The highest number was 10oz :-)
