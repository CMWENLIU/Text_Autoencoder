...because it is more potent. i dont know why they dont make the larger version with the same concentration of sweetness. takes twice as many drops with the big bottle--the dispenser is has a better design on the tiny bottles too. sweetens nicely. i will admit that it does have a slight aftertaste, but i think it is less noticeable than splendas. fun to use with flavored, unsweetened, sparkling water. a lot easier and cleaner than splenda in powdered form. stuff is great!
