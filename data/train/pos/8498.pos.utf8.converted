There was a lot of liquid in the pouch and the fillet seemed soggy and wet.  I bought four of them without trying them first so I figured I'd screwed up.  But then I broke off a piece and ended up making a squealing pig out of myself, oh my.  The wet slimy little fillet was the best tasting SSS I've ever tried.  It was so good I ate the whole thing after dinner, GLADIOLAS!<br /><br />I'll de-package and weigh the next one to see if they tared the liquid.  I'll buy it no matter anyway.  Even people that don't have a taste for smoked salmon/ sockeye might like this, very mild and extremely flavorful. It's the alder wood I think.
