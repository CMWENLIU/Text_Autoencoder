my friend told me how she loves these YummyEarth lollipops, so I bought a bag to share at work.  everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days.  really packed with great flavor.  different than other candy.  very fruity and real tasting, not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy.  just awesome taste.  pretty cool, too, that it's organic.
