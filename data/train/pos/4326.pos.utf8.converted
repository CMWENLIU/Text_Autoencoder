I saw the commercial for this and thought I'd give it a try. My dogs are very picky eaters and often leave kibble behind in their bowl. I end up having to throw them out cuz they refuse to eat them again. I normally buy a bag of dog food with a variety of flavors and textures like Chewy pieces and meat filled nuggets, etc but often time they leave certain flavors/kibble behind. But when I purchased two bags of the Canine Creations ... OMG ! Not a Crumb nor Kibble was left behind. I believe it's made from freeze-dried beef and kibble pieces. Moose *One of my dogs* can be a pig sometimes when he comes across something delicious. He won't share with his sister. This is one of them. The daily recommended feeding is 1 cup so I put one cup but Moose would eat every last bit and not leave any for his sister. I tried maybe 2 cups so they'll be some left but then he'd just eat all 2 cups. I tried separating their bowls but she won't eat without her brother. So I just hand feed her and let him eat outta the bowl. I know spoiled but Chef Michael's Canine Creation is FOR SURE thee best Dog Food I have purchased. I'm gonna be continually purchasing these for my dogs from now on. If I could I'd actually rate this 10+ stars !!
