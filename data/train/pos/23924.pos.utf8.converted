I just got my first case and let it get cold in the fridge for a couple days.  Drank my first bottle tonight and let me tell you, it tastes like.....WATER!  I didn't detect any dirty taste or even an aftertaste.  I don't understand what people are saying it tastes funky because all I drink is water and milk.  This tastes like my bottled regular water.  I'm going to switch to 2-3 bottles of BLK Water a day and see if it really makes me feel any better and energized.
