This is the highest quality I have seen. And when they say use sparingly they mean it. I needed it for a recipie and used half of the amount the recipie asked for and it was still VERY strong. Next time I will reduce it to a quarter of the amount listed in the recipie.<br /><br />Glad I found this seller for this product.
