I love this little machine.  I worked as a professional nanny for years before having my own baby and I made a lot of baby food during that time (lucky kids :)  This machine makes home made baby food a cinch!<br /><br />Here is what I love:<br /><br />Smaller batches - unless you are living your own version of "baby boom" you just don't need to make gallons of apple sauce<br /><br />Fast!  I can have baby food in about 10 minutes, so if I run out, it just takes a few minutes to make something fresh<br /><br />Great puree - really smooth and creamy, or as chunky as you wish<br /><br />it's small - not a space hog in my cramped kitchen<br /><br />Looks cute - so I don't having it out all the time<br /><br />If you are leaning towards getting the device, or registering one for your baby shower - DO IT!  you will love it, promise.
