I ordered this near the end of January when advertised for $19.80 for the same 3-pack along with Prime two-day free shipping. Never received the order. Amazon has sent several emails that the order will ship when product is available and I even extended the open order when requested. I doubt Amazon will fulfill this order now that the price has almost doubled and is over $45 with shipping.  Wal-mart is selling an 18-count pack for about $11.
