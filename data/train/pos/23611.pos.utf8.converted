UPDATE: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at Bon App&eacute;tit magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show on Dec. 30, 2009 and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it be a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hambuger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Sriracha is also an excellent value. Amazon offers three 28-ounce bottles for less than $14, or about 16 cents an ounce. That's a lot of flavor for your dollar.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth.
