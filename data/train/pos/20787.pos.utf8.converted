Kona coffee is world reknowned as being some of the best in the world, and I can speak with experience knowing that this domestic blend compares favorably with some of the best.<br /><br />However, I only ask those in Hawaii who farm and roast these beans to forgive me for saying that I think Konas are a bit overrated in the world of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, these beans have a lot of flavor.  The body is unrivalled.  Everything is balanced in a way that is unique to the Kona bean, but there are no subtle undertones prevalent that make me like the Sumatran and Ethiopian beans so much better.  The beans are aesthetically perfect in every way, and I only have to use about 2/3 the portion of what I would use to make my favorite brews, but this is where it gets touchy for me.  I pay about $12-13 a lb for coffee that might not be better than Kona coffee, but I like it better.  Hawaii Growers makes a mighty fine coffee, one of the best Konas I've ever tasted, but it isn't worth more than $25 a lb.  No coffee is worth that to me, and I've tasted the world's finest.<br /><br />Hawaii Growers is very competitively priced compared to other Konas, so if Kona coffee is the drinker's coffee of choice, then Hawaii Growers is a great choice.  For someone who prefers coffee from other regions, Kona still stacks up well, but a purchase for me was to simply try something new rather than to look for a new regular.
