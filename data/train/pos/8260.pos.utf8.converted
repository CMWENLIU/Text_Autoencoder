Parmigiano Reggiano, mostly grated for use by most of us here in the U.S., is considered very wrong in Italy to use as a "grating" cheese. It's used as shavings for toppings to dishes or just for eating chunks. NEVER grated. The best by far is Parmigiano Reggiano Resirva Stravecchio. YUM-O!<br /><br />But I'm here in the U.S., so I do it both ways. Great to eat (wonderful, nutty flavor to me). I use it on pastas, salads, bruschettas. Top off some Artisan toasted bread with pesto and grate this cheese over it, or put a nice shaving on it and set it under the broiler...OMG! It'll make you sass your mama!
