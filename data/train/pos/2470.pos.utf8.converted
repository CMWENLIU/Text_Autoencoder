I bought this brand without having tried it beforehand because I couldn't find any mulling spices in bags in the local grocery stores last month, and I was ready for some apple juice and mulling spices.  It tastes very good, much the same as another brand a friend shared with me last year.  I have tried other instant brands but didn't care for them.  These are perfect for me, although the amount I had to buy here on amazon was really more than what I wanted.
