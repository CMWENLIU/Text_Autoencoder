Being a person who has hated water all of my life, I have tried various ways to make water palatable and always failed.  Doctors, friends, family and various health articles all say our bodies need x amount of water daily.  Well, for me to drink water was always a dreaded experience because drinking a glass of water felt like a ton of lead in my stomach, so I just did not drink it. On rare occasions when really thirsty, I will make an effort to swallow water and force myself to not let it come back up. Because of my intense dislike of water, I can truthfully say I only drink a (small) glass of water about twice a year.  Really.  I don't  drink sodas, beer or much of any other beverage except milk. I love milk. But, the only water in my diet is what I get from coffee (1 or 2 cups a day) and whatever other foods/drinks that might contain water. But never just plain water.  Hate it. I have tried a squirt of Lemon in water...hated that too.  In hot weather I will drink Lemonade on occasion, but still not enough to say I got my daily requirement.<br /><br />Well, someone told me to at least try Mio to see what I think about it.  Tonight was the first time I tried it and now I feel that finally, I have found something to add to water to make it palatable to me, thus taking a big step to making myself healthier. In the long run, this product can be responsible for saving my life or at least making the rest of my life healthier by making water something I will now drink on a daily basis and actually enjoy it.
