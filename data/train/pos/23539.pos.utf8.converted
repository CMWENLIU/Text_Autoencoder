This is the awesome sauce you've heard about. In a cheesy not saucy kind of way. This processed cheese food come closer to the taste of cheddar than most processed cheese foods. It's what cheddar would taste like if it were a cheese food and not actually a cheese. The tip has little notches in it like a star tip for a pastry bag so when you push down on the tip it dispenses in a fancy star shape or a nice looking line instead of just a plain line. It's decorative and tasty. It's like cheese frosting for crackers, meatloaf or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5NHE">Spam</a>.<br />My favorite way to eat it is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9XBD4">Wheat Thins</a>.<br />For parties, I recommend serving it on crackers in a star shape, and topping the crack with half of a pimento stuffed olive. It will look very classy!
