This is the best substitute for soy sauce I have tried...and I have tried a lot! I highly recommend coconut aminos for anyone following a Paleo life style as I do or for anyone with a soy allergy.  This product tastes fantastic! I just used it in thai basil chicken and you really can't tell it wasn't made with soy sauce. Not only does it taste great, it's also a million times healthier for you than soy sauce or even Bragg's Soy Aminos. Buy this product, you won't be disappointed.
