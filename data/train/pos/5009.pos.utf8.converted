I don't get it -- everywhere I go now, mediocre coconut juice is in stores now for 5 times the price as this brand.  This brand uses young THAI coconut, which is far sweeter than the young coconut from the Caribbean and Brazil that other products use.  I am such a fanatic that I cut down several young coconuts fresh from trees while on trips to both Hawaii and Puerto Rico and those were not even as good as this product.  I've been fortunate enough to also sample fresh young coconut juice once while on a trip to Thailand and while, admittedly, this product was not quite as good as having it fresh off the tree in Thailand, it does give you an approximation of what that is like.
