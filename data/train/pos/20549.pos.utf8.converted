I like this product alot. It has 8g protein and 6g fiber per 4oz serving. It is easier to eat than the brand nuts one. It is not real hard like the other brand nuts one. It comes in a box with 6 smaller boxes of cereal. It is a heavier cereal and the boxes are smaller than regular cereal boxes. It is very nutritious and healthy. No added sugar and no flour. It is all sprouted grain. This is what I need. I hope you like it also.
