My rating is for the service I received from Corazonas when I notified them the batch of these Chips I received were much too salty for me.  They responded then next day, agreeing to substitute my Chip purchase with a like amount of Oatmeal Squares, which have become a favorite of mine.  Within a couple days I received the replacement, well packed and with discount coupons as well.  This is a company fully committed to customer service.
