I'm one of those weird people who has never been able to drink water.  I don't like the taste of it, it makes me gag when it's going down, and it just stresses me out even thinking of drinking water.  I know, I know, I have issues... Anyway, I'm getting OLDER and realizing that drinking 5 bottles of flavored sugary Snapple is not going to cut it for my daily liquid intake any more.  Then our cafeteria at work started stocking this stuff and I thought I'd give it a try.  I was IMMEDIATELY hooked.  It's just damn good.  It's not sickly sweet or overpowering with fake fruity flavor like some of the other flavored waters.  It's just the right HINT of flavor.  I'm addicted.  Now I get regular deliveries to make sure I don't run out.
