I have tried quite a few different brands of Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil and this has got to be one of the best.  I use it for everything....frying,sauteing, baking, skin lotion, hair.  It works really well on my kids' dry skin, and they love when I apply it to their lips because it tastes and smells yummy.  The health benefits of this product are outstanding..it's really a "Super Food".  I have researched prices online extensively and Amazon has the best deal on this oil.
