I ordered this for my brother for Christmas.  I have not had a lot of smoked salmon, but he loves it, so I was going in w/ little experience.<br /><br />The first associate I spoke with very graciously explained the differences between wet and dry smoked salmon---all news to me---and how his product was prepared and packaged.  I ordered it and yes, it was a huge hit with my brother.  He said it was excellent.<br /><br />In the meantime, I had mistakenly placed a second order in ordering other things from Amazon.  My fault.  I notified Amazon, and notified Alaska Smokehouse, and was immediately sent confirmation that the second order had been deleted.  However, I did receive the second oder of smoked salmon, although it never showed up on my credit card statement.<br /><br />I called Alaska Smokehouse to ask how to return the second order and they graciously said to keep the salmon, and please enjoy it as a thank you for being a customer.<br /><br />The same brother had a birthday in January, so I sent the second order to him along w/ the story and he was impressed and delighted. He said at Christmas he had to share, but this time around his salmon was a "protected species"!<br /><br />Great product, great service....what more could one ask for????
