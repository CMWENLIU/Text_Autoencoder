I have purchased xylitol from Emerald Forest for several years and was pleased to find it on Amazon. My dentist was the first to introduce me to the benefits of xylitol gum to reduce cavities and he also mentioned research indicated that people had fewer ear infections when they used xylitol (bacteria love sugar). Since it tastes just like sugar, I keep it in the coffee corner at work and no one has identified an aftertaste or a difference in the sweetness. (I do let people know that the "sugar" bowl has xylitol and several people have switched at home to xylitol) A couple years ago I communicated concerns with Emerald Forest over importation of xylitol from China but was impressed with the level of care: the company had safeguards in place to assure product purity. I see that their product is now derived from American trees and is just as fine a product and competitively priced, especially if you subscribe to monthly delivery. My husband uses xylitol mints and I note that Amazon is carrying them too. Emerald Forest's Xylitol is a healthy choice at a great price.
