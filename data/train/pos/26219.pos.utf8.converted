In 1989, during my first trip to China, I was sightseeing on Lamma Island, near Hong Kong.  I spent the entire day there and was rather amazed to not see another Westerner.  It was October and the weather was excellent.<br /><br />Browsing the local markets I spotted tins of tea in one small shop.  I was relatively young at the time--only 39--and being rather uncultured I did not know anything about tea.  Purely guessing I selected two tins each of Lichee Black and Jasmine to take back home with me.<br /><br />When I returned home I put the tins in the cabinet and subsequently forgot them.  Years passed and the tins were packed away during various job-related relocations.  My wife then developed a love for fine tea and was therefor given my tins.<br /><br />One afternoon soon after she asked me about the origin of the tins.  I had to think for a while to remember when/where I had originally purchased it.  Much to my surprise, I realized those tins were now 20 years old.  Curious as to their condition I opened one of the tins of Lichee Black.  The aroma was very clean and inviting.  I therefore made myself a cup.  The flavor of that cup of 20 year-old Lichee Black tea was the finest, most genteel I had ever had.<br /><br />In the subsequent 2-3 years, we've grown to appreciate many varieties of tea.  I continue to hoard my half-pound tin of Lichee Black tea and even after repeatedly opening the canister, the tea continues to stay fresh and aromatic, and incredibly smooth.<br /><br />Having just returned this week from my 5th trip to China (Shanghai and Nanchang, this time) I went to good old Amazon to see if my Lichee Black is still commercially available.  I am amazed and very pleased to see that it is.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this variety of tea, whether you are a connoisseur or a novice.
