These Bob's Red Mill Raisins are the best! They are exceptionally sweet, moist, and tasty - maybe because they are unsulphured - and very fresh! We store them in the freezer (and even bake with them frozen) so they keep two years or more, if they last that long! Great snack, for trail mix, oatmeal cookies, raisin bread, curry, and anything you can think of. One taste of these raisins and you will not buy them at the grocery store ever again.
