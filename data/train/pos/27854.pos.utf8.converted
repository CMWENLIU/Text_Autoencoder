As vegetarians, a good veggie chili is always a fantastic way for us to get lean, easy to prepare protein in a fast, hearty meal.  It is a huge staple of our diet.<br /><br />Hormel veggie chili is so fantastic and so underrated it's insane.  We have tried so many of the other brands and they are so much more expensive, and no better.  The Hormel stuff doesn't have any artificial junk in it, just straightforward wholesome ingredients, like veggies and beans and seasonings.  It's no higher in sodium, and no lower in nutrients than the other canned veggie chilis.  And it runs about $1.50 a can, as opposed to the stuff at the health food store that's always at least twice the price.  It is delicious, easy to make, ready in minutes, practically fat free, high in protein, filling, I could go on and on.  With a family of 5 vegetarians to feed having such an easy meal on hand is a LIFE SAVER.<br /><br />Obviously I know that this is a prepared food, and has a little too much sodium for it to be an everyday treat, but as far as prepared foods go I could not be happier or more impressed with it.
