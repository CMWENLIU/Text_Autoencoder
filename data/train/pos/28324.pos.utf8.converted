My miniature poodle has food allergies and has to avoid wheat gluten and most protein sources.  These are the only treats that she's been given for several years and she adores them.  My other dog doesn't have allergies, but he loves them as well.  I used to buy them at my vet's office, but I recently moved to another city and my vet here doesn't have them.  I was relieved to find that I could order them here.
