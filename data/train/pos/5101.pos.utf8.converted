This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.
