To start this is my first matcha/green tea latte powder that I bought and I have to admit it is really good.  I know they use "unsweetened" matcha in starbuck w/ melon syrup from torani (which they do not sell anymore).  This product already comes sweetened which is great to save money from buying syrups and this items also mixes very well with medium-hot drinks.  My guide to using this is below so its not so sweet to the palette and I use whole milk for the richness.  To close I would recommend this product to anyone and matter of fact about to finish my 3 lbs. bag and buying a refill right now :).<br /><br />Venti = 20oz = 4 tablespoons<br />Grande = 16oz = 3 tablespoons<br />Tall = 12oz = 2 tablespoons
