First, I love this brand of powdered buttermilk and I have been baking with it for over 17 years. That being said,...Saco needs to make a better container that will stand up to shipping this item via Amazon.com. The first shipment I received arrived dented so badly that all of the seals were broken and part of the buttermilk powder had escaped into the packing material. The replacement wasn't in much better shape except that thankfully the seals were in tact and none of product had leaked out.<br /><br />Saco powdered buttermilk will harden over time in its original container and so it is best immediately transferred into a sealed glass or plastic container once opened to keep freshest and easiest to work with. I bake a lot of bread and baked goods each week and this brand of buttermilk is always my go-to ingredient that makes a superior tasting loaf/muffins/croissants with a slightly sourdough aroma due to the subtle tartness of the buttermilk.<br /><br />Definitely worth keeping stocked up in the pantry for all of your baking needs!
