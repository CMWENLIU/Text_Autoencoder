I'm not some fringe mustard snob. I like what i like. it seems odd to me to write a review of mustard, but this stuff has really earned it, and i was just so excited to see that it is now available on Amazon that i decided to clarify things for those who have not tried it. this  stuff is made with beer. in fact, the first ingredient on the label is "Beer." they're not joking either; you can really taste it. this stuff is absolutely worth going out of your way to get for bratwurst, burgers, or pretty much anything. it's rather hard to find in grocery stores, even specialty food stores and high-end groceries, so having it online is very convenient. the point is, do yourself a favor and try this stuff on some grilled brats from the butcher. you will never eat another one without thinking about this mustard.
