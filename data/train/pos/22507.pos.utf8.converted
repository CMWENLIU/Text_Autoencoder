I received the Babycook as a gift and I absolutely love it!  Here's how it works:  Pour some water into the reservoir tank.  Load food into the steamer basket which sits right in the grinder "bowl".  It steams the food perfectly, then you dump the food from the steamer basket into the grinder portion, grind and VIOLA! you have baby food.  I agree with other reviewers that you can grab your steamer and your blender and probably get similar results. . .but now you've got a counter full of kitchen appliances, you have to perfect your steaming capabilities. . .what a pain!!!  This little guy stores easily in a cupboard, you bring him out and he cooks and grinds the food.  Clean up is a breeze.  So worth the investment! (oh, yah. . I forgot, mine was a gift. . but I would buy one in a heartbeat!!!!).  Seriously, it makes "making baby food" a breeze.  I think it would be a chore to bring out the steamer, bring out the blender or food processor, use them, wash them, put them away. I'm LAZY and this little guy makes my baby food making adventures so simple!  Buy it. . .stop thinking about it.
