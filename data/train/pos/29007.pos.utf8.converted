I think not!<br /><br />OF course it is great for all the things people have mentioned, but I have found it particularly wonderful as a facial CLEANSER.  I massage a good bit of the oil over my face and neck, let it sit for a few minutes while I brush my teeth etc., then I take a warm wet cloth and wipe my face.  The excess oil comes off with all the dirt and makeup that was on my face (even the water proof mascara) and it leaves a nice light film of oil that makes my face glow, and for ONCE in my life I'm free of blemishes, even during those particularly difficult times of month! I'm in love!  Next time I'll be ordering a gallon size!
