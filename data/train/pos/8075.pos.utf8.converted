I just got this today from bedbathandbeyond (they have them in store), and its very sweet and pretty delicious.  Much stronger than I expected, and honestly Id prefer this over the coffee shop.  Next time I make a cup i will actually set it to a larger cup to take away just a little bit of the intensity and sweetness, or maybe add some milk to the cup ahead of time.  Overall this exceeded my expectations.
