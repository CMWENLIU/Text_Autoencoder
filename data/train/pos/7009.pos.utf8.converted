I ordered this rice, willing to take a chance, and it turned out be the best brown rice Ive ever eaten or made.<br />I have a rice maker that I have been using to make texmati rice and it was always ok, but the Nishiki rice cooks flawlessly.  Just set the rice maker to brown rice add the rice and fill with water to brown rice line and let it do its thing.(no rinsing or soaking etc.)  The rice comes out perfect!!  The texture of the rice is "meaty" it has substance without being cruchy or undercooked.  The taste is somewhat "nutty and rich".  If your on the fence try it I believe youll be happy.
