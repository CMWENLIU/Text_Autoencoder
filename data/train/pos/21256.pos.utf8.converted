My husband has a serious thing for dates since I bought him several packages of Caramel Naturale dates from our local grocer. Of course, the grocer is now inept at purchasing more of these dates so I had to head out to trusty Amazon to find a suitable replacement.<br /><br />These dates were very good. They were large, sweet, plump and just like the other brand of Medjool dates. Of course now Amazon is short on the other dates so I went with the dates from the Bergen Nut company and paid more and was seriously disappointed in the quality of the dates.<br /><br />So when they are in stock my suggestion would be to stock up on a couple packs if you are really into eating dates daily. I find myself missing these little beauties now that we have run out and they are worth the price as they are very healthy and loaded with vitamins and minerals. Speaking of price - if you are wondering - yes these are a solid value compared to others. The packages are large, larger than the Caramel Naturale dates I had been buying.<br /><br />These are also delicious over ice cream, search around for some recipes. I know Anthony Bourdain did a show where they showed chopped dates in a milkshake which looked sublime..:)<br /><br />Wholeheartedly recommend!<br />And as a side note, if you purchase from Amazon and ever have issue with the quality of a purchase CALL them! They have the best CS on earth (and I have been shopping online for 12 years now so I know) and they want to make right if you are displeased.
