This is an all time favorite.<br /><br />I prefer this over many types of regular coffee. It's very finely ground, smooth, nutty flavored, and it has a very creamy foam on top when you stir it well.<br /><br />Only complaint.... it's way over priced on amazon.<br /><br />I buy this at my local farmer's market for $5 a tin.
