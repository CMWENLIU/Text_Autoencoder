I have tried other brands, but this is the best tasting coconut oil on the market!  I use it anything from stir fries, to chicken dishes.  I also use it in oatmeal instead of butter.  It makes cakes,cookies brownies, etc.. taste better when greasing the pans before baking.  Do your research on coconut oil.  You will discover something good and healthy to add to your diet.  This is one of the good fats that are being recommended by doctors.  It is worth the price.
