I have many allergies including gluten.  These noodles feed that craving though.  I have used them in soup, a stew, in spaghetti sauce with veggies and in Asian dishes. You are limited only by your creativity.  The texture is not al dente as some have said but I don't think it matters.  The only stipulation I make is that I don't mind the smell per se but I do have a reaction to it by getting a headache.  So I share my solution to the solution it's kept in: drain the noodles in a strainer and rinse with cold water.  Place noodles in bowl adding cold water to cover.  Add a splash of white vinegar.  I need to soak them for more than fifteen minutes or else headache appears but after ten or fifteen minutes the noodles are done soaking.  I leave them to drain in the strainer for a few minutes over the bowl.  Use as you like.  I find this easier than the recommended method.  I prepare the base food while the noodles soak and drain.  Bon Appetit!
