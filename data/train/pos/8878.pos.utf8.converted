because this was so divine over slightly melted idiazabal cheese and eggs, I bought at a very expensive cookware store, this past weekend the variety with white truffle at slightly more $.  Both are exceptional and worth the indulgence  One word of advice: shake the dispenser before using, to disperse the truffle pieces.  Lift off the lid and that alone gives you quite a truffle hit!
