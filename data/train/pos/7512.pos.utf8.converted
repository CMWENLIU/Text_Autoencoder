This product is wonderful and a big time saver for me. I used to stuff my own pretzels. I'd buy a big bag of Rold Gold pretzels and a jar of Jiffy peanut butter (you can use Skippy if Jiffy is not available) and then proceed to hollow out each pretzel and fill them with peanut butter. Well, this is a time consuming process but until I found these pre-stuffed pretzels on-line it was the only option I had to satisfy my peanut butter stuffed pretzel addiction. No, they aren't quite as good as my homemade peanut butter pretzels but they are good when you short of time, like when American Idol and Dancing with the Stars are on back to back. One thing about stuffing your own pretzels that I learned early on is that you need to make sure you buy creamy peanut butter and not the crunchy peanut butter. Just trust me on that, it will save you hours of frustration and the results are very disappointing. I hope Kirkland will come out with peanut butter stuffed chocolate some day. Right now I buy a bag full of Hershey's kisses and a jar a peanut butter (prefer Jiffy but you can use Skippy in a pinch) and use a similar process as what I use with my stuffed pretzels.
