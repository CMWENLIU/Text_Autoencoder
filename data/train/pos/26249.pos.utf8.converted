I am from Baton Rouge, LA and currently working overseas.  I loved them.  They weren't dry or too sweet, very creamy and had a good amount of pecans.  I have had better when they are fresh or less expensive.  For what it was worth and considering my options I am very satisfied with this pecan candy. One person here compared it to caramel fudge, if that helps.
