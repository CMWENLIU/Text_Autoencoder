Exactly like the name says, this is a medium roast coffee. I ordered this because of a great price, but I only ordered one as I wasn't sure how it would taste. We just brewed some up in our Keurig, and it is fresh and rich. Very good taste for those who like a medium roast. One of the best coffees I've tasted so far and it's a bonus that this is fair trade (two thumbs up) and organic (two thumbs up). Recommended.
