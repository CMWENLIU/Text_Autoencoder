after years of using starbucks espresso roast in my gaggia titanium, i thought i'd try something different.  there is really NO comparison...the lavazza beans produce coffee that is less bitter and sweeter than any of the starbucks coffees...there is a lovely thick crema on top of the glass (thicker and tastier than any i've ever tried)  i can even happily enjoy full cups of americano coffee from my gaggia (doesn't work really well with other beans, again, they tend to be bitter and acidy)<br /><br />highly recommended!
