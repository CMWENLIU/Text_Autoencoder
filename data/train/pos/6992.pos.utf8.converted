This was our first time trying smoked salmon that wasn't from Scotland. This is every bit as good and far more affordable. It's pre-sliced (thinly and no bones), lightly and perfectly smoked and easy on the salt. We're going back to serving it for the holidays (with lemon slices, capers and very thin circles of onion)...you can't beat that for a tradition and it's a healthy one!
