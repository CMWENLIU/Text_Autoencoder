My exceptional body is sensitive to many of the ingredients used in most prepared foods, e.g., wheat, dairy, peanuts, lemon and soy.  Additionally, I do not eat foods that contain processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, preservatives or artifical food coloring or flavors. Since the foods I do eat are not always readily available, I carry a snack bar with me in case of a hunger attack.  Enjoy Life snack bars meet all my eating and health requirements and even taste really good. I have been enjoying Cocoa Loco and Very Berry snack bars for over six months and I am looking forward to trying their new flavors. My husband says  eating with me is like buying a car with Ralph Nader. I READ the labels! Thanks to Enjoy Life food can be fun, tasty, good for you and chocolate.
