Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.<br /><br />On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture "lifebits" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.<br /><br />I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Here's a summary of the nutritional information:<br />-Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup.<br />-One cup contains 478 calories<br />-Major ingredients:<br />Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).<br /><br />I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it.
