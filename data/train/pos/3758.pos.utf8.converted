5th Avenue candy bars are truly one of the best out there.  Far superb to the oh-so-sugary, too-sweet Butterfinger, the 5th Avenue takes the combination of peanut butter and chocolate and adds a satisfyingly audible "crunch" to the whole affair - without the interruption that comes from using whole nuts in the bars, as you may notice in Snickers or Baby Ruth's.<br /><br />No, 5th Avenue's distinguish themselves from Butterfingers in the fact that they maintain some semblance of the flavor of peanut butter within their golden centers. Butterfinger seems to content itself with stirring sugar water with a small dollop of peanut butter (and perhaps some food coloring, I'd dare say) before coating the confection with a thin layer of chocolate.<br /><br />5th Avenue, on the other hand, does the lovers of the peanut butter and chocolate combination true justice. Your teeth will glide through the thick, milk chocolate coating before they are but momentarily halted at the crunchy (though not nutty) peanut buttery center; each rapturous bite offers such satisfaction that you will hardly want to have to wait to swallow one before greedily taking another.<br /><br />This review was written by a lover of other chocolate/peanut-buttery delights as: Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (regular or bite-sized), Nutty Butty Bars, Reese's Pieces, chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips, Buckeyes, and peanut butter pie with chocolate shell crust, and S'mores (you must add peanut butter to your grahams for the perfect S'more, y'know).
