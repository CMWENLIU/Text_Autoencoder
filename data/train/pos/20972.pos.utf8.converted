I am on a low sodium diet and have used this product for over fifteen years. I love it. It has a great taste and pours and "salts" just like salt does.  My husband recently decided to go low-sodium due to the FDA's new low sodium guidelines and he switched to No-Salt at the table and he can't tell the difference except that his hands don't swell up the next morning. I love being able to use No-Salt on popcorn and not have to worry about the impact on my heart or circulatory system. It may not taste exactly like salt initially but overall, it is an excellent substitute. It is definitely the best one out there. It is the best bargain AND the best to feel and taste like salt.  Once you have changed over to this product, you won't have a problem staying with it.
