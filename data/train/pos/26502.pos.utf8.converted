A few years ago, I lost 50 pounds and this was a big reason why... a  high fiber breakfast that held me for hours!  I've used it to keep the weight off, and enjoy how quick and easy it is.  Sprinkle it into a bowl, add some water, throw it in the microwave... I enjoy mixing in thick rolled oats, flax meal, bananas, berries, anything for variety when needed... soymilk on top and you're good to go!  Love it!!!
