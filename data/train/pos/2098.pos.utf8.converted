If you're like me, sometimes you might just crave the taste of chocolate, despite the fact that you really know you shouldn't eat any (assuming it's not on your eating plan)!<br /><br />Well, if that's the case, than these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds will alleviate those cravings while providing a healthy snack chock full of protein and healthy fats.<br /><br />I only ate 5 of these almonds and was completely satisfied. The cocoa has a subtle, yet tasty, chocolaty flavor and the almonds tasted fresh.<br /><br />My son, though, really enjoys these nuts and eats 'em by the handful.  This is a good product I'd completely recommend.
