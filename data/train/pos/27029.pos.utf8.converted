Fast shipping, and looked healthy and full when unpacked. I had gotten another bonsai (looked similar, a small juniper) at a garden expo, and it was dead within a month. This new plant is luscious after two months, just followed the simple instructions. I used the tiny ceramic Japanese man from my first plant with this second one, and he obviouly likes sitting under this beautiful one much better!
