I lived off of this in the packet form after I delivered my first child - then I couldn't find it anywhere!  I was thrilled when I searched on Amazon and found it!<br /><br />I bought this but didn't really realize I was buying a whole case! Lucky for me I love the stuff!  I drink the broth plain, use it to flavor rice, noodles, season meat, chicken etc.  It is such a versatile product that I'm glad I have the whole case!
