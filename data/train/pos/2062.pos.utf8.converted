My cat kept getting sick and refusing to eat.  He would go anorexic and become lethargic I had to keep taking him to the vet.  The last time it was so bad that he was put on IV's for dehydration.  He also had a high fever and some other weird stuff going on.  I was really afraid he was not going to live very long (he was only about 4 years old).  After he was back home from the vets and feeling better, it started up again within a week.  He stopped eating and became lethargic.  My husband bought Whiskas Milk because we were trying to get him to at least drink something.  I was going to bottle feed him if I had to, but as soon as he sniffed the Whiskas Milk, he cleaned out the dish and he has not been sick since then and it has been about 2 years.  I give him a small amount several times a week or whenever he asks for it.  There must be some kind of nutrition in it that he needed that he was not getting.  If I forget to give it to him, he'll meow in a different tone so I know he wants it.  It's really a miracle, he went from being a very sick cat to very healthy.  I have not taken him to the vets since I started giving him the milk.  My other two cats who are healthy will not drink it at all, but that's okay, they don't need it.
