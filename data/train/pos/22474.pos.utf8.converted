My wife suffers from high blood pressure and not wanting to get hooked on blood pressure medicine, sought out natural ways to control her blood pressure. A collegue of her's recommended rooibos and thats how we started drinking it. Its expensive to buy by the teabag and this product was the best value for money we could find. Love the taste, no additives and best of all, my wife's blood pressure has come come down noticably(she's been drinking a large cup daily for the last six months).
