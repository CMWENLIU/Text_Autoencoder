My daughter brought Kinder Happy Hippo Cacoa back from her study abroad in Germany.  That is the best candy in the world.  Totally.  I shared a few in the office and everyone was on-line seeing how to order it.  The outside is a crunchy kind of cookie filled with nutella (which is a sweet kind of nut cream)that is a favorite in Europe.  Even has a cute hippo face.
