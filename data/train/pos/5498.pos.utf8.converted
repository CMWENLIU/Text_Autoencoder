I bought one of these 13 years ago, to keep a dog out of my garden.  I'm on a new dog, but the same old fence charger.  I've replace everything but the charger over the years (wear and tear, taking the fence down and putting it back up every year) but have never had a problem with the unit.<br /><br />Some information:<br /><br />You can use any wire you want with the charger unit. I've got mine hooked up with the cheapest galvanized steel wire I could find at the hardware store.<br /><br />You can use any kind of post as long as you insulate the wire from the post. I did it by snipping little rings of plastic tubing and threading the wire through those, which I attached to bamboo stakes with plastic zip ties.  At the end of the season, I just pull up the posts and coil the wire up, posts and all.  Makes setup a snap the next year.<br /><br />This thing works great for deer.  I have one wire, a foot off the ground, and it protects my garden all summer.  I bait the fence each spring by putting peanut butter on aluminum foil and folding it over the wire, so that deer don't just step over it without touching it.  Anyway, I've watched deer grazing at the plants growing under the wire, then zap!  The deer runs off.  Two or three days after I turn it off in the fall, the deer come in and clean up the leftovers.<br /><br />The dog only zapped herself twice, once each spring for the first two years.  Now she acts like the garden doesn't exist.<br /><br />I hang my unit on a post out in the garden, run an extension cord to it, and cover the whole thing with a plastic bucket to keep the rain off.<br /><br />A non-contact circuit tester is a handy way to make sure it's working. (Or you can do it the hard way!)<br /><br />Anyway, I love the product, and it has stood the test of time for me.
