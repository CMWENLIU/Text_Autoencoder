I was concerned about the effect "regular" dog food was having on our dogs. We have one puppy and one senior, so both are in crucial stages. The puppy had bad dandruff and dull, course hair while the senior had various issues throughout his life including seizures and IBD. I decided to try a home cooked diet for them but after the pup developed an allergy I was scared to try anything else on my own. We decided to try Wellness after some research on the natural brands (not to mention a taste test with samples from Pet People).<br /><br />This food has done WONDERS. The pup no longer has dandruff and his coat is shiny and silky. His energy level is also through the roof. Our older dog has always been a veeery picky eater, sometimes going a couple days in between meals if it wasn't appetizing enough for him, but he loves the Wellness food and even eats it dry! No canned mix-ins necessary! Since he started eating it we haven't seen any IBD symptoms and he's acting a lot younger.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this food, or at least another brand of natural food. I encourage you to compare the ingredients in Wellness to regular food as even  "high-end" grocer brands (like Science Diet) contain the same junk as the generic ones!
