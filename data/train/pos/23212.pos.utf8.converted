I have made dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls using Jello Egg Custard Mix for many years and my family really likes them.  Suddenly I could not find the mix here, but found some in other cities.  Then I couldn't find any.  Before Thanksgiving my son didn't like the idea of not having the rolls and went on Amazon and found the 24 box package.  We were thrilled to find this item still available and were able to have our rolls as usual.
