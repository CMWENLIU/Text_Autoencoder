The only drawback might be the phosphate content, but if that doesn't kill me, something else most definitely will.<br /><br />I'm a skinny person, but whatever food providers claim to be a serving never works for me.  The most I'll get out of this can is two servings; a larger person might have to eat the entire can's content, which contains a lot of broth.  I had my serving with mashed potatoes and peas, and it was good after I doctored the meat with curry, onion, Tobasco sauce, sesame oil, and garlic.  Although olive oil makes a lot of things taste delicious, my body behaves better when I feed it sesame seed oil.  Next time, I'll try the beef in spaghetti sauce or tomato sauce with vegetable puree.  However, I'm okay eating insipid stuff, so I could have easily eaten the meat as a sandwich with just lettuce and tomatoes.  For people who can't eat anything without flavor, you will need to add whatever you prefer; think of it as plain beef because that's pretty much what it is, with plenty of beef broth that you can use as a stock for stew, gravy, or any other concoction.  I used a portion of the broth over my potatoes; it made them smoother.<br /><br />The meat comes in stew-size cubes that were apparently pressure cooked to tenderness, since they flake apart with a fork - I like tender meat.  The meat has almost zero fat; much of which was solid and stuck to the lid, so I guess my apartment is comfortably cold.  The pack comes with three Mexican-style recipes, but you can definitely do your own style of cooking; a beef stroganoff would be nice.<br /><br />When I used to drive along the east coast and stay at the Days Inn, I always carried my own canned goods with me that I warmed up at the motel because a can of Health Valley soup, Del Monte vegetables, Progresso tuna fish, or Crown Prince salmon is always healthier than eating at one of those fast food chains.  I suspect that eating this Kirkland roast beef is also healthier, despite the sodium phosphate.  As the daughter of a cook, I can prepare fine fresh food, but I choose not to because I don't like kitchen duty.  So, whenever I don't order take out, canned or frozen items and baked potato work fine for me.  Conclusion: I recommend this product and will buy it again.
