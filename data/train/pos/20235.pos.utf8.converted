I am a maniacal nut eater! I live on nuts,,,my current favorites are pistachio and macadamia.....have had problems lately finding pistachio that aren't rancid or hard so I was surprised to find these on Amazon for such a good price, I had them overnighted, in desperation and so far, I am working on the first of the three jars, these are GREAT nuts!  Great!  You can tell they are fresh, I am not running into any bad ones,  Great taste,  I am so impressed!  I will be ordering them on a regular basis if Amazon keeps carrying them which I certainly hope they do.  Thanks!
