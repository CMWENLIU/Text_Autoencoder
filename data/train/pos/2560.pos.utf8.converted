The most intense chocolate I ever had. I only ate 2 squares and the chocolate buzz hit me immediately and lasted about 30 minutes. This stuff is not for amateurs, this is the real deal. The flavor is so complex I was tasting different chocolate layers in each bite. The downside is it has a lot of fat. This stuff is for serious chocoholics.
