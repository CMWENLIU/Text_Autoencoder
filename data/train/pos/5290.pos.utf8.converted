all of the herbs germinated and grew just fine.I have been cutting and cutting for weeks now and none of them are faltering and I expect to continue having them all summer.It is very convenient to have fresh basil,cilantro,mint,parsely but unfortunately no chives since my cat has taken ownership of them and they are never higher than and inch.but i am sure they would have been good on my baked potato.<br />bad cat!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI61OQ">AeroGarden Gourmet Herb Seed Kit</a>
