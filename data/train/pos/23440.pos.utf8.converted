I'm a real popcorn nut.  I've been trying for years to get that real "movie theatre" taste.  Well, I've done it, and one better.  The theatres use coconut oil blended with butter "flavoring".  The problem is it's partially hydrogenated, which as most of you know is not healthy.  This Nutiva Coconut Oil is pure, and extra virgin.  Used by itself in popcorn, the taste is a bit too coconutty for me.  The secret?  Add about 1/4 real butter to the coconut oil in your popper.  Yes, real butter is healthy for you, unlike margarines or so called buttery toppings.  So the perfect blend of Nutiva Coconut oil and butter produces the most excellent popcorn you could ever imagine.  You feel good after eating it.  Also a couple of other tips, all popcorn kernals are not created equal.  Use Orville's for a much more tender pop.  And get popcorn salt, not regular salt, and not Flavacol.  Popcorn salt is super flaky and sticks like magic to the popcorn.  Simply add it in the popper while it's popping.  Adjust accordingly for your taste.  Enjoy!
