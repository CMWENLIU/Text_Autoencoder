The best sampling of pods I've run across.  Price works out to be about 58.3 cents per pod.  What's really nice is that I didn't know that you could get single-origin pods, and at least two of the brands in this sampler offer them, so it's great to taste the differences in the single-origin coffees as well as the differences in roasts between manufacturers.  Find what you like, and then you can get larger quantities of the pods you really like.  No joke about taking notes, either.  It helps to keep track of which ones you like and dislike...  There is definitely variation in the flow through the different pod brands too- so find what works well with your machine too.
