I can handle very hot stuff but WOW! this stuff is strong, the guy above me who said use the  eye dropper was smart i shouldve listened to him, this stuff isnt a joke, its not something to let anyone eat straight from the bottle its just too hot. it should be used as a food additive only. the reason i say that you need an eye dropper is because it is incredibly runny and you dont want to put in more than you can handle, it has an incredible flavor, i used 1 small drop of the 357 mad dog pepper extract and a pinch of crushed naga jolokia into a 5 pound pot of chili and had to drain some of the heat out of it (which is incredibly difficult) and it still stayed pretty hot. its very good and very hot use with caution
