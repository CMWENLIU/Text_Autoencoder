Delicious and invigorating. For those who want something more than a regular cup of coffee. Yes, this is made with a bit of splenda. I, personally, prefer this and, as far as the sweetness goes, it is made with very little splenda - it is not overly sweet (for those of us that don't like sweet things), but sugar/sweetener can be added for those who do like it. Chai tea is a delicious drink and the tassimo chai latte is definitely the best chai you could make at home in 30 seconds. Far better tasting and far better for you than the boxed or powder versions!
