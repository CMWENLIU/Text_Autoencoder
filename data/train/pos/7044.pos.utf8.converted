I bought a used Keurig K-70 single cup coffee maker from an Amazon seller and was pleased at the taste and quality of the brews but found the darker Keurig brews a bit strong and bitter. Also, the K-cup brews cost me about 60 cents per cup, a better price per cup than Starbucks, but not as well flavored.  I started washing out and re-using the K-cups with the little aftermarket clear plastic covers and they work great, allowing me to re-fill with other coffees.<br /><br />I worked my way through many coffee brands at around $6 to $10 per K-cup pack or 10-oz can, but none were exceptional. (stay away from the WalMart house brands or you'll be sorry.) I had bought a 10-oz can of Cafe Bustelo at the local Dollar Store for about $3.60 because it was so cheap, but put off getting into it until the others were used up. Frankly, I waited because I was expecting something really bad, considering the low price. ... WOW, was I wrong! ... It was by far the best of the lot and I'm hooked. ... Nearing the bottom of the first can I started looking for a replacement,  assuming finding another can would be simple but couldn't find one anywhere in town, including WalMart, so I'm ordering a slightly higher priced (plus shipping) four-pack of 10-oz cans from Amazon. ... Not because it's so cheap but because of the nutty, roasted, non-acid full-flavor. ... I refill a K-cup with Bustelo but don't pack it tightly before putting the little after market lid on. It probably costs me about 6-cents per cup now for excellent custom brew coffee.<br /><br />cheers!
