I was looking for a malted milk powder like the Horlick's that I remembered as a child.  The NOW brand tastes EXACTLY the same as I remember the Horlick's Malted Milk Tablets tasting.  This malted milk dissolves easily in a little cold milk with a bit of whisking.  I have enjoyed it in milk, malts and I'll admit, eating it dry right from the spoon, it tastes just the same as those yummy tablets!  I chose this malted milk on Amazon because it is considerably less expensive than Horlick's and I won't look any further!
