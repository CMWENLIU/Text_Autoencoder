I decided to try this product because my husband, never a picky taster,  stated he hated, hated, hated our usual decaf coffee.<br />Since I started preparing Jeremiah's Pick, he doesn't even realize he's drinking decaf. It actually tastes better than our usual caffeinated coffee. Ground for 15 seconds, it works very well in our stainless french press coffeepot.
