I bought these glass bottles because of the BPA concern and the gas prevention system. I think they are great, I didn't have to look for any other. The glass is really sturdy and can take many falls on the ground, no breaking yet. I don't think you need to hassle with bottle sleeves either. Be sure to get extra nipples, especially for level 1, since in time the hole may open wider to release too much milk.
