These noodles are fantastic!  I've ordered the 24 pack 3 times bc i go through them so fast!  the best way to cook these noodles is very simple.<br />take a frying pan with terriaki or some kind of other than tomato or alfredo.  While you rinse the noodles in a strainer, let the frying pan start to simmer.  Set the noodles out for a while to dry a bit.  Add the noodles to the pan and let them fry for a few minutes while they absorb the flavor.  if there is still sauce in the pan- drain it!  and let these noodles 'dry' fry for a bit.  This while thicken the texture of the noodles and also allow the soaked flavor to be sealed in.  I usually stirfry Shrimp or chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, peppers and onions, and cabbage into EVOO with garlic and a little salt- then add the FULLY sauteed mixture into the now 'dry' frying noodles...and let it sit.  the taste is out of this world- it's so good that my friends thought i'd made rice noodles!<br /><br />To add tomoto sauce or alfredo you must first put a frying pan of extra virgin olive oil on the stove and let simmer while you rinse your noodles.  let them dry just like before- then add the noodles to the EVOO on the stove.  The EVOO makes the noodles thicker- they soak up the oil and become thick like angel hair.  rinse any excess oil and let the noodles 'dry' fry for a few minutes.  Once you done this- you will see and feel the texture change- now go ahead and add sauce to this mix- it sticks perfectly to the noodles and tastes just like the original recipe.  You just have to know how to get those lil noodles texturized and they will do what you want! :)<br />These recipes are fool proof- i've done them many many times and taught my roomate- who doesn't know to cook, how to properly cook these!  they are always a big hit!!!  If you want more recipes that i've come up with for these noodles- let me know, i'd be happy to send them to you!
