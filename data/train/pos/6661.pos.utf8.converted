No doubt in my mind that Fresh Step is the BEST litter on the market. Buying online though is tricky.<br />I bought 10 boxes when they were $10 on Amazon. A fantastic buy. However, all but 2 of the boxes were received split open. I bet you can imagine the mess. I don't know if the cost savings is worth the clean up hassle. I had litter all over my porch and entryway. They were still in a shipping box but there was hardly anything in the box to keep the litter from slamming around during transport. And being so heavy,I am sure the carrier didn't treat them like a caton of eggs. I bought so many because I like to stock up when things are a good price. Maybe that was my first mistake. I have 4 indoor cats and do go through a lot of litter though.
