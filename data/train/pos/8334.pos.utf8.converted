I first bought these jelly beans in a local store, my boys 9 (8 and 14) had so much fun with it I had to find it again and buy it, this time for my 18 year old niece who chain reads the Harry Potter books (and loves jelly beans). Some of the beans are delicious (lemon drop, cherry, cinnamon, blueberry, toasted marshmallow etc  but I didn't dare to try the unconventional ones...the kids do tell me though they taste exactly as described (sardine, rotten egg, pickle ,sausage, ear wax, earthworm ...)<br /><br />Fun twist on an all time favorite.
