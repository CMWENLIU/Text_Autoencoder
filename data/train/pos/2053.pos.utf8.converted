I first tasted this coffee at a conference center. Went back to the kitchen to find the brand name. I ordered the ground coffee first, but it didn't taste the same. Changed coffee makers, started using unbleached filters and filtered water, but it still didn't taste right. Finally ordered the whole beans and everything came together. What an amazingly rich flavor!!!
