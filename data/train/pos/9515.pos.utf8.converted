(I thought I had reviewed this product already, but perhaps it was under a different size? Oh, well)<br /><br />With apologies for possible redundancy, I will simply say that this stuff is fantastic.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about the "clean" taste, and I can say that after tasting this product, I wholeheartedly agree. It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil. If you wear it on your skin, you will not smell like the stuff that comes in a brown bottle. It actually fades relatively quickly, but no one will accuse you of rolling around in coconuts.<br /><br />Same goes for putting in food. I think it adds a nice depth and nuttiness, and is yummy in popcorn, as some have stated. But it is absolute HEAVEN in your fried brekkie potatoes.<br /><br />Think it is also worth mentioning that to the lower ratings reviewers, I think that ordering this product in the cooler months has merit. If it becomes liquid at 75-ish degrees, I can see that it would be easy for this stuff to leak, despite what appears to be the best efforts on the part of the manufacturer when it comes to the packaging.<br /><br />Finally, I think that the 15 oz size is fine if you are going to be using this product for topical use only, but if you plan on cooking with it as well, I would recommend getting a larger size-<br /><br />Can't wait to use this during the summer, and show off my glowing skin!<br /><br />Hope this helps!
