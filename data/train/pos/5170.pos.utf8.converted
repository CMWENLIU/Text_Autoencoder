I make a mexican style cornbread that is amazing with this mix.  Instead of water, I add 1 jar of pimentos, and 1/2 cup jalepenos with the juice, and add 1 cup of frozen (do not thaw) corn.  I also add 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Then it has to bake for 45 minutes.  It comes out very moist, and very addicting!
