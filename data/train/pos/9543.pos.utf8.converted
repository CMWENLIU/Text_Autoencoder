I recently became interested in becoming a practitioner in the art of bonsai, so I went out and bought a book about indoor bonsai for beginners. After reading the book throughly, I decided to go with the Chinese Elm, since it looks great and can stand the hard tap water in the area where I live. The tree also is capable of withstanding most pests, with the exception of spider mites, but I got a humidifying tray to aide with that. I literally just received this tree and it is just great! It took approximately four days to arrive and only lost about fifteen leaves, which in my book, is just fine for four days without sun, only about of three leaves were yellowed. The coloring and branch placement are exceptional and it looks like this is the start of a great relationship. :)
