I've started cooking with coconut oil and have been researching it. It is a SAFE product, makes foods crispier, and ordering it from [...] is the most economical price ANYWHERE.  I order the organic because my daughter does not like the flavor of coconut and organic has no flavor or very, very slight; I also order virgin coconut oil because I like the flavor of coconut.  Research this yourself and you will find Spectrum Naturals is a good product and [...] offers the best price. It has NO TRANS FAT!!!
