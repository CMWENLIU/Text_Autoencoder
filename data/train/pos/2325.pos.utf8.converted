Edward & Sons Low Sodium Veggie Bouillon is one of the best that I have tried.  There are actual tiny bits of veggies in the cubes--obviously not enough to prevent you from adding your own.  When I cook rice, I love to toss either one or two of these cubes into the rice cooker.<br /><br />One correction to the Nutritional Information posted on the product page:  The actual sodium content is 135 mg and not 920 as indicated on the product page.  This is a huge difference.<br /><br />05/31/2011 Update:<br /><br />I am saddened to say that I will not be purchasing these bouillon cubes from Amazon.  I don't know if it was a fluke but the last box that I purchased came complete with bugs.  Unfortunately, I discovered this after it was too late to return the package.  It may be because a "case" of these will last me for nearly a year.<br /><br />That said, if I can find them at a local grocery store, I will buy individual packages.
