As founder of PurrEver Ranch Sanctuary (A Hospice For Senior Kittizens & Wayward Pussycats) we put this on our Amazon Wishlist.  It was like Thanksgiving for these misfit cats.  It made them SO happy.  All immediately took a nap afterwards and purred.  VERY very  HEALTHY.  Plus it took about half of regular canned cat food to make them full.  A little goes a long way.  Looks like human food.  Makes me very happy to know these unwanted & unadoptable cats got have a FEAST.  We could not be happier. Thank you so very much!!!<br />Rita Wood, Founder<br />PurrEver Ranch Sanctuary<br />(...)
