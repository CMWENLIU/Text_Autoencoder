This is a great set with all of the ingredients needed to make sushi, besides the fresh items. The items in the kit are good for multiple sushi making sessions. The only improvement would be to include more Nori, as there was only enough to make sushi for four one time. The kit comes with a recipe book which has clear directions and many sushi ideas. I would definately buy this kit again.
