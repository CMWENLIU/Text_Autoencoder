The Haribo Sugarless Gummi Bears I bought (the 5 lb. bag, of course)tasted EXACTLY like the fattening sugar gummi bears they make. I didn't bother looking up Lycasin to see if there were any side effects with this stuff - I would never have thought to do that - there was no warning on the bag stating that within two hours of eating a handful you will be literally RUNNING to the bathroom to expel all of those wonderful things you ate such a short time before. I have been chronically constipated all my life, but BOY this sure cured that problem! There is NO WAY you could go anywhere or do anything with this going on - it is that bad!!!!!  I don't know what to do - I bought two 5 lb. bags for $38 and will know they are sitting in my cupboard waiting for me to "sneak a few" even knowing what they will do to me. The reviews I have just read are SO FREAKING RIGHT - it has been three hours and my stomach still is rolling like I'm on a SHIP FROM HELL!  Seriously, if I were SMART, I would have eaten only a few, not two handfuls the first time to see how I would feel. Who thinks about these things when they need their Gummis??  If I can get the kind of reaction I got with my constipation problem, you can imagine what these will do to ORDINARY people. Handle with EXTREME CARE!!!!
