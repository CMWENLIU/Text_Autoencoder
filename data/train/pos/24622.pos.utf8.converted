If you are seeking a stupendous alternative to the same ol' herbal teas, look no further.  My wife and I were graciously given samples of this (and many other) teas when we stumbled on the Stash Tea Company's headquarters in Portland, Oregon.  True to its name this tea has a light honey-sweet floral flavor that nicely tolerates a little added cream, though it is fine without as well.  While my wife and I have slightly different tastes in teas, we both agreed we should stock this as a regular tea.<br /><br />Similar to red tea, honeybush contains antioxidants like polyphenols, flavones and isoflavones, so it is not merely tasty but good for you as well.  This tea is caffeine free.  There are few tannins, so it will tolerate longer brewing times.  Try a cup at your local coffee shop if you're not certain you'll like it, but buy it here in bulk to save $.<br /><br />Many thanks to the kind folks at Stash for the free samples!
