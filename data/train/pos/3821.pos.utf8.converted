I first picked this tea up in Paris at the Bon Marche department store food halls (Le Grand Epicerie de Paris).  On returning to the states and trying the tea I was most impressed.  Redolent of bergamot and flowers it has an intense aroma and flavor that is well-enhanced with the addition of honey and a little milk. It is now my favorite tea.  Enjoy!
