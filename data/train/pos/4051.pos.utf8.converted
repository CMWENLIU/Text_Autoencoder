Once, years ago whilst working in a faraway land I sat down to eat with a co-worker who had upon his plate a heaping helping of fish bodies swimming in a tomato sauce.  "What, pray tell, are those" I queried?  "Sardines," he said, to which I replied "No."  We settled the dispute by fishing out the can from the garbage and ascertaining that it did indeed state 'Sardines' on the label.  I was flabbergasted, having had no idea that a sardine can be as large as a plate as th0se were, or as small as a pinkie finger as many of these King Oscar Tiny Tots are....but let's face it:  Nobody wants to eat a humongous sardine.  In fact, doing so is antithetical to the meaning of the small fish, it's oxymoronic, and downright distasteful to do so, possibly even disrespectful.<br /><br />In the years since then whenever I got the craving for sardines I would buy a can of them, usually in mustard sauce, then catch myself thinking that I remembered sardines being tiny fish packed, well, like sardines in a can, and the ones I was buying seemed relatively large....generally as large as the can was wide and meaty such that they would quite overwhelm the saltine cracker I placed them on, and they tasted like fish.  I'm not complaining, I'm from a state that was famous for its sardines and the ones I was eating were often caught and processed there....I just thought that Sardines were, by their nature, tiny.<br /><br />It turns out that the name Sardine is a term similar to Beer.  In other words, lots of different kinds of fish get to be called Sardines but to me and likely to most people, classic sardines are meant to be small and Brisling: The kind of fish that can be stacked two high in a can as small as a sardine can. There is another fish called the Sild harvested in Scotland that is just as or nearly as small which I suppose makes it too a classic sardine, but most of the others that we eat over here in the US are slightly larger with more dark flesh and a fishier taste.  Them are good, but these are better!!!<br /><br />In fact, these are great.  They are great because they are tiny (most are 3" in length), of delicate white meat (with a section of dark) and a wonderfully neutral sardine flavor that pairs well with a dash of Tabasco and a Saltine.<br /><br />Even better than their flavor is the visual impact of their sleek, fat, glistening, silver-sided bodies packed end to end in their palm-sized, aluminum, pull-top can which neatly evokes the turn-key steel sardine cans of my childhood.  It's a picture almost too pure to sully with a fork or knife, luckily that ephemeral beauty remains up until the last body is pulled from the can and laid out upon its cracker and finally consumed with respectful appreciation.  Heaven.
