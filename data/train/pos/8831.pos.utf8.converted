Shirataki Noodles are made from Konjac yams.  The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  Also, it has less than 1g of carbs per serving which is 3oz.  I have eaten Shirataki noodles many times before with the tofu added.  Today I got the JFC brand at The Hong Kong market here in Texas.  I made a quick soup with a vegan bouillon cube.  I rinsed the noodles then added it to the soup.  I had it on the stove for approx 1 minute.  The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago.  I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I eat these noodles.  The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce.  That didn't work for me, the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta.  Furthermore, to get an idea, the noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. The longest it should be put into boiling water is approx a minute or two so it can warm up.  I was afraid that these noodles will fall apart.  The tofu shirataki is definitely a harder texture which I like but I quickly found out the JFC white Shirataki noodles were nothing to be afraid of.  The product has no taste, so seasoning it will be helpful.  This product is perfect for me and I will continue using it.<br /><br />Update:<br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  As I mentioned above the first time I had the shirataki noodles was the tofu kind.  I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.
