Not only was this brand of Goji berries the most economical I found on Amazon, but their taste meets or exceeds the other two brands I have tried.<br /><br />I throw a handful of these into my cereal, mix them in with salad, or eat them out of the bag. Also good cooked in with pasta or meat. They are not very sweet, but have a unique flavor and a consistency that makes you want to chew.
