So last week my lovely and pregnant wife was eating a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal and made some comment in passing about how she wished she could have a bowl of just the marshmallows. I quickly did a search and somebody suggested I check Amazon.com for "Dehydrated Marshmallows". A few minutes later I found and ordered these. Three days later a box arrived via USPS. I told my wife it was a gift for her. She absolutely LOVES them. I have scored "a months worth of brownie points". They are exactly what she was hoping for. I will be reordering as soon as she uses up this supply. Very highly recommended.
