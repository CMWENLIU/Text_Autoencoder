I live on a salt water tidal pond on one side and deep woods on the other which breeds mosquitos like a bad dream.  I tried the mosquito magnet for a year and caught a bunch but still could not be out in the yard during the day without being attacked.  When I apply the Cutter Backyard concentrate I am able to work and play out in the yard all day without any mosquitos.  After dark the mosquitos are still pesky but my bug free time is good up until the sun goes down.  I can only treat the perimeter of my home and not all the other places they breed so I am satisfied with this product.  Also I did try malathion which works but is washed away after the first rain so I only would get a few days of protection.  Cutter Backyard lasts 4-6 weeks as long as there is not lots of heavy rain and even with that you still get 3 weeks out of it.  Been using it for 2 summers now so I know it is not a fluke.
