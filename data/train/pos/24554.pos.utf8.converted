The breeder that I bought my English bulldog puppy was top notch. They had a LOT of money invested in their breeding operation and it was easily noticeable. I saw this brand food (chicken and rice formula) stacked up high and asked why this brand and where could I get it? She said that her and her husband researched dog food for six months and this is what they decided on. Said they got it from Amazon but maybe there are other locations locally wherever you are. My dog loves it and she is very healthy with a beautiful coat.
