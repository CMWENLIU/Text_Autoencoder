This is very good sushi ginger. It's not restaurant quality - it's not tinted pink and the slices aren't transparently thin. But the taste is excellent and I like the fact it doesn't have additives. I like potent ginger; this might be too strong for you if you prefer mild. (In which case you might like the Eden ginger instead. I found that to be too bland.)<br /><br />The ingredients are: ginger, rice vinegar, sugar, salt, water, and potassium sorbate. The label says there are zero carbs in a one-tablespoon serving - obviously there have to be carbs in it, but it must fall below what has to be listed.
