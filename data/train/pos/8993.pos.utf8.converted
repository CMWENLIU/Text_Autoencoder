This has been one of my favorite quick miso soups-- in fact, I like the taste far better than even the miso soup I prepare with fresh miso paste. I enjoy it in the evenings, as it has little calories and gives me something warm to sip on rather than some other junk I'd regret later. It's easy to prepare-- just add 1 cup of boiling water per packet.<br /><br />Let's see... what other information can I give than what is provided here?  I have a packet with me right now, so I will tell you the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories: 40 kcal, Total Fat: 1.5 g, Cholesterol: 0, Sodium: 860 mg (yikes!), Total Carbohydrate: 3 g, Sugars: 0, Protein: 3 g.  Contains soy, wheat and fish ingredients.<br /><br />Even though I love this soup, this is the last packet I'll buy because I just noticed that it is NOT vegetarian.  It says it has fish ingredients in it.  I couldn't figure out from the nutrition label where the fish was coming from, but I found out that bonito powder was a fish extract.  I just wanted to warn other vegetarians-- as I didn't notice this earlier.  You can also try the San-J Wakame broth packets-- those are almost as delicious and they're vegan (though the sodium's a bit higher).  I hope the company will come out with a vegetarian version of this miso soup though.
