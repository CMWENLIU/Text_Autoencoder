For all those concerned about the BPA . . . I contacted them directly and was told that as of October 2011 there is no longer BPA in any amount in the lids. I recommended to them that they promote that on their website to make it clear. Otherwise, we love this company and their products, and my babies both love them. So I can only go with the highest rating of 5 stars.
