I spent some time in Italy this past Summer (Tuscany) where I rented a villa and had the occasion to cook several times.  Not only was the product convenient and reduce waste with it's recloseable tube,  the product itself was incredible.  It was not acidic and really added incredible tomato flavor and richness to the dishes I prepared. I actually brought several tubes home with me.  You can find other brands in US specialty food shops packaged this same way but I have yet to find one that is comparable in taste.
