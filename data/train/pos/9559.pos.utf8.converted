These are great-tasting snack bars, and are even better when you warm them up (remove from wrapper, microwave for 10-15 seconds), which makes them much softer and smoother, like a treat that just came out of the oven. They have lots of fiber and protein and nutrients, and plant sterols that lower cholesterol.
