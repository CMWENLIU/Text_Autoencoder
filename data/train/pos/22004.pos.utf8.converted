I like the idea of these squeeze bottles and I will investigate how cost effective it is to use them instead of the cans which work well for me.<br /><br />I have been using sweetened condensed milk in my coffee, off and on since learning to use it as a child at my grandparent's adjacent farm over on the other side of the squash field.  My Father preferred HEAVY cream (we had our own cows) sweetened with THREE teaspoons of sugar but even as a child, I did not care for that over the top combo normally favored by those engaged in heavy labor (a good description of my father with his day job and plowing at night by tractor headlights) as a quick caloric boost.  In these sedentary days, your doctor would put you on the don't call back list for such a dietary sin.  I actually prefer BLACK coffee when making a brew with my favored fresh ground (Vietnamese, espresso) but I was given a Keurig as a present and all the K-cups available taste better to me with some milk in them and those machines are too easy to use for that first quick jolt in the AM. The canned milk is very rich and it will last forever in the refrigerator, unlike any fresh milk/cream.  I find that La Lechera seems to be less sweet than the old standby, Eagle Brand and that pleases me.  This brand works perfectly for Vietnamese iced coffee which if you have never had, I suggest you try soon-- I enjoy it on an occasional basis in the summer and everyone I have introduced to it likes it a great deal.<br /><br />Anyway, I had the same problems with storing open containers until I realized that pet food can lids would work well.  They are (presumably) food grade plastic, inexpensive at the pet super stores and fit the condensed milk cans perfectly (same size as a standard tuna/cat food can)-- some are even cleverly molded to fit several different sizes of can to also fit the larger cans.  With normal handling, the milk NEVER touches the lid so even mystery plastic should not be a great consideration but I would look for a brand that is not made in China from industrial waste if that is possible anymore-- I have 4-5 that I have been using as pet food lids for years, acquired pre-Chinese economic invasion.  These lids work better and easier than the side cutting can openers which provide the cutoff part of the can as a lid!
