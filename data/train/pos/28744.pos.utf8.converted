I had the fortune of marrying a guy that loves fruitcake. After so many years of fruitcake jokes in my family, it was an adjustment to think someone actually wants one of these things. The Claxton fruitcake has been available in stores in years past and I would buy the smaller size for my husband. Then one year I tasted it. After just that one bite, I was hooked. I now look for the Claxton fruitcake and I'm so glad it's available at Amazon. No other fruitcake compares to the taste of Claxton's. It is the combination of the ingredients that makes this so special. It's worth every penny and we know every last crumb will be eaten.
