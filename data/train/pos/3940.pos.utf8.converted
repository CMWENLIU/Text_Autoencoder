My discovery of coconut water was brought on by a search for a natural alternative to Pedialite (There aren't many pronouncable ingredients in Pedialite and none I'd put in my baby's little body.) Coconut water is the best alternative, good for you, and the taste is simply refreshing. Not too sweet, but not boring either! A great solution to dehydration! This size is great to keep in the fridge. . . certainly more friendly to the environment! A great price on Amazon . . .
