Warm, rich, deeply satisfying -- that is what Mount Hagen Organic Freeze-Dried Instant Decaffeinated Coffee tastes like!  A strong brew, but not overly so, with just a hint of sweetness!  Totally superb -- this is COFFEE!  Additional benefits, of course, are<br />that it is instant coffee, decaffeinated, and organic.  But....mmmm!  That taste!  Totally terriffic!  (I bought only one jar somewhere else -- it went SO fast!  The "six-pack" here on Amazon is a great idea!)<br /><br />P.S.:  For the BEST taste in ANY instant coffee, let the water boil as LONG as possible.  For the best taste in any TEA, let the water boil for as SHORT a time as possible.  (In her books on the British Royal Family, Marion Crawford reports how Queen Mary would stand at the tea kettle, and take it off as SOON as it started to boil.  For tea.  But for a truly "royal treat" in Instant Coffee, my suggestion is to this scrumptious Mount Hagen Decaffeinated Freeze-Dried instant.  I son't think a better decaffeinated instant can be found anywhere!
