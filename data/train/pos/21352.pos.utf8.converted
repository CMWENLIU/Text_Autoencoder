I love this product! I am able to use it in many dishes because it is unflavored. This is particularly important in my life right now as my daughter goes through cancer treatment. I have added this to smoothies, banana pudding and even pumpkin pie for her. She needs the protein and she wants comfort foods. I have also added it to my coffee and it provides and extra creaminess as it is milk based. Oh yes, I also added it to gluten free chocolate chip walnut cookies. They too were a success!This is one product I will not be without.
