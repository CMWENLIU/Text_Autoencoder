Our Senseo coffee machine was given to us as a house warming gift, and we have loved from the first time we used it!  The dark roast coffee pods seem to taste so much better than any other brand or flavor I have ever made from home.  The dark roast blend is simply the best. It is smooth, rich, and brews so quickly in our new machine, it's fantastic.  I suggest using stevia powder as a natural (and chemical free!) sweetener with this blend, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">30 Grams (1.06 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  I don't even use cream anymore, no kidding!
