As one of the previous reviewers said, this is the first "K-cup" that doesn't taste at least somewhat watery.  I've tried LOTS of the Green Mountain sanctioned "extra bold" varieties (Jet Fuel, Dark Magic, Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, etc.), but the new "RealCup" Martinson Dark Roast is in a class by itself.  Not necessarily a better "flavor" than the others mind you, but definitely more full-bodied and robust....not to mention significantly less expensive!<br /><br />BTW, absolutely no "sludge" or "dust" to be found at the bottom (or anywhere else) in my mug.  Only a good, satisfying cup of Joe! Highly recommended!<br /><br />Next, I plan to try a few of the Brown Gold RealCup varieties.  Look for even more choices to hit the market as some of the Green Mountain K-cup patents expire.
