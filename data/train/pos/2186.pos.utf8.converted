I make some pretty killer brownies, that always draw requests for the recipe whenever I make them.  A little while back I tried making them with Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and it really pushed my brownies to a decadent level.  Ever since I finished my last container, I've been scouring the local groceries in search of some more, and had just about giving up on ever finding it again. What a surprise to find it on Amazon--I'm thrilled!
