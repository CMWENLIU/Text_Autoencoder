Years ago, I spent over 15 months in Turkey.  Enjoyed apple tea very much.  Spent time with Turkish nationals this past trip through Iraq.  Having knowledge of the country and customs, I was reintroduced to apple tea after an 18 year hiatus.  They were good enough to give me several bags over the year.  Turkish apple teas are made by many different companies in Turkey, all with different tastes.<br />This tea is the closest that I have found, short of going back to Turkey.  It has a really great taste.  I prefer to mix mine a little thicker than recommended.  It gives it that bite, that you enjoy so much.
