I'm allergic to dairy and egg. I've been using tofu for many years in no-egg egg salad (use regular egg salad recipe, just use mashed tofu instead of chopped egg) and dips and puddings. For no-egg egg salad, you can just use a fork to mash it up. Let it chill an hour or two for best flavor.<br /><br />For dips - just use any dip recipe or mix. A box of Mori-Nu will work fine for a mix envelope, just blend until creamy (and the silken-style extra firm type does cream up well this way, if you want something all-purpose) and add some oil and lemon or lime juice to substitute for sour cream. If you want, you can follow instructions and actually slowly pour the oil in while blending, but just dumping it in works also. You can try without oil if you want, but I like the oil. Let it chill for at least an hour or so. If you think the flavor is too intense, you can just use part of another package to get the volume you want, but nobody's ever complained about the 12 oz box method.<br /><br />The consistency of tofu is great for really instant pudding from any junky pudding mix you like (who says tofu has to be healthy?!?) or your own recipe for whatever you usually add to milk to make pudding. I look for mixes that don't have dairy myself. If desperate, I'll look for recipes... But all you really need to do is blend the tofu with the mix and voil&agrave; -  it's pudding. Chill for a while, but it tastes pretty good even just out of the blender. Don't know how well it freezes for "pudding pops", haven't tried, but I've seen a recipe for tofu fudgsicles based on a tofu chocolate mousse recipe (using firm or extra firm silken tofu, as is available here), so it probably works fine. You might need to add some sweetener to taste if you don't think it's decadent enough. This is much easier than trying to make soy milk work...<br /><br />Thin strips of tofu cooked in a pan  with soy sauce (or baked with any sauce) are pretty good also if you're into cooking. Tofu soaks up whatever flavors you toss at it, given sufficient time and encouragement. The instructions I have for baking are to bake for 30 min until "firm but not tough", turning half way through, but I've only personally tried the pan method. I've seen recipes for "veggie bacon" using tofu and nutritional yeast (such as Red Star), liquid smoke, and oil.<br /><br />You also can use tofu as the base for quick ice cream, just mix the box with frozen fruit, sweetener to taste, and blend. It can be used for regular smoothies also, of course. Look for recipes at vegan hangouts for both fancier ice cream recipes (often combining with soy milk, although I wonder if coconut milk would work well) and smoothie recipes.<br /><br />There are also recipes for pumpkin pie using blended tofu instead of dairy. You might need to add some oil to fatten up the tofu a bit.<br /><br />The Mori-Nu boxes are really handy since they don't take up refrigerator space and can be always available. The case price is much, much cheaper than at my local grocery store for individual boxes. I just wish Amazon would give an expiration date for current stock (or at least a no-earlier-than expiration date), as some other sources are now doing.
