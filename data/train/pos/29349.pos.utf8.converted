This is the coffee that is served in all the "coffee shops" in Italy. It is delicious.  We love it so much we purchased 30 cans before we moved back to the United States. It tastes rich and full, especially when you make it with a stove top espresso pot.  If you love real coffee that tastes like coffee than this is the brew for you.
