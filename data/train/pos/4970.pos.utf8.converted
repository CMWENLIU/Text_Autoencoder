Frankly I never thought I'd buy a vegetarian dog food, even though I personally have given up meat and chicken and rarely eat any type of seafood anymore. However my Yorkshire terrier and rescued Dwarf Australian Cattle Dog needed to lose a bit of weight (don't we all) and I decided this would be an easy and compassionate way to cut back on calories and decrease the violence in our personal food consumption at our house. The dogs love it! I'm buying the big bag this time.
