Never a fan of Truffles, since it was like playing Russian Roulette-never knowing what exactly was inside, I was absolutely amazed at these delicious confections. It's like Heroin to a Choc-a-holic, only better and legal. They're great with your morning coffee/espresso, an afternoon Tequila or an evening glass of Red Wine.
