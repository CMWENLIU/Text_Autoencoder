I read on a breastfeeding website that you should take a bit more of this supplement than is listed on the bottle's directions. On day 1, I took 3 pills, 3 times per day, and the following day I pumped 6 more ounces of milk! I took the same amount of pills the 2nd day, and only 3 pills on the 3rd day. On days 2 and 3, I didn't pump because I was at home, but I was able to feed my baby without supplementing with formula. It was a 5-day holiday weekend, and at no time did I need to supplement, nor did I take any additional pills after those first 3 days. After the 5-day holiday, I pumped 16 ounces each day for 2 days in a row, and also breastfed my baby in the evenings when I got home from work with no problem. (That brings me to today, and I am still going strong.) Before that, I was lucky if I pumped 9-12 ounces! The side effects for me included that maple-syrup smell in urine/sweat, and it also upset my stomach, but it was only for a few days, so I thought it was worth it. The best thing is that, once your supply is increased, you can stop taking the pills.
