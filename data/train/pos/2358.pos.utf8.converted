I received my Dawn Redwood today. It looks wonderful. I was initially nervous about purchasing more plants online because I have had bad experiences from nurseries. But I read the reviews on this particular tree and they convinced me to try again. The tree arrived in great shape. It actually only spent about 3 days in the box. It was well packed it looks very healthy and the soil was still damp on arrival.<br />Thanks you for the care that was taken in selecting, packing and shipping my tree. I would have no hesitation in recommending you to others.
