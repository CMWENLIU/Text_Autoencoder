I'm doing Weight Watchers and have made the change to skim milk only.  Was having trouble without chocolate and after discovering this product decided to attempt it as my substitute.  Wow!  Even with skim milk this stuff is great.  Now I get my 2 cups milk in, and each packet is only 1 WW points because if its high fiber content.  Very satisfying late night drink.
