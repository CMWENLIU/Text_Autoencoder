This yacon is very nutritious and has a sweet, resiny flavor that goes great with tea or smoothies. Yacon is a close relative of the sunflower and Jerusalem artichoke, but tastes kind of like a dried apple with perhaps a hint of sweet potato.<br /><br />The plant itself is a tuber that is composed mostly of water and fructo-oligosaccharides, which are prebiotics that increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract and have also been shown to increase calcium absorption. Yacon is great for diabetics because although it tastes sweet the type of sugar can't be absorbed by humans, but since it feeds the friendly bacteria in the digestive system it boosts the immune system and helps digestion. Yacon is also known for it's high antioxidant activity, and has been used as both a food and medicine by Indigenous Andeans for at least 3200 years.
