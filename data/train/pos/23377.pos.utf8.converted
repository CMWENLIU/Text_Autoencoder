I'm not expert as many are on this site, and so you can take this with a grain of salt, but I found this recently at our local market. I do happen to grow some spices, but I'm not always up to doing what I need to, so these 4 spice combo's are advertised here as be mixed with oil and good then with bread. ( Speaking of salt one of my mother's endearing superstitions is the spilling of salt, pinch over the left shoulder when you spill!)<br />The 4 choices of flavors are Sundried Tomato and basil( they call this Tuscany), Garlic and Tomato(Sicilian), Rosemary and Garlic(Rosa Maria), Roasted Garlic and Cheese(Parmesan Blend). I used making flatbread and made 4 kinds quickly today. I would not recommend replacing fresh herbs, but I like this and will send one out with my daughter because the kids liked the flavor.<br />Mom's flat bread recipe is good too, and I just sort of rolled it in the spices and did use this spice creatively:<br /><br />Hearth Flat Bread<br /><br />1 pkg. dry active yeast<br />1/2 tsp. sugar<br />1 3/4 cup flour<br />1 tsp. coarse kosher salt<br />1 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves<br />3/4 cup water ( might need bit more)<br />1 tsp. oil<br /><br />In a food processor combine yeast, sugar, flour , salt and thyme. Pulse and combine. Add the water in a steady stream until he dough gets to forming a ball, now you turn it out on a board and knead with the heel of your hand until the dough is smooth and elastic.<br /><br />Coat a bowl with oil. Place the dough in the bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Put in a warm spot to raise it until double in bulk, about an hour.<br /><br />When the dough has doubled punch it down. scrape it onto the counter or board and knead it lightly into a smooth ball. Cut into 20 pieces and with a rolling pin roll out to form ver flat 5 to 6 inch circles.<br /><br />Preheat a stove top grill pan over a medium high. Do not oil. Place bread on hot grill and cook without touching it until you see bubbles on the surface, about 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and continue to cook 1 to 2 minutes more or until bread has puffed up. Serve immediately.<br /><br />( mom says she got this from the Television Food Network)<br /><br />Again there are other's here with far greater insights, but if you see it you might like this to add to cabinet spices.
