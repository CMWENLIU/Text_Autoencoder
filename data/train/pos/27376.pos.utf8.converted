I love this cereal.  Essentially, if you like Raisin Bran but don't always love the fact that it surrenders to milk easily then this is your solution.  The honey in the granola clusters makes it especially great.<br /><br />What I have a problem with here is the price.  Amazon has this listed at $20.29 for 4 boxes.  That works out to just over $5 per box ($5.07 exactly).  Considering that I can go to Wal Mart and get the 25 oz. box for about $3.50 or even go to the one of the more expensive grocery stores in the area and pay $4.20 for these 18 oz. boxes, that seems like a horrible deal.  After all, you would hope that since you're buying in bulk here that you'd get some kind of discount.  Or at the very least I think it's reasonable to expect that you wouldn't be charged a premium for the privilege of buying 4 boxes at once.<br /><br />Delicious cereal, but not worth more than $5 per box as it is listed currently.
