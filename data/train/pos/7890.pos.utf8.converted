I can't find anything that isn't absolutely perfect about this eye cream...(except perhaps the pump which when I'm half the way through clogs up and I have to take the top off and scrape it out).  Small price to pay for this really inexpensive product.<br /><br />The scent is vanilla/coffee (and I really don't care for either scent), but it smells different than most artificially scented beauty items because it truly is 100 percent pure.  The vanilla/coffee disappears very quickly.<br /><br />It has the perfect consistency for both upper and lower lids, and the perfect slip for makeup (the makeup goes on right over it...perfect)  I don't get the reviewer who had it in her eyes for days, but maybe her eyes are shaped differently.  I don't use very much, but when I do get a little too much out I put some on my cheeks (makes a really good anything cream).  I also always put some over my upper lip as I do with any eye cream to help with a few vertical lines.  I was using a very high end product which I really liked (never thought I'd use anything else), and then I gave this a try, and I just can't go back.<br /><br />Just had to write this review because I'm purchasing my fourth bottle.<br /><br />Update:040612-<br />After trying the new packaging with the pump, I wish I could take off a star.  The product is still remarkable (even better, acually), but the new pump...well...it broke off at the top (and I'm very easy on my things), and I now<br />have to squeeze it out.  I'm going to have to buy the smaller version.  I will never be able to get it all out.
