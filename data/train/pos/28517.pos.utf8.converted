I've tried them all, and they all taste wretched except this one -- it actually tastes good!  Keep in mind, though, that it does work better with a flavorful sauce -- not a mild alfredo.<br /><br />Also, unlike the other reviewer, I've never had a problem with bugs, and I've been buying this stuff for years, during which time I've lived in NYC, Atlanta, and Chicago.  No bugs in my pasta ever.
