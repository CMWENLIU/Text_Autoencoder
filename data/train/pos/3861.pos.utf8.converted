I have 2 schanuzers, one has great skin one has serious skin allergies. When we adopted them they were eating kibbles and bits, and the one with bad skin looked horrible. I hate to say it, but I didn't even like petting him.<br /><br />We went to the vet and spoke to a nutirentest, they gave us some small samples for each dog to try and find out which brand of dog food they liked the best. Turns out they both loved the natures balance.<br /><br />I chose the fish and sweet potato flavor since most dogs that have alleriges are also allergic to chicken and rice. We have been using this dog food for almost 3 months and I have seen a dramtic change in both of their coats!<br /><br />The one with great skin, is even softer and shiner. But the one with bad skin has had the most change. He has a beasutiful shiney dark black coat. He has completly stopped itching and all the bumps are gone.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this food!
