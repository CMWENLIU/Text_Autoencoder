Yorkshire Gold is the finest premiere English tea.  As you watch its golden amber descent into a teacup, complement with just the right amount of milk and perhaps a little sugar, you'll appreciate what our colonial forefathers sacrificed when they chose to promote the United States as an American coffee-drinking nation.  Now that those unpleasantries are behind us, we can reach again across the pond and together enjoy a cuppa!
