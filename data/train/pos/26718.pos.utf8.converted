I introduced several other people to this soup and all of them love it.<br /><br />When I make the soup I combine the mix, the water and the tomato sauce in a 6 qt pot.  I add a pound of boneless chicken breasts.  Simmer soup until chicken is tender enough to shred.  Remove chicken to cutting board and shred with a fork (the texture is much better in the soup than cubing it).  Return chicken to pot.  Add 1 can each black beans, pinto beans and Green Giant's Mexi-corn.  Heat through.  Serve in bowls.  Top with shredded cheese of your choice, chopped green onions and Tostitos Dipping Strips.
