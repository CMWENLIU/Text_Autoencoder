Let's face it.  No one wants to get bad news from the dentist.  Proper dental care can go a long way to keeping one's teeth for a lifetime.<br /><br />The generation that grew up in the Depression and World War II many times did not have good dental care.  No fluoride, sealants, waterpiks, sonic toothbrushes and the like.  It wasn't uncommon for a person in their 30s to be missing a few teeth.  People generally could look forward to wearing dentures as their teeth became so rotten, the only thing to do was to pull them.<br /><br />Today, we don't have such problems.  And one of the reasons is the use of xylitol to help kill the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  The main reason for dental decay is a bacterium called S. Mutans.  This bug feeds on sugars and starches, secreting acids which destroy tooth enamel, which leads to decay and cavities.  There are various ways to defeat this bug, brushing, fluoride, flossing and sealants all have their place.<br /><br />A more modern addition to the decay-preventing fight is xylitol.  It's a sugar alcohol that S. Mutans cannot digest.  Sucking on mints or chewing gum with xylitol a few times a day is a easy and tasty way to curb this nasty bacteria.<br /><br />I've been chewing xylitol gum and eating xylitol mints for a number of years, and I've noticed that my dental problems have really improved.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  My only complaint is that this gum is so delicious, I tend not to ration it to make it last longer.  Try Spry.  Your mouth will thank you for it.  (Maybe not your dentist, though).
