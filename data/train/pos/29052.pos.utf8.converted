I absolutely love this food, and so does my baby, Aphrodite! I absolutely recommend this food with no equivocations!<br /><br />Aphrodite is 9 years old and for the past 2 years, he's been having digestion and kidney problems that grew progressively more severe. About 6 months ago, it got so severe that I was sobbing at the vet trying to decide if we should put him to sleep. At that point, he was vomiting several times a day, had lost 5 lbs, and looked awful. Everything we had tried up to that point had failed.<br /><br />The vet suggested we try one more thing - a series of injections and a bunch of pills - and a switch to high protein wet food. Of course, my baby deserved a last ditch effort and we went ahead with it. After a hefty vet bill and 2 weeks, he actually seemed to be perking up! After another 2 weeks, it seemed that he would pull through. But the prescription food was costing me almost $2 per DAY! I had to find a suitable alternative. So to the internet I went. That's where I first discovered the Wilderness Diet by Blue Buffalo! With it's high protein content and wholesome, holistic, grain free (specifically corn) ingredient list, it's actually superior to the dry version of the RX diet.<br /><br />I ran to the pet store and to my surprise, they carried it. So I grabbed a small bag and headed home with fingers crossed. Aphrodite is a finicky eater, so the first test was whether he'd eat it at all. To my relief, he ran for it and LOVED it! So, I watched and waited.<br /><br />6 months later, my cat is doing amazingly well! Esp. considering just months ago, he was on the verge of being put down! His coat is thick, shiny, and healthy. His eyes are clear and bright. And he rarely vomits - save for the occasional hairball! To maintain his health, I've switched to Bellyrubs Organic Bonito Flakes and Liv-a-Littles All-Natural Freeze Dried Chicken treats, as well!<br /><br />And today, Aphrodite is incredibly healthy, happy, and back to his old self.<br /><br />Now, if I can only do something about his wayward curiosity! =D
