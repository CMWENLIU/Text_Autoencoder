From all the original Senseo Coffee Pods, I like this variety best.<br /><br />I follow the rules and prepare it using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XQZFBK">Senseo HD7003 Espresso Pod Holder</a> - that means it will be a smaller cup (not really as little as an Italian Espresso shot), but you can always use your regular Pod Holder, if that is too strong for you.<br /><br />The prepared coffee has a nice Crema and great taste. In the morning I heat some milk in the microwave and whip it using an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001RT1OS">Aerolatte Frother</a> to make a very quick Cappuccino - the way I like it :)
