Hi,<br /><br />  I am a HUGE Root Beer Fanatic.  I have always loved the Natural, micro brew, old fashioned root beers.  But for some reason the root beer I liked the best was Boylan's Root beer which ironically is an artificial root beer.  Then one day I was strolling throught the soda section of my local health food store looing for some natural root beers when I stumbled upon Boylan's "The Natural Kind" Root Beer.  I almost fainted right there in the aisle!  It was my favorite root beer only better! it was made micro-brew style with REAL ingredients.  Then for about 2 months I was constantly in and out of the store getting that root beer.  I was just like the Boylan's root beer that I had come to love only it was, as I said above, better!  First of all, the second you taste the root beer you can tell the quality of craftsman-ship that went into making the root beer.  The root beer is creamy and velvetly smoothe.  It just slides down your throat.  The amazing thing is that you then notice that it is definitley the signature Boylan's cane sugar root beer flavor.  The flavor is deep and complex but mild.  I know this sounds contradictory but you'll understand when you taste it for yourself.  Then something terrible happened.  I was going into the store to get my weekly bottle only to find that the store had discontinued the root beer.  I was so upset I seriously almost cried.  But then I have discoverd that Amazon.com sells it.  I can't stress to you enough how much I like this root beer.<br /><br />  -Desty
