I have fed my dog dehydrated food as well as those frozen raw food tubes. I decided to try out the Addiction brand. I have tried the Venison, Lamb and Beef so far. My dog absolutely loves each one. After he has finished eating he comes running to me licking his face, his eyes all lit up, all excited. I find him licking his empty bowl over and over again. I've never seen this reaction with the other "natural" brands. This product lives up to its name! Addiction? you betcha!<br /><br />Warm water is added to this product. I let it sit a while till it is absorbed. I then fluff it up with a fork and serve. This  product does have a wonderful aroma. I must admit that I am tempted to taste it because it smells so good!<br /><br />I wish I had kept the box with the ingredients for the Venison to share it with you. I will when I reorder.<br /><br />Although this brand is a bit pricey, it well worth it.
