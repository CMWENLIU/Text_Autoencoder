I just placed another order with Harmony House, and the tomato dices were in it. I throw these tomato pieces into everything I can for more flavor and nutrition. The pieces are small and rehydrate quickly, so it doesn't add extra cook time if you're just adding a little extra to your existing recipes.<br /><br />The shipping cost is a little steep for ordering a single item since it is a USPS flat rate, so it's worth looking at the rest of the company site and adding more items to your order.
