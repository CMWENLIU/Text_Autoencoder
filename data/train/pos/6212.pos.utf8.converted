Just had some Greenoodles with Tom Yum Soup for dinner tonight and I'm glad I did. Fast easy and delicious. Ok.. so I added some shrimp so it would look like the picture and I gotta say it was way better than I expected. In fact the noodles were so good I took the time to write this review. I don't remember which store I bought them at which is why I checked on Amazon. Sure glad they sell 'em here. Can't wait to try them again!<br /><br />Really.
