If you are reading this you probably know about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZHO">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, which is a great condiment and a must-have at my table. Huy Fong also makes Chili Garlic sauce (i.e. the one on this product page) which is a better sauce to cook with. The blend of Chili & Garlic is a wonderful flavor combination for stir-fries etc. You can also use it as a condiment, although it is not as fine and blended as a condiment sauce. While Sriracha is a great condiment I find that it's not that great for cooking use - the flavor seems to change due to heat. The Chili Garlic sauce is much better for cooking use.<br />I hope you find this helpful!
