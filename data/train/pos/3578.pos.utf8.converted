I bought this product as I was trying to find something to sweeten my tea with that was not sugar, and was not made with a bunch of chemicals.<br />This was a nice surprise.  It tastes like sugar and doesn't have a nasty after taste.  I used it to bake a sugar free cheesecake, and it came out perfect with no bitter after taste. I like that you can measure it just like sugar and it seems to do the job just as well in baking.
