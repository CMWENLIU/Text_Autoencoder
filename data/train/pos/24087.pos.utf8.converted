When I decided to become veggie, my boyfriend frowned.  He figured that we'd be giving up on all these foods that he likes.  I made these sloppy joes for him though, and he couldn't even tell the difference!  We're talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled.  I figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again, anybody would like them.
