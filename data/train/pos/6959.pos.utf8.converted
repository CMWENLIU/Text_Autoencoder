Of all the Ostrim products I personally like these best.  A nice combination of taste and nutrition.<br /><br />Decent protein level - 14 g per stick<br />Low calorie - 100 per stick<br />Low fat - 3 g per<br /><br />A little high on sodium - 600 mg - but it's a meat stick after all.<br /><br />A nice alternative for the many sweet protein supplement choices that exist - as well as a nice change from chicken. :)
