We have used Nutiva for more than 2 years.  It's the highest in quality and taste.  We don't use butter any more, just coconut oil, a little salt or sugar on toast, on veggies, for everything it's so much better for you than butter and other dairy.  Great cooking oil too, doesn't break down like all other oils.<br /><br />The 54 oz is the way to go...we buy 4 at a time and go through them in about 4-6 months.<br /><br />Wonderful product, Amazon is the best too, you can't beat the free ship.<br /><br />Local store retail for the same product costs almost 3 times as much.
