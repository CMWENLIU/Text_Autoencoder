While I'm not a fan of 100% buckwheat hot cereal, I do mix it half-and-half with regular oatmeal and cook it either in the microwave or in a saucepan, and it's delicious. I also find that this mixture "holds" me longer than straight oatmeal. If you find that you get hungry too soon after breakfast, give this product a go---the price on Amazon is great, compared to what I've spent in the stores.
