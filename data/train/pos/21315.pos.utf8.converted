Up until about a year or so ago I was able to find this in local stores and then it disappeared.  I'm so glad to have found it again.  I mix 2 0z with a tsp of organic apple cider vinegar and 1 Tbs. of freshly squeezed lemon juice for a great drink.  It will be great to have the good juice back in my diet again.
