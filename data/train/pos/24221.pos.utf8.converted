I drank this tea at the end of my 3rd trimester (9th month). This tea has a high concentration of Red Rasberry tea leaves. It is known to induce labor during the third trimester and it did. I was three days past my babies due date when I drank a cup of this tea at midnight. I went into labor 4 hours later.<br /><br />My doula didn't think this tea induced labor but I believe it did because I started having slight cramping after I finished one cup of this tea. I went to sleep and woke up 4 hours later with mild cramping which quickly turned into contractions. My baby was born at 11 AM ...natural childbirth.<br /><br />Good stuff to have around if you are past your due date. Doesn't taste as good as the Peaceful Mama tea though.
