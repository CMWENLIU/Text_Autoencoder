I too have a problem cat - she was starved before I got her and well, her coat, skin, and overall condition was ridiculous.  This was one of the foods that she went mad for, still does, and well, you should see her now!  She's a chocolate Persian and has the most beautiful long, shiny coat now! Friskies has a great variety of healthy, protein-filled products that both I and my vet credit for bringing her back.  If you rescue cats on a regular basis, although it costs more, it is definitely worth the results.  Besides, it smells like you just cooked it yourself and canned it! Great stuff, highly recommend!
