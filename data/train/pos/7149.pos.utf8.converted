We started buying powdered milk because we live in the mountains and are not able to get to town often and we love milk.<br /><br />There is a difference in the Nido powdered milk.  It tastes the best in that it is whole milk not skim as most are. I have purchased the Nido from Mexico and from Europe.  I found the one from Europe is a little more expensive but when it is chilled I can drink it and find it delicious.  The one from Mexico has a little more of a 'bite' to it.  Can't keep from thinking that when I was in Mexico the cows looked like they were starving to death and were probably being fed corn and when I was in Europe the cows looked healthy and were grazing on the land as cow were intended to do.  Just an observation.  My son likes the Mexico milk better as he says it is richer.  I disagree  and do not like to drink it but he will drink my european Nido milk.  It is great for cooking as well and handy when you can't get to the store often. I will only buy the European Nido now.
