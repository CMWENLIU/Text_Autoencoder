I am totally sold on buckwheat being a super-grain. This product is organic, has great nutrition value and tastes pretty good too. I would not give it 5 starts for the taste, but other benefits added, I recommend it. Just keep in mind, that it tastes a little different than regular pasta, so you may have to experiment a little to find foods/sauces that complement it well.<br /><br />If you have kids, who are addicted to pasta and you want to keep them from overloading on simple carbs and not getting enough other nutrients, this is a very good pasta to try.
