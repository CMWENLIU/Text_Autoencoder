Lobster base is delicious in a variety of contexts. I have made seafood sauce for pasta, Seafood Nuberg over a pastry shell. Seafood soup becomes a quick and simple favorite. Any type of seafood can be enriched with this product. I have made stuffing for fish using this lobster base to season the bread and veggies. It's great in stuffed clams. It simply adds wonderful flavor to all things from the sea, fish, clams, crab, scallops, as well as lobster. It's the missing ingredient in recipies I have tried to copy from outstanding dinners I have been served at restaurants.
