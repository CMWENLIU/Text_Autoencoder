I have not posted a review before, but this so impressed me that I just had to.<br /><br />This stuff is great. It tastes FANTASTIC! And I have noticed some EXTRA, positive, benefits from taking it, too.<br /><br />I cant stop eating it! Seriously, I am craving it (maybe my body needs something that's in it). But what I have also noticed is that after I take it, for maybe 3 or 4 hours, it seems to suppress my appetite and cravings, which I have never had anything do that before. Now I have to MAKE myself eat, sometimes. (Gotta work on THAT one!)<br /><br />I have been having some problems lately (being 45) with my metabolism slowing down and me gaining weight and feeling hungry all the time. -I assume due to getting older and hormones and such.<br /><br />Well, it made me feel like I was not hungry at all. Sometimes I did eat anyway (well, more than I should have, even though I wasnt hungry), which was not smart on my part, but, again ... I will have to work on that one.<br /><br />How? I am going to try to take advantage of it suppressing my appetite to try to eat less and healthier. Maybe this will give me give me the extra help/boost I needed.<br /><br />Maybe I can LIVE on this stuff! (Ha, ha!) I have read all the comments, and someone said it DID help her lose weight.<br /><br />I am taking a tablespoon twice a day (I don't want to take too much). And I will continue this and see how it goes. Maybe add a third one.<br /><br />Oh, and I agree with those others about buying it somewhere else. I got mine at Whole Foods for (I think) about $8 dollars on sale. I was checking here what Amazon wanted, but I will apparently be going back there for more!<br /><br />About making your own ... it IS a bit pricey, but you're getting raw AND organic, so is it really worth it to make your own (buying raw, organic flakes)?<br /><br />Oh, and the OTHER health benefit. -I have been fighting a problem (I am talking on and off for a couple of YEARS) of a yeast combination dermatitis on my hands. It will seem like it is improving, then comes back. I have been at my wits end. Dr.'s and creams and medicine and trying to change my diet (EXTREMELY hard!) and nothing has kept it from going away completely.<br /><br />I read somewhere that coconut oil was a strong antifungal, and when I got the oil at WF's, I saw this and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />My hands have been improving A LOT.<br /><br />Now I don't know if they will STAY improved, or if it is the CB helping. (I am also taking cinnamon, which I read showed antifungal benefits on fungal infections that were resistant to medications - but I had been taking it before and it didn't help as much as this.) Maybe both together?<br /><br />I don't know, and I don't want to get my hopes up, but I am going to keep trying BOTH of them. I do take pro-biotic's, though they have never seemed to help much.<br /><br />I cant say if it will have the same benefits for everyone as it has me, but I'd say its worth trying. And I admit I have only been using it a week and a half, so I don't know if it will make a difference in the long run or not. (I HOPE so!)<br /><br />Sorry to be so long, but I wanted to be thorough and to explain all of how it helped me.
