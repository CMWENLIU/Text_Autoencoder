I use this just as I used to use regular white sugar. I do find that this brand of sugars tends to be a bit more moist than the regular stuff from the grocery store, but I only sometimes remember to adjust recipes and it's not really a big deal.<br /><br />I still wish I could buy larger packages of sugar, but at 24oz these are a step up from the 16oz packages some of the other sugars come in, so there is less packaging waste which is a bonus.
