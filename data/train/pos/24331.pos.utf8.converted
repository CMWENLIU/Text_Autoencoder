We made shredded chicken and cheese enchiladas with this sauce for our new years eve party, and everyone enjoyed it, many had seconds.  Very yummy!  A smoother overall flavor than most other enchilada sauces (it doesn't have that harshness that many sauces do), but at the same time it has a good depth of flavors.  We'll definitely be having this sauce again!
