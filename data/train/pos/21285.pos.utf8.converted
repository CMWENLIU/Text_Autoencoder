Now I know many people would rather spend $30 on something else rather than their cat food, but I have to say this cat food is great. Ever since I switched to this from Nutro brand cat food, my cats now have shinier and healthier coats, as well as more energy. My overweight cat has lost some weight too. Both my 2 year old and my 9 year old love this food. Though the price is a bit high, I think it's worth it for my cats. They're much more active and healthy after switching to this. They also eat less, as the food is more rich.<br /><br />This food is %45 protein, so it's a cheaper alternative to Innova EVO and Core Wellness cat foods, which have slightly higher protein content but higher price. In case you were wondering, all cheap cat foods will usually have around 10% of protein.... This is carnivore food we're talking about here! They can't even use most of the filler other foods have, it just contributes to empty calories and overweight kitties!<br /><br />Do your cats a favor and buy them this, it'll make them healthier and I promise you'll notice the difference within a couple days. Oh by the way, since this is full of protein, their poops WILL get stinkier. Now my two cats BOMB the place after buying this food, the smell is something similar to human poop after a big meaty meal! LOL. To me though, it's worth it. Just remember to keep some Febreeze handy!
