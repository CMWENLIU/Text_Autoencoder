I had ruined several bottles of wine before I tried this wine saver.  By removing the air that causes wine to go bad after a short time, I am able to enjoy it and know that in a week's time it still tastes as good as when I opened the bottle.  It works effortlessly and the "click" sound tells me that the air is removed - so simple and quick!! This was a great idea and it works for me.  No more wasted wine.
