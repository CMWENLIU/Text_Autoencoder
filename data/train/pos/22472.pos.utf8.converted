After many disappointing low carb mixes, this one sat in the cabinet assuming it would be another artificial taste.  Well I stand corrected.  2 servings (1/2 Cup mix) makes one 4-square belgium waffle.  Very crisp and tasty, you will never know it is low carb.  Be sure to spray the waffle maker with Pam on the top and bottom.  We love these waffles.  Have not tried it as pancakes, but for now it is a special treat for weekend waffles.
