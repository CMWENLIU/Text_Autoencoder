I love this stuff!  I am always looking for ways to add healthful fiber to my diet and as a devoted fan of agave nectar I thought I would give this a try.  I use it in my morning oatmeal; it leaves no discernable taste or texture and each teaspoonful adds 10 grams of healthful soluble fiber. One note of advice: as with all fiber if you are not used to it in your diet be prepared for excess gas. Simply start with small amounts and slowly increase it over time to minimize this effect.
