I like to drink my coffee with Half & Half and a sugar substitute; with that, I find this particular coffee rich, bold and full bodied yet smooth, without an offensive after taste that bites back. This is similar to Van Houtte Costa Rica Tarrazu light roast; but slightly stronger. Both I could drink all day long. I don't like a coffees who's after taste last with you for long periods of time; but yet, is very favorable. If you like V.H Costa Rica Tarrazu, give this one a try.<br /><br />This winner gets a spot in my top five favorites list. Which is not an easy achievement.
