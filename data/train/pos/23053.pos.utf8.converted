I love this stuff! I am trying to cut white sugar out of my life, but it is so hard because I hate sugar free stuff. I hate the taste of aspartame, sucrose, and other artificial sweetners. Stevia is a natural sweetner that tastes good. I drink lemonade & tea sweetened with it. I have put it in oatmeal, plain Greek yogurt, cereal.... a wonderful, healthy alternative for a hard core sugar addict! I even carry a bottle in my purse at all times!
