I just bought a box of this tea last week to  keep at work and it was gone within 2 days.  It is so delicious and the smell is unbelievable, I had it this morning with almond milk and it was just fantastic.  I have to say Bigelow  makes great  teas, I have been a faithful Bigelow Earl Grey drinker for years.  The individually sealed packs make all the difference.
