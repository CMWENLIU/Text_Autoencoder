We had a Saeco Vienna Deluxe for several years.  The machine finally died on us.  In searching for a new machine, I saw the Saeco Vienna Plus and knew this would be the next machine.  It is very similar to our previous model.  It is much cheaper than when we had purchased our first unit.  I feel there is value in what we are getting.  It saves us a fortune from having to run to the more expensive coffee shop chains to pick up a mocha when it can easily made at home.  At the touch of a button or two, the coffee is ready to go.  The ease of use is amazing.  Clean up is easy.  I would definitely recommend this machine for those who want to be able to make espresso with ease.
