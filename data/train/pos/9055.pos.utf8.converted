This product was recommended to me by a few nurses & lactation consultants.  I wasn't going to get as I'm not much of a "wholistic medicine" person and read that fenugreek products are more of a placebo type of drug.  That is, as a placebo, the benefit of the drug is a mental / emotional one not a proven factual/medical one.  I have to disagree & highly recommend this product.  I have numerous issues against me in the breastfeeding department... I'm an older mom, I have thyroid issues, had fertility issues and my child was not accomodating to breastfeeding.  For a few weeks, and per the advice of a few professionals, I was doing an insane "booby boot camp" to increase my supply.  I was attempting to do this at EACH feeding: breast feed for 10-15 minutes per side, bottle feed with a formula supplement, and then pump for 20 minutes.  Doing this took a minimum of 2 hours and was done at every 3 hour increment.  Insane!!!  My child also would not breast feed unless I used a nipple shield as well.  I believe that all this was caused when I was in the hospital, she wouldn't feed well and the hospital 1) got her hooked to the nipple shield, 2) got her started down the bottle / formula route since she was a tiny baby, and 3) NEGLECTED TO TELL ME that I needed to pump to keep my supply up.  The combo of the events was a powerfully negative effect on my milk supply, breastfeeding abililty, and well being.  Needless to say, I was a physical and emotional wreck, but I was willing to do the booby boot camp to try to increase my milk supply and ultimately exclusively breastfeed my baby.<br /><br />So here's the point:  After drinking the tea ONE time, I had immediate results.  My pumping supply increased about 3x.  Now, my supply is fine.  Even better, I'm no longer on booby boot camp and not providing supplement of formula OR expressed breast milk to my daughter.  Next stage is getting her off the nipple shield, but everything is in phases.  Plus, it's now some crazy early hour, I really should be sleeping, but I wanted to leave feedback so others don't suffer like I did.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I also recommend Dr. Harvey Karp's book "Happiest Baby on the Block".  The calming recommendations have been a life saver for me.  Did I mention that my husband travels for work and is gone unpredictibly for days at a time? Oh, and we moved when I was 8 months pregnant.<br /><br />TRUST ME: The book & the tea have been hugely helpful.  Sanity and sleep never felt better!!<br /><br />Best of luck to everyone.
