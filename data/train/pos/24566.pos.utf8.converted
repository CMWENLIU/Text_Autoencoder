Although these flakes are generally used for asian recipes, I generally buy them in bulk for my two cats.  They absolutely love these.  I call them kitty chips because they go through a serving pretty much like my husband goes through potato chips.  The difference is that the tuna is low fat and very high in protein.  Wish I could get my husband to like these.
