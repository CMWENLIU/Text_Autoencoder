A co-worker recently bought this in to work from an island vacation.  It was so good, it was gone within seconds of opening it!  I searched for it and was lucky to find it on Amazon and pretty decent prices!  Once I received it, my husband and I dug into this and it was extremely good!<br />It is the perfect cake!  moist through out, sweet with a slight pungent sweet rum aroma and flavor.  Yum Yum!<br /><br />My new favorite type of cake!  It is pretty lethal, and pretty saturated with sugar, so be careful!
