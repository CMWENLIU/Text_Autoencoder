Good Earth Green Tea - Lemongrass 25 tea bags--<br /><br />No way, no how, was I ever going to be a tea drinker. Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - "coffee if you've got it please". I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br /><br />It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought "lemongrass" would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating - as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.It is also sold in multi packs of the 20 bag boxes here as well:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNQM">Good Earth Green Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)  [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>].<br /><br />Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile. Here are a couple of them I'll leave this review with:<br /><br />"You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket"...John Adams<br /><br />"Flowers leave some of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them"...Chinese Proverb<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie
