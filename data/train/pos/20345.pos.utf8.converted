I fancy myself a blue cheese aficianado.  I have had some good blue cheese before but I have NEVER tasted a blue so great it prompted me to actually write a review.  A friend of mine who works at Cow Girl Creamery gave me a hunk of this stuff for my birthday.  I am forever greatful.  So, there you have it.  If you like blue cheese, you have to try this one.  There is no other blue cheese out there better!  Take it from me.  I have a hook-up for free cheese and believe me, I have tried a lot of them.  This one is the best yet!
