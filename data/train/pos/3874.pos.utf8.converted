These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.
