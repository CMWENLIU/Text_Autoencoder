If you have missed the ease and familiar taste of a boxed brownie mix try these!  Betty Crocker's GF brownies are an amazingly close contender to their original brownies.  They smell the same, look the same, and taste pretty darn close.  It was lovely to add butter and eggs and have yummy familiar brownies in under a half an hour. We are thrilled that a major brand has jumped on the gluten free band wagon, we hope many more companies follow!
