My wife and I have tried several choices of flavored coffees and this one seems to be the favorite of not only our family, but several of our guests that have tried it rate it very well also. Nice bargin from Amazon compared the 18 cup packages sold locally at the grocery store and usually this flavor is not available so if it wasn't for Amazon, we might not have had the opportunity to buy and try.
