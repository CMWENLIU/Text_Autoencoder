I don't usually review items, but I am highly impressed with this dog food.  After much research, I decided to go with Blue Buffalo based on very favorable reviews of the ingredient list.  What I wasn't prepared for was my puppy's response to this food.  We recently adopted a Treeing Walker Coonhound mix from a rescue organization and kept her on Science Diet for two weeks until she got settled in our home and I was able to figure out what we wanted to feed her.  I thought she was a very light and grazing eater because she would not finish her food at feeding time.  Rather, she would come back throughout the day and take a few bites at a time.  When we took her out, she would constantly eat grass.  That is, until we started the switch to this food.  As soon as the bag was delivered from Amazon, she smelled it and kept following me smelling it as I tried to put the food it away -- good sign #1.  Even at the initial 75% old 25% new food mix, she ate her full feeding at one sitting for the first time -- good sign #2.<br /><br />She is now fully transitioned to the new food, and eats her full meals in one sitting. The grass eating has stopped and she was able to transition to this food without any loose stools or other issues -- good signs #3 and 4. Needless to say, she absolutely loves the Blue Buffalo food and having hear eat her food in one sitting has greatly simplified my life as her bowel movements are now regular, greatly helping in the whole housebreaking process.  I haven't noticed much of a difference in her coat, but she's only been on the new food for a little over a week. Based on my positive exeprience with this food, I intend to switch her to the adult version of Blue Buffalo once she gets past the puppy stage.
