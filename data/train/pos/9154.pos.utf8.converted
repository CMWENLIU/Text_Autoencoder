This fondant tasts great, I find myself eating the scraps as I cover my cakes with it. However, it stiffens up and begins to crack VERY quickly once rolled out. A trick I use is to kneed a little Crisco into it before rolling it out. This makes the fondant SO much easier to roll out and you end up using less because you can roll it thinner. It also covers cakes beautifully and doesn't crack around the cake's corners if you add the shortening. As long as you make the addition, it's a five star product that's suitable for beginners to work with.
