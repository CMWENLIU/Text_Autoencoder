My wife and I found Marie Sharps while on a month long trip to Belize .It was difficult to find a table anywhere in the country without it.<br />And after a few days we knew why .This is the very best hot sauce we have ever had !<br />This is from a person who 20 years ago wanted to start a store built on one thing hot sauce !Hot Condiments from all over the world.<br />With the Internet we each have that store right in our own homes.<br />Back to Marie sharps this is unique ! Garlic carrot lime all combine so wonderfully with the Habanero pepper to offer sublime heat and flavor.<br />This is hot ! but it is not out to destroy you hot it is gimme more hot while the sweat drips from your brow.<br />This is nothing at all like Tabascos new product while that is very good and I use it a lot . It is more like Malinda's ( Costa Rica )<br />It was told to us that they, Marie Sharp and Malinda were related and each went their own way .Not sure if that is true but there is a slight similarity in the sauces<br />I do not wish to really compare but for an idea of the flavor I must ,However it is not anywhere near a match. Marie sharps has no rival that I have yet found,<br />and I do try them all . This sauce brings a lively zesty bright flavor to most any food ,Ok I have not tried it on ice cream but have been tempted  .It is not a sweet sauce<br />I urge any who enjoy that special zing a good hot sauce brings to give this a try it is very very good .the pronounced flavor of the scotch bonnet pepper leaves you looking for and wanting more it has an almost fruity flavor which is brought out very well in this sauce. Good luck hope you enjoy
