The review by Michigan Money  is not related to the product and really has no bearing on this product. I have used blue buffalo for years and found it to be one of the best products in terms of content and health for my dogs. I have a dog with an extremely sensitive stomach. It turns out there is a common sensitivity to gluten and certain grains. Using Blue solved this problem.
