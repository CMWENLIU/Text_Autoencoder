This is a very good cereal (hence the five-star rating), but twice I received boxes from Amazon either too close to or past the "best by" date stamped on the top flap. When I received a pack of six boxes three weeks PAST the "best by" date, I complained to Amazon. A rep quickly responded with an e-mailed apology and said Amazon would credit my credit card for the purchase price. (Foodstuffs cannot be returned for health reasons, of course.) I realize the "best by" date is not an expiration, but it takes me weeks to consume 6 boxes of cereal, so I want the freshest product possible.
