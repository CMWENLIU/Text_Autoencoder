I've been buying Nature's Path gluten free foods for a number of years, and have been fully satisfied.  I've had access to somewhat lower prices than what traditional grocery stores put on their products, but am delighted that Amazon's price is virtually identical to the prices offered by the discount organic foods market we've purchased these from in the past.  I doubt you'll find Nature's Path products any lower anywhere else, particularly when you consider no sales tax and free shipping if the order is large enough.  Also, I contacted Nature's Path once with a question about one of their products (the Mesa Sunrise flakes).  Customer service is excellent and very friendly (much nicer than we typically get "down here" in the States - they're a Canadian company up in B.C.).  If this sounds like a commercial, it's not intended to be - I just have been entirely satisfied with Nature's Path foods for years and have no complaints at all.  When a company does a good job, they deserve referrals - everybody wins.
