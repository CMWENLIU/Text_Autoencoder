I've been buying this brand of seltzer water from my local grocer for many years.  In fact, I have a bottle of this next to me on the desk right now to sip as I surf.  I wasn't even looking for this, in particular.  Coincidence? In my case, probably not.<br /><br />Something about the bubbles settles my stomach.  (I weaned myself off of Coke and the like years ago, but I still want my fizz!)<br /><br />This has been a good and dependable brand as long as I have known it, and that's a long time.  My only caution, and this is important, is to unscrew the cap SLOWLY the first time, because otherwise, you may get an unexpected baptism.  It doesn't happen every time, but it's happened aften enough to make me very careful!<br /><br />If you like seltzer, you'll like this.  I also recommend the lemon-lime flavor as well as the orange and raspberry varieties.  I'm not wild about the cherry.  I'd rather drink the plain than the cherry, but that's a personal thing.  I also use this product to top up my Crystal Light type drinks to give them a little "pop."  Pun intended.<br /><br />Oh, and in answer to the other reviewer, it's one liter bottles, 12 of them to a case. I drink it warm, I drink it cold.  I just like it.
