I have used this litter for 4 years and I wouldn't use anything else. I have 3 cats, and because I use this litter, there is no cat smell at all in my apartment. I know why this litter is the #1 selling cat litter in Japan! In addition, this litter really doesn't track much at all and it is environmentally-friendly.<br /><br />I buy the largest bag of litter, and it lasts a month for my 3 cats. Several things help this litter last: 1) use the litter scoop that's made for this litter; 2) pour the litter only 1.5" deep at a time; 3) be sure to scoop and stir the litter -- the stirring is very important -- at least once a day so that it can do its work; 4) keep the rest of the fresh litter in an air-tight container so that it doesn't absorb moisture from the air before you use it.<br /><br />This litter works so well that my cats happily use only one litter box. That's an added benefit!
