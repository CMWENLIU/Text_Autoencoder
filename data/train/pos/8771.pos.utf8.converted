We came back from our trip to Peru with a hankering for more Coca tea and it wasn't long before it occurred to me to toss some in my iced tea maker.  What came out was really quite a nice iced tea with hints of cocoa in the flavor, a nice rich earthy flavor.  I've been making nothing but coca iced tea ever since.  I like this particular variety because it comes in a nice sealed tin, it has a nice fresh green color and strong flavor.  The powder works nicely in my iced tea maker, one heaping teaspoon makes a moderately strong batch of iced tea.  The built in filter filters out the powder so I'm not picking it out of my teeth. I add a small spoonful of NuStevia to sweeten it a bit (I've been living in the South for a while now) and the result is amazing.  Best of all, it gives me a little energy without any caffeine.
