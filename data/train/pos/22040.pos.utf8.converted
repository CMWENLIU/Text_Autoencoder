'I use this product because my husband has congestive heart failure and<br />the safe levels of potassium chloride is over 4000 mg per day. Never<br />use that much but the flavoring in food really helps. Cannot find this<br />product in any of the local stores.  Product was fresh dated Thanks for<br />offering it!
