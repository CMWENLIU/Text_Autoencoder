this seller sent me fresh beautiful curry leaves. very arromatic and lovely and there were lots of them. i appreciate the effort the seller put in to send these wonderful leaves to me so quickly. i want to make turnip wraps and need curry leaves. i grew up in Tennessee and moved to New Jersey. because of this i know southern foods and my pastas and sauces will make you sing opera, but i want to learn Indian food because i live in Wyoming now and there isnt access to "exotic" foods and ingredients, and honestly there is nothing like a beautiful spicy hot curry on a cold night=thank God for Amazon and great sellers like this one! i can now make the turnip wraps  have been dying to try, i got the recipe from cookingchanel.com Bal Arneson, she's so pretty and happy who wouldnt want to try her recipies.
