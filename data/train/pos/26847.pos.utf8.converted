Ok I don't know about anyone else but for me this product is nothing short of miraculous.  The taste is OK...I make just as I would any old iced tea; by the pitcher. On occasion I drink it hot. It doesn't taste bad, doesn't taste great. The miracle is what it has done for my body! I controls my appetite and I've lost a lot of weight since drinking it.  This surprises me because my life has held a lot of tragedy this year which has thrown off my workouts.  I thought surely I would gain weight (adding another tragedy to the list) but I started drinking this and my clothes are fitting despite not working out as much. I hate that the shipping is so expensive but I just can't be without this stuff.
