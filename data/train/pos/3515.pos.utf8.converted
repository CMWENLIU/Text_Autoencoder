These bars are wonderful!  Full of nuts and the box says just 6 grams of sugar, much lower than others I have tried.  The protein really fills me up and keeps me sated for 2+ hours. I think they taste like Cracker Jack without the popcorn, very light and crunchy.<br /><br />Other nut bars I have tried are chewy and the nuts tend to lose their snap sitting in nougat-style binding; these are lightly sweet and brittle.  I break up the bar before I open the open the pouch and pop in the clusters while I work to keep me away from the donuts in the break room.<br /><br />The price is fantastic: the amazon.com 6 pack breaks down to 57 cents a bar, which is WAY less expensive than other nut bars of this quality.  I used to eat KIND bars, but they are over $1 a bar and more sugar.<br /><br />There are only 8 ingredients and I can pronounce and recognize them all; there is corn syrup in these, but it is not High Fructose Corn Syrup (which is modified and not very good for you).  I eat about 3-4 of these a week.<br /><br />Another tip: I am 6 months pregnant and find these a perfect thing to keep in my purse for when I need a nosh to keep me from getting light-headed, the protein and low sugar keeps me buoyant and doesn't send me crashing.  One of these, a string cheese and a piece of fresh fruit is a filling and easy mid-day meal when I am pressed for time.
