I am using this product now. I will discuss both the himalayan salt inhaler and the himalayan salt itself and how I use both.  I am asthmatic and have been so since I was 3. I find the salt inhaler helpful but I still use my regular inhaler which is minimal. What I am finding out is that when I drink the himalayan salt twice a day that is helping cut down my asthma. I drink one teaspoon in the morning and the evening. It doesn't taste to bad but I get it down fast. I also use warm water. That approach is making some differences. I use the himalayan salt inhaler along with my other inhaler. The salt inhaler makes my lungs feel good. Asthma is a lower tract problem visiting the lungs or at least if you read about asthma ascarsis it has a full cycle from the lower tract into the lungs. Not a fun problem. My dad and grandfather had asthma and who knows how far back the problem exists. It isn't genetic but a bacterium that is very hard to kill. The drinking of the himalayan salt helps to alkalize the body but it also does some unique tricks of its own for what it is. It is an wonderful mineral supplement of many minerals in addition to the salt. Salt kills anything and is a killer of germs. The process has to be used daily as once asthma and lung problems exist, the fight is on to keep the lid on it. It isn't an easy street problem that can be quickly resolved. I use the himalayan salt drink now to kill what causes asthma and I will continue to use it to keep the problem at bay. It has cut down my allergies tremendously so I'm a big fan of it. The inhaler I really like. It makes my lungs feel good. I can breathe a lot deeper with it I've noticed. I've had mine over about two months now and progress is with both techniques I am talking about. Please note I am not talking about table salt or sea salt of any kind; I am talking about the himalayan salt. It is the only one that has this incredible balancing and healing property to it. I am seeing some wonderful results by drinking it. And believe me asthma has been so miserable for me that drinking it is nothing. If that solves the problem and gives me my life back and my energy, I can handle it.<br /><br />Update on the above:<br />I use the "sole" that you make with the himalayan rocks. I have gone to using just one teaspoon of sole in a glass of water in the morning on empty stomach. It is far more effective than doing this teaspoon a day with regular himalayan salt which is what I started out with originally but modified the procedure as time went on and as I learned more about the uses of himalayan salt. I'd not suggest to anyone using a teaspoon of regular salt in a drink of water; it is too much salt for anyone with asthma. It is incredible stuff, but creating sole is with the himalayan rocks and water. You add the rocks to a glass container of water that has a lid and let it sit. You keep adding rocks every 24 hours until the rocks stop dissolving and then the sole water is ready but just do one teaspoon in a glass of water and preferably on empty stomach waiting for one hour to get the best impacts and then you are done for the day until the next time. The sole is highly concentrated at that point. When the water gets down add more water and more rocks and let it sit for the 24 hours before taking anything out. If the rocks dissolve add more rocks. A box of the rocks will last a very long time.<br /><br />Hope that helps clarify the process.  Use the himalayan rocks to create sole water and do not drink the himalayan salt by itself--too much salt for anyone in that fashion.  The salt inhaler is impressive.  Tiberius
