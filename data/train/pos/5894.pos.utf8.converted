I have been enjoying single malt scotch since back in the '70's. For a long time the selection available here in the States was quite limited. My normal choice of glass was a brandy snifter. The recent explosion of available brands of single malt caused me to branch out and try a couple other varities with mixed results. After reading the descriptions of some varities online, I found I just wasn't sensitive enough to discover the aromas and tastes they were experiencing. I was just about to settle back with my old favorite, (Can I name brands here?), Glenfiddich, when I discovered the availability of specialized tasting glasses while searching online.<br /><br />I never thought the shape of a glass could make so much difference! These specialized glasses have opened new doors, or should I say new bottles, to the single malt scotch world for me. Is it the curve of the rim? I don't know. I can't say that I am smelling and tasting all of what the 'experts' claim is there, but they do make a difference. If you have any interest in exploring single malt scotches these specialized glasses are a must have.<br /><br />And I may be bordering on sacrilege, but I've tried a little rum in them and they seem to work for that spirit also.
