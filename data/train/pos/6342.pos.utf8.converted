In the '70s there was an herbal tea that I really loved from South Africa, but then came the boycott of South African goods and I could never again find it. Recently I did some research and found that the tea was once again available (though not by the brand name I knew) by the actual name of the tea "Rooibos".<br /><br />So I made an order through Amazon... and although the shipping price is a bit high for something so light in weight, I can't complain because the tea is even better than I remember it. For those who aren't familiar with Rooibos Tea, it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor, minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid, but with the anti-oxidants and other GOOD stuff. Refreshing and delicious stuff!
