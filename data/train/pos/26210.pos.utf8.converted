My kids hated the natural peanut butters that I used to buy and I hated to use the ones that had hydrogenated oils in them. Kudos to Skippy for developing this. This stuff spreads like the other ones, tastes like the other ones and costs about the same (if you can find it). And it doesn't separate. My kids love it and so do I.
