I ordered this bilberry jam after hearing the benefits bilberry brings.  I wasn't expecting it to taste sooo good!  It's not too sweet or unsweet.  It's perfectly balanced!  I just love it.  I love it enough that I mix it with my cereal :D  Who knows what else I could spread this on with.  This is seriously my new favorite jam ^_^  I'm definitely buying more.
