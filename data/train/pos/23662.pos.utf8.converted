Bought the smaller one for the wife.  Mounting is a breeze.  I went ahead and used the screws to insure it wasn't going anywhere.  Perfect way to store your K cups without taking up a drawer or more counter space.  It tucks them away nicely out of site under the cabinet.  Highly recommend this unit.
