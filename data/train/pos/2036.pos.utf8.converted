When I opened the box, I thought I had spent a lot of money for some plastic bins.  However, they fit together well, I had no spilling of water, and they are totally dishwasher safe.  The little instruction booklet, though not very flashy, was very helpful in getting me started in sprouting.  Definitely a good investment.
