I am very gluten sensitive and have unconsciously avoided pasta for years, as well as bread, pizza, etc.  I've become consciously aware of this sensitivity and have switched to gluten-free foods as much as possible.<br /><br />When I saw this pasta, I thought, hmmm.  Great price for gluten-free pasta although I wasn't sure about the size/shape of this pasta since I do prefer larger flat pasta noodles.<br /><br />When I cooked this pasta, I was very pleasantly surprised. It cooked quickly, stayed firm enough for me, and digested like a charm. No bloated feeling after eating it..........it went down like a vegetable and I love the size.<br /><br />It's perfect to add to soup for a bit more "body".  I also made a delicious stove-top tuna casserole-type meal by combining about a cup of this uncooked pasta, then cooking it, a can of tuna drained, some cooked broccoli and diced baby carrots, garlic to taste, and then heated it all together with half a jar of alfredo sauce.  Yum and quick.......probably 15 minutes start to finish.<br /><br />The price at about a buck plus a bag is amazing compared to the prices you'll find in your local health food store and it's not a compromise, in my opinion.<br /><br />If you have digestion issues or gluten sensitivity, please consider trying this product.  It's a winner !
