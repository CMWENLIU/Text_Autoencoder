I have been vegan for about two years. i love desserts and suffice it to say the selection of vegan offerings leaves much to be desired. These cookies are moist and chewy and not too sweet. Not too salty either as I have come across that. Not too oily. Vegan cookies can be too sweet and either too dry or too oily. There is a delicious coconut undertaste - the chocolate fools you into thinking it is milk. I like chocolate but most vegan chocolate is very dark or has a nasty rice dream aftertaste.  If I were not vegan I would eat these - no crave these. My Whole Foods cannot keep this line in stock. Crazed sweet toothed vegans periodically raid the store and buy it out. Then we are back to boring fig newtons and dark chocolate bars (mmmmmm).  Anyway - try it. I plan to buy from amazon now since I cant go too many weeks without a fix.. cheers
