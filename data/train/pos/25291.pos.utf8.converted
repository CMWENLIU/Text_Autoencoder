I have been a green tea drinker for a long time and have tried many brands, but I keep coming back to Celestial Seasonings.  Very good tea.<br />This is a lovely flavored tea, never bitter and never has that processed taste that so many teas have.  I drink a full pot of it every day and the flavor is always consisent... no nasty surprises.<br /><br />Amazon has a great value on the 40 count boxes... much cheaper and fresher than I could ever get at my grocery store.
