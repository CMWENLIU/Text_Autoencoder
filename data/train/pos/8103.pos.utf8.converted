My 25 year lover Dean just loves clam sauce and we always had it when we lived in NY. After moving to sunny Albuquerque we had a hard time finding clam sauce and when we finally did a can half the size of this yummy product goes for around $4 a can so a case of Ferrara's is just a bit over $2 a yummy can. Tastes fresh and delicious. I highly endorse this product. Yummy to the tummy for sure!
