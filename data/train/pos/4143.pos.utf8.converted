I love chocolate extract, and I'm so happy to have found a source that is cheaper than the outlets I normally buy from.  One warning:  Chocolate Extract only boosts the chocolate notes of products already containing some kind of chocolate or cocoa powder. Used in non chocolate baking, it brings a boost of flavor that may make someone ask "what is that I'm tasting?".  They may recognize chocolate, but you don't have to tell them what it is!
