this is the best hot cereal.  period.  being a big hot cereal fan, I regularly partake of oatmeal, wheat farina, etc. but this one is just the tastiest of all of them.  And it's organic, so it's a no brainer.  There are several other brands that make a brown rice farina, but this one seems to be the cheapest, and is equal or better in quality to the others.
