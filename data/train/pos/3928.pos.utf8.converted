This stuff I found at my sister's place. I tried it and loved it. It made me think of raisin branne [sic] with yogurt. Why don't those guys make that? Or berry bran? Or banana bran? Diversify Brainiacs!<br /><br />Be very very careful. Don't ignore the verbiage on the front that says it has lots of fiber. I am a dude. I don't know or care what the hell that gibberish is supposed to mean.<br /><br />But I learned if you do 2-3 bowls of this awesome tasting stuff, it better be your day off of work. Or else you WILL be racing home from work for the duration of the whole day.<br /><br />It shoots the plumbing with a quickness. Recall or google Pope of Greenwich Village. When Paulie slips the cop a Mickie.<br /><br />I love the flavor and the healthy parts, but I only do 1, that is ONE bowl each day or couple days MAX.<br /><br />Be Smart.
