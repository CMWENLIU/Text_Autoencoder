We've been buying Horizon individual milks for nearly 4 years. My first daughter has never cared much for dairy products, and refuses to drink plain milk, but she'll slurp these up and ask for more! After looking for a flavored alternative to regular milk, I quickly discovered how much junk is added to the popular brands of flavored milks. There are so many artificial flavors, sugar, and perservatives, why even bother? The Horizon milks are not as sugary, but still have great flavor. The part I adore is that they can be stored out of the refrigerator and chilled before serving. That way, they are incredibly portable, especially for travel. All of their flavors are fantastic, but my kids love the strawberry and vanilla best.
