I'm probably one of those weirdos who can tolerate a LOT of heat, so, this review is coming from someone who loves her hot stuff.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this is definitely HOT but not anything near scorching hot where you can't appreciate the flavor of the pepper itself. This cayenne has a nice sweet fruitiness coupled with the heat which I really dig.<br /><br />For those of you who are not used to a lot of heat, go easy on yourself at first and gradually work up to more or you might be visiting the toilet in a tumultuous rush.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that this is not organic. Why is it that all of the super hot cayenne is non-organic? Is it because the peppers are so hot that they repel bugs naturally and are already 'organic' by proxy of their natural repellent factor? LOL
