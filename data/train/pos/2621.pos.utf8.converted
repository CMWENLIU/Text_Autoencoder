I have been looking at Coconut oil for my cat's fur, yet hesitated to purchase. I found this parachute coconut oil and have been quite pleased. It has helped my cats fur and dander 100%. They LOVE it. The youngest comes running when he see's the bottle. I have used it to cook with, to help a small fungal issue on my feet, dry skin, my own hair... My only concern is the bottle expires 15 months from the date of manufacturer date, so this bottle is good for another month.<br />I'm glad it was  a small bottle. We love it and hope the next time we purchase we have longer to use the product.
