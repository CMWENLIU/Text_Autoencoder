Currently I have a five months old bichon frise. When I first got him as a puppy, I thought I picked out the best food for him, Blue Buffalo at Petsmart. However, when I got home, I did more research and found Orijen. As owners of bichons, or malteses, or poodles know, they tend to have problems with tear staining because of their white fur. Since I already got him Blue Buffalo, I thought I'll finish it before switching. Because of the tomato pomace (it's the leftover tomato seed, pulp, and skin) in the ingredients list, he had tear staining problems. I did nightly cleanings of his eyes, but it was still noticeable.<br /><br />Now it's been a month since Orijen Puppy, and I just realized that it's been a few weeks since I had to clean his eyes. Even my friends who visit us constantly commented on just how clean and bright his eyes look.<br /><br />Besides helping with the tear staining, Orijen is an all-around great food. I've also noticed his coat has a sheen to it. His poops are solid, not too soft or hard. He loves it, gobbles it down each time. I am extremely excited about feeding him this awesome food! And I will whole-heartedly recommend this dog food to anyone. It's totally worth it.
