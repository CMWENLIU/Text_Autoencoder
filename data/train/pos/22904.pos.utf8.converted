This is a very refreshing and clean tasting product.  I love the fact that the tops come capped with this nice thick foil to keep any dirt out off the part your lips go.  The orange flavor has a bit of a bite which, to me, just means its not loaded with sugar to counter the bitterness.  Don't think this product is bitter, just not too sweet for my taste buds.  I hope to try the lemonata by the same manufacturer when it goes on sale.
