I was looking for milk for my coffee that I could keep at work unrefrigerated and was planning on purchasing those little creamer cups. After reading reviews on Amazon for Peak, I decided to try it. This is not like instant milk of old. It is a very smooth and wonderful powder that easily stirs into a cup of coffee. So much better than  coffee-mate type powders.
