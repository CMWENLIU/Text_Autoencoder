Like one of the reviewers I like the fact it has the sugar pieced in various shapes and sizes (technically it can't be called a cube since very few of them are shaped like a cube).  I had been looking for an unrefined sugar cube and the onces in my local grocery store are very expensive.  These are very reasonably priced and they also add that special flavor that this kind of sugar gives in addition to sweetness.
