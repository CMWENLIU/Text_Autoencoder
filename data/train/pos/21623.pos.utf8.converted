I have two cats, brother and sister, and the sister was having upset stomach all of a sudden. We were feeding them this natural food in a green bag and the vet said sometimes cats stomachs can just react to their food. The vet recommended to switch foods and a friend recommended this food. They both chow it down and its way better than just standard food! Just look at the ingredients! Amazon actually sells it cheaper than petco and highly recommend ordering from here! These are my first two babies and I want to keep them around for a long time so I don't mind spending a few extra bucks to feed them the best. What if you were in their shoes? You'd want good food too :-)
