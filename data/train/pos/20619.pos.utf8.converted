These taste just like the Rice Krispies I remember as a kid!!  I cannot even express my joy in being able to make AND eat Rice Krispie treats with my children.  It is a tradition that many take for granted, unless you can't have gluten.  These Rice Krispies still provide the "snap, crackle, pop" like the original version but don't contain gluten.  I think I need to start a weekly delivery via subscribe and save.  They make me feel normal.  :)
