This pasta is definitely different than white pasta.  Don't expect the same flavor or texture!  However, we love this pasta for what it is.  It is a lot like a sponge and needs much more sauce than white pasta to not taste dry.  Our favorite way to eat it is just with real butter, salt & pepper.  (My kids want this for lunch everyday)  As far as other pasta dishes go, I find that you can't really substitute this.  Tinkyada is a good brand that is much more similar to regular white pasta if you just want the health benefits, but don't want to change your recipes very much.  The flavor of this pasta is much more rich and full than a normal white pasta, or even whole grain pasta.  It will compete with other flavors, so you have to tinker with it and find what you like it with and what you don't.  I don't think it tastes like cardboard though, we really enjoy the flavor.  All in all, the health benefits are so great, we will use this 90% of the time.  Also, I do think the penne is the best shape.  The spaghetti is difficult to work with and overcooks easily.  The penne is delicate, but turns out much better for me.
