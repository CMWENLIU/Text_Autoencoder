We have used Bragg Liquid Aminos for years in our family.  It is a great soy sauce substitute that is lower in sodium and unfermented.  We ran out and while waiting for our order to arrive, we used a soy sauce in our scrambled tofu and grilled vegies and boy could we tell the difference.  The scrambled tofu had a bitter taste and the grilled vegies had a fermented smell while in the electric skillet.  I highly recommend this product and what a great deal buying it in a 3pack with the option of free shipping.  You just can't beat it.
