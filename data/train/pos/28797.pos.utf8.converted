I tried some of this recently and I love it, there is absolutely NO strange taste to it at all.  It tastes like...WATER.  It's great for working out in the morning, who wants to drink coffee during/after a summer workout?  and no sugar overload like the energy drinks have.  I give it a 10 out of 10.
