This is an unexpectedly enjoyable tea.  The mate gives it a deeper and woodier taste than black tea alone, with just a hint of smokiness.  While that might not sound particularly appetizing, it's actually quite good.  However, I ONLY like it with a squirt of lemon juice (and sweetener).  Without lemon juice, I don't enjoy it, but I have to have lemon juice in my plain tea, as well.<br /><br />The flavor is distinctive enough that when I moved to a small town where the local store doesn't carry Morning Thunder, I didn't switch back to plain tea.  I had to start getting multiple boxes on my periodic trips to the big city.  I was delighted to find that Amazon now offers it at a price lower than most supermarkets.  Having it delivered (for free with Prime membership or Super Saver) is the ultimate in convenience.<br /><br />I don't find this tea particularly invigorating (not that I notice, anyway, which is perhaps a good thing), but the mate does seem to live up to its reputation as an appetite suppressant.  Whether it revs you up or not, it's a great way to get started in the morning.  And with the astonishingly high level of antioxidants (due both to the tea and the mate), you can actually feel good about drinking it.<br /><br />Don't be alarmed by the six-pack size.  It's a good enough tea that you'll go through it quickly.  Each box is individually wrapped in plastic (as you'd get it at the store), so you can expect a long shelf life.
