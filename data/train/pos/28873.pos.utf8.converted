Who knew dog food could be this delicious, this nutritious, this fun to serve? How can you go wrong with a product named "Stella & Chewy's" -- the name alone makes you want to hug the package.<br /><br />But dogs can't read. So the real test came when I opened the package and popped out the dry, puck-sized wafer and put it in front of Madeleine, our 4.5 lb Papillon. Madeleine gobbled it down like she hadn't had a thing to eat in months. Sold.<br /><br />What's in the wafers? Freeze-dried, RAW farm raised chicken with no imitation anything. It's also CERTIFIED safe raw and pathogen free food.<br /><br />Do I trust those words? In today's FDA-scammed market, they aren't what they used to be.  And yet, the whole package just seems to ooze with clues this company is ethical, responsible, progressive, and aware of the potential damage "ordinary" dog food brings to the table. I just have a feeling this company knows more about perfecting the domestic dog diet than I do.<br /><br />This stuff is "Made in Wisconsin" according to the emblem on the front, but there's French writing all over the place. That's because Stella & Chewys' LLC is exporting their gourmet dog food to France, complying with French law by pointing out that it is indeed "Fabrique aux Etats-Unis" and it is "Nourriture pour chiens".<br /><br />Given the exchange rate and the shipping costs, by the time it reaches the Left Bank, it must cost a bundle.  And worth every Franc.<br /><br />Botttom line: I think these people at Stella & Chewy's care about the same things I care about. That may be irrelevant in the business world.  Profits are hard enough to come by these days.<br /><br />But they aren't cutting any corners in Chewy's Chicken Dinner.  Because it's a healthy blend of this, that and the other thing, it's even healthier than, say, pure Chicken or Steak right off the dinner table.  This has fruits and vegetables mixed in (organic blueberries, apples, carrots, squash, beets, broccoli, cranberries and pumpkin seeds).  That's important for a happy, healthy dog.  No wonder Madeleine is hooked.
