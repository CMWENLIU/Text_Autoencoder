We've tried repellent and gas bombs but with no real success (we did kill one gopher with the gas bombs but out of 20 bombs we only got one gopher)<br /><br />I set the trap and that night got a gopher, I live in Colorado's front range and we are inundated with the little buggers, on my five acres, I have at least 4 active gophers. So one down, three to go.<br /><br />The traps are pretty easy to use, you do need to dig a hole but if you don't get rid of them your yard will be trashed so a hole here or there is no big deal.<br /><br />As a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres (at least the active ones), we did this in 3 days. We spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs.
