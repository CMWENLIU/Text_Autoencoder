My husband and I liken this sauce to something we've had in an Italian restaurant on Mulberry Street in Manhattan.  I've never, ever tasted a sauce like this from a jar or bottle.  I've been able to purchase it in Shaw's in New Hampshire, but I believe they've removed it from the shelves because like another reviewer, I've noticed some of the inner seals not holding tight.  I hope the company addresses this matter, because they most certainly have a 100% winner with this product.
