It's nice to know when you can't find a product at your local grocery store you can usually find it here on Amazon.  My husband grew up on Wolf Brand Chili in Texas and you can not find here in Kentucky.  Not only did I find it, it was very affordable compared to the link on the Wolf Brand website had taken me to.  I was hesitant to try "canned" chili but I was suprised that I really loved it.  It makes the BEST Frito pie!
