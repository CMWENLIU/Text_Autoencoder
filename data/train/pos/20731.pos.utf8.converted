This arrived in wonderful condition. I am writing this review weeks later because I wanted to be able to say how it held up and I am happy to report it is doing fantastic. This is a slow-grower, but I have no trouble getting what I need off it for my recipes. If you use a lot of bay in cooking you may want to get a couple of them. The company is top notch - they pack the plants well and ship timely.
