I tried the carob-cocoa flavor. These are not at all sweet, even with malted grains, honey and raisins in the ingredient list. They have the texture and appearance of very dense, nutty brownies, but not a lot of chocolate flavor, rather a kind of carob/raisin/grain taste. These are for active people who want a quick, calorie-dense (440 calories per bar) meal from a bar made with natural ingredients. They are NOT weight-loss bars.<br /><br />I like my coffee black and my iced tea with no sweeteners of any kind, so maybe that is why I like these bars. My wife won't drink those beverages without lots of sugar, and she HATES these bars. So, I'm guessing if you like sugar in your coffee, you should stay away from this product.
