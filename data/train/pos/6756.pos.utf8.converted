I bought this salt because i heard it was the secret ingredient for making a Tofu Scramble. Boy were they right! The slightly sulfurous taste/smell of this salt really made our scrambled Tofu taste just like eggs. It's in a powdered form, so it distributed evenly amongst the Tofu. I am very pleased with this product.
