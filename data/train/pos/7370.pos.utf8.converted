Colors were brilliant.  After my gel colors in the little jars had dried up, I was looking for another type of food coloring and these have met my needs.  Love having just to squeeze drops out of the bottles rather than messing with toothpicks.  This is the clean and easy way to use food coloring.  Would highly recommend it.  Haven't used all the colors yet but by Easter, they will be used.
