I tasted it at a friend's place and could not wait to place my order.  The chocolate is absolutely the best. The shipping and handling cost is absolutely terrible,  but there is a way to offset it.  For every extra package, the charge is only $1.50 more.  So, I bought more packages to make the shipping and handling cost more reasonable, I bought 4 Kg (i.e. 8.8 lbs), and in average, I paid about $4 per 2.2 lb.  With this price, it is not so bad any more, and I also got a good excuse to order more.  These chocolates make excellent gifts, and the extra packages could be used for the holidays.  The only thing I need to worry about now is how to burn off those extra calories.  BTW, I have absolutely no affiliation with the vendor.
