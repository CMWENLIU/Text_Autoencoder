These are my favorite of the Pop-Tart line ever since I can remember!  I can't find them in the supermarket anywhere, and I have looked, and even searched the Internet for them.  I found them on Amazon and was very happy to see them indeed!  I guess that today everyone is pushed by their kids to get the frosted ones.  Don't get me wrong, the frosted ones are fine, but I prefer the unfrosted.  Very hard to find nowadays!  The product was delivered fast, and they are fresh and delicious!  Thanks to Amazon for great service, and to Kellogg's for still making them!!!  Any chance of coming back with strawberry, cherry, and apricot flavored in unfrosted too???  Perhaps an ad campaign noting the lower sugar content (and therefor a bit healtier) alternative while still being delicious!
