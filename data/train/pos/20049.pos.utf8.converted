Not a western tasting entree by any stretch but a very good Indian vegetarian curry. Kinda hot but very tasty, especially the big chunks of mushrooms.  The pouch does not contain what I would call a full meal (but says 3 servings= no womder Indians are so slim)but served over a bowl of fresh rice with a salad does the trick.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add some tofu and see how that works.  I'll bet it turns out great.  Itsmells so good that the house carries the aroma for a long time.<br />I cut open the pouches and nuke it in a covered larger bowl to leave room for rice.  I.d buy this again.
