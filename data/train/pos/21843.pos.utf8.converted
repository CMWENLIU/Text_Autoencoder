This organic matcha is great for everyday use!!!  I will definitely buy this matcha again and again!  I put matcha in smoothies or make tea by the quart with honey.  Ceremonial grade matcha is just too expensive to drink everyday by the quart or to load up smoothies with it.  This tea has a good, clean flavor that is flavorful enough without being overpowering.  I have found it to be delicious in smoothies made with a fresh peach or mango, coconut milk, honey, ice, and a teaspoon of this matcha powder dumped directly into the blender.  It is a great way to enjoy the delicate flavor of matcha and the health benefits never tasted so good!  You are getting many times over the anti-oxidant effects of green tea from a tea bag because you are actually ingesting the tea leaves when you enjoy matcha. When making matcha as a tea by itself, less is more.  I use 1 teaspoon to a whole teapot of steaming (not boiling) water (but I enjoy strong flavors), then I mix in honey after it cools a little.  After my morning cup of matcha, I store the remainder of the tea and honey in the fridge for iced matcha later that day.  The flavor can be strong by itself, especially if you don't enjoy strong flavors, so it might be a good idea to start with smaller amounts (1/8 teaspoon or less per cup water) and work your way up to suit your individual tastes.  Experiment and enjoy!
