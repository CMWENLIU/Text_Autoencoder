I ordered two boxes of the 70's candy.  I displayed these at my husbands Disco-50th Birthday Party. Everyone had a blast thinking back to their childhood and remembering their favorite candy especially the candy cigarettes.  Note:  Each box contained many of the same candies but there were also some differences within each box.
