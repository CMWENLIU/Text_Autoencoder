If you are real true lover of licorice, the Kraepelien & Holm Coin Licorice is one of a kind.<br />The taste is a medium taste and you get the real taste of licorice, not waxy or sugary, so it's not real sweet.<br />Also the left overs keep well, although I don't usually have allot of left overs, as once I receive my order, eat some and share some with friends and family who also love the taste, there's not always allot leftovers, but they do last a long time if you decide to store them until later.<br />To me, there's nothing like it, the good, real taste of licorice and I'm hooked.<br />Thank You Kraeplin & Holm for making such a good tasting treat !!<br />Thank You candy companies for carrying it and making it available to the customers.<br />Sincerely ~ A very pleased customer.
