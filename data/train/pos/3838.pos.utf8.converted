It started with Peets coffee in Berkeley, 1980....couldn't then, get better coffee. Now much older, I'm picky about what we drink. THIS tea, I used to order directly from Sri Lanka; $10 for 4 tins, and $30 for Fedex!!! Now available from Amazon, it is VERY HARD to find any Earl Grey that is FRESHER, or of higher QUALITY. Peets in the a.m., and Dilmah Earl Grey in the p.m., for a refreshing LIFT, that coffee just can't match - weird, but true. Wish we could try a SAMPLING of the other GREAT Dilmah teas...but, no one has gone that MARKETING route, sadly.
