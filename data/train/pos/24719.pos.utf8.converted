I'm really happy I tried this moisturizer, it is amazing. At first I didn't think 3oz of this stuff would be enough to last me very long but a little really goes a long way. My skin soaks it right in but you only need a little bit of it. I think I use less a dime-sized amount to cover my entire face. It's not greasy at all and just leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. The first time I used it at night, I used it before going to bed and when I woke up the next morning, my face was noticeably clearer. It even helped diminish my pimples.
