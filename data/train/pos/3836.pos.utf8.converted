This is the best tea I've ever tasted - period! Each canister has a double lid plus comes sealed in plastic to preserve the flavor. On opening the lid, the rush of bergamot aroma hits your nose. Wow! You also smell the flavor of the black tea (unlike some other Earl Grey brands where all you get is the bergamot). The leaves are indeed the prized small buds from the top of the plant.<br /><br />This tea cannot be over-brewed. I left it longer than 5 minutes a couple of times and it never became bitter or acidic. Always you taste the smooth black tea and the bergamot is strong but never over-powering.<br /><br />I also like that you're supporting a local grower and the workers instead of being syphoned off into a large mega-corporation.<br /><br />If you like Earl Grey, get this tea! You won't be disappointed.
