My little Munchkin girl threw up every food we fed her, including the Royal Canin Green Pea and Duck the vet recommended! I discovered and switched her to Blue Buffalo Basics Turkey and Potato about 4 months ago, and she hasn't thrown up once! Thank goodness for this wonderful nutritious food - my cat loves it! I also switched my dogs to Blue Buffalo Basics, and it has helped their allergy symptoms tremendously. I just wish Amazon would put Blue Buffalo items on subscribe and save!
