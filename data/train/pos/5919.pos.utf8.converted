After nearly 4 months of changing my diet, stopping my medications (not a great idea), fighting with my baby to nurse, dealing with a screaming baby every time I finally got her to eat, constipation and mucousy stools, putting her on Zantac and then Miralax, and then, finally having her refuse to eat at all; my pediatrician had me trial her on Nutramigen. The first bottle showed an amazing turn around!!! After the office visit I was out and didn't have any bottles so I did one last nursing which she fought the whole way through. The next feeding I gave her a bottle of Nutramigen and she calmly drank, finished the whole thing and burped easily. No struggling, no crying, no pain! Just a calm, happy, baby, finally! Admittedly it's taken a few weeks to get past her mucousy stools, constipation and she still needs the Zantac but I am so happy this formula exists.<br /><br />Another good thing is that it doesn't smell like normal formula. Not being used to formula, this was a relief for me.<br /><br />Cons: it's not cheap and it's quite hard to find coupons or cheap prices. Most annoyingly is that it's very difficult to find multi-can packs with the 19.8 oz cans. It's mostly just the 12.6 oz cans. It works out cheaper than buying the larger cans since they aren't coming in discounted packs but it just seems so wasteful to have all these little cans to throw out.<br /><br />Typically this formula causes an increase in frequency and runniness of stools. For us that's a good thing since she also has a bad problem with constipation (actually managed to have a BF baby that was constipated tho it's not 'supposed' to happen). She still doesn't stool daily yet but after 3 weeks she's up to every other or every 2 days (from over a week between). The stool smells aweful, though!<br /><br />If your baby has a milk protein allergy, this is an excellent choice!
