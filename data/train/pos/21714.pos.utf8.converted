Chick o Sticks remind me a little of the inside of a butterfinger. CRUNCHY, BUTTERY GOODNESS! The thing I really like most about them though is that they're not nearly as sickening-sweet.  You can munch on them pretty much all day and not get sick of that over bearing sweetness that makes your mouth feel chalky and dry.  They've almost got a nutty flavor to them. I can't really describe it.  If you like Butterfinger, minus the chocolate, try a Chick o Stick.  I think you'll like them.
