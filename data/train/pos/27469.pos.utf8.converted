Thanks a lot! I am now the owner of a demanding stoner cat who will accept no other catnip. I've only had this nip for a week, and she already knows what the can looks like. The minute I go anywhere near the can, she starts screaming at me like a banshee for her nip. I tried giving her her old nip (which shall remain nameless) and she turned up her little black nose at it. So, yeah, she knows the difference.<br /><br />All I have to say is this: Bob is about 5 years old, so I figure she's probably got at least another good ten years in her.  So, you Sojos people are going to have to keep making this nip for at least another 13 or 14 years, just to be on the safe side. It's not my fault, it's y'all who've created a monster.<br /><br />P.S. Bob loves you guys, and if she could have kittens, she'd name them after you.
