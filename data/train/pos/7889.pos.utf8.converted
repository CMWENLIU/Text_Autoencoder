I fortunately bought the MINI version of this off their website and am so glad I did! I will probably ONLY buy it in this form as it is super easy to push out of the tube. (I only note this as reading other reviews regarding the pump) The product smells exactly like their Tahiti line of body products; which makes me happy every time I use it. (sort of like vanilla coffee) I have noticed a huge difference in my eyes and am really thankful for this product. My small lines seem to disappear and the product sinks right into my under eye area. I even put it on the eyelids. I swear my under eyes look brighter and I don't even need to use my concealer! I had been using Origins similar product to no avail and decided to try this. SUPER GLAD I DID! I would recommend it in the small version (cheaper too!) to try it out. I love 100% Pure and all their products!
