I am a big fan of Frontier already, but when I received these flowers, I was amazed. You can tell just by looking at them that nothing else has been done to these flowers except drying. The leaves are still in tact and the wonderful color makes holiday tea packs I've made bright and vibrant.<br /><br />This chamomile has worked wonders on taking the excessive bitterness from some black teas. I just mixed 3 parts black tea with 1 part of this chamomile and the quality of the tea changed drastically.<br /><br />I was nervous about getting the 1 lb. bag, but there is hardly any tea I drink now without adding a few of these flowers. It really adds a smoothness to all teas. In addition, I brewed down some of the flowers and used the tea to cut some of the nastiness out of homeopathic medicines I make. It worked really well and also adds the nice calming effect of chamomile to medicines.<br /><br />These are VERY high quality flowers and I have really enjoyed them.
