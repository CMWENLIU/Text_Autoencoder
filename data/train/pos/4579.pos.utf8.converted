We used to be able to purchase Spiced Peaches anywhere around the holidays but not anymore. At least in Colorado. This year I thought "Why not check Amazon" To my surprise we found these. They were deleivered quickly and were quite tasty! Thanks for a great product and we will be back again! Happy Holidays!
