I could not get the quick barley at Albertson's so turned to the internet.<br />Although 12 boxes is a lot of barley, I was able to sell some of them to friends for cost at $3.17 each, which includes the S & H. Also a local grocer dealing in organic foods took a couple of them.<br />Putting barley in any soup home made or canned adds a flavor I really like, so in two weeks I have used up one 11 ounce box already. It only takes 10 minutes heating the soup with the barley to cook it, either in the microwave or on the stove.<br />Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, mmmmmmmmm.<br />R
