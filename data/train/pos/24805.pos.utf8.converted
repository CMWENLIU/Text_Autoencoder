The Extend "Chocolate Delight" bars are probably the best low carb snack bars I have tried since becoming diabetic. While the Atkins bars are generally very good, these taste even better and also do seem to control my blood sugar longer.<br /><br />These bars have 150 Calories each, 12g of Protein, and only 1 Net Carb. The high protein load really helps to control my hunger,  making this a great snack for mid-day munchies or after workout "pick me up", as well as a bed time snack.<br /><br />One note of caution, these do have Maltitol which can cause "gastric distress" in some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
