I've had Kashi cereals in the past and this was certainly the crunchiest of them all. Kashi managed to perfectly sweeten this cereal just the way I like and I found this cereal to be extremely filling. When I eat other brands as a meal I normally feel like I need to eat two bowls, but with Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! I was very satisfied with less than a bowlful. I find this cereal is best when I let it sit in the bowl of milk for about 5 minutes before eating it to soften the crunchiness a bit. The grains were full size and easily identifiable in each cluster.
