Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder has been a must-have for me from the very first time I tasted it. Forget about the adulterated, irradiated cinnamon powder that lines the shelves in the supermarket. After having done my own extensive research I discovered that organic Ceylon cinnamon is by far the best. Of all the varieties of  cinnamon Ceylon cinnamon is the one that provides health benefits. I was happy and relieved to discover Indus organic Ceylon cinnamon powder here at Amazon. It is certified organic plus the flavor is exceptional. I enjoy it with my favorite snack of 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, fruit and nuts. To that combination I add 1 1/2 teaspoons of this product. It tastes absolutely delicious! It adds a subtle sweetness without the calories, of course, and is much better for you than artificial sweeteners. Experiment to find out how much or how little cinnamon you may require on your sweet potatoes, apples, winter squash, etc. For example 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder is just the right amount to sprinkle over one sliced apple.  Also it is great in recipes in which cinnamon is an ingredient. Additionally, each packet lasts for a long time while it maintains freshness. I am a loyal customer of Indus and highly recommend the Indus Organic Ceylon Cinnamon Powder.  Enjoy!
