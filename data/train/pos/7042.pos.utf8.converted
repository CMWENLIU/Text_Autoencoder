You have to try this juice! I love pink grapefruit for its intestinal cleansing and weight controlling effects on my body. Even in California, though, it is not always available. Here is a non-alcoholic cocktail that is exciting to behold, then imbibe. In a stemmed water goblet place some cracked ice, then cover with this juice nearly to the top. Also have on hand Lakewood Organic PURE Black Cherry or Lakewood Organic PURE Concord Grape Juice. Pour the dark juice down one side of the goblet. The effect is that the dark juice goes to the bottom, but swirls throughout when you tip the glass to drink. This keeps the two flavors separate but complementary. I feel as special when I drink this, as I have whenever having drunk a 20 year old port! Once you have tried Lakewood's Organic PURE Juices, you won't want to spend your money on anything else. BTW: Whole Foods doesn't carry the Pink Grapefruit, but Amazon PRIME does!
