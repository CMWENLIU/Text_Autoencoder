I have been looking for a good source of living moss for my orchids. I had tried the expensive moss milkshake products and all I wound up with was an expensive science project. No moss, just mess. Then I found this product. At less than one tenth the cost it is clean and easy to use. I am really happy with the product and the seller was first rate too. I will definitely be buying more in the future. If you like to grow moss with your orchids, check out the kyoto moss spores.
