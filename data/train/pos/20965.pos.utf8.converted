I've been using this product since the early '70's, and when it disappears from the grocer's shelves I get upset as a baby who wants his pablum! I'm glad it's available online. Buckwheat is closest to animal protein of all the grains, and the grain in its various forms has been a staple in Europe and Asia. The cereal cooks quickly and can be used in a variety of recipes. Best of all, it's a tasty alternative to wheat, oats and rice. You've probably had kasha, made from the roasted groats which have a strong, nutty flavor. Cream of buckwheat is bland, I mean good-bland, because it won't turn off the kids and lends itself to various sweeteners. Though it's not shown on the Cream of Buckwheat box, it works as an "instant" bowl of hot cereal: Follow the measuring directions for a single serving, put in a microwaveable cereal bowl 1/4 c. cereal to 1 1/4 c. water. Microwave on MEDIUM (I use power # 6 or 7 of 10) for 4 min., interrupting once or twice to stir. Important: Do not cook on high, or the mixture will boil over! If you need to cook longer than 4 min., make sure you reset the power for medium. If desired, add milk (I use soy) and sweeten (I like maple syrup).
