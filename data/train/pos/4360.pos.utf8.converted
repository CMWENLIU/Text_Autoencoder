House shichimi togarashi (7 flavored pepper spice) is a very popular brand of seasoning and this distinct little red glass jar is often found on countertops in ramen shops and izakayas across Japan and the US. It is an excellent spice to sprinkle on top of ramen, fish, grilled chicken skewers, okonomiyaki, and any other food you'd like to add a little fire to.<br /><br />Shichimi doesn't just bring heat. It adds texture, flavor, and a small amount of added nutrients from the seeds in the mixture. Shichimi in Japan usually contains hemp seed as one of the 7 ingredients, which gives the spice a good crunch. For export to the US, this ingredient has been replaced. Aside from that, this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite.<br /><br />Be sure to put the cap back on tightly after use so that no moisture gets into the bottle. When that happens, the powdered ingredients will start to stick together and become difficult to shake out of the hole.
