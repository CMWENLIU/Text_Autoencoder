I used to use the original Mini Thins on occasion for energy boosts (I'm not really a coffee person) and I was skeptical about this "new" product that they make, however, I took one in the morning before class and had a pleasant energy boost without coffee jitters (200 mg per pill which is about 2 cups of coffee) I don't know if it is the caffeine, bitter orange peel, ginseng, etc combonation that does it, but it works for me and works well! I will definitely order this again! :-)
