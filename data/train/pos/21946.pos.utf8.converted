A few days ago I was posting some rather disparaging comments about Grace Hot Sauce. This sauce<br />however, blows its baby brother away with a raw, firey Scotch Bonnet flavor. This is about as basic<br />as you can get, though it does seem to straddle the line a bit between hot sauce and condiment. When<br />the sweet Jamaican smoke is cleared, however, this is a great hot sauce that's made to be enjoyed.<br /><br />Scotch Bonnets are relatives of habaneros, but if habaneros are the serious, hard working pepper plugged<br />into so many independent American hot sauces, Scotch Bonnets are their laid-back island cousin, just as<br />hot but more relaxed and sweeter leaning more towards spice and flavor. Scotch Bonnets would rather look<br />silly and taste tropical than merely kill you with heat. This sauce, a colorful yellow, is Grace's best<br />condiment by a long shot. The simple mashing of Scotch Bonnets, with some slight flavor accentuators<br />really captures the heat of the islands and flavor of a solid hot sauce.<br /><br />In the description on their website, Grace promises a challenge. "Add a drop or two to food for a truely<br />serious pepper experience," though heat freaks may need to up this number by a few shakes of the bottle.<br />This sauce does have a minor tropical blast which won't floor you at once, but provides a long lingering<br />burn cycle that will continue as long as you keep eating the sauce....and you will. However, still be able<br />to taste your food and thats a plus in a world of dangerous, murderous sauces lurking around every corner.<br />It's hot enough to hang with some of the bad boys, but the flavor outshines the heat in the end.<br /><br />Sweet, rich, hot, and delicious, this sauce will absolutely not disappoint. The double-punch of cane vinegar<br />and cane sugar/citric acid give the sauce fruity tropical hints and a tangy, acidic flavor. The sauce becomes<br />tricky when you factor in the fact that it contains modified starch and ascorbic acid. These ingredients thicken<br />the sauce, gelling it a bit so that it seems like crushed peppers in a sauce the consistency of a heavier BBQ<br />sauce. This is not a bad thing at all, but be prepared to feel like you're eating a hot sauce masquerading as a<br />thick condiment. Flavor is spot on, but consistency is a bit unnatural for a traditional hot sauce.<br /><br />I love this sauce on cold pizza and pizza crust and smoked turkey sandwiches, just to name a few. However,<br />because it has such a bright, sunshine taste, I think it can accentuate other Caribbean dishes which tend to<br />use jerk spice (also made from Scotch Bonnets). If you have a sandwich with sweeter ingredients, this sauce is<br />for you. Also a great tag team partner for mango or pineapple salsas. 5 Scovies!
