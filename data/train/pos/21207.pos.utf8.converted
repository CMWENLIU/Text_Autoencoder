When I found these soft, chewy candies covered with sugary beads, all in red and deep purple raspberry colors at a grocery outlet five years ago, I ended up purchasing 25 bags.  I generously shared them with almost all my close friends and they loved them.  Then they seemed to disappear from all the stores I scoured; my friends accused me of hoarding and not sharing.  I carefully rationed the three bags I had saved, but they finally ran out and I spent a year trying not to accept that they may have been discontinued by the manufacturer. I eventually succumbed to temptation and searched the internet for the manufacturer; and Eureka! there they were and for sale on Amazon.  Thinking everybody else had forgotten about the existence of these little gems of raspberry candy, I only ordered 2 5-pound bags. I immediately gave a jarful to my brother and a neighbor who wasn't feeling well and so on until it is almost time for me to order another 10 pounds.  If you like mouth-watering raspberry flavor in a bite sized jewel that melts gradually until you surrender to the urge to chew up the last bit, you'll love these.  Just be sure you don't order the whole supply; that you leave some more for me.
