Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.  Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control fit my family's needs, but you should make sure you really look at the different products' nutritional information.  You can compare Quaker's products on their website: [...].
