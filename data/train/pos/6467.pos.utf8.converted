These are the best brownies I've ever made or eaten, in a long life as devoted<br />chocophile! I am a baking snob, and normally never use cake mixes of any kind.<br />I did use popular brownie mixes during many years as PTA volunteer, Room-mother<br />for three, Cub Scout leader, and Swim Team mom; but even though I added extra<br />vanilla, chocolate chips, and espresso powder, the chocolate flavor was always bland<br />and disappointing, or the brownies were like little squares of unexciting chocolate<br />cake. Later, I spent years searching cookbooks and experimenting with new recipes<br />each time I baked brownies, looking for the best possible, fudgey, deeply chocolate,<br />truly satisfying homemade brownie recipe.<br />  Then I discovered Dassant Belgian Truffle Brownie Mix, and I was an instant convert!<br />This mix is as good as any homemade from scratch recipe, and better than most.<br />These brownies are deep, dark, luscious, decadent. The only problem is that everyone<br />will want the recipe, so you'll have to admit you used a mix ;-)<br />  Tip: try spreading a thin layer (about 1/4 cup) of seedless red raspberry jam between<br />two layers of batter before baking. Sheer heaven!
