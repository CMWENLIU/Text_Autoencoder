This company makes delicious nori snacks and I am willing to say I think eating nori feeds your brain at least a little. Of course it feeds your body. Anyway this delicious salty sweet snack is in little shreds like big sawdust and basically is as inelegant to eat in front of another person as onion soup au gratin on a first date. HOWEVER. I love it. Maybe the best weird vegetarian kind of sweet snack I have ever tried. TONS of packaging, that is kind of non-green but it does keep the product pristine and CRISP. WORTH EVERY CENT.
