Some other reviewer wrote that the agave nectar is 60 calories per teaspoon and that is an error. The bottle actually says 60 calories per tablespoon and since there are 3 teaspoons in a 1 tablespoon, agave nectar actually has 20 CALORIES PER TEASPOON. I only wanted to point this out because it would be a shame if that previous misinformation stopped someone who would otherwise try this wonderful product. Another reviewer thought the light agave nectar tasted like butterscotch...I don't agree; I think it just has a pleasant sugar-like sweetness with no after taste.
