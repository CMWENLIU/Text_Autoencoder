I have 2 retrievers (7 months and 1 year) and they are basically 60 pounds of raging teeth.  They destroy virtually every dog toy (not to mention legos, briefcases, shoes, ethernet cables, small trees, socks, ... you get the picture)  that comes through the house in about 10 minutes.  They have never been interested in Kongs and rawhides just only hold their attention for so long.<br /><br />I found these at the store last week and bought a couple.  My dogs won't leave them alone.  They love the "snack balls" that come in them and they withstand hours and hours of chewing.  Even my 13-year-old sheltie who doesn't even like chew toys likes these things... My only complaint?  The petsmarts in my area can't keep them in stock so I have to order online.<br /><br />If your dog/puppy is a chewing machine... get these toys... lots of them... keep them in the crate, the living room, anywhere your dog hangs out.  The shoes you save may be your own!<br /><br />BTW, to get them interested, you want to find something soooooooo doggie delicious for the inside... give your dog a taste and smell of that before you stuff it in the middle.  Then stuff it in the middle and put the "caps" on. also, be sure to let the caps "dry" before giving them to your dog or the caps pop right off (you have to moisten them to make the pop in easier)
