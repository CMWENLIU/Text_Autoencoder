I love having this product on hand.  I can't tell you how much is saves me both in money and time to be able to mix up whatever amount of buttermilk I need for a recipe.  I even add it to my chocolate chip cookies...makes them snappy!  I also keep the powder cheese (not sauce)on hand for cheese popcorn and I add a bit with milk to leftover mac and cheese when reheating.  My kids can't tell they're left overs.  What great money saving products.
