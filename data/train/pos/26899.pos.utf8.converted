My husband and I are both American and were visiting a British friend who thought it would be funny to introduce us to "Marmite."  Well, as a teenager int he 80's, I'd been exposed to Men At Work, so anything that looks like THAT and ends in "mite" is suspect to me.  Now, the Aussies have Vegemite and the Brits have Marmite--each says his is superior.  We are NOT talking about chocolate, here, remember.  So, much to the surprise and disappointment of our friend, my husbands eyes lit up and said, "Oh My GOD, what IS THAT? I LOVE IT"  So, being the nice wife I tend to be--I went looking for it and of course, only found it online.
