Ordered it 20th got it 22nd. Last time I bought a "brand" name 25oz. bottle for $9.99. Never again! $36.40 total for<br />a brand I like and enjoy. I thought I'd get this maybe by this Friday. I am seriously empressed by the turn around of this order. Well packaged for shipping, double bubble and plenty of peanuts! And most important... Mmmm good!
