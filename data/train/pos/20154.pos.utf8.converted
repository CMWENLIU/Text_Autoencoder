Someone gave our office a box of this chocolate at Christmas time. The box sat over a shelf with a light under it and it softened a bit. I noticed it, being a chocolate lover, and I was the first to opon the bag inside. I managed to extract a piece of soft warm chocolate and tried it. My knees went weak, my eyes rolled back in my head. I wanted to run off with the entire box and live with it on a tropical island. Once opened,  we were all amazed at this product and couldn't stop making reference to our reactions to tasting it. One woman said her reaction reminded her of the quote from When Harry Met Sally "I want what SHE's having". Don't make me say more, it's that good.
