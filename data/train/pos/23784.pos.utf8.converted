What a joy when I read about that!  The only problem is finding a way to add chocolate to my diet without all the extraneous sugars that are NOT so healthy.  In the past I have tried various higher percentage chocolates and found the Scharffen Berger bars to be excellent, so when I decided to get some cocoa powder this is one of the three I decided to try.<br /><br />For my purposes I have been mixing it in with a small amount of dairy to add to coffee.  Turns out this makes an excellent chocolate coffee.  I do the mixing at the bottom of the cup and spend some needed time making sure it's blended, and then add the coffee after that.  Very good and I get to call it healthy.<br /><br />Using the unsweetened powder allows to add only the barest sweetner of choice--suit to taste so to speak.<br /><br />The other thing I've used it for is to mix up a bit of cream, the chocolate and a tiny bit of Splenda...blend it up in a bowl with a spoon until it thickens a bit and then it's a great strawberry dip.  Again, I pretend this is health food--and really as desserts go, it's not so bad if you are more interested in the science behind carbs vs fats (but that is a whole different topic).<br /><br />In any case, of the unsweetened chocolate poweders I've tried so far...this one is the best product in terms of taste when making my coffee--it's good enough to keep me away from the coffee shop where the drinks are pricey and full of sugar.<br /><br />Recommended!!<br /><br />JTG<br /><br />eta: this is not 'dutch processed' so the healthy benefits remain intact.
