Product 19 is a great cereal, but it's really hard to find.  I even checked Kellogg's website and found they don't sell it within 35 miles of my city - and I live in a pretty major city.  After years of browsing the cereal aisle, my husband found this online and ordered the first set for me.  I'm really picky about cereal.  I don't like the real sugary cereals or the "full of fiber" cereals.  This is a great cereal for someone that wants a good basic cereal.  It tastes great and is healthy.  My co-workers think it's funny that I ordered my cereal off of Amazon, but it's really good, I've been looking for it for a long time, and  now that's one less thing I have to go to the grocery store for.  Plus if your order is over $25, you get free shipping.
