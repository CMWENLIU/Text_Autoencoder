I have used this product for years and would be lost without it.  It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock, but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes, rice, etc.  It is very handy for the "flu" season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup.  For those times, I make a cup of chicken broth using this product.  Sometimes, I add leftovers from the fridge... rice, vegies, chicken.  The other flavors are also very handy... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire.
