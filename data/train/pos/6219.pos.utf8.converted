There's nothing Plain Jane about the performance of this product. The aroma and flavor are heavenly, mouth-wateringly vanilla-y as soon as I open the bottle. It's a good value. As another reviewer said, you need only 1/4 teaspoon of powder for every 1 teaspoon of liquid extract called for in a recipe. Or, if you're like me and always add more vanilla than the recipe calls for, use as much as a 1/2 teaspoon per teaspoon, and your baked goods will taste decadent!<br /><br />One thing I especially appreciate is the strong vanilla flavor without the alcohol of liquid extracts, which allows me to use the powder in uncooked creations, like smoothies, fruit salad, and as an unexpected accent in salad dressings.
