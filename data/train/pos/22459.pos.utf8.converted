Mind you, I am a kale chip fanatic! Started eating these things like there was no tomorrow when they first came out over 10 years ago (No, I am not a raw vegan, but eat plenty of raw foods). The wonderful thing about kale chips, in my humble opinion, is that they are a great portable "green" snack. Beware though, as they are somewhat high in fat due to the nut-based batter that coats them, but if your diet is low in fat (as mine is), then these are the perfect food. They are crunchy and filling.<br /><br />One other plus about Rhythm Foods packaging is that the package is resealable.<br /><br />Note that this flavor does contain a small amount of sugar. The ingredients are: kale, carrot, apple cider vinegar, tomato, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, beets, yeast powder, garlic, raw sugar, spices, sea salt, natural liquid smoke concentrate. (almost all ingredients are organic).<br /><br />All kale chips are pretty expensive and this one is no exception. A 2 oz bag is going to cost about $5! which believe it or not is pretty much the going price for this product. Anyway, this might be a good crossover product for those not familiar with raw foods, so give it a try--I mean how many awesome green leafy vegetable snacks are there out there? Kale chips definitely fall into that category--awesomely scrumptious!
