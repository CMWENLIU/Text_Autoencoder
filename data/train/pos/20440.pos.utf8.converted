Have you ever described a food as tasting "healthy" when you mean it tastes so bad it must be good for you? Fear not! It is pleasantly adaptable to use with any fruit on hand. I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive.
