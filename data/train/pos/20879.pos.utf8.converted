Last August we brought home a lhasa apso mix from a local shelter. He was a mess with shaggy, unkept fur and after we had him groomed, we discovered he was covered in scabs and hives. Several visits to the vet didn't get us any closer to figuring out what was causing the hives, but we thought it might be related to the food he was eating. We tried several different brands, from Eukanuba to Science Diet, but they all contained corn/grains, and the hives continued to get worse.<br /><br />Then we switched to a raw food diet, which immediately cured the hives and itchiness.  But raw food isn't practical when you're away from home frequently, like we are. Plus, I'm not convinced that a raw food diet gives my dogs all the nutrients they need to stay healthy.<br /><br />So we tried several different grain free brands and finally settled on the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free dry dog food. He loves it and he's been hives free for several months now.  We switch between the salmon and duck formulas.  An 11-pound bag lasts my two little dogs about a month.  Another nice side effect is that they smell better and their skin/coats are healthier.  My 11-year old chiweenie has more energy than she's had in a few years. Oh...and no more diarrhea or constipation - just nice, little turds that are easy to clean up.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is the same as what I'd pay at the local pet store and the shipping is free.  Saves me the price of gas driving to the store and lugging it home. I would highly recommend this dog food to anyone whose dog has itchy/smelly/scabby skin problems.
