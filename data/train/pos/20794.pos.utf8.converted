I have used the Danish Dessert for years.  I always got it at our IGA, and they went out of business.  I finally searched the web and found it through Amazon.  I used the strawberry for pies.  I never knew they made the raspberry until I found it on the web. I just add the fruit and put it in a pie shell.  It makes the best pie glaze that I have ever tasted.  My husband loves it.  I always keep a large supply on hand.  I would recommend this product for everyone.
