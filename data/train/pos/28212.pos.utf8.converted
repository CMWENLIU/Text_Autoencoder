I recently bought an El Paso Chile Co. margarita machine and also wanted to lose a little weight!!  Did a search for sugar free mix and found Baja Bob's.  I've gone through about 20 packages of the powder margarita mix and love it.  It is a touch tart but I tone it down with a lite diet Sprite and it makes a perfect margarita everytime! You won't be disappointed.  I have had regular (sugar) mix since and I prefer Baja Bob's.
