I've been buying dried blueberries from the grocery store for ages, and struggled everytime I had to buy a tiny bag that only lasted 2 days. I went online to see if I could find them in bulk, and low and behold...! I use these on everything: Spinach salads, cereal, yogurt, trail mix, even just to snack on plain. These blueberries are acutally better than the ones I was buying before, because they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Sugar is actually healthier and tastes better. I will buy these again and again.
