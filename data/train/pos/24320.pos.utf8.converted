I grew up on Alpen and it is still my favorite cereal after 30+ years of enjoying it!  It is very difficult to find so I am very happy that Amazon is selling it. Alpen has a light sweet flavor to it and a wonderful consistency. The almonds and raisins are not overbearing (I normally don't like either in anything, but for some reason they are great in Alpen!).  I highly recommend this cereal. Add fresh fruit for added tastiness.
