I never thought of Vietnam as a point of coffee growing. But on second thought, why not..it's very close to Indonesia and they have some wonderful brews. And the same is here!  This is  very smooth with a low acid taste. So it will roll across your tongue and not leave an after bite. There is even a hint of chocolate in the taste-very surprising! For me this is one of the more unusal island-type coffees I've ever tasted.A good find and nice to drink. A further note,if you go to the Trung Nguyen website, they sell a Vietnamese single cup coffee maker real cheap. It's sort of a cross between a french press and a melita single drip cone. If nothing else it's fun.
