I fell in love with Tortuga rum cakes during a cruise many years ago.  It is now a tradition for me to ship cakes to my family for Christmas.  I stuck with the original reciepe until this last Christmas.  I added the chocolate rum cake and the pineapple rum cake as presents.  I didn't get to taste the pineapple cake but my mom and brother who got to taste both strongly agreed that the pineapple was super moist and had more of a rum flavor than the original and the chocolate cakes.  Needless to say, they have place their orders for this year's Christmas.
