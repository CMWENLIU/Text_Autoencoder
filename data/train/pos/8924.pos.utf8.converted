I seldom write reviews, but this popcorn is so delicious I HAD TO! We pop it in the Presto Hot Air popper - it pops up huge, fresh and NO unpopped kernals. We melt some coconut oil and drizzle a small amount on popcorn, add sea salt - and the whole family raves it's the BEST POPCORN EVER! We'll never go back to non-organic after reading the concerns about toxins/chemicals on popcorn. And this it the best ever! We will go through the bags quickly as popcorn is now our new favorite nightly snack.
