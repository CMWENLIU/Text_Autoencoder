These lentils cook fast (25 minutes) and are truly delicious and smooth. You will need to rinse them well first. I often add to vegetable stews (I sautee onions, sweet potatoes, leeks--or other veggies, the combinations are endless--for a few minutes, then add water and the lentils. I add spices and then let this cook for 20 to 30 minutes on medium/low. Voila! Easy, and very healthy, nourishing, and above all, incredibly tasty. Bon appetit!
