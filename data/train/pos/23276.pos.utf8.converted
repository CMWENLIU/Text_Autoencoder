I opened my first pack of Leonidas chocolate to find them completely melted. I thought for certain I was out $40. I skeptically emailed the company through the amazon provided link expecting never to hear back. Not only did I hear back by later that evening, but the next day I had a new package of chocolate in Perfect Condition with no additonal charge. The Chocolate in and of itself is great, but I believe that good customer service, especially in this day and age, should be commended. I would highly recommend both the Chocolate and the company and will be doing business with them again.
