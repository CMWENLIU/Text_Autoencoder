I really like that we can buy organic canned white meat chicken. This is one of my pantry staples (to add to soups, to make chicken salad sandwiches, to dump on top of salads for protein.) Living in South Florida, this is also part of my hurricane prep--ready to eat, lowfat, organic protein, easy as opening a can.<br /><br />For those of us too lazy to cook our own chicken for lunch, this is a great help.<br /><br />And for those who can't eat tuna (like me, due to seafood allergy), mixing this with traditional tuna fish salad ingredients (relish, mayo, onions, carrots, celery) almost feels like I'm having tuna like in ye olde non-allergic days. :)<br /><br />I tend to rinse this with water before using due to the saltiness.<br /><br />I'm glad amazon has it, as my local supermarket sometimes runs out. The expiration date on my last two orders here were in late 2011 for the first and mid 2012 for the second, so these are not "ready to go bad any day" type of sale items.
