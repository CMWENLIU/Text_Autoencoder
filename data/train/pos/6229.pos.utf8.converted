My cats love this stuff!!!!!  I grow it in long window boxes along my sills and it does sprout and grow rather quickly.  If I could just get my one male cat to stop ripping the grasses up from the root and making a mess of soil, it would be perfect.  Nothing against the seeds...my cat just has terrible table manners.
