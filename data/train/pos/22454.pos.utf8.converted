I am hooked on toasted sesame seeds.  I toast them in my countertop oven and keep them in a small parmesan cheese shaker and use them on just about everything.  I was paying over two dollars an ounce by buying the McCormicks one ounce bottles so you can see buying in bulk this way is a very good thing.  Before I bought I was confused about whether I should get hulled or unhulled.  After researching I decided I wanted unhulled and so I choose this brand because everything I get from Bob's Red Mill is great.  When they arrived I was relieved to see they were just want I wanted, exactly the same as the McCormicks.  I allow myself two ounces of toasted sesame seeds per week.  A little goes a long way because the flavor is so intense.  I wanted to make some hummus and although I know it can be tasty without tahini I decided (since I have so much now) to toast and puree some sesame seeds and used about two tablespoons of the resulting thick peanut butter-like paste in the hummus along with some olive oil.  Best hummus I've ever made.  Update - I see the product description now includes a statement saying that the outer coating of these seeds has been removed.  So I guess these are hulled seeds then?  I don't know for sure but they are just like what is in the one ounce canisters of McCormicks.
