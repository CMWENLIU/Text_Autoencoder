Our family loves the White Grape flavor of Crystal Light. In fact, if it weren't for this flavor, some members of the family would have never drank Crystal Light at all. It has a great taste that's not too bitter and not too sweet.<br /><br />It seems like the availability of this flavor has been going through ups and downs for the last few years, with many people even claiming it was discontinued earlier. It wasn't discontinued then but I stumbled upon Crystal Light's official Facebook page where someone asked for a list of recently discontinued flavors. Crystal Light responded with a list and - lo and behold - White Grape was listed as a flavor that was discontinued as of November 2011. Here's a link to a screen shot of the post by Crystal Light for anyone who wants to see it - the post was made on Feb. 13, 2012: (...)<br /><br />After running into the post, I confirmed via the Crystal Light official website and White Grape is no longer listed as an available flavor in any quantity. So it looks like this great flavor, possibly one of the best Crystal Light had, is no more - sacrificed to market all the new "specialty" flavors.
