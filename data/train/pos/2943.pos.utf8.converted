I use Organic Valley Nonfat Dry Milk Powder for baking bread regularly. However, there is one simple rule you have to follow every time you bake with it. You need to always mix it thoroughly with other dry ingredients before you mix in the wet ingredients. Otherwise, you will get little hard lumps of dry milk that will never dissolve no matter how long you work on it. The consistency of the lumps is almost like raw rice that has been soaked in water. So, regardless what you bake, just remember to mix the milk powder with the rest of the dry ingredients very well. Even a little mount of milk powder that's missed in the mixing will give you some hard lumps. Mixing it in advance with water or other wet ingredients is not a good answer either. That's what happened to me when I tried to reconstitute it to the equivalent of a cup of liquid milk when I used it for the first time (my recipe calls for liquid milk). I ended up throwing 3 tablespoon of it and started over. I can't imagine how some people can use it for drinking or in coffee without having to chew or swallow lumps all the time. I can understand it for shakes or smoothies. If you have tips of how to reconstitute it free of lump, please share it.
