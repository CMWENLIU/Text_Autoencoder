Okay, so I'm a vegan, and I'm a baker and now that its cold, I become obsessed with this stuff.  It has 5g of protein in a serving, is unprocessed so you actually get the cacao benefit instead of Hershey crap, and honestly, its the best cocoa I've ever used.  Seriously.  The quality is unsurpassed and I cannot even begin to tell you how much you'll use it once you try it.  I make my hot chocolate with it!  Once you go natural cacao, you just don't go back.
