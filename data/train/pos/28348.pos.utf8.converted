Yogi Tea's Cold Season is superior to its respiratory remedial tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMIYWC">Yogi Breathe Deep, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>. While BOTH have eucalyptus, Cold Season accentuates the eucalyptus by combining it with cardamom, clove, and cinnamon (instead of the rather wimpy thyme and peppermint in Breathe Deep) Cold Season is very punchy. If your lungs feel clogged, drink this down! It's spicy and sweet!
