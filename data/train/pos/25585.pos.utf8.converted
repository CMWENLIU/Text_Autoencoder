Hey! If you have never tried adding Hemp seed to your diet you should. I started out with a smaller version of Manitoba Harvest Hemp Seed, but used it all in smoothies, salads, and various recipes quickly, so I upgraded to the 5 lb. bucket. It stores nicely in my outside frig. You can also store Hemp seeds in glass mason jars and freeze them. When you are ready for use, just open the jar and measure out the quantity you need.<br /><br />The taste of Manitoba's Hemp Seed is superior in my opinion. In fact, I have grown to love the taste of hemp. I always sprinkle a few tablespoons on my kale salads or in smoothies.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product especially if you are looking for more vegan ways to up your protein intake, as Hemp is an excellent source.
