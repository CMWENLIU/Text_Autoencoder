This box comes with a copious amount of candy with an abundance of flavors.  I personally don't like sour drops/lollipops so I didn't particularly like this set.  Most (maybe 9/12 pouches) have citrus or sour flavored candy that comes in assortments like Mango Tango, Watermelon, and Pomegranate Pucker.  So as such, I brought in the candies in a basket to the corner of my office desk and everyone drops on by to tell me how delicious they are.  It's relatively cheap so if you're working in an administrative position, this purchase might be an easy way to spark up conversations or get noticed around the office.  My personal favorites were Pomegranate and Root Beer.  If you're thinking of getting this candy for yourself, it is WAY too much for any ordinary sweet-toothed person to eat.  You WILL have to share or give them to family or friends.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great drop/lollipop pack for the price with very interesting (and unforgettable) flavors.  If you buy this particular box, you will have to share or give away various pouches unless you want to develop cavities.<br /><br />NOTE THAT THESE CANDIES ARE NOT SUGAR FREE, they are ONLY GLUTEN FREE for people with various disorders.  They are still very sweet (and sour).
