We have 6 dogs, all sizes, varieties & ages.  The oldest is 12 years old and the last several years, she has developed a spring/summer skin condition that causes her to itch and scratch and lose her fur.  She would lay on the floor next to us and chew and scratch to try to get some relief.  Her skin would get an oozing rash and she was miserable.  We tried different shampoos, lotions, steroid shots - anything to give her some relief.<br />My wife suggested she might have an allergy to the carbohydrates/gluten in her food that got worse in the south Texas heat.  We ordered a bag of the Blue Buffalo dry dog food and after the first feeding, she laid down next to us and did not scratch one time all evening.  Her fur has grown back and she no longer has the patches of nasty, smelly rash on her.  She now has energy to run up the stairs, run around in the yard and acts like she did as a puppy.  The change in less than a week is amazing!<br />We have ordered more Blue Buffalo for all 6 of our dogs and our cat. Their coats are shinier and their eyes sparkle more.  Thank you for making our pets healthier and happier.
