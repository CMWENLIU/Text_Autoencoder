I live in suburban Detroit and love Indian food. Unfortunately, the nearest Indian restaurant is probably 25 miles away from my home, which isn't real convenient. So when this Kitchens of India product was offered as a Lightning Deal from Amazon, I decided to take a chance on it. I was, however, very skeptical. How could something so simple produce great tasting Indian food at home? Well, I am skeptical no longer. I made this for the first time last night and was amazed at how easy it was. All you do is put your raw chicken pieces in a pot with some water, butter, and this product. Then you cook it for about 25 minutes. That's it. One pot and less than a half hour of cooking time. And let me tell you: While the taste of the finished product might not be exactly the same as that found in an authentic Indian restaurant, it's darn close. So close, in fact, that I'd be willing to bet that a lot of people couldn't tell the difference. I can't recommend this product any more highly. It will definitely satisfy my cravings for Indian food going forward! And you can bet that I'll be trying other Kitchens of India products soon! (Edit: One cooking suggestion that at least one other reviewer mentioned and I just recently tried... Add some chopped onions to the mixture for the last five minutes of cooking time. The onions make a great dish even better!)
