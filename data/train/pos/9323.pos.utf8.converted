This mix makes the best gluten free bread I have tried yet!  There is no "icky gluten free aftertaste" like so many other products out there.  I add a few squirts of honey, a hearty pinch of flax meal and make it in my bread machine every week for sandwiches.  Let the bread cool completely before slicing so it doesn't fall apart and you will be in heaven
