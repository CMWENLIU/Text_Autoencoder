I once found this item at almost every grovery store. Now, I have to drive almost an hour to a very large grocery store. I can't seem to ever buy enough to get me through the next trip to the big city. I order them 3 cases at a time now, and make sure I re-order before I'm dowm to my last case. ( They come 18 cans per case ) I sure would hate to go through life without thiis little treat. Almost every night I think about having a treat. I don't, because they woud be gone too soon. If you like canned fish snacks, you will love these. One of lifes great pleasures.<br />Enjoy........but I know you will!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KHMWQS">Polar Kipper Snacks, 3.53 Ounce Units (Pack of 18)</a>
