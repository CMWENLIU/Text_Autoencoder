When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton.  I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton.  Until now.  I am officially an Americolor convert.  These colors are so amazingly vibrant!  And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT.  They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again.  I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!
