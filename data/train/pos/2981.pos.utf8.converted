These treats really work!! My 4 year old Sheltie had a serious build up of plaque on her teeth when I got her two years ago.  The vet has been advising me to have her teeth cleaned while she is under anesthesia.  I saw "Check ups" and decided to try them.  My dog loves them, and best of all, after about two months there is hardly any plaque on her teeth.  I truly believe these treats saved me from the risk and expense of having my dog under anesthesia.  Plus, these treats are wheat gluten free so they don't aggravate my dog's allergies.
