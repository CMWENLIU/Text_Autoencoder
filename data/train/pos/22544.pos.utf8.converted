my cat began having digestive tract problems that my vet attributed to having a lack of fiber found in most cat foods. he also began having teeth & weight problems so she recommended increasing his intake of moist food, which have even less fiber than dry cat foods. i found this supplement at the petstore. i keep a measuring scoop in the bag & just mix it in w/his wet food, even my finicky other cat doesn't even notice the powder mixed in. there has never been a problem w/them getting sick from this supplement, like cat grass tends to make them puke, but it has improved both of their digestive tracts and makes me feel better about giving them more wet food since this adds the extra nutrients & fiber they need.
