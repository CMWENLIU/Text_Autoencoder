Quinoa is not only a fantastic whole grain and complete protein, it is delicious.  For those who love cereal, but are unable to eat wheat gluten, this is perfect.  The order arrived as requested, on time.  The packaging is minimal, which is a big plus for the environment and another indication of the attention to detail.  The bags are remarkable durable and the grain is fresh and wonderfully aromatic.  It has many uses and is good sweet and salty, spicy and even plain.  It is hard to find a multi purpose grain with no drawbacks I am aware of at least.  All good!
