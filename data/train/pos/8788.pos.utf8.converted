I had heard Mum Mums were a great finger food for babies so as soon as I got the OK from my son's pediatrician to start finger foods/teething biscuits, I purchased these.  I was a little worried about the fact that they were from China, but after doing some research, I found that the milk powder that Mum Mums contain is made in New Zealand and that the Organic Mum Mums do not even have milk powder as an ingredient (although the box does state that the product may contain trace amounts.)<br /><br />Anyway, my son loves to chew on these and play with them, and they don't make a mess like other teething biscuits.  They are easy for him to hold and manipulate.  I definitely recommend these over the other types of finger food and biscuits that you can get.<br /><br />I bought mine from Amazon (for a good price for six boxes) but I have also seen these at Babies R US.
