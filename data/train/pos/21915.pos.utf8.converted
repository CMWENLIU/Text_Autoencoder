I got these on a recent Jet Blue flight and were very pleased with them. They're crunchy like nachos, but have a meatier texture. The surface of the chip has lots of bumps and bubbles that you can see and taste. They add a nice mouth-feel and crunch to the overall experience of eating these chips.<br /><br />One bag has only 140 calories (35 from fat) and very low sodium (110 mg), so you can eat a whole bag without feeling much guilt. There are no artificial additives or preservatives in this product. The only comment I have is that the taste is a bit sweet because of added sugar. I prefer a stronger salt taste.<br /><br />Popcorners are also relatively hard to find. After having these on the flight, I looked for them at a local Boston supermarket. I only found Kettle, but none of the other flavors (butter, sea salt, white cheddar, cheesy jalapeno). An excellent and healthy snack.
