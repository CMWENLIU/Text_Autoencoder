This is great bread mix. I put it in my bread maker and it comes out delicious every time. I've found that using real butter helps it rise higher than margarine or oil. I've added different ingredients to make different types of bread. We especially like adding flax seed, rosemary, oregano and minced onion. Bread is a little pricey but so worth it. Fresh & no preservatives.
