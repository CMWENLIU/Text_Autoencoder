I'm a beef jerky, sausage, and all-things-meat junkie. So I figured I'd order some stuff in bulk off the net. These are pretty darn good. The trick is to let them hang in the open air for as long as you can resist eating them. The longer the better. I imagine letting them hang for a really long time (months) would be detrimental, but I never managed to let them hang for more than a week or 2. After the first week or so they hit their stride and are prime for eating.
