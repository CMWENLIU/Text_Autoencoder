Students, if you've ever had a three-hour seminar on the economics of the arts and cultural policy on Wednesday afternoons, you know how hard it is to stay awake while remaining discreet (and no, popping chocolate-covered espresso beans while drinking a Big Gulp's worth of iced coffee does not qualify as discreet).<br /><br />Well, embarrass yourselves no more. With Jolt Gum, you have a compact, easy-to-chew, easy-to-hide form of extreme caffeination.  Instead of seeing you as an obvious 'feine addict, your professors will regard you as some kind of Violet Beauregard on uppers.  Much better.<br /><br />Did I mention I love this stuff??
