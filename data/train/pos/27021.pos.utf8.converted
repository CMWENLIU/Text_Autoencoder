These crackers have a light corn bread flavor and texture. They are so good, I have to make sure to put the box away after serving or they will disappear. They are about an inch in size and are sturdy enough to hold a dip. They are fantastic to serve with chili or salsa.  As you can see from the picture of the front of the box, they have no trans fat.  According to the box, a serving of 30g (ab. 16 crackers)contains 3g total fat, 170mg sodium, 21 carbs, 4g sugar, 2g protein. The ingredients listed are: Enriched wheat flour, corn meal, vegetable oil, sugar, invert sugar syrup, whey powder, honey, salt barley malt extract, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, monocalcium phosphate.  In addition the box states the crackers contain milk, wheat, and may contain sesame seeds; and it says that they are suitable for Vegetarian Diets. Try them. I was surprised at how yummy they were.
