I am not a tea drinker but when it came to providing for a little 'healthy beverage' in my life, I was steeped in decision making as to what tea.  Amazon is my favorite place to shop these days and why not. The Hampstead Hibiscus caught my eye.  For a first time user, I can pat myself on the back for choosing a winner!  Good flavor for it's easy and mild to my taste without adding sugar, the color is a rich red, the quality seems supurb. The sachets of tea brew up nicely. Very satiifying - will look to other varieties from Hampstead.
