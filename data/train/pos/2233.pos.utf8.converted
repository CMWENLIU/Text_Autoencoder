I have suffered with arthritis for some time and found little natural relief.  I read that cherry juice could help and that some juices were better than others.  I'd tried some other kinds of cherry juice and got a little relief from my arthritis pain.  Then I tried this one and it is significantly better.  I love the taste of cherries and cherry juice and this is one of the best.  But to get the added health benefits, too, is wonderful.  Whether you want it for your health or the taste, you'll find this to be a great product!
