French sardines are so unlike sardines  in the U.S. and other places.  Much larger with a light, non fishy, taste.  The ConneTable brand is on the high side in both price and taste.  We have sampled sardines from all over Europe and these are easily  the best.<br /><br />Serve with a nice french bread and DO NOT discard the oil, it is part of the experience.
