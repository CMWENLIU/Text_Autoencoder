This product is amazing.  I cook it with onions and chicken broth, and then add anything I want.  Feta Cheese, bell peppers, pine nuts, lemon juice, olive oil, or I use it as regular pasta and add sauce and meat.  This is a delicious toasted pasta that tastes al dente and never mushy or over done, that can be used just like pasta, or just like cous cous, only much better.<br />Love it, and will always use it.  Leave it to the Israelies to come up with an awesome product!!
