I adopted a cat from the Humane Society that spent about a year in a cage hiding from prospective owners.  When I took her to the vet for her check up within a month of adopting her, I was told she needed her teeth cleaned.  (that was probably why she was only eating a few bites at a time of the Purina I was given with her adoption kit.)  Now she eats Innova cat food exclusively (now and then she gets a little bit of Merrick canned dog food as a treat when I feed the dog a little canned food as a treat).  I have to say that her appetite is terrific, her coat feels and looks a lot better and her stools are firmer when I scoop the "potty" box.
