These eggs are perfect for baking, but NOT for eating by themselves.  Use them for baking only and you'll love it.  I live in rural alaska where eggs are not easy to come by.  We keep a can in the fridge and it lasts us a year or two of baking.  We still use real eggs for omelets or fried egg sandwiches.  Also if you don't open the can until you need it they will keep forever, something like 7 years.  You can also buy these from honeyville grain's website.  They have flat $4.99 shipping anywhere in the lower 48 no matter how many items you buy.
