I have been buying coca tea and coca products for over a year and I love them! I was happy to see that I could buy at a cheaper price at Amazon.com from a different seller than Bolivia Stores but it was a nightmare, please be careful and aware of this facts:<br /><br />I order a coca tea box from Bolivia Exports, the package was very late and took over two weeks for arrival when I got used to the "less than a week USA shipping", this package was mailed directly from Bolivia and not from North Carolina where I usually get my coca products shipped from. I received a custom open package with green tape all over, tea bags where opened and ripped apart, the box was cut open all around and I can send as many pictures as required..... but the worse part is that with it , I got a Custom, DEA and FDA warning letters that the coca tea box was getting in the United States without licences for schedule II substances from a no registered seller for what it was a 100% illegal package from Bolivia that I needed to sign for and get my name as importer of ILEGAL GOODS; the product was not intended for human consumptions because it was not from a FDA certified location.<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called "Bolivia Stores" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licencing, FDA registered facilities and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US???<br /><br />I tried to save a few dollars and got a whole headache and lost every penny in a tea that cannot be drink
