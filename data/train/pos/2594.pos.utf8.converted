Nutiva's organic coconut oil is terrific. They press it from fresh coconuts, and I think that's what gives it the nice gentle fragrance and wonderful taste. I like the clear plastic jar it comes in. We've been using coconut oil for years and Nutiva tastes much better than the coconut oil from dried coconuts. I even spread it on crackers. Yummy!
