This brand of tuna well deserves all the 5 star reviews. It IS tasty tuna chunks w/ a small amt. of creamy pink juice that I used instead of squeezing out to make tuna salad.There is no fishy taste as it is more like fresh tuna. I compare this tuna to switching from box wine to bottle wine-once you make the leap to this tuna you will never want to go back to the typical grocery store variety or even the higher grade brands available on Amazon. The 3 brands I used to buy on Amazon were Polar's yellowfin steak, Natural Value's yellowfin, and Wild Oats light tongol, all packed in water. Until I tried this brand I was content w/ those brands. I just hope Amazon continues to carry this brand and it stays at this price point.
