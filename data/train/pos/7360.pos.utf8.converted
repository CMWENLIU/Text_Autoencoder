Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print.  Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala "Take the Skinheads Bowling" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic "II & III"; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them "scratching their heads out loud" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  "Camper Vantiquities", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: "Seven Languages" and the Harrison/Starkey composition "Photograph."  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper "phenomenon" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.  I hope it was helpful.  Rock on Comrades!!!
