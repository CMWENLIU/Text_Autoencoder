I first tried these tofu noodles on a whim.  They looked interesting, low-calorie, and fun to eat.  I am so happy I found these noodles!<br /><br />The noodles come in a pouch with water, and it is plenty for two people.  I drain out the water, add some fresh water, and microwave it in a bowl for 2 minutes.  They have a cool texture (like slippery ramen), and they have a very mild flavor.  I typically eat these noodles after adding some type of sauce and veggies.  Yummy!<br /><br />A warning:  when you first open the noodles, they smell strange.  VERY strange.  Almost so strange that you may not want to eat them!  Apparently this is normal (they are made with yam flour), and the package says to just boil them for 2 minutes to remove the smell.  After 2 minutes in the microwave, the smell really does go away!<br /><br />Overall, I love these noodles.  It is a low-cal, low-carb alternative to ramen noodles, and it has a lot of protein.  They are mild enough to mix with anything, and they are really easy to make.  Try it out and enjoy!
