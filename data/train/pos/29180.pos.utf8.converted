DISCLAIMER:  I do not work for Bear Naked or any of its subsidiaries or parent companies.  I am an normal consumer.<br /><br />This stuff is GREAT!  I was recently forced to go on a low-sodium diet due to congenital high blood pressure, and finding things with little to no sodium that actually taste good has been REALLY hard.  I picked the Bear Naked All-Natural Granola, Fruit and Nut last night and it is wonderful.  Its pleasantly sweet-not bland, and leaves a great aftertaste, unlike other natural granolas.  the fruit and nuts in it are fresh, even without preservatives.  Better yet, it has 0 (zero, none, nada) sodium!!  A little Bear Naked and some soy milk in the morning and I'm set.  I definitely will recommend this to all my family and friends.  Thanks Bear Naked!
