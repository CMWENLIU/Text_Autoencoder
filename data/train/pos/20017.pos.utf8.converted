Say bye bye to gritty GF flour!  I bought Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour based on the suggestion from a stellar book called Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts.  Her recipes call for a blend of Brown rice flour, Potato Starch(not flour), and Tapioca flour and all my recipes come out perfectly.  I supplied all the desserts for Easter and everyone raved about how GF baked goods are better that the original.  Well they hadn't tasted the trial and errors of previous mixes and flours.  So buy Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour and The Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts and no one will ever know you've baked GF unless you tell them.  P. S. I even received a call from my "Simon Cowell" friend the next day saying he couldn't stop eating the left-overs.
