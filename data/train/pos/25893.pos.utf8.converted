The cafeteria at my work serves this coffee along with the brand's Cinnabon and caffeine free versions.<br /><br />This coffee is fabulous!  Rich, full bodied, doesn't leave an aftertaste or acid reaction for sensitive stomachs.  Much to my surprise, the Organic blend has a smoother finish than the non-Organic blend.<br /><br />I only wish I had easier access to it in the stores.  Which is why I'm buying it here.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, try some and see for yourself.
