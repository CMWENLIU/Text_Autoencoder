I live in Puerto Rico and cannot find Thai food here, let alone ingredients.<br />I bought this and the red curry paste too. I had never made my own curry<br />before, but with the help of this, I made restaurant quality curry!  There is quite<br />a bit of product in the container, so it will last if refrigerated.  Watch the shipping<br />costs from outside vendors. They will not combine shipping in some cases.
