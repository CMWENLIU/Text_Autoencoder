For some of us who cannot drink coffee or do not wish to ingest caffeine this healthy drink is the answer.  The powder  version is very good, but I prefer the crystals.  This beverage can be prepared black or milk/cream/Half andHalf added.  Also can be prepared as a cold drink.  When I decided to stop drinking coffee for health reasons, I was looking for a product that would satisfy me.  I tried other brands of coffee substitute but Cafix did the job.I highly recomended.
