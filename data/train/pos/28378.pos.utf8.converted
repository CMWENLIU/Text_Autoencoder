Quality is great, price is astounding.  No irradiation symbol on the bottle so I assume it is not irradiated, which is important to me.  I use cinnamon fairly heavily in oatmeal, waffles, yogurt, etc., so the ability to get a good quality cinnamon at a bulk price is greatly appreciated.  Thanks Taste Specialty and Amazon!
