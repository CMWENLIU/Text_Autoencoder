Original review: This is a good quality product and a great value, but the bag I got was a little stale. When I open the packages of other brands, I get a noseful of fresh peppermint aroma and that is missing here. Davidson needs to use  more sophisticated packaging to keep it fresh. How about something similar to the bags coffee comes in, instead of a paper bag with a folded over top?<br /><br />Update April 2011: Davidson's has upgraded their packaging to a zip-top bag with a foil barrier, and the difference is amazing: intense peppermint aroma and rich flavor. Excellent.
