Kukicha is NOT and never has been green tea!  It is the stems and twigs of the tea plant picked when the caffeine is lowest and the calcium is highest in the plant.  It is a rich brown color with a woody slightly astringent flavor.  I find nothing more soothing than a cup of this kukicha tea and carry the tea bags everywhere I go.  I also use it if I begin to get a sty on my eye.  I brew a strong cup, soak a washcloth in it and apply it warm to my eye.  The sty is usually gone in a few hours.
