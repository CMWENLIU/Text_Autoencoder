This item works a little too well in fact.  The little sticky traps are covered so I actually need to order more!  They work well because you are able to push them as far down into the pot as you need to unlike other traps you would just hang in the general area.  They seem to be helping control our gnat problem though I would recommend a pesticide to go along with them.  The sticky paper helps cut down on the number of flying adults but eggs still exist in the pot that need to be taken care of as well.
