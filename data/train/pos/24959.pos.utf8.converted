These noodles are traditional for sukiyaki but work well as oriental noodles or even chicken soup noodles. And made of tofu, they won't add carbs to your diet. I find I cannot eat processed starch--upsets my stomach, so these are a total lifesaver. And the slightly slippery soft texture is soothing. Love'em.
