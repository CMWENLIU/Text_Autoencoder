since 2006 , due to graveyard shift work, I have not slept sans pills ( sominex, xanaz, and ambian) everyday for the past 5 years. I was greatly surprized when I drank a bottle of neuro and was dead to the world in 30 minutes! Since then I have ordered a case. and , although expensive, what price can one put on sleep? I hope it proves the test of time, because I hate sleeping pills!
