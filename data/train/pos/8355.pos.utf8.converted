Wow, I've gotta admit: I thought these KIND Madagascar Vanilla Almond bars were just gonna be some regular ol' bars when I ordered them from Vine. Boy, was I wrong. These aren't a bunch of ingredients blended together and they aren't held together by some outer opaque coating. Instead, the ingredients are all right there for you to see while you're eating each bar. There are only 10 ingredients in these things, including almonds, peanuts, cashews, walnuts, honey, non GMO glucose, chicory root fiber, crisp rice, Madagascar vanilla, and soy lecithin. Notice anything about those ingredients? That's right, they're all PRONOUNCEABLE and stuff you've actually heard of! That means you can feel good about what's in these because you aren't putting a bunch of chemicals or fillers in your body. And you know what else? The nutrition facts are pretty great as well! Only 210 Calories per bar (just slightly high), 16 grams fat (I'm assuming this is due to the nuts because there are only 2 grams of saturated fat), only 14 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and last but not at all least only 4 grams of sugar. Yeah, in a time when pretty much everything we eat is packed with sugar, each of these bars only has 4 grams of it! They've also got various percentages of a bunch of different vitamins and minerals. And on top of everything, these are really tasty. This is one of the few food items I've tried from Vine that I do plan to purchase more of when I run out.<br /><br />If you want a food bar that has decent protein and fiber and isn't loaded with sugar AND only has ingredients you've heard of, I wholeheartedly recommend the KIND Madagascar Vanilla Almond bars!
