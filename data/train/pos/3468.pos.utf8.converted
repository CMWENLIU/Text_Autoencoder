We owned a Saeco Vienna Deluxe since January 2004, but decided to purchase a newer model in September 2010.  The Vienna Deluxe served us well for six and a half years, but was beginning to show its age.  The Saeco Vienna Plus is the updated version of the Vienna Deluxe.<br /><br />Saeco's Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use.  Add up to 57 oz filtered cold water to the reservoir, up to 12 oz beans in the hopper, and then turn the machine on.  While warming up, adjust the volume dial for a 1 to 6 oz pour. Once ready, press the coffee button once to make an espresso or twice for a double shot or two espressos.  If a latte is desired, press the steam button after the espresso has finished brewing and turn the steam knob to activate the pannarello to steam the milk.  Turning the steam knob without pressing the steam button will produce hot water from the pannarello instead.<br /><br />The perfect espresso may require adjusting a couple dials in the hopper. A strength dial controls the amount of grounds used per cup.  A second knob controls the grind's coarseness. These settings are typically adjusted once then left alone if you chose to alter the factory setting.  The factory settings work well for us, so we didn't adjust these controls.<br /><br />Maintaining and cleaning the Vienna Plus espresso machine is just as simple.  Cleaning consists of a weekly (or after every 15 pucks) wipe down of the machine, rinsing off the brew group with warm water, and emptying and washing the drip tray and grounds drawer.  Incidentally, the used coffee grounds are beneficial to soil when spread out in the gardens or lawn.  Once every three months, running descaler through the boiler keeps the inner workings in good condition.<br /><br />A common complaint about Saeco Vienna espresso machines is the outer plastic cabinet.  The durable plastic cabinet was not a problem for us on the old machine, as it didn't chip, crack, or break with normal use.  The Veinna Plus uses the same plastic material for the outer cabinet, and is probably used to keep the cost down.  The internal workings, like the stainless steel boiler, are hidden from view and use more expensive materials.<br /><br />Another complaint I've read about is the grinder getting clogged.  Our local coffee shop advised us not to purchase oily beans like many flavored coffees.  If you enjoy flavored coffee, add syrup to the cup instead.  Choosing the right beans, and regular cleanings has kept us from experiencing this problem.<br /><br />Compared to the Vienna Deluxe, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine has an updated look, but operates the same and is similarly sized.  However the Vienna plus is quieter, and the pannarello has been improved for easier and more consistent frothing.<br /><br />Ultimately, the Vienna Plus super-automatic espresso machine is simple to use and maintain; plus produces a great tasting espresso and Americano.  If you're looking for a fully automatic espresso machine, this one is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Fresh quality coffee made at the press of a button<br />Makes consistently great tasting coffee/espresso<br />Simple to use<br />Easy to clean/maintain<br />Biodegradable waste is great for the garden<br /><br />CONS:<br />This espresso machine is sure to spoil its owners<br />Cannot handle large quantities quickly
