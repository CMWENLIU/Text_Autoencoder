I have one cat who is really not into canned food at all - unusual, I know. But, I put down a can of Merrick's 'California Roll' and she totally ignored the dry food that I had mixed with her favorite treat, Kitty Kaviar (fish flakes) and dove into the canned. I think she ate close to the entire can by herself, in fact, purring like crazy the entire time!<br /><br />If you have a picky eater, try this food. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised! Oh, and this really doesn't smell (icky) like your typical canned cat food, either.
