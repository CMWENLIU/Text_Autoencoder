I'm a total chile head and have been enjoying hot sauces for many many years.  I even grow my own peppers and make my own sauce.<br /><br />However, this particular sauce is my favorate for a habanero.  It's got great flavor, tremendous heat, and goes great with most foods, especially fried chicken IMO.<br /><br />If you've not tried this one yet, do yourself a favor and get it.  A little goes a long way and this will raise your tollerance for all things hot.<br /><br />Oh, and the best part is this isn't some science experiment extract (none of which are cool in my book) this stuff attains it's heat and flavor without cheating.  Excellent craftsmanship went into creating this stuff.
