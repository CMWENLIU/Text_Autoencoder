A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.  After several cups, one begins to contemplate that there might be an even darker, more fulfilling blend out there somewhere, perhaps being plucked from deep within a jungle or rain forest, or the side of a volcano.  Perchance there is, but until that is discovered, I must continue to let the magic wash across my taste buds, and deal with the sadness that follows the completion of a cup, knowing that the next cup has yet to be poured.<br /><br />Salut.
