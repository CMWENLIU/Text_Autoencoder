I really recommend this noodle.  It is very delicious... My family's favorite is still the original flavor and not other spicy or shrimp flavor.  Just boil, once it's softened strain the noodle then mix with the seasoning.  The smell is so aromatic.  The packing is misleading though cause people might think there're additional ingredients other than the seasoning itself.  Normally we'd boil the frozen mix vege together with the noodle and fry some eggs to accompany it.  My toddler loves this noodle.  You can buy an individual pack at 99 ranch grocery store.
