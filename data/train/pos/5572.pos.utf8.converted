I love these pine nuts in my favorite cookies. They are usually in almond pastries and cookies at bakeries.<br />I always get Diamond brand, if I can because they're cheaper.<br />They have a nice delicate taste and I eat the bag very quickly.I savor the taste, but they're so tiny that they're swallowed the second they're chewed.<br />I haven't kept them long enough to use in recipes and that's my only problem with this.
