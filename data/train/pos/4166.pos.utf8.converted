I was very disappointed in the "regular" Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp, dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes.  I was wary of Nylabone products after that, but the durable ones have turned out to be great, and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones, but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down, but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs, the toys are missing their heads, but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things.
