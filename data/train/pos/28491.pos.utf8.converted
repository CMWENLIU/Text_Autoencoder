This is my favorite milk and sugar tea.  It is lovely, mellow and malty, full bodied without bitterness.  My husband, who used to say all tea tastes like wet cardboard, had to admit this tea is full of pleasant flavors.  This tea is designed for milk tea people.  Because it is the best tea for milk tea people does not mean it is the best tea for all tea people everywhere, tea has many different faces.  Mr. Assam Tea made some unfair, and I would say untrue criticisms of this tea.  I'm sure he was disappointed, but I suspect his disappointment was not a question of quality but rather of having selected the wrong product - wishing for apples and accidentally purchasing oranges.
