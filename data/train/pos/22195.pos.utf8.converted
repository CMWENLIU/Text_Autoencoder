I already had a  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4TL8E">Keurig K-cup Storage Drawer Coffee Holder for 36 K-cups</a> that I use for my DECAF coffee, tea, k-cups so I decided to invest in a spinner for my favorites. I LOVE IT!!!!! The Black spinner is very nice, you'll be very happy if you purchase this Carousel.<br /><br />PROS-<br />- 35 k-cups fit<br />- Spins smooth<br />- small and skinny<br />- makes the k-cups very inviting<br /><br />CONS-<br />- I haven't found anything wrong with it, LOL.
