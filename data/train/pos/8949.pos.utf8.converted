This is an exquisite thick, sweet, aged balsamic vinegar. When I traveled to Rome this spring, I was hoping to buy aged balsamic vinegar.  Actually, considering the exchange rate, the price through Amazon is better than buying in Italy.<br /><br />Given its sophisticated taste, you need just a little to make a huge difference in the taste of whatever food you decide to pamper.  If you have only experienced watery supermarket balsamic vinegar, you will be in for a wonderful treat with Fattoria Estense.
