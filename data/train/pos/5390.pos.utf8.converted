I buy from Honeyville often and I love them! Their shipping is always a flat rate. They have monthly special deals. And their products are TOP QUALITY at prices that are amazingly competitive. I can get lesser-quality products of poor freshness locally from our overrated health food store, or I can go online and receive delivered to my door, almond meal (and so many other products) of such freshness for so much less. I love this company's products and have not found one thing yet that I was disappointed in, and their service is always top notch.
