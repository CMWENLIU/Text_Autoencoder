I am a medical school student and you might imagine how much coffee goes through my system in any given year.  I had Aloha Island first when I was an undergraduate and have since given up all other coffee.  Kona is by far the best there is out there, and Aloha Island is amazing.  I have tried 100% Kona from other retailers since my first dalliance with Kona, but not even the best of the premium coffees compare to the rich taste of Aloha Island's gold collection (which is their lowest grade).  The rich, dark grounds are perfect every time and make the perfect study break.  Now they say that the diamond collection is a special treat, but once you have a really good coffee it is so hard to go back to something that is below it.  I highly reccommend the diamond collection.  Word to the wise: don't stock up on this coffee; while it does last quite some time even with the most careless keeping, the coffee is best when kept in an airtight container and ground fresh for every cup.  The longer you keep coffee around, the more flavor it loses.
