If  you want to like olive oil, but just can't quite manage it, try this before you give up.  It tastes completely different than any other olive oil.  You know how they always say olive oil is fruity, but it just isn't?  This is. It is fresh, fruity, rich and delicious.  I tasted it in a restaurant, asked for the name, and tracked it down.  It's just amazingly good.
