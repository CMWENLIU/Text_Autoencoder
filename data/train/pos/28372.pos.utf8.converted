I used to make my own flans and creme brulee but I tried this flan mix and rarely make it from scratch anymore.  However, I have discovered that I can make a lot of changes and create some truly scrumptious desserts that are my "own".  Here are some options:  Use heavy creme for half of the milk.  Use coconut milk instead of regular milk.  Both produce a silky smooth and elegant custard.  Add fresh lime or lemon juice for part of the milk, but add it right at the end of the cooking process.  Instead of the enclosed sauce, use marmalade, lingonberry, mango or blueberry preserves,spreading it around the bottom of your custard cups before adding the cooked custard. If you are serving 6-8 people you will need to start with two packages of the mix. I don't have names for what I create, but I sure get raves from everyone who tries them.  Only thing is, don't make these rich desserts very often or you will clog up your arteries.<br /><br />I have been having a hard time finding this product in local grocery stores so was happy to see Amazon now sells it.  And, subscribe and save is a great deal, if you cook as much as I do.
