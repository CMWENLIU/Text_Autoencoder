Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy and tasty, and blend into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart. Red Zinger is especially good for colds--the ingredients strengthen the immune system and the tea is soothing to the throat. It is also great for a diet tea--the bold flavor helps with cravings and the diuretic ingredients prevent and ameliorate water retention. And aside from its benefits it is just a delicious tea! The flavor is sour-cherry with a hint of mint and flavorful hot or cold.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues."  Baltasar Gracian.
