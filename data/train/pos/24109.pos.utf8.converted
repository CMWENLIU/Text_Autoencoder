I love seafood.  And seafood chowders.  The best are homemade.  Then some restaurants none of which do too badly.<br />And then there is canned.  Frankly, Boudin's Bakery makes a clam chowder to die for.  Now to Bar Harbor.  My first can had about 25% lobster meat.  Mostly claw from the looks of it.  Very sweet and "lobstery".  Then about the same amount of potatoes and veg.  In a broth that tastes beautifully of lobster.  I made mine on the stove. Perhaps that other reviewer used their microwave.  And I added one half cup of 2% milk and 3 Tablespoons of cream.  Absolute heaven.  As this brand uses tapioca as a thickening agent, and tapioca is uppety, I heated this slowly in a heavy Caphalon pan until very, very hot and stirred it nearly constantly.  Just like one would make tapioca.  I think if you follow those directions, you'll be surprised at how delicious this is.  Is it homemade.  No of course not.  Is it restaurant fare.  No way.  But for a quick chowder if you take some time to prepare it properly, it is absolutely delicious.  In a jam I would add extra cream, a dash of cream sherry, some fresh Italian parsley and serve this as a soup course for guests.  It is truly that good.  So buy some and enjoy it.  I certainly did just awhile ago.
