I tried several other flavors trying to avoid the 'green' taste as I want to have it more than once a day.  The Acai flavor is certainly palatable but the ORAC with its fruity taste is actually good, especially cold.  I use a reusable opaque drinking bottle so others can't see the solution and I drink several a day around the office adding a little ice to keep it cold.  It is the only flavor I will buy from now on.<br />My wife and sister both said it tasted fine so just about anyone should find it acceptable!!!<br />Like the other flavors, it also has the 'gritty' residue that settles at the bottom and just does not seem to dissolve but not an issue for me.  For now, I am just adding it to water as I don't like having my smoothies turn green.<br />If you have a natural food store near you, try a single serving, travel packet for yourself.  If not, and you are still hesitant about committing to a 30 serving canister, order a box of the travel packets so unused ones can be comfortably used by someone else.<br />Except for the Acai flavor with its very slight green taste, all the others, including the chocolate and dreamsicle, still had a very strong 'green' taste to me.  After trying the ORAC flavor, I even returned the ACAI.  (Thanks, Sunflower and Whole Foods)<br />At the Amazing Grass web site, it is the only flavor with all 5-star ratings!<br />Amazing Grass ORAC and their wheatgrass tablets (again, to avoid the green taste) are a complete combination for me.<br />Good luck in your pursuit of health.
