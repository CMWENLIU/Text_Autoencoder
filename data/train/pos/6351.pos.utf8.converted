lol, I read that this item was cheaper in stores and almost bought it here.<br /><br />I am so glad I checked out my local oriental market first.<br /><br />I bought it for 8 dollars at the Asian store.<br /><br />Even on eBay this is expensive. It also is not from Japan, it is from Taiwan. Still good.<br /><br />All you need is 1/2-1 teaspoon for a cup of tea or to put in anything like juice or non-dairy milk (like Rice, Almond or Soy milk). I personally tried 2 teaspoons and I could not sleep LOL! 1 tsp is enough for the whole day.<br /><br />You can also put it in just about anything.<br /><br />This also looked a bit low grade (faded green color), but oh well the higher grade is so much more expensive.<br /><br />This went down good with a chocolate flavored drink I have (called Ensure)!<br /><br />Though I question if this is Matcha... I mean it tasted like green tea. I'd have to try another Matcha brand to see if this is real. I read one a matcha website that the brownish green tea is imitation Japanese matcha from the Chinese or Korean and well... someone said how this mostly has Chinese writing on it, and it's from Taiwan! Then, there is even imitation matcha from the Japanese themselves, where it is just regular green tea powder, and claiming it is matcha. :(<br /><br />UPDATE: I will post a picture of a comparison of this powder and another. I bought Matcha that is from (or claims to be) from Japan and is called "drinking grade". This is a brighter, healthy looking green as opposed to this Taiwanese green tea. Or, the Taiwanese tea is made from different leaves, and not the ones that Matcha is traditionally made out of. Or, the other Matcha is simply a higher grade. Not that high though, as I am aware top notch Matcha is a very very bright green.<br /><br />However, this Taiwanese green tea is great. It keeps me up and 1 teaspoon is enough, or even half. I tried 2 teaspoons (morning and lunch) and I was up all night, so this stuff is real haha. I'd drink just 1 teaspoon for the morning or a 1/2 teaspoon in the morning and another 1/2 during lunch (I personally don't have time for that). Not disregarding the product at all, I love it. But those who want the bright colored Matcha might think differently of this product.<br /><br />This stuff is great for people who do not get enough sleep as well. Put this in some orange juice and that will be your energy drink for the day, and it lasts a very long time.<br /><br />Oh and I paid 45 dollars for 150g of the other Matcha. I plan to use that one only on exam days or something. Or even during an all-nighter.
