Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.  This caffeine-free herbal blend brews up into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart and tastes like minty cherry syrup.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues."  Baltasar Gracian.
