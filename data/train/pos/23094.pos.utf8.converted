I first bought President butter because all I needed was 1/2 pound. When I got it home and out of the package, I knew right away it was different. It is more yellow than grocery store butter and has a pleasant butter aroma. The taste is outstanding: the way butter used to taste when I was a kid. I am on a tight budget, but I make room for President butter. It's the only kind I buy.
