These are delicious, fresh and tasty!  My kids love 'em and so do I.  I was surprised as my cans are mostly full halves and some nearly whole nuts with only some "bits and pieces" -- much better quality than I expected.  The first can was gone in three-four days!  A big hit at my house.  So you may eat more than you would otherwise, with so large a supply...keep that in mind.  ;)<br /><br />A great deal - much cheaper per ounce than the smaller sizes.<br /><br />2012-07-07 update: Have purchased multiple times and quality has remained good.
