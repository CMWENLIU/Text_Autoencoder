For the vast majority of people, a functionally identical product is the non-organic version, which saves a large part of this rather premium price:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FR0F8">DoMatcha Green Tea, Matcha, 1.06-Ounce Tin</a>.<br /><br />Though this is some of the best Matcha available (especially for Amazon Prime junkies like me), IMHO the premium that the organic certification adds is too large.  I am sure the administrative overhead and more expensive processes genuinely account for most of the markup, but DoMatcha seems to take great care to ensure that their regular products are never contaminated.  Additionally, considering the relatively small quantity of material you are actually ingesting, even pesticide-drenched, badly washed leaves would carry less poison in a dozen tins than a single non-organic potato sometimes does!<br /><br />For those who buy organic for moral reasons, drinkers who have special health requirements relative to farming processes, and the lucky few with an excess of cash---this is the best Matcha I have found on Amazon.  Otherwise, get the cheaper equivalent.  Either way, you'll love it!
