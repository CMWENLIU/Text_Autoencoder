I used to feed my two cats Meow Mix dry food and give them a can of Fancy Feast as a treat when I came home from work.  My male cat started throwing up after he'd eat... it was nasty!  I took him to the vet and she said most likely a food allergy and to put him on Wellness single protein canned food.  It's worked great... he loves it and rarely throws up anymore aside from the occasional hairball.  His sister will only eat dry food so I switched her to Wellness dry and she loves it as well.
