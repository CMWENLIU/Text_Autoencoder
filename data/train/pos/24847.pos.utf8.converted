This is really good stuff. Last long in the fridge, works great in machines, and there's no need for proofing (adding water to Active Dry yeast, and some flour, and letting it sit for a while before adding it to the rest of the mixture).<br /><br />Two things to remember:<br /><br />1. When using this, mix it well into the dry ingredients. If you just dump it into the water, it may clump together and you wind up with a clump of yeast in your bread. If you're using a bread machine, no worries, because if you follow the machine instructions (making a little "volcano" in the flour, putting yeast in the volcano hole) it'll do it for you.<br /><br />2. make no mistake, you're using mutant yeast. Instant yeast is created through protoplast fusion, where two different strains of yeast are combined into one. One of the types is usually a mutant yeast to begin with. any difference, health or taste wise? dunno. but once in a while i like to use cake yeast (the high-moisture "fresh" kind), or sourdough from my own starter (look on the net for instructions on how to make starters), and i like to think that i can taste the difference (and human history!)<br /><br />kev
