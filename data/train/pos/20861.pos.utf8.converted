I think this is the best microwave mac n cheese around.  There is enough in one bowl for lunch.  The only downside is you need to stir it a lot after it is done so everything is mixed.  Occasionally, there is a stray noodle that is hard with a lot of mix still on it, but I like those and I make it a game to find one.
