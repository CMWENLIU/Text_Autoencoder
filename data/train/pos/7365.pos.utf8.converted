The spectra paste food colors are simply fantastic. They provide a depth and clarity of color that is impossible to achieve with liquid food colors. And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.
