I've used dried mushrooms many times over the years and these are among the best.  Though expensive the morel has great flavor and is easily reconstituted.  Already I've used them in a mushroom risotto and my favorite Fettuccine Alfredo.  The 4-ounce package has a volume of about five cups of the dried morels so it easily beats what I find in the local supermarket.
