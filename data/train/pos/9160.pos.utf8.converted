Have you every felt like the biggest jerk going through your child's Halloween Bag or Easter basket and taking out all the lollipops because your children simply don't need more sugar laying against their teeth.  I have, and it didnt feel good.  Suddenly, I'm like Santa Claus.  Not that they eat lollipops all day-everyday; but if they did, it would only help their teeth, not rot them to nubs. Forget what you heard about sugar-free lollipops, these taste GREAT.  And the fact that they contain Xylitol which actually strengthens their teeth, how could you not buy these for your kids.  Sure they are a little expensive in comparison to the sugar on a stick that we're used to, but they are worth every cent. Note:  These were initially recommended to me by my Pediatric Dentist.  He keeps a bowl of them in his office.
