For one thing, Xylichew has a tasty fruit flavor.  For another, it uses xylitol for sweetener, which is a product derived from beech tree bark: no freaky chemicals and low-cal.  Just read an article, too, that says that women who chew xylitol gum while pregnant have babies who grow up to have fewer cavities.  Go figure!  One caveat:  pregnant women probably want to avoid chewing gums with multiple sweeteners - a lot of domestic (U.S.) brands have both xylitol and aspartame/saccharine.
