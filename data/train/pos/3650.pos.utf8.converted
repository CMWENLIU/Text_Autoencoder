Not anymore, apparently.  Offhand, the only other place I can remember seeing skulls on the labels of beverages is in the Rotgut Industry.  But this is hardly the first case of counter intuitive marketing in energy drinks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU">Monster Energy Drink cans</a> have claw marks slashed through their label, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039BXTCI">Venom Energy Drink cans</a> have a poisonous snake on their label, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RI8GI8">Cocaine Energy Drink - As Strong As 3 Red Bulls</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MRQ4J4">Zombie Blood Energy Potion Pack</a> pretty much speak for themselves.<br /><br />(What next?  This Will Kill You brand energy drinks?)<br /><br />Which is a bit ironic since No Fear brand energy drinks could argue that they are a little bit more healthy (or a little bit less UNhealthy) than the average energy drink because they contain grape juice concentrate.  How much is unclear, but from the label we can know that there is less grape juice concentrate than the taurine (1000mg) but more than the inositol (100mg).  Oh, it is hardly what I would call genuine "Soda Juice": <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDDHPQ">essn Sparkling Juice</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Carbonated Juice</a>, but this probably explains the different and IMHO surprisingly good taste.<br /><br />Note: Also available in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MO3AUW">No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.
