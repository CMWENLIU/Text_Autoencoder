I feel bad.  Like I'm cheating on my own other review.  But I have to be honest.  A year or two ago, I wrote a review praising another brand of "small batch" colas, proclaiming it as the "real" Real Thing.  I won't completely disown that review, but that was all before I tried Fentiman's.  Holy Moley.  I love Boylan's.  I love the Coca Cola from Mexico.  I loved Pepsi Throwback.  I even loved that complex, black sheep of colas, Red Bull cola.  Heck, I even enjoyed the strange, toasty flavor of Pepsi Raw... in small portions.  But this... this stuff is AMAZING!  Not too heavily carbonated.  Bursting with a variety of fruit flavors, this cola provides a multilayered tasting experience where the authentic cola taste gently unifies the other ingredients.  Sodas aren't supposed to taste this good.  Drinks like Fentimen's Curiosity Cola are why we fell in love with soda pop as kids.  For a special treat, it's well worth the price.  In a world of Scotch snobs, beer snobs, and wine snobs, this is the ultimate answer to what may emerge as the cola snob.  It is the Glenmorangie Scotch or Montecristo Cigar of colas.
