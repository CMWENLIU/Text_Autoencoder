Just made the first pot this Saturday morning for the wife and myself.  Used a burr type coffee grinder and used my drip type coffee maker.<br />Used (3) scoops for 10-cups of coffee.<br />The aroma was great, the brew was dark and rich and the taste was superb.<br />So good as a matter of fact that we made an additional pot.<br />If you like a hearty and fulfilling cup of coffee I highly recommend this coffee.
