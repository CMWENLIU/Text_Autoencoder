I left the feedback couple days ago. Today, I made Creme Brulee that required a vanilla bean. So I opened the package, I realized right away what other reviewers had said "It's plump and moist" even though I have never used vanilla beans! I was so thrilled that I had to leave another review...I know this is the only place that I would get vanilla beans. Thank you so much, JR mushroom for such a fantastic quality and price!!!
