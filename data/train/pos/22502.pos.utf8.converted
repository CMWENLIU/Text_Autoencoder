I love my Beaba Babycook. My daughter is a year old now, and I still use it to make applesauce, purees for casseroles, and soups. It's really easy to use, and I'm a single mother so I love anything that is quick, practical, and easy. As far as another review that said the Beaba is too small to make enough food, I stuff mine pretty full, that way I can make quite a bit of food at once. I don't like tons of leftovers and I don't freeze, so the amount it makes is perfect for my daughter and me. Definitely worth every penny!
