My Grandma made Whip 'n Chill for me and my brothers when we came to visit them back in the late 60's and early 70's.  This is the same stuff, same taste and everything!!  It comes in institutional 15 oz. pouches, so I divided it in half and mixed it with 2 cups of water and that taste brought me back to when I was a kid!!!
