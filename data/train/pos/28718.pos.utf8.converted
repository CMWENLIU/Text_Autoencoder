Vegan. Organic. Kosher pareve. Fat free. Wonderful aroma. Small tender lentils in a flavorful vegan gravy. Fantastic choice with rice. Sweet onion and bay leaf flavor notes are mild and well-balanced for beautiful overall flavor. Bravo! Approx. 455 calories, 28g protein, 0g fat, and 715mg sodium per can. Made with organic lentils, organic tomato puree, organic shoyu(organic soybeans, organic whole wheat, sea salt), organic onion, organic garlic, and organic bay leaf. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKYUSM">Eden Organic Baked Beans, Fat Free - Low Salt, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> also from Eden.
