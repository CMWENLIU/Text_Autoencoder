I first had rock sugar at an upscale spa as I waited for my massouse and fell in love with it after one cup.  This definitely does the trick for tea.  Unlike granualated sugars that sink, accumulate at the bottom and demand that you stir periodically just to keep the tea & it's contents homogenized, this rock sugar distributes an evenly sweet taste throughout the whole cup.  No stirring needed!  Rocks dissolve gradually from the temperature of the tea water. And like a previous user said, it does a great job sweetening without changing the tea's designated flavor, but rather enhances it.  I'm hooked on thsi product from Teavana.
