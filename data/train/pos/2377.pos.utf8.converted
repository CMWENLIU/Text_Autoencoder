Persian cats can be very fussy eaters and have very delicate digestive tracks. They also have trouble picking up their food. Royal Canin for Persians has been perfect for our two cats.  Its easy for them to pick up. They enjoy the taste, but don't over eat. They've had no digestive problems, urinary infections which can be a problem with an all dry food diet. Their skin and coats are healthy and fur balls are minimal. They have it packaged with a resealable strip which helps keep it fresh.  I'm very happy.  And its a Great Price!
