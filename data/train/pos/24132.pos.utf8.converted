This stuff is real Mafia olive oil! Genco has been imported since the turn of the last century but it was mostly available only in the northeastern tier of the US. Genco is the only dealer that still ships a full gallon container. Sometimes there is a slight peppery sting with extra virgin oil but not with Genco; it is as smooth as good scotch!<br />I got my shipment in about three days but the product was shipped via DHL, which is not the best, so that amount of time was understandable.
