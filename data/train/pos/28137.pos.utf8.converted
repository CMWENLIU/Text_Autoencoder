This microwave oven popcorn pops light and fluffy.  When it's popping, it actually smells like popcorn and not like some kind of artificially-flavored buttery grease.  There is a hint of salt and light butter.  It's really good stuff unless you're looking to replicate the trans-fat experience of the movie theater concession stand.
