This coffee is insanely good.  I'm a picky coffee drinker; I prefer strong-flavored, strong-brewed coffee.  Cameron's Toasted Pecan hits the spot.  The flavor is out of this world.  I keep the beans frozen and grind up a fresh batch for my french press--oh my, oh my.  How this coffee is so cheap is beyond me.<br /><br />No matter what kind of coffee you like (except maybe if you're a starbucks snob, lol) this will do you right.
