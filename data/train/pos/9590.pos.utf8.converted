There are times you look at the ad for a product and say, "Well it looks good in the ad, but that's a lot of money to pay for what may be just a cheap piece of chinese plastic." Well, I ordered this for my wife with missgivings. When it arrived,I was immediately struck with the solid, quality construction. My wife followed the instructions and in less than 3 weeks we were eating all the delicious, healthy, fresh herbs we could handle. The herbs produced for over 5 months, and then we replaced them.<br /><br />We were so impressed with the product, we bought two more with a shelf-- one for salad greens and one for cherry tomatoes. If you love fresh produce and especially salads, but it seems as if some are always spoiling in your fridge, then this is a great product for you.
