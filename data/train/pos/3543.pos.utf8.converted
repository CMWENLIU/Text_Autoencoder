I don't like tea. I never have, but I've always WANTED to like it. I mean... it smells delicious, it's good for you and it's something a lot of my friends love. I've just never liked it.<br /><br />My husband and I recently switched to as much organic as possible and he started drinking these teas. He begged me to try this and wow! It's the best tea I've ever tasted! I swear I can taste the peach fuzz. It's so light and refreshing! I drink slowly, so one lasts me all day at work because of the generous 16oz can. I don't even miss soda.<br /><br />I buy these at Kroger for $1 a can. I wish I could find a place to buy a case at an even better price. I'd buy a freaking pallet of them and bathe in this stuff.
