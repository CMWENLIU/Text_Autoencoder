For some reason, the good people at Heinz see fit to market a number of delectable items that Americans might like but are reserved for the Brits. One of them is baked beans (the kind you serve on toast, not the kind you serve with barbecue.) Another is this tomato soup.<br /><br />The soup comes in a pull-tab can, with two moderate servings (not quite a full soup mug.) You do not dilute this soup. The flavor is rich with tomatoes. The "cream" is some skim milk and a little bit of cream; this is not a bisque. The other chief attraction is that the soup has no wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Tomatoes (84%), water, vegetable oil, sugar, modified cornflour, salt, dried skimmed milk, whey protein, cream, citric acid, spice extracts, herb extract<br /><br />Compare this with Campbells:<br /><br />tomato puree (water, tomato paste), water, wheat, flour, high fructose corn syrup, contains less than 2% of the following : salt, ascorbic acid (added to help retain color), flavoring, citric acid.<br /><br />Look, Campbells has that nasty HFCS! That cloying, sweet taste that is not good for you!  No wonder Heinz tastes like a tomato.
