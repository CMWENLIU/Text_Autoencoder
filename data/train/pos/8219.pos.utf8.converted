Had this corn bread mix for the first time tonight with some grilled fresh green beans and new potatoes.  I always like corn bread with this slice of heaven.... and this corn bread mix took me above the clouds in taste and texture.<br />I've been making and eating corn bread for 60 years and this is as good as it gets, believe me.<br />Just follow directions and have a slice of heaven on me !
