I have been using these bags for 3 months.  They were provided to me by the Mother's Milk Bank in San Jose.  Prior to using these bags, I had used the very popular Lansinoh bags for 3 months.<br /><br />Between the two, I much prefer the HoneySuckle bags.  Why? They are better.  How are they better, you ask?<br /><br />1. This bag is actually tamper resistant, while the Lansinoh bag is not.  The HoneySuckle bags have the entire top sealed to prevent tampering.  You cannot tamper with the bag without opening one of the three sides of the perforated top.  You remove the perforated portion to open the bag.  The Lansinoh bags have a perforated top, but not the sides of that upper area, so you could actually still open the bag without undoing the perforations.  Poor design IMO.<br /><br />2. The sides and bottom of the HoneySuckle bags are reinforced, the Lansinoh bags are not.  I pump exclusively, and even at 6 mos, my son is not eating all the milk I produce, so I freeze easily 2-4 bags of milk a day.  I can produce between 8 to as much as 14oz during a pumping session, and have been able to overfill these bags without them bursting open when they are frozen.  The reinforced sides and bottom have alot to do with that.<br /><br />3. The information to write at the top is much more useful, and is rightside up.  The Lansinoh bags have the info updside down.  That has always bothered me.  Even when you stand the bags up in the freezer, they are upside down.  It's stupid.  HoneySuckle bags have the labeling rightside up.  Plus it asks for baby's name and the date, not the volume.  I don't find the volume info helpful at all, and when my baby was in the NICU, or when donating breastmilk, the name is much more useful information.<br /><br />4. Best quality - THEY ARE BIODEGRADABLE!!  They will dissolve when they are in the landfill.  If you care about the environment at all, these are the bags for you.  The Lansinoh bags aren't biodegradable, at least from what I can tell from their packaging.  As if dirty diapers aren't a big enough contribution to the tremendous amount of trash people generate these days, breastmilk storage bags don't need to add to that.<br /><br />Price wise, these are comparable to the Lansinoh bags, except that with shipping they are a few dollars more.  But I think they are worth it from a quality and environmental standpoint.  You can also go to the New Bag Co. website and order a free sample if you aren't convinced.  IMO, these bags are superior to the Lansinoh bags and I will definitely be using them exclusively.
