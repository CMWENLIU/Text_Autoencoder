Our two cats love this cat food. It smells fresh (not rancid-smelling, as many of the popular brands ARE rancid)and I am delighted that no rendered slaughterhouse animals and euthanized cats and dogs have been added as "meat by-products" and I like that it is organic. We will continue to buy Organix.
