This green tea is not brewed and then the leaves thrown out. You drink the whole leaf crushed into a powder getting all the phytonutrients and benefits that tea bags cannot give you. It becomes a superfood when you get it this way. Check out the website domatcha.com for more information but get the product here because it is cheaper. For even more info on the health benefits of this type of tea go to mercola.com then do a search in Products for Royal Matcha. This one though, is even more expensive and not any better than Do Matcha that I can tell after doing alot of research.<br /><br />I drink this every day and it makes me more alert and sharp of mind without the crash of caffeine and stimulants. It does not taste like much, it has a very mild 'spinachy' taste, but I don't drink it because it tastes so good, I drink it for mental clarity, emotional support and for my health and immune support. I don't put it in hot water. I put it in about 24 ounces of room temperature water and agitate it with an egg whisk to blend it with the water, otherwise it clumps, hot or cold. They try to sell you a wooden whisk but I use the metal one that I already had and it works great. Just agitate it really good by rolling the handle back and forth in your hands in the drink very quickly until it is foamy and well blended and drink right away.
