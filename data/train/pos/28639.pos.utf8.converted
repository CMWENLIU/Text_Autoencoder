I am a mom of a VERY picky 7 year old...The first thing I made for her with the vegi burger was tacos....She now CRAVES these and asks for them at least once a week!...I don't even like to think about regular hamburger after using this product..(I am a regular meat eater)<br />Sautee a finely chopped small onion in a large nonstick skillet..(no oil needed)<br />Add 2tsp of minced garlic..stir for a minute...Add 3/4 of a reg. size can of diced tomatoes with the italian seasonings already added in the can...Add 1 can of LL burger..mix together...Add 1 1/4 package of your favorite taco seasoning..(we use taco bell orig.)  and 1c water...Stir and cook until thickened...Mix in salt and pepper to taste..(I add the s and p when I add the meat, but this way you will get an idea of how much you'll need the next time)
