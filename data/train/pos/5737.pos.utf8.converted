This tea is not a dainty, gentle tea for a thin, English teacup.  It is a strong, robust, smokey drink, worthy of a large handmade ceramic mug.  It is for tea lovers of oolongs and lapsongs, and cold nights, and Russian literature of the 18th Century.  It has a shadowy side, a hint of a flavor that defies identification, an Existantial taste that encourages deep thoughts.<br /><br />I bought a half pound of this tea and will go for a full pound next time I order.
