I have been using this product for over 12 years.  I try not to miss a day.  I used to have noisy knees when I went up and down the stairs. I noticed a definite improvement within a month and not just in my joints but my hair, skin, and nails too.  This is one you should make a regular part of your health regime.  It has no taste and dissolves easily.  I drink it in my tea.  It's also great to take just before bedtime.  I think the calcium in it helps me sleep better.
