Bionaturae GF Spaghetti tastes better then any others that we tried. It's made from rice, potato and soy. It's very fast to cook - 6 min, and no need to drain. It's important to follow instructions and cook the exact time listed on the package, otherwise it will get too soft. It's a perfect texture, and I like it now even better then the glutenous spaghetti that I used to it. It's a great price here, and I can't wait till it comes back in stock.
