For my dog who is 8...a beagle...she is easy to please...but ...to find a dog food that contained probiotics, major proteins for a heavy set dog...this was the package for my dog.  I was referred to this brand and am delighted that she has lost weight right away, enjoys her meal and seems to be satisfied with the protein...staying full.  So thank you Blue Buffalo for providing clearly an amazing product!
