I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me. There is no religious reason for me NOT to eat bacon; however, these give you that smokey flavor of bacon without the fakey smoked tasted of turkey bacon or just that liquid smoke stuff. I love bacon, I love bonito flakes and have become addicted to dashi, the basic Japanese broth they use in almost everything.<br /> It's much more natural, it's delicious, it's not like anything else. I have yet to come across 'artificial bonito flakes' - that should tell you something.
