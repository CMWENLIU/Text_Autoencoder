<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HAJZHM">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Intense Hairball 34 Formula, 6-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I have finicky cats.  I have tried all the top line cat foods.<br />My cats lose interest after about two weeks, and I end up tossing the foood<br /><br />I have two cats and have already purchased 3 bags of this product.<br />They are still not tired of this food.<br />Due to the intense hairball formula,I very rarely see them coughing up hair balls<br /><br />It may be a little costly because it is only a 6 pound bag, but for me it is worth it.<br />my cats are more satisfied, and I have noticed they are happier and healthier.<br /><br />My one cat is never constipated anymore, and my chubby cat looks trimmer and actually can leap to the top of his tree house with ease.<br />It worth the price to switch.<br /><br />No foul smell in litter box at all.
