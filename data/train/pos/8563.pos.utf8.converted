I've been using AlsoSalt for years, and am Very Happy!-<br /><br />No bad aftertaste, and keeps my Blood Pressure lower!<br />I also get the 100 count, handy little travel packs!<br />Butter flavor is good to cut calories, on popcorn/vegys...!<br />I like the Garlic flavor too!<br />Free S&H at mfg. web site!
