I have this product in white - excellent!  Easy to follow instructions (hint hint for Mr. James Lin who sent in the images), quick produce and a delight for anyone visiting your home.<br /><br />When you open your garden kit, it will tell you which setting and location to put your plants, the box has a 7 open spaces mimicking the actual aerogarden.  You place the garden grow pods in the corresponding locations.  You do not mix the lettuce with the herbs and place the aerogarden on herbs or tomatoes settings - if you're growing lettuce, which setting do you think you place the garden?  Everyone at the same time "the lettuce setting".<br /><br />Buy this product - it's wonderful if gardening is or isn't your thing.  The garden kits are showing up at all of the stores now - JCPenney, Bed Bath & Beyond, etc....
