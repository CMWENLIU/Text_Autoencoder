This is not restaurant quality Korma, but it is still really tasty for how easy it is to prepare. My wife and I make two packets when we cook it which fills us both with a small portion left over that she will usually take to work the next day. The sauce is very flavorful, but not overly spicy, so if you like things hot, be prepared to add some chili powder or red pepper flakes to spice it up. The Basmati rice is very nice and doesn't clump together when cooked.
