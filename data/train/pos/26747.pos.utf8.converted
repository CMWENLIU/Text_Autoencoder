After buying a pepper mill I did some online sleuthing to find out that this peppercorn was highly & positively reviewed. I am no at all a foody but bought this as a gift for my wife (who is an amateur gourmand). She raves about this pepper. It is a large bag that at our rate of consumption will probably last at least five years.
