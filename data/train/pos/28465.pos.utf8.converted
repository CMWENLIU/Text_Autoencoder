As far as coca tea goes, this is it. Macmate has a subtle green color, an aromatic grassy scent and a refreshing herby flavor. I found it really has many of the attributes it is credited with, and the new resealable packaging helps to keep it fresher for longer than individual paper wraps. I have just received my second delivery, and I will order again, and again, and again...
