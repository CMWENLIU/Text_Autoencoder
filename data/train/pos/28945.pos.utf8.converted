I was looking for a product with some powerful properties in it, as I have quite<br />a few medical problems.  I had heard about Manuka Honey through a friend on the net that had been using it for quite a few years.  I was shocked at the price for<br />so little an amount, but purchased it anyway.<br />I tried the honey twice a day for a week, and looked forward to it every time, and wished I could add several more spoonfuls, however being diabetic, that would not be wise.  Manuka has to be the best honey I have ever tasted, there is really nothing else to describe it to, nothing comes close to the taste, the  thickness, it's wonderful. Unfortunately, it is too expensive for me. $31.00 is alot to pay for such a small amount.  I even tried to cut down, but that is impossible, it's just too good.  I just have to end this review by saying, I've had the best, and will always be looking for specials on it, so I can maybe purchase it again, or triple up on it.  If you buy it you will not regret it.<br />you will not forget it, and you will fight yourself to leave it alone....
