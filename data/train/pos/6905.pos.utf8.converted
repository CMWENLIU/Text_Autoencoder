it's true.  El Yucateco is the best hot sauce money can buy.  No gimmicks about how "insane" it is, and no suggestive catch phrases or clever names relating to how the heat will effect your digestive track.<br /><br />Tomatos and Haberneros.  End of Story.<br /><br />It is a very hot sauce,  but it also has a very good flavor that comes with the heat.  mmmmm.<br /><br />Lately I've seen it get redder.  I think they've added some food coloring.  That's weird and unnecessary,  but it tastes the same so I will not downgrade from the full 5 start rating.
