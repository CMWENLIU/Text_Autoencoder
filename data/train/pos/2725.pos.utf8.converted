I have a bran muffin recipe that I make every Sunday evening and then it lives in my fridge for the week.  Each morning I put a scoop of batter into a couple of muffin cups, put them in my convection oven and by the time I'm out of the shower and dressed, the fresh baked muffins are ready to put in my tote bag and I head out the door to work . . . I get to enjoy fresh baked muffins every morning with a fresh cup of tea.  Last night I was out of the usual All Bran, but found a box of the Bran Buds in the back of the cupboard.  Wasn't sure how it would work, but I liked these muffins even better than made with the All Bran! I did need to use more milk, and I'm guessing I'll have more than enough batter for the entire week (I'll bring some to share with co workers ;-)  This is a great way to get fiber in the morning and gives me a good start to the day.<br /><br />Update on the above.  I discovered that I can make these muffins, sccop them into my silicone muffin cups and then freeze the entire batch (usually 18 muffins).  Taking them out one or two at a time to bake in my convection oven each morning.  I start each day with fresh baked muffin(s).
