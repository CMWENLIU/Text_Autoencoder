Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee. When the Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker was created, these single use, disposable coffee 'pods' fit together like hand in glove. 5,000,000 European coffee lovers cannot be wrong...Senseo Douwe Egberts is outstanding, fresh tasting coffee, and each imported 4 pack, (72 Single-Serve pods), comes attractively packaged in a resealable pouch.<p>Medium roast is apt to be a particular favorite for American coffee tastes. It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup. The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top, and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up, or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do.<p>I do envision the price point coming down a bit, as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation. Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks, however, I've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change.
