I took one out and it told me to put 17.5 ounces of water into a covered dish and microwave for 9 minutes (approximately the amount of time to turn dirt into lava)... so I started out pretty darn skeptical.  Then I opened the powder package and it smelled like fish food from my acquarium, so amazingly the skepticism increased.  After considering whether to dump them or eat them I finally had a spoonfull and it was one of the best moves ive ever made. These things are friggen deliscious, I'm a fan for life and will definately be a repeat buyer.
