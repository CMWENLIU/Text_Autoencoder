I have found great relief (constipation) as I eat this everyday.<br />I've shared this with friends in the same situation and they have also<br />found 'relief'.  Who would have thought something this simple could help.<br />We have worked with this 'problem' for a long time so we know the in's<br />and out's.  My husband says to me 'O your eating cardboard for breakfast?' Ha Ha..<br />Make it like a sandwhich, breaking off the portion you want. Honey and Peanut<br />butter or almond butter, sprinkle with cinnamon. delish.  Or humas with sliced<br />tomatoes or sliced cucumber.  I love it....no fats, no sugar, lots of fiber!<br />Pam
