The first San Francisco Bay k cup I tried was the Fog Chaser. It wasn't bad...I loved the way these k cup type pods work in my Keurig! I have absolutely no issues with them not being standard k cups and having less plastic. Perfectly functional with less waste and a better price. So we tried the Breakfast Blend---great flavor,smooth coffee. I am a person who orders coffees from places like Coffees of Hawaii and Joe's Coffee so I am pretty picky about flavor. I am quite satisfied with this coffee as an everyday brew.For comparison? My mother is a Donut Shop and  Green Mountain k cup user and says this is very much like the Donut Shop- we both brew it on the largest or next to largest setting every time and it is a strong, solid cup- never weak. Freshness? I read concerns about the coffee staying fresh because of the filter type bottoms of the cups- have never had an issue with this.Each sealed bag has 8 cups in it and we have always used them before they had a chance to get stale! This is a loved coffee in our household! I now have this on subscribe and save and am considering changing the delivery to more often!
