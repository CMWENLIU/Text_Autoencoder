This tea is absolutely remarkable.  I ordered a cup of this on a whim while working on application essays for grad school.  I figured (especially being caffeine free) that it would just be a gimic and that I'd just move onto a latte afterward.  Well...I never needed the latte.  This woke me up and made me focus better than anything I have ever tried before.  Now instead of taking my ADHD meds, which work but give me migraines, I usually just grab a cup of this instead.  I'm about to finish up my first can and will definitely be purchasing another one.  Whether looking for energy, focus, or both, this tea absolutely delivers!  I cannot recommend it enough.<br />***Word of caution***  One cup is plenty to get you going; a little goes a LONG way.  Two cups in a row made me a little jittery, dizzy, and gave me stomach pain.
