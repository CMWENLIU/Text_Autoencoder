These pearls are very quick to make (5min in hot water or 2min in a good microwave), and they taste excellent! I've tried them in various drinks (from tea to soda) and so far they've worked well with it all.<br />The price is also pretty good. I can't get these anywhere near me, so the chance to get a few bags was great.
