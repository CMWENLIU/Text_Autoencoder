Im not sure about the other products out there but this stuff will make you believe your at the theater...the only problem is with the application..there are no instructions and its really thick so i have found the only way is to pour some into a small container (i used an old mustard squirt container) then spread cooked popcorn all level in the maker then apply some liberally on top then mix it all together...after doing that twice the popcorn is perfect the only problem is that itmakes the popcorn maker ALLOT messier then if you applied it somewhere else...good luck
