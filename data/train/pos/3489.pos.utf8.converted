I switched to the "Get Naked" chew sticks, which contain 18 calories per treat, from one chew treat that contained 300 calories per treat......how I would know how many calories were in those other treats? The fact is you would never know because there was no nutrition information on the package.....my vet told me and she told me me dogs were obese.  The "Get Naked" treats clearly list the caloric information, and if you reward one chew treat a day, it isn't a huge addition of calories for your pet.<br /><br />They can be a bit pricey and I do shop around to find the best prices.....Oh, and my dogs love them too~
