For the first two years of my cats lives, they were getting Purina One, or the natural/organic stuff found at Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  My two girls were fine with it, but their brother became tubby.  I wasn't sure what to do, the cats were all getting enough exercise since they roughhouse with each other.  The one day my mom's cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  In an attempt to keep her cat healthy, she switched to another brand of "Healthy" cat food (very similar to Orijen).  I took home a sample of it for my own cats and they LOVED it.  Simply out of wanting to keep my cats from ever getting diabetes (most store brand pet foods have far too many carbs than necessary), I began my own research and came across Orijen,<br /><br />This food is amazing.  Yes, it is pricey, but because the content is less filler and more substance, they eat much less than needed, so it ends up breaking fairly even.  Their coats are healthier -- one of my girls was having a dandruff problem (something I didn't think Domestic Shorthair Tabbies could get) which cleared up after switching foods.  Their stool even became more compact because of, again, less filler.  Most importantly, my male cat suddenly began shedding the pounds with no other change other than his diet!  That made me quite happy.<br /><br />Even if you don't decide to try this dry food, research.  Make sure what you're giving your cats is actually GOOD for them and not just stamped with some fancy designer label like Science Diet.  My cats being happy makes ME happy.
