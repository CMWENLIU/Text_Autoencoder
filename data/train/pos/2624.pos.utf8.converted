My three dogs can't get enough of these treats.  They are all natural and low in calories.<br />I have ordered them through Amazon, because our local stores don't always carry them.  We<br />especially like the Peanut Butter & Molasses.  When I say "WE", I mean me and the dogs.<br />Yes, they are even fit for human consumption.  They are the best dog/human treats on the<br />market.
