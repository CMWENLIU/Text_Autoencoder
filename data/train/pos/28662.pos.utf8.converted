We love these corn flakes and were so happy to see them at Amazon. They are the perfect alternative to mainstream corn flakes! They have just the right texture and flavor and everyone in our house will eat them! We even use them for crusts in many dessert recipes!<br /><br />Ordering groceries from Amazon has always been both convenient and saves us money. But we paid $30.40 a case for these a few month ago! I can get them at our local health food store for less than they are now listed so unless Amazon changes their prices of many of our gluten free favorites to reflect the savings we USED to get, we won't be ordering groceries here anymore.
