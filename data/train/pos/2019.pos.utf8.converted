I was hesitating to buy this sprouter because I thought this as expensive plastic container.<br />But, it does its job - since worth the price.<br /><br />I have used mostly mid-small size beans. Spouts are fresh smelling and almost all beans have sprouts. Our family is consuming more sprouts because of this spouter.
