I don't usually write reviews because I purchase items that already have at least dozens of rave reviews. I can't believe this soup only has one! I made a chicken tortilla soup on my own that was just a little bit better than this. But it took a lot of time to shop for and cook with all those ingredients and the cost was much higher.<br /><br />This soup tastes great and all you need to have is 6 cups of broth, pre-cooked chicken breast and some tortilla chips to throw on top. (FYI- I'm glad it's not hot/spicy. Throw in chili powder if you're into that.) These are really healthy, tasty ingredients. I ran into this in a nice local market and it was $7 or $8! I figured it was worth a try because making it on my own takes so long. I'm really glad I checked Amazon and can get two soups for that price.<br /><br />I need to try other flavors now...
