I use this Organic Cold-Pressed hemp oil instead of olive oil in recipes. It tastes great, has all those important omega-3 fatty acids and wasn't heat treated, which is important for all of us following a raw lifestyle. I also buy the bags of hemp seeds to add to my salads and smoothies. To top it off... FREE shipping from Amazon. Great product, great price, free shipping = no brainer... you must try this!
