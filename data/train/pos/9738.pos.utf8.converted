I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!<br /><br />1 1/2c milk<br /><br />2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder<br /><br />1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)<br /><br />10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)<br /><br />Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!
