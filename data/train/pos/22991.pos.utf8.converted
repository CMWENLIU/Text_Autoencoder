We recently purchased a new Boxer puppy and I did allot of research beforehand on what is considered the very best dry dog food. This is the one I chose over all the others. I slowly switched our puppy over from what the breeder was feeding and she is on straight GO! NGFEF and has not had any problems. So glad to see Amazon has picked up this product as it is hard to find in my area and it can be delivered right to my door for the same pet store cost without driving across town to get it (after I special order it). As one reviewer mentioned, only a raw diet is better than this one.
