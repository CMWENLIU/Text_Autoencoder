These are the best-built retriever rolls we've seen in years. They appear to be constructed all in one piece and are densely constructed. We have an 80-pound dog and a 105-pound dog, both avid chewers. The smaller dog will get only a few inches into one of these in a day -- she'll chew, nap, chew, look out the window, chew ... and the bigger dog, who is more food-motivated, will have one of these last him at least a day. If there is one criticism -- I wonder if the rawhide isn't a  bit too thick, even for our large dogs. Time will tell.
