This is by far the best gum on the market!  Spry utilizes Xylitol, a sugar-alcohol that has no carbohydrate action, yet bacteria ingest the Xylitol and cannot metabolize it, thus starving the bacteria!  Thus, with consistant use, it rids the mouth of harmful cavity-causing, gum-disease causing bacteria!  This is truly a unique gum.  One of the few gums that all dentists recommend!<br /><br />Avoid gum chewing if you suffer from TMJ.  Gum chewing aggravates TMJ's, so this is to be avoided.  This is the only contraindication to this product.<br /><br />This is a great product for the average person, child or adult.  Chew one to three pieces a day and your oral health will improve.<br /><br />Jim Koenig, DDS
