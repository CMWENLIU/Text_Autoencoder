Okay. Im a very cautious parent, but the fact that there is BPA in the lids doesnt affect the food or the quality of it. BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail! Again... dont freak out over BPA in the lids lol.
