It seems like everything these days is loaded with sodium, and way too much of it.  Thankfully, a few years ago a low sodium version of V8 vegetable juice was introduced.  I've been buying this lower sodium version exclusively since.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients and nutrition content per 8 oz. serving:<br /><br />Juices from the following vegetables: tomatoes, carrots, celery, beets, parsley, lettuce, watercress, and spinach.<br /><br />Calories 50<br />Sodium 140 mg.<br />Potassium 820 mg.<br />Total carbohydrates 10 g.<br />Dietary fiber 2 g.<br />Sugars 8 g.<br />Protein 2 g.<br />Vitamin A 40%<br />Vitamin C 120%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 2%<br /><br />I highly recommend the low sodium product over the regular V8 if you're concerned about taking in too much sodium.  The low sodium version tastes different, but whether or not it's better tasting compared to the regular version is up to you.
