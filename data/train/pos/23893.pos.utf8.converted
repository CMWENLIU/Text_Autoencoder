I love this program with Amazon.  I have many subscriptions for catfood.  The only problem I have with it, is the prices are changing CONSTANTLY/daily.  Seriously, I have to monitor my account almost every day.  The prices jump around from $9/case to $17/case ALL THE TIME.  I did not understand that part when I signed up for subscribe and save.  In the beginning, I ended up paying $17/case a few times (becuz I was not watching to see what the price was on my shipment day).  I can get it at WalMart for $10-$11/case.  I figured, subscribing meant locking in the price, and that is not the case with this program.  Now I watch them alot and I am just cancelling and re-activating everything all the time.  I will only do this if it is cheaper for me than I pay at WalMart.  I have lots of cats and I also feed strays, so I need to save money on catfood whenever possible.
