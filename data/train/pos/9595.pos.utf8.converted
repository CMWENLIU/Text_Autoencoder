I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we both are amazed at the quality  of this product.  Our first 'planting' was tomatoes and 4 days later we have sprouts.  This is easy to use with no mess.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to see done differently is the ability to grow multiple products (i.e., tomatoes, salad, herbs) at the same time. Currently, you can only grow the same item at one time.<br /><br />Update: 3 months later<br /><br />This thing is noisy.  The pump is making an awful racket and am afraid it will fail soon...have contacted the manufacturer for a replacement and I hope the customer service horror stories I've seen so far have been resolved.
