My finicky cat would not eat any wet food but Fancy Feasts. When I found out what ingredients went into that product, I decided to switch him to a different brand. The pet store that I went to recommended several different brands to me. I bought several, including Nutro. He did not like the Nutro at all, and left the whole can out to feed some ants. Then, I opened a Merrick can. As soon as I opened it, he was bothering me to hurry and feed him. He gobbled up the wet food like I'd never seen before. Since then, we adopted a second cat, and she also loves it. She has the same response when I open the can. We brought in a stray cat several months ago, and she took to this food right away, too. I have not heard about a cat that hasn't liked this brand of wet food. I have recommended it to many people that I know who are cat lovers. The cats enjoy it, but I like it because it's healthy. My cats have great looking coats, which the vet always comments about. The true reflection of a cat's health is their coat, apparently.
