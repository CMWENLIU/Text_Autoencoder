We were having problem switching our son from his Enfamil Gentlelease to whole milk. When Emfamil sent us samples of the Enfagrow regular, we gave that a tried and our son totally refuse to drink any of it. That got us worried, so we tried different brands of whole milk, different favors, add juice in the milk, still getting nowhere. Finally, we threw our hands up and decided to take the $5 Emfamil coupon (came along with the enfagrow samples) to get the Enfagrow Gentlelease. We were still afraid it may be a waste of money to get it, but after throwing so much money down the drain with the other whole milks, we were desperate to give anything a try.<br /><br />Here are the details I noticed when I compared the two.<br /><br />Calories per 5 fl oz are the same for both Enfamil Gentlelease and Enfagrow Gentlelease: 100 Calories.<br /><br />Nutrients:<br />Both Enfamil Gentlelease and Enfagrow Gentlelease has the same nutrients in grams, with very negligible different in carbohydrate and water.<br /><br />Vitamins:<br />They are the same.<br /><br />Minerals:<br />Here is where I see the changes from Enfamil Gentlelease to Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br />Most notable are,<br />Calcium - From 82mg to 195mg<br />Phosphorus - From 46mg to 130mg<br />There are only slight increases in Sodium, Potassium and Chloride.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />-Enfagrow Gentlelease has extra two ingredients of Calcium Phosphate and Potassium Iodide,<br />-Instead of Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Phosphate in Enfamil Gentlelease, it is replaced with Calcium Chloride in Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br /><br />Taste test(?!):<br />Me: I figured since most of the ingredients are the same, there shouldn't be much difference in the taste. Sure enough, there wasn't except there is a slight drier after taste in the Enfagrow Gentlelease.<br />Son: He drank the whole thing! So relieved.<br /><br />Overall, we are extremely happy he would drink the Enfagrow Gentlelease. We would have prefered the Enfagrow over regular whole milk anyway, because of all the vitamins and DHA in it.
