My diet is gluten- and soy-free (among lots of other things).  Pre-diagnosis I used regular soy sauce, then tamari (after the Celiac diagnosis).  I was never much of a edamame or tofu eater and didn't think I'd miss soy when that allergy diagnosis came along, but doing without tamari was tough.<br /><br />The office manager at my doctor's office raved about coconut aminos and at her urging I decided to give them a try.  I am so glad I did!  I haven't noticed much of a difference between coconut aminos and tamari.  I'd like to compare it to soy sauce for the sake of the review, but it's been so long since I've had soy sauce that I don't remember what it tastes like.<br /><br />I typically use this is stir fry, Thai peanut sauce, and barbecue sauce.  The results have been excellent and not too salty.
