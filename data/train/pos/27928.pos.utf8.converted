These coffee candies are strong...there's not much of a milk flavor to them....let's just say if they were coffee instead of candy, they'd be closer to straight black than most coffee candies you find around...they are just sweet enough. It took me no time at all to get used to the fact that they're not overly sweet. I really recommend these candies for those of you who like stronger coffee and expresso...<br /><br />I, personally, love them, I bought five bags...and if you decide to buy them...I hope you'll enjoy them... :)<br /><br />I hope this helped... :)
