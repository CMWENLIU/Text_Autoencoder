Consider this an endorsement of the product. It is a delicious product, ideal with 2% or more milk (no skim) and served in a very large bowl. You can eat a lot of it. I can eat a lot of it. A lot of it is meant to be eaten. The six-pack is just as well because it is extremely difficult to find this cereal in Arizona. I used to feel this price was ridiculous but now, after four months without CLC, it is most certainly fair, and can be delivered overnight by air for you prime members. The prime is an end in itself, to have things delivered in two days for free: that is a lot of products that can make their way to you. It is the world's largest grocery store and bookstore. Everything--the world in all its muchness--is yours for the ordering. I love all of it, the world, these reviews, Amazon and its slightly salacious/campy name, Amazon prime, the website, the other reviewers who gave it five stars, and their children. All these things are beautiful. All these things will fade away. You might as well stock up because you may never be able to leave the house again.
