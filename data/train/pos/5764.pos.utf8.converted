First, the actual product: Love this stuff. Tastier than bouillon cubes, easier to deal with, and the price is comparable given the large number of servings. We live in a vegan household and wouldn't ever be caught without it. Having said that, it's usually about half this price at the grocery store, not quite sure why Amazon's costs so much.<br /><br />Second, to the MSG haters: there is going to be no such thing as an MSG-free broth unless you make it yourself. Make sure you leave out all naturally-occuring sources of it as well. Furthermore, a cursory search for medical journal articles doesn't turn up any reputable sources concluding that MSG consumed in the quantities found in this kind of product possess any adverse health effects. If you'd like to share some citations, I'll be listening. In the meantime, I'm going to continue to use this product in every soup/gravy/ice cream topping I eat.
