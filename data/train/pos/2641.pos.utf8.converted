I first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in Kansas one summer... and I never stopped. The first time you try this stuff, it's like wine or avocados; it's a taste that is certainly acquired, and like nothing else. I have fed it to a friend and to my significant other; few like it the first time, but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it's a staple in your house, like it is in mine. Kind of reminds me of sushi; first time I tried it, I was like, "this is odd, why do people eat this?", then, I found myself craving it a week later. Haha. Now I love sushi and miso! (By the way, it comes in an envelope with 3 individual packets). Mix it in hot water, to taste. You might like it with more or less water, depending on how salty you like your food. -Experiment with it to your satisfaction, and I guarantee, there is much of that to be had.<br /><br />I usually add all 3 little individual packets (it's low-fat) to a decent-sized cup of hot water, add my favorite vinegar, and let it sit and "cure" for a minute or so, since the little green sea-vegetable flakes (and green onions + tofu squares) need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable. I then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart's content.<br /><br />(I also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you!)<br /><br />If you let it sit, the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl, which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful, too. I think of it as cheap, delicious entertainment. But then again, I am easily amused. ;)
