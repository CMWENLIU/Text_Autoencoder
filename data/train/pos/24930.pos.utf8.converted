Hershey's Symphony milk chocolate candy bars with almond & toffee bits are one of my favorite chocolate bars EVER! I'm not a chocoholic, but when I really, truly want good chocolate, I'm either looking for one of these bars, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JZDXV4">Cadbury Fruit & Nut Chocolate Bar 49g England (12 Pack)</a>, a good Ghirardelli square (preferrably the solid chocolate mint, not the mint cream filled), Dove milk chocolate, or English toffee for some good crunch & sweet with a chocolate kick. This chocolate bar by Hershey's has been one of my favorites ever since it came out, way back in my college days (if I remember correctly). It really IS like someone turned a big chunk of English Toffee inside out & added extra chocolate. The chocolate itself is smooth and creamy without being too, too sweet, and the crunchy chunks of toffee & toasted almonds inside of it make for a delicious, sweet surprise.<br /><br />If you haven't tried this confection by Hershey's yet, pick one up at your local drugstore or grocery store. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
