If you like tea as I do, you will really like this tea. This is not flavored or blended. Sure, I know it is "bag" tea and not "loose", and I know all about all the other things like the flush (harvest), the cut and such, but you don't have to be a tea "snob" to like this tea. I find that if I brew it with less than boiling water -around 190-200 degrees (just boil and wait a minute after pouring the water in the cup before adding the bag) and steep for 3 minutes, it comes out perfect. If I do want to sweeten it, I use orange blossom honey and it is great! Best of all, I didn't break the bank to get tea that I could enjoy. You can spend more, a lot more, and get "better", but I am perfectly happy with this because it is good tea, and at the rate I drink it, it is saving me a bunch of money. To me, that makes it taste even better!
