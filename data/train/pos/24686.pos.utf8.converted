Totally unexpected in how good this tasted! I eat organic as much as I can. No pun intended I don't associate organic or healthy in a can. But I saw this in my organic food aisle and I took a shot. Yummy! I ate it with some organic texmati brown rice with some fresh dill. Wonderful.<br /><br />I'm one of those that follows the body for bloodtype diet. I'm AB positive. Unfortunately, meat intake is limited to lamb and turkey. I can seriously get bored with that. And shrimp is out. I love shrimp being asian. But salmon is great for me. I was debating on going online to buy wild salmon online and it just was too expensive for me to buy in bulk.<br /><br />Obviously you're going to pay a bit more for it. But ask yourself how much does your health cost to you in the long run? People spend far to much money tricking out their car. Or clothes and makeup to look gorgeous. I admit I do put in the effort to look attractive on the outside. However what about inside your body?<br /><br />I can't believe they sell this on Amazon. I never buy food online but never say never. I think I'll make an exception. This stuff is great. And based on my own protein intake per day this makes for two meals. And I'm a 5'1" athlete. Single and on the go. I still save money compared to going to a gourmet sushi restaurant to get fresh fish. And what's great about this company is they are eco-conscious. Part of their proceeds they donate to help support marine conservation. A++++ overall. Thanks for putting out a quality product that makes me feel healthy and contributing to the conservation of the global community.
