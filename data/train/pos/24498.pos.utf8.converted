These are delicious with any kind of roast, beef burgundy etc. If you have any leftovers cut them up and cook them in a pan with a little butter. Another idea is to fill them with a mixture of seasoned ground beef, leeks, bread crumbs and eggs, pour brown butter over them and serve them with apple sauce.
