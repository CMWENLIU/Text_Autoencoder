I ordered this for my husband, a die-hard maple syrup fan.  I've always been of the "any good syrup will do" opinion.  After having this syrup over waffles my husband made the morning after the shipment arrived, I'm now a convert.  We will definitely continue our subscription to regular shipments of this delicious elixir!
