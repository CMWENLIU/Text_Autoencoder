Since Extra Virgin Coconut Oil has so many practical uses, I had a tough time picking one off the internet, but I'm so pleased with my purchase!  It's a balm-like texture, but quickly melts with your normal body heat, smells fantastic, goes on smooth but doesn't leave you feeling oily.  I use it for a lot of things, but the main thing I'm loving it for is as a facial moisturizer!  It's the best!  I can put it on after a shower, before bed, in the morning before putting on makeup, whatever... and no oily residue is left behind!
