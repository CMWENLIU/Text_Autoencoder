I absolutely love this oil. I applied it directly to my scalp/roots, then massaged my scalp and put a bonnet over my hair and went to sleep. I woke up the next morning and washed my hair (with a homemade shampoo using castile soap) and conditioned and my hair was so incredibly soft.<br /><br />A lot of women I've heard have complained of the smell. It smells similar to the Blue Magic hair grease to me...the blue bergamont hair dressing that people use. It has a natural, almost earthy smell to it, and the smell does tend to linger. It took a day for me to stop smelling it in my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend. I am African-American, and I have natural, 3b/3c hair. I felt as if the oil has accentuated my curl pattern (not defined it anymore than usual). I have noticed that my hair is shedding a lot less, and the softness is to die for. Two thumbs up, definitely.
