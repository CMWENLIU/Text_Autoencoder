This is a serious shipment of Swedish Fish. Hefting these bags out of the box is a lot like standing on the slippery desk of a schooner in the Baltic sea.. except.. well, like with sugar water instead of salt water.<br /><br />Anyway these are nice soft (as in fresh-ish) Swedish Fish. There's even some stray piece of other candy from a factory, it looks like maybe a Sour Patch Kid or something, in the bag I haven't opened yet. Which totally lends to the illusion of a big net-full just reined in from the bottom of that sugary, sugary Baltic.<br /><br />This will keep my visitor cup running-eth over of Swedish Fish at the office for the winter.. and hopefully will not promote my pants size. If you were going to eat this many Swedish Fish, you'd need to order like some kind of Kama Sutra of ways to eat Swedish Fish to go with it. This is a massive haul of the good old chewy fellas, of the large variety. My only complaint is that it isn't like 100 pounds instead of 10 pounds. Ahoy.
