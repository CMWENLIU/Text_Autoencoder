These appeared singly in my local grocery store and in the 3 flavor pack in my local warehouse store (BJs) for about three bucks a canister.  They were marked as being for a limited time and they're all gone now, so the only place I know to get them is Amazon.  My stash of Mojito mix is already gone.<br /><br />The three flavors are Mojito, Margarita, and Appletini.  The Mojito and Margarita are refreshing and very similar to the real mixes that I get at the store.  The difference is, I can (and do!) drink this stuff all day long without any guilt since it's 5 calories a serving.<br /><br />Mojito: like limeade with a hint of mint, so good over ice!  Muddle some mint for an extra delicious treat, use club soda for mint juleps, or even add alcohol.<br />Margarita: tastes like Jose Cuervo margarita mixer to me, it even has the salty tang.<br />Appletini: the more I've had it, the less I like it. It's a bit strong on the fake-apple taste and smell, so it's like drinking a Jolly Rancher green apple candy.<br /><br />These are a wonderful treat!<br /><br />UPDATE: this is the response I got from Kraft when asking if these would be available.<br />We are delighted to hear of your interest in our CRYSTAL LIGHT Mocktail Powdered Soft Drink Mix.
