I've posted a previous review on Amazon for this product, however it doesn't seem to get pulled up most of the time.<br /><br />Chateau D'Lanz Swiss licorice is a wonderful taste experience.  IMO, Swiss Licorice has the richest, deepest, truest black licorice flavor of the 4 commercial GF black Licorice products I've tried (others: OrgraN, Belgian, Allen's).  It's even better than my homemade attempts at GF black licorice.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a total taste bliss-out.  It melts slowly, with each piece giving a lengthy gustatory experience.  IME, the slow-melting, big taste aspect of Swiss Licorice make it economical.  I don't find, as with other brands, that I need to gobble more and more of it.<br /><br />Swiss Licorice is a not a high-sugar product, IMO.  It also has some fiber, courtesy of acacia gum.  Possibly the combination of these 2 factors contributes to the "satisfying" (no need to binge) aspect.<br /><br />This product is less chewy than some of the other brands.  I thought I'd miss that, however the flavor & long-lastingness of Swiss Licorice trump chew, IMO.<br /><br />If you love black licorice, you owe it to yourself to try this product.  It's great for both regular black licorice fanatics, as well as celiac / gluten-intolerant black licorice devotees.<br /><br />Now if the Chateau could only come up with  the GF equivalent of cherry Nibs ...
