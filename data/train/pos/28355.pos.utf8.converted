Excellent falafel mix.  Spicy, but not too spicy, and contains just fava beans and chickpeas while some other brands leave out the fava beans and add wheat flour.  The instructions say add 1 cup water to 1 cup mix but that's too much water.  3/4 cup water is more reasonable.  You can always add more water if it's too thick.
