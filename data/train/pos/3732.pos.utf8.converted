I found these on Amazon a couple of years ago, and I thought they'd be like the ones you buy in the box at the store. I was really surprised. They are like the ones you buy individually. Each chocolate covered cherry is wrapped in red foil, and quite a bit larger. Very fresh and a whole mouth full of flavor. I bought a box of the milk chocolate and a box of the dark chocolate covered cherries and I love them both. I highly recommend them.
