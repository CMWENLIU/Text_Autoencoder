We have three cats in the household, and they all LOVE these treats - in all flavors.  In fact, we rattle the bag to get the kitties to come in at night - almost always works.  One cat is fussy and won't eat any treats but these.<br /><br />I'm not sure how "good" the treats are for their health - the package says "nutritionally complete and balanced", and the ingredients include taurine which is essential for cats.  I suspect a diet including kibble, "wet" food and occasional treats is ideal.
