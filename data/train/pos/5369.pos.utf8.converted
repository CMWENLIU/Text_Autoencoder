Not only is it a good replacement for those who don't want to drink soda, it's a great substitute for those of us who are simply looking for a cool, tasty beverage.  Not too strong but still quite flavorful.  There isn't a lot of carbonation, but enough to give it a nice little bite.<br /><br />The blackberry Izze isn't just blackberry juice, however, it's a blend with white grape, apple, lemon and raspberry along with blackberry.<br /><br />Subtle and tasty and even healthy.  I will be buying these regularly, especially throughout the summer.
