This pasta is delicious!  I've been eating low-carb for a couple of years now and I love all Atkins products.  Some of their bars taste better than regular candy bars and this pasta is so good!  I make it all the time with butter, broccoli, chicken, and a little parmesan and it's yummy :)  It's one of my favorite dinners to make and so easy!  Eating low-carb doesn't have to restrictive :)
