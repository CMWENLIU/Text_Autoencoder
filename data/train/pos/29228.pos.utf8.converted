This is amazing stuff! I had been hunting for a few months for Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning, which I'd read rave reviews for. It's not available locally, Amazon wouldn't ship it to Hawaii, and other retailers wanted to sell me a dozen shakers and charge more for the shipping than the product. Frustrated, I hunted until I found Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt. There were only 3 reviews, but the price tag was only about [...] with free shipping and YES, Amazon would ship it to Hawaii.<br /><br />Wowie-Zowie! The flavor may be artificial, but I swear it tastes JUST like the stuff at the movie theater. Even blisters my lip the same way if I eat enough of it! So glad I took this $10 gamble. LOVE the product. I had an old salt shaker in the cabinet, so dispensing is not a problem. Agree with other comments...odd choice of packaging. Wonder why they decided to put it in a package better suited for a fifth of rum. Never mind the package...the product is terrific.
