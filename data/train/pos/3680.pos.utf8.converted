Some days the only cure for a hot summer afternoon is a cool Pina Colada, but one done right. For that job you will need one can of Coco Lopez, 1 46oz. can of pineapple juice, and some Half & Half. Now you're in bidness. Just make sure you warm this magical stuff in/under hot water before opening the can.<br /><br />And if you prefer a non-alchohol drink, then just mix as above with about 4 ozs. half & half and store in the fridge for up to a week. Very refreshing.
