Good values: no fat, high fiber, high protein, NO CHEMICAL ADDITIVES!<br />For my diet this is a great lunch at a very reasonable price. I like the taste too. I am not vegan or even vegetarian, but limit my intake of animal products where possible. All-in-all a very good deal. I followed my initial purchase of one box with a second purchase of three more. I keep a supply on hand now.
