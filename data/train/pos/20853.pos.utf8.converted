This product is delicious! The price was so much better than what I had been paying for Quinoa at Whole Foods. When my first order arrived, the plastic bag it was mailed in had split during shipping. It was difficult scooping the Quinoa out and dealing with it. I decided to send an email to let the company know they should use stronger bags for shipping. They mailed me another 10 pound bag free!!! It, thankfully, arrived in great shape. I was not expecting that kind of great customer service!!<br /><br />I cook the Quinoa in water with chopped garlic and it is heavenly. I love this product!!
