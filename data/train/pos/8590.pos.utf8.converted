I am completely addicted to these things and I eat them all day, every day. This is the best brand because they are made only with olive oil, not canola oil. I read the post from the person who thinks they taste like the bottom of the sea, and felt the need to post my opposite opinion. Yes, there are some people who have not acquired a taste for seaweed (my daughter for one). But for anyone who likes sushi, they would probably LOVE these seaweed snacks. I felt in love the first time I bit into one, and always keeps a couple cases at my house.
