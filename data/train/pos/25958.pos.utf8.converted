I have recently went on a low carb lifestyle CHANGE. My father has diabetes, and him going on dialysis was the final wake up call for me to get it together. My doctor told me I am morbidly obese, so I said to myself "Change must come" I was looking for something to fix my bread fix as I have already replaced my pasta fix. I found this low carb focaccia bread recipe , and it called for this product. This bread was delicious  and I used it with my infamous chicken salad and it was delicious! You really can't tell the difference in taste and so so easy to make. I don't have any reason to buy grocery store bread any more. Warning: you will be going to the bathroom!
