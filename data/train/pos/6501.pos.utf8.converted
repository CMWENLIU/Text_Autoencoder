I used this product, along with kelp, to make dashi. Basically, the recipe is to bring water to a boil with the kelp ( a 4 or 5 inch long piece), then add the bonito flakes (sprinkle the surface of the water, as if you were feeding fish), stir, and let the water cool down. Strain and you have dashi!<br /> A lot of people use instant dashi but I think the taste of freshly made dashi is incomparable. Good for making miso soup (add in some miso and maybe a little bit of tofu).<br /> Dashi is a basic ingredient in Japanese cooking. It's as common as chicken broth in recipes!<br /> This product (Nishimoto brand) was flavorful. I would buy it again and probably will.
