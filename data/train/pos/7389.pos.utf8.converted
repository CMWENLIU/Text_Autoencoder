When I first saw the hummus dip package I was wondering how I was going to get it open without a scissors but it opened easily just by tearing it open with my hands. The hummus is actually some of the best I've ever had and this one is especially lemony. This box also contains a package of dry roasted soy beans, spicy and sweet fruit and nut mix and a small bar of dark chocolate. This is one of GoPicnic's more exotic selections. While these boxes work well while traveling, they are also good for breakfast or lunch at home when you are not in the mood to cook. You can also keep a few boxes at work or in the car for an instant meal. I must say that the chocolate in this box is some of the best I've ever tasted - so smooth and creamy for a dark chocolate.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
