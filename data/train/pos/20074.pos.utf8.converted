I agree... these are perfect with tea. They are just the right amount of sweetness and the texture is wonderful. A satisfying treat.<br /><br />Here in the states I have found them at Wegman's and also at a small 'health-oriented' grocery.<br /><br />I wish they were organic (like the Dove brand in the UK) but I am glad to find these have no hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />The Amazon 3-pak for $11-12 is a good price.
