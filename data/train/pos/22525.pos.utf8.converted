I had been searching for quite sometime for affordable rice bran oil and this was the most reasonable Ive found and its great. My horse ver recommended 4oz. a day of this oil for my horse to help him gain weight. Worked wonders. He is now at perfect weight and it also helped with muscle and his coat looks soo shiny and healthy. great product can use for dogs and cats too to promote weight gain or help with coats. Tried cooking up my tofu with this also and it tasted really good. all around great stuff.
