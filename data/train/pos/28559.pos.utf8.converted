EDIT:  I found an even better way to work this stuff.  Read on for good tips.<br /><br />Buy TWO (or more) bottles of the same juice.  Apple or peach grape are good options.  Let one ferment out dry...takes about a week.<br /><br />Then, pour about 75% out into a pitcher.  Refill the original container with fresh juice.  Put the vapor lock back on...you've created Batch #2.<br /><br />Pour the pitcher of dry alcoholic juice into the new container (with 25% juice).  Squeeze the bottle to remove the rest of the air.  Re-install the lid.  Wait 24-48 hours until the bottle is stiff again and then refrigerate.  Drink and enjoy perfectly sweet/dry/carbonated spiked juice.<br /><br />The advantages?<br /><br />1.  No worrying about how long it'll take to ferment.  You can run your first bottle dry and then add the fresh juice right before the weekend to prime the carbonation.  You can leave the first bottle with vapor lock in a finished fermentation state for days/weeks without issue.<br />2.  You control the sweetness/dryness.  Vary the mix ratio to suit your taste.<br />3.  You control the carbonation.  Adjust the refrigeration and/or vent carbonation to avoid overpressure.  (Squeezing out all the air helps prevent oxidation).<br />4.  You get cleaner drink.  The yeast drops out of suspension and is left in the next batch.<br />5.  YOU REUSE THE YEAST AND SAVE MONEY!  Do this just once per batch and you cut your cost by 50%.  Plus the next batch starts up quicker than if you'd pitched new yeast.<br /><br />As a side note, this yeast is particularly well-suited for this task.  I tried some white wine yeast once and it turned my apple juice into a STINKY ROTTEN EGG SULFUR BOMB!  No kidding....the yeast got all stressed out and burped sulfur.  Yuck.  This yeast has never let me down in 10-20 batches.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Wow, this stuff is fun.  Thankfully, it comes in double kits so you can experiment faster ( or make twice as much) without waiting.<br /><br />Go grab a variety of 64oz 100% juice bottles from Trader Joes.  I've tried pear cider and blackberry so far...and both worked great.  Or save some money and get apple juice or peach grape from Walmart.  Choose your poison.<br /><br />Check it after 2 days.  You'll probably want to go 3 or 4 days to get rid of a good amount of sugar and get enough alcohol.  But check it daily after that, as the fermentation will be geometrically faster as the yeast multiply.  After 4 days, you'll probably have a much drier taste...too dry for some.<br /><br />I use a strainer to filter out the largest chunks of dead yeast, but they won't hurt you.<br /><br />And I left the cap on in the fridge to have the residual yeast carbonate the drink.  Yes, I was risking explosion, but it tastes MUCH better. And the cold temperature slows the fermentation...just check the bottle rigidity twice a day.  If it's too stiff, HAVE A DRINK!  The nice thing is, it'll repressurize itself a bit, unlike soda that goes flat after you open it.<br /><br />Give it a try....you can't go wrong.
