I first discovered Bentley's tea by purchasing an assortment of tea like this in order to have a nice container.  What I was surprised by was how great the teas are.  The teas (except for the green tea) are black-tea based and all but the English Breakfast are flavored (none are herbal like a previous review implied). The black tea base is the smoothest black tea I've ever encountered.  It really has an outstanding flavor.  The flavored versions seem to use this tea base and add a flavor above it.  The flavor isn't as strong as in many teas.  However, given how good the black tea that Bentley's uses tastes, it shouldn't be.<br /><br />By ordering this off Amazon, I'm not paying any more than tea costs in the supermarket on sale, and getting far better tea.  Hope you enjoy this tea as much as I do!
