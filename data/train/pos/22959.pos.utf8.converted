Yes, it has bones and skin in it.  I never knew you could buy canned salmon any other way!  So to me this is fine.  Plus, the skin has the fat in it, and it's the fat (omega-3 fats) that you want, so bring on the skin.  Is it as pristine and beautiful as it could be?  Probably not.  Most Roland products I've tried were more like the way supermarket canned brands look next to the appearance of the famous named brands, if you know what I mean, but you can't really do a whole lot to mess up a salmon.<br /><br />And I will have to say, this is a product of the USA and I like that.  I'm probably showing prejudice, but sometimes I kind of wonder what might be going into canned seafoods when they come from other countries--I've heard they can be grown in polluted water, for example--so I like to see this coming from Alaska.<br /><br />So five stars on this salmon.
