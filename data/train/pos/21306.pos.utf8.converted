I was originally hesitant to try these given the mixed reviews. I really love buckwheat and use it in a variety of different ways including as a hot morning cereal, fresh ground for homemade bread and  pancakes (nothing beats fresh ground buckwheat flour made into pancakes with 100 wholesome maple syrup) and even in a type of pilaf. After re-reading a few things it appears there are some misconceptions about this product...<br /><br />1. - This is indeed raw and whole grain groats. If you are searching for roasted/toasted buckwheat you need to keep searching. If you are searching for partially ground, flaked, rolled, etc you also need to keep looking. For those that are familiar with Kasha - this is not roasted nor partially broken...when cooked it will turn into little round balls rather like tapioca.<br /><br />2. Not mushy...try this a few times to get the cooking correct. I eat this for breakfast with a little honey several times  per week and it is excellent. No gluten, lots of nutrition including most essential amino acids, very little fat/calories...it's nearly the perfect food. Bring the water to a boil, put in the groats, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for a few minutes. Keep an eye on it - the buckwheat will "puff" and become soft. After a few attempts you will learn to recognize the preferred consistency that suites you best.<br /><br />3. Superb nutrition & versatile. Buckwheat should be considered a super-food it's so nutritious without all the other garbage. It's also incredibly versatile - from a hot breakfast cereal (boil and use a touch of honey) to fresh ground for bread (bread makers, use about 1:4 ratio with fresh ground whole wheat...since this has no gluten the wheat will allow it to rise while the buckwheat adds essential nutrients the wheat lacks. For those with a gluten intolerance, buckwheat is a superb alternative and can be used to create bread without any gluten but you will need to use an enhancer to help it rise.
