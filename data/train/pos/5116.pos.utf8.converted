I found this VERY delicious - to me it tasted like a good dish at a Chinese restaurant - spicy and flavorful.  My only caution is that the box is TWO servings, not one, so the calories aren't a nice, low 170 - it's 340 if you eat the whole thing (which is VERY easy to do).  I don't know if it should have been named 'Spicy Szechuan' because the paste included is actually made from a Korean dish - gochujang red chili paste - but I found this VERY tasty!<br />Pros: made in USA, natural ingredients, no MSG or preservatives<br />Cons: 2 servings as packaged so 340 calories, 58g carbs and 38% of daily sodium.
