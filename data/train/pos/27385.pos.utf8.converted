I was so happy to find this product since my son has a severe egg allergy, but I was a little skeptical at first.<br />How well could it possibly work to flavor and bind food?  Well, it's AWESOME!!!<br />I've used it in baked goods like muffins and cakes and it comes out perfectly.<br />This year I used it in our pumpkin pies and everyone in the family said it was the best they've tasted.<br />Also did some french toast with it.  Even though the box says you can't make "scrambled eggs" with it I thought it was<br />worth a try since I just needed to dip them in the egg, milk mixture.  Well, needless to say, we had to buy more bread<br />because we wanted to have french toast again the next day.  =)
