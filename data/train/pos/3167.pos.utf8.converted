You can find this tea for just over $5.00 in many Asian food markets.  It is well worth the cost.  This is a great tasting tea.  I have had some oolong/wulong teas that tasted like steeped twigs.  This is not one of them.  If you steep this tea for less than 3 minutes, you can still get a good tasting cup of tea from a second brewing with the same tea bag.  If you don't microwave (or boil) your tea water with the tea bag in it, you can even get a pretty decent third cup of tea!  You'll find that when you are brewing a pot of tea for yourself & friends, you will only need 1 or 2 bags to make a whole pot!
