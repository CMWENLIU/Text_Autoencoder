I lived in Japan for 4 years so perhaps I was predisposed to like this sort of thing, but after trying it once at a Japanese restaurant, I was hook.  I recently found this product and recommend it highly.<br /><br />One teabag makes a large pitch of this pleasant, mild tea.  It's taste reminds me a bit of Sugar Smacks without the sugar, or even Sheerios.  Doesn't sound like a good taste for tea you say?  Well, you'd be suprised.  A co-worker who tasted it said it reminds her of coffee, which I can see too.<br /><br />Recent studies have shown it has many health benefits, including the ability to improve the fludity of the blood.  I'm not sure how that translates into overall well being, but I know that drinking it makes me feel healthy, and I enjoy the flavor.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea (sorry, had to), but it is worth trying at least once I'd say.  I have a container at work and I sip iced Barley tea throughout the day.
