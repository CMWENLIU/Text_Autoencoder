I love peanut butter, I eat too much and it's very fattening. It's one of the foods we have in our home all the time, therefore I eat it all the time. I have tried so many shakes, drinks, mixes, low fat this, low carb that, appetite controllers, bars and diets that I figured this couldn't be any worse, especially given the reviews. It came today and we have made one PB@ & J sammy, one smoothie and one low carb wrap with PB2. A 9 year old, a 21 year old and mom (me) love it. It tastes like peanut butter right out of the jar. We have stuck to the natural peanut butters with no added oil or sugars so the less sweet taste is perfect. If you use sweetened peanut butter, you may find it not sweet enough. I'm never going to buy regular peanut butter ever again. This stuff rocks, try it, you won't be sorry.
