I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate "liver spots"  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few "liver" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,
