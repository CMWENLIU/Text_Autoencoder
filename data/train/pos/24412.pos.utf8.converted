Having a child on a gluten free, casein free diet has proven to be quite challenging, and we continue to try new foods.  I must say, Mrs. Leeper's Organic Rice Spaghetti is by far the best rice pasta we have tried yet!  Unlike other rice spaghetti we have tried, Mrs. Leeper's does not fall apart into little rice pieces while cooking, and it even stays together if it gets overcooked a little bit.  The texture is great, taste is excellent, and I'd highly recommend this product to others, including those on gluten free / casein free diets.
