I purchased this teapot for a friend's birthday present. I figured it would be a novelty because she loves tea sets... Her reaction was stunning, though! She is absolutely nuts over this little glass teapot and beautiful flowering teas. She called me when she opened the package and saw the bamboo box. Then she called me again when she opened the box and saw the tea pot and bundles of wrapped tea leaves. She just e-mailed me because she was finally done playing with the tea bundles and made a pot - her first try was the 'Jasmine Pearl' - she said it smelled heavenly and her husband said the flavor was excellent and the whole process reminded him of an opportunity he'd had to spend time w/a tea master in Berkeley.<br /><br />All in all, this was a big hit with my friend, and her surprise and enjoyment speaks volumes of the quality of the product.
