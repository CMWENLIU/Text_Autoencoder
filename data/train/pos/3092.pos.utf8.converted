We have gotten into reviving old cocktail recipes, ie Manhattan, Old Fashioned, etc.  Many of these call for maraschino cherries, which usually means the neon red plastic super sweet tasteless things in the jar at the supermarket. We ordered Luxardo cherries from Italy and WOW!  These are the real thing. The cocktails are so much better.  As usual, when you decide to make something yourself, always use the best ingredients. You will be rewarded when you taste the results. These cherries are great!
