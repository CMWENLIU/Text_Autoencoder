I made just a single bag of this soup mix for my work lunches and added some fresh mixed vegetables, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar -- the soup came out more like a stew (because I used some starchy veggies) and I loved the chewy texture the barley added and the creaminess of the split peas.  I must have gotten at least 2 gallons of soup from this single bag and I'm still eating it a week later, having frozen some of it.  Very frugal and healthy!
