Cento still maintains its perfect record in my kitchen. I have never been disappointed in the quality of their products and these quartered artichoke hearts are no exception. They are medium size quartered chokes - just right for almost all recipes. They are packed tightly in the can so you get what you pay for.<br /><br />The sections are tender but not mushy - no tough outer leaves either and not over salty - just the clean natural taste you would expect.<br /><br />With subscription pricing you can't beat the price.
