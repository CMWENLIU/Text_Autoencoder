started on this in the hope of losing some weight and lowering my cholesterol. After about 5 weeks by LDL dropped about 7% (176 to 163) and my HDL increased by about 5% (from 40 to 42). This with absolutely no excercise; just limiting myself re fat and calories. My total stayed high at 257, but the ratio improved from about 4.4 to 3.6 - - - My weight dropped by 3.3% - -  The cereal is good by itself, but I add real maple syrup and either raisins/craisins or chopped dates to make it a real treat either for bFast or a late night snack when I'd otherwise go for potato chips or the like...
