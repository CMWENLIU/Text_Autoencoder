These oat cakes are really more like super-crumbly crackers... and they are quite good, even if they are heinously overpriced.  I enjoy eating them by themselves, they have a variety of textures and layers of flavor; a great substitute for other mindless eating, and one small packet can be stretched out for a while.  Interestingly enough, the organic version tastes saltier (pleasant surprise) but both their plain oat varieties are quite good.<br /><br />I also like that each box contains more than one sealed packet, so you can eat a few at one sitting and save the others without worrying about them going stale.  A nice touch; very considerate of the consumer.
