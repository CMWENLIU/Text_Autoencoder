THESE ARE WHOLE CHIA SEEDS--not powder<br />Someone reviewed that they wish they'd known these weren't seeds, they must have just received the wrong item.  I purchased these and both bags were filled with whole blackish chia seeds.  Just what I ordered, and at an amazing price.<br /><br />Love the zip loc strip on the bag.
