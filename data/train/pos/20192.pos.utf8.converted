I had to put my son on a gluten free diet, but had a hard time finding an alternative carb source for him.  He refused any of the gluten-free oatmeals I cooked or rice breads.  He was use to his Quaker apple cinnamon instant oatmeal, and this is very similar in texture and taste.  I just add a couple spoonfuls of natural applesauce to sweeten it more, and he eats the whole bowl.  If you are looking for an alternative to the Quaker instant oatmeal packs, this will work out great for you.  My child is super picky, and this past the test with flying colors.
