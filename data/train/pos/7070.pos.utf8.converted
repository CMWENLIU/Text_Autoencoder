This is a wonderful set.  It was originally created as a supplement to the book Ajanta - Regional Feasts of India by the author (who runs a lovely Indian restaurant in Berkeley, CA) Lachu Moorjani.<br /><br />There are 30 separately packed spices proportionate to their probably use.  I love it because I didn't have to purchase each spice, which is often quite expensive, especially when shipping and handling are added.<br /><br />The spices are:<br />Ajwain<br />Asafetida<br />Black Mustard Seeds<br />Black Cumin Seeds<br />Black Salt Powder<br />Cardamom Powder & Pods<br />Cinnamon Sticks<br />Cloves<br />Coriander Powder & Seeds<br />Cumin Powder & Seeds<br />Chile Pepper Flakes<br />Whole Red Chile Peppers<br />Chile Pepper Powder - Hot<br />Garam Masala<br />Dried Pomegranate Powder & Seeds<br />Dried Fenugreek Herb & Seeds<br />Fennel (Anise) Powder & Seeds<br />Mango Powder<br />Nigella Seeds<br />Paprika<br />Tamarind<br />Tumeric (sic)<br />White Pepper Powder<br />White Poppy Seeds<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586857770">Ajanta: Regional Feasts of India</a>
