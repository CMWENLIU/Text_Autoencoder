The vanilla beans arrived still moist, and plump. They're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at Whole Foods or Wild Oats, which are very dry and shriveled by comparison, not to mention overpriced.<br /><br />The fragrance is overpowering, and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee.  Don't throw away your used vanilla pods!  Save them to flavor your sugar.
