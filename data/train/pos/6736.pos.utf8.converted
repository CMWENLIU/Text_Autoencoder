This coffee has the best flavor of any k- cup we have tried. It has a different nutty flavor. We have been through everything from strabucks, green mountain, emrils, folgers, caribou, newmans, etc. I will say that a few coffee grounds make it into the cup, but that doesn't bother me. We will be trying the other flavors ASAP.
