Okay, after 6 years gluten free and trying every GF food product I can find, these little rolls are one of the only REALLY good GF bread products I have encountered. They are easy to prepare (8 min in my toaster oven works perfect-o)and they taste like real bread -- not dry crumbly and flavorless like most GF breads.<br />My only wish is that Schar made them in the size of hoagie (sub) rolls with sesame seeds on top so that I could make a real sub sandwich again. (Are you listening Schar?)<br />I used to do all the GF bread mixes from scratch in my bread machine, and some are pretty decent, but these little rolls are WAY better. In fact, they taste much better than any of Schar's other breads -- weird, I know, but try them and you will see.
