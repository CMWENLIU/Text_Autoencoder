Good vegan-friendly baked beans in a tomato-based, rather than brown sugar and molasses-based, sauce.  Nicely spiced, relatively simple baked beans, the way they were meant to be.  I haven't found a better price for them in America, than Amazon's subscription service by the case.<br /><br />They're less sweet than other kinds, such as the Heinz Vegetarian Beans usually sold in America, and have about 35% fewer calories due to having less sugar.  The can I have lists 90 calories per serving, 3 servings per can.<br /><br />Strange "how to play with this food" suggestion:  corrupt your basic beans by adding chunks of green pepper, onion, green olive with pimento and/or (yes, really) radish.  The sauce for these beans works well with all of the above.  I grew up, in the days before ramen, considering a small can of baked beans heated with sliced radishes mixed in, to be an excellent budget dinner.  (Hey, if they work with tacos at Mexican restaurants, WHY NOT with beans?)<br /><br />And yes, they do make a good breakfast, served over toast, perhaps with some sauteed mushroom slices.  As I'm vegan, I've had to be creative at breakfast, when all my friends are eating egg and cheese dishes.<br /><br />Important:  Don't have these in your carry-on when going through an airport gate, no matter how handy of a quick snack they seem to be, with most even being packed with a pull-top lid.  There has been no sadder sight to me than having to head to the gate with my cans of Heinz Beans sitting on top of the x-ray machine as "confiscated goods" because of the liquid they contain, ahead of a 20 hour trip. (!)  That said, they work well for train journeys, because they taste nearly as good cold as they do warm, and unlike other kinds of canned beans, don't need to be rinsed before eating.
