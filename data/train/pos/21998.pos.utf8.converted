Food and drinks in pouches are life savers!!! The apple sauce taste as good, if not better than those in jars. Huge advantages are that they fit nicely into back packs, no spoon requirement, one had eating action, and a great quick snack. If they can put more stuff into travel pack like this, I would eat and drink everything from pouches. One complaint is the packaging. They waste way too much packing material for the bulk box. It's 4 pouches inside a card board box, then 12 of those boxes in another box. I don't plan of selling these goodies so I can do without the extra packaging. Go cheap on the extra cardboard and pass the savings on to the customers.
