I'm trying to eat a heathier diet.  As for fish, unless it is deep fried and served with fries, salt, and a sea of vinegar I don't eat it.  But I decided to try these, and YUMMY!!!  I can actually eat fish without the bad fat, hooray!  I've tried the plain with olive oil and didn't like that, but I really like these Mediterranean ones.  They are very flavorful and take away the icky fish factor.  I would really recommend this to anyone who wants to try eating, fish but is leery of fishyness that keeps them away.
