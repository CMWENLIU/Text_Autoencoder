I know this is a gross title for a review, but it's true. You can tell a lot about the quality of dog food and its ingredients by the consistency and quantity of dog poop.  I've tried a lot of high-end dog foods before finally settling on Innova EVO. The ingredients and the nutritional composition were exactly what I was looking for, and my Bichon Frise and Havanese absolutely love this food.  And I can tell they're absorbing the nutrients from this food because their poops are smaller, firm (but not hard), and regular.
