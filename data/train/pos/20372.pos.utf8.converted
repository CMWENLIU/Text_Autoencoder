I have had trouble finding a good spicy hot curry powder in Colorado, so I was delighted to find this.  Since it didn't say 'hot' I was afraid it wouldn't be hot enough, but that wasn't a problem.  Yes, it is high in sodium, but I just don't add any more salt to my curries and use much less in cooking the rice to go with it than I might with a less salty curry powder.
