Ro-Tel has a variety of diced tomatoes flavored for every taste.  For fresh, home style salsa, you can't beat their Lime and Cilantro version.  For tacos, use the Medium Hot version.  But the hands down, all around best is their Hot Diced Tomatoes with Habanero.<br /><br />If you love hot Mexican cooking like I do, you'll think you died and went to Heaven with this!  It is definitely NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!  Habanero is the hottest of all the peppers you can eat.  It is off the Scovill Scale of hotness like Einstein is off the IQ scale.  But, at the same time, it is versatile and its uses are only limited by your imagination.  Need to tone it down, add some sour cream or Philly cream cheese, or drain off the water in the can and mix into your recipe that way.  Mix it into chili and simmer it down with lots of water for superb flavor and eye-watering heat.  For parties, stir into a pot of nacho cheese for a zip that everybody will remember.<br /><br />Can you tell I love this stuff? But don't take my word for it, try it yourself -- you'll love it!
