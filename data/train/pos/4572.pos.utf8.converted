When I was in college, some missionaries once introduced me to sticky rice balls served with sweetened condensed milk (or hot sauce). I haven't had it since then, until I saw this kit. I have to make it on a day I plan to be home because the rice has to soak for 4-6 hours before it's steamed. And then the rice has to steam for 45 minutes. But the end product is delicious... Enjoy.
