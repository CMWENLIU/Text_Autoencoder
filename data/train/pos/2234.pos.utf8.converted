I have trouble getting to sleep and sleeping soundly.  I have heard from a few people and saw on Dr.Oz (lol...yes, I try some of the things he suggests) that a few ounces of 100% unsweetened 'pie cherry' juice (which I have since found out is Montmorency cherry juice) can be of help.  Well...it is helping me...and its full of antioxidants too...another good reason to have a sip of this juice daily.  Have read more and I now know that this juice is full of tryptophan, the same stuff in turkey =) that helps you feel so snoozy!  I shopped around in Amazon AND in local stores, this is THE best price.  8 plastic jugs came cardboard divided, in a box,<br />I will be purchasing from this seller again through Amazon.  A Made in Michigan product.  (PS/this is TART but not unpleasant in the least, to me its not as tart<br />as cranberry juice.  It made me remember the days of my Nana making cherry pies<br />and I got to drink the left over cherry juice...its the same juice)
