I have no complaints about the food at all; it seems to be a high quality, low phosphorus food for cats with chronic renal failure (CRF).  My CRF cat is really finicky though, but he eats it pretty good.  The food is very moist, which most cats seem to like.  I do mix even more water into the food to make a gravy, just so he gets extra water.  The food was shipped in a timely manner, and overally, I have no complaints.
