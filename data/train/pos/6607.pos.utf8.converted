... here's a gift. I  didn't expect to find fresh gooseberries for sale on amazon, and I can't pretend that these canned gooseberries are "just as good as ,,, {Hold the press! I just heard the news that Osama bin Laden has been located and killed by US Special Forces! Wow. I won't miss him. Congratulations to President Barack Hussein Obama and all those who participated in this successful action!} ... fresh gooseberries. But last winter my wife made a very tasty pie with this very brand of gooseberries in light syrup, essentially following the recipe for a sour cherry pie.<br /><br />Now here's an even better idea: in your favorite recipe combining rhubarb and strawberries -- pie, crisp, tart, or jam -- use gooseberries instead of strawberries!
