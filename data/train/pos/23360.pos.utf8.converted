An excellent product, superior to Tinkyada in that it does not have the slightly bitter brown-rice aftertaste my family dislikes in spaghetti.  (Although in general Tinkyada - especially the macaroni - is very good.) Can be substituted for wheat spaghetti with even the pickiest eater.<br /><br />Like all brown pastas I've tried, Jovial has the advantage of absorbing sauces better than wheat pasta, giving the finished dish a deep and satisfying flavor. It also has the rice-pasta tendency to clump and/or turn mushy unless cooked very carefully.<br /><br />Here is cooking the method I recommend (adopted from the Tinkyada packages):<br />*Bring water to full boil<br />*Add pasta slowly, a few pieces at a time, stirring gently to make sure it doesn't stick together<br />*Boil gently 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently<br />*Turn off the burner, cover and let the pasta finish cooking in hot water (excessive boiling breaks the delicate pasta to mush)<br />*After 5 minutes, stir pasta and check for doneness.<br />*Continue stirring and checking just about every minute after that. Pasta is done when it is very slightly al-dente. Do *not* overcook.<br />*Drain and (optionally) rinse pasta under a gentle tap.<br />*Stir in sauce or a little olive oil immediately to prevent clumping<br /><br />Enjoy!
