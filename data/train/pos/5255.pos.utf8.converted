The best cashews I've found.  I love that they're just cashews and sea salt, roasted dry without added oils.  Total fat 13 grams (sat. 2 g; trans 0 g; poly. 2.5 g; mono. 7 g.); chol. 0 mg.; sodium 100 mg.; potassium 190 mg.; carb 9 grams (sugar 2 g.); protein 5 grams.  Ten servings per 10-ounce package, but I could eat two or three ounces at a sitting.  I love these tasty nuts.  A great snack that does not raise my blood sugar.  Try them at a meal served over salad, cooked vegetables, chicken, pork, fish.  Amazon's price is about the same as in the supermarket but with the added advantage that they're shipped to your door.  Enjoy!
