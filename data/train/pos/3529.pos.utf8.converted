The strawberry banana flavor of this individually packaged drink mix is really out-of-this-world! It's as good as the far more expensive bottled drinks. The packaging is ultra-convenient, and saves me the hassle of carrying in cans of diet soda. Besides, who really needs the carbonation?<br /><br />Now, as for the "hunger satisfaction" part -- I can't believe it, but it really does seem to work. Now, it is true that if I drank plain water before a meal, it would also kill my hunger. However, the taste of this stuff is so great that it really does satisfy my craving for something sweet. So, if this is "science," "magic," or my will to believe in the power of Crystal Light -- I don't know. But, the bottom line is that this is a great product that I've already purchased several times, and will continue to buy.
