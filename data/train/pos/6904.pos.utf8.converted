I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.<br /><br />Not this hot sauce.  It's perfectly hot enough, yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle.  I put it on everything:  Burger too blah with the normal condiments, El Yucateco can fix it!  Shrimp cocktail not kicking, El Yucateco will show those shrimp who's boss.  I even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat.<br /><br />It's definitely hot.  If all you're used to is normal, red-colored vinegar water, this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire.  But, if you're looking for something with good flavor that'll keep you coming back for more, this is the stuff.
