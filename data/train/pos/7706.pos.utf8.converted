I've recently gone on a health kick.  One of my new regimens is taking cayenne pepper on a daily basis.  I knew the small grocery store containers wouldn't be very economical for my purpose and had also read that the hotter the pepper the better so I went straight to Amazon.  Of all of the different offerings I found, this one seemed to be the best deal.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.  It came in two separate mylar bags of 1lb. each.  The bags aren't resealable so I had to put it into another container. I found that one bag fits perfectly into a 1 quart Mason jar.  I will say that taking cayenne pepper all by itself is not an easy thing to do, but I'm getting used to it.  It helps that this pepper has an excellent flavor.  It's not all heat.  So, whether you are using it in a recipe, making your own hot sauce or taking it as a daily supplement, I think you will be satisfied with the flavor and heat of Frontier's ground chili peppers.  And the price is hard to beat.<br /><br />For those of you who are new to taking cayenne pepper as a daily supplement or are considering it, here's my experience:  The first time I tried it I used 1tsp. in 8oz. of warm water as a sort of tea as I had read on several different natural health forums.  I found that it was way too hot for me and 8oz. of it was a lot more than I could make myself drink.  My next attempt was 1tsp. dumped on the back of my tongue and washed down with plenty of cold water.. around 16oz.  I found that this was bearable, but that a full teaspoon was a lot to swallow. Much of it fell to the side between my cheek and gums... not pleasant.  I have since reduced the amount to 1/2tsp and found this to be optimum for me.  Surprisingly, there were no ill affects such as heartburn or reflux for me and have read that it will cure stomach ulcers.  My only warning is not to take it on an empty stomach.  My wife did that the first time she tried it and I'm not sure if I'll ever get her to try it again.
