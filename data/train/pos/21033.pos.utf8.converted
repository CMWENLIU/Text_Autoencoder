Red Bull (as everyone knows) basically started the buzz on energy drinks. It's full of B-vitamins, a bit of sugar (and a nice blast of caffeine just for good measure.) What makes this more popular than every other energy drink? It's CONSISTENTLY effective and NEVER overbearing. Red Bull isn't very sweet, and as such it goes down wonderfully at any time... It's a bit tart (which can take getting used to if you're a soda drinker) but generally has a very pleasing flavor. Plus, you know every time you pop open a can of Red Bull, you will get the desired result. Much like coffee, Red Bull is a tried and true boost that many swear by.<br /><br />My only reservation in recommending this drink is the artificial ingredients, which I feel bring the level of quality down a little bit... In my opinion, a drink that costs this much should use 100% natural ingredients... That being said, at least the original Red Bull uses natural sugar and is free of nasty preservatives.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
