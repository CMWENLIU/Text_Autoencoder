At $45.99, this price is a great deal BUT when you add the $17.02 shipping, the total comes to $63.01!  I can buy this locally for $54.95 plus 6.5% tax for a total of $58.58!  I have check other places online and I have come to the conclusion that buying locally is the least expensive.<br /><br />I have been feeding Natura's Innova dry puppy and, later, large breed dog food to my 1-year old Golden Retriever mix since I adopted him at 11-weeks, and, the past few years, Innova Senior to my 11-year old Lab mix, 4 cups a day for the former who is almost 80-pounds, and 2 cups a day for the latter who is 65-pounds.<br /><br />For years, I fed my Lab mix Science Diet because it was touted as  recommended by vets.  But, when skin issues developed (scratching) I started doing research and began my dog food education. I was surprised to learn about "sub-prime" ingredients and how much grain is used as filler.  I switched to Nutro for a few years and that helped the allergies.  More reading and I graduated to Innova.  Expensive?  Yes. I cringe every time I buy a bag and a part of me thinks there is a very large profit being made by the seller.  But, knowing that I am feeding a quality dog food to my dogs, priceless.  They are healthy, happy, and my Lab mix seldom scratches himself anymore.<br /><br />The next step up would be Natura's EVO, a no-grain food, but unlike cats whose main ingrediant in their diets must be meat and would benefit from a no-grain diet, a dog diet may include vegetables, grains, and fruits, so I will probably stick with Innova.<br /><br />So, 5-stars for the food, 0-stars for the "bargain" price.
