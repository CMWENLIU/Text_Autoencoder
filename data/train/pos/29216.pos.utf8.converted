One thing I missed in Chili when going low carb was the beans. While I would prefer Pinto Beans in my chili the black soy beans are a darn good alternative and at only one net gram of carb per serving you can't beat them. In addition, Amazon's price beats other sources.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the beans and Amazon.
