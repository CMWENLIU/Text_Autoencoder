I love pistachio nuts. So I tried these since the price was good and I am always looking for good products at low prices.<br />I wasn't disappointed. Out of the two jars of nuts, there were less than 5 duds (dried out or bad tasting nuts.<br /><br />There were less than 25 nuts that were not split open so no need for a nut cracker.<br /><br />The rest were very good to excellent in taste, ease of opening shells and amount of salt on them.<br /><br />The only problem was, I couldn't stop eating them so they only lasted less than a week. 3 1/2 pounds of pistachios in less than a week. I sure will be buying them again, but will wait a couple of months and eat pistachio ice cream in the meanwhile.<br /><br />Jewel Foods now has their own pistachio ice cream that is better than Ben and Jerry's and only costs $2.99 a half gallon instead of $4.50 a pint for B&J's. Just as many WHOLE pistachios in the ice cream (unlike the ground up ones Hagen Das uses) and the ice cream itself is creamier and better tasting than B&J's.
