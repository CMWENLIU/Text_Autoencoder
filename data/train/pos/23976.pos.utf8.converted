I'm on my third 32-ounce bottle in three days. You could almost live completely off this stuff. It looks green, yes, and everyone should really try it first with a blindfold on; the green somehow throws you off, you expect it to be gross, but it's sweet and fresh and filling. Not too thick, not too thin, delicious and so truly good for you. Spirlina is a pheominal nutrient/mineral rich food and it's in here and very expensive in the healthfood stores to buy seperately. I taste mostly pinnaple flavor in it, my step-son tastes mostly kiwi. It's vegan and kosher and made without any preservatives, colors, or GMO foods. I love it. My head feels clear, I feel calm and healthy drinking it. This is taking over my AM coffee for me. Much cheaper in the stores than advertised here currently. Enjoy, it's really really good for you.<br /><br />From their website on the product:--<br /><br />[Green Machine: apple and pear juice blend, pineapple juice, mango puree, kiwifruit puree, banana puree with powdered spirulina, chlorella, brocolli, green tea extract, spinach, barley grass, wheat grass, blue green algae, echinacea purpurea extract, odorless garlic!
