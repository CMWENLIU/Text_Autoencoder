Anytime we wash fresh fruits and veggies in Fit, it's obvious how well it works.<br /><br />The ridiculously dirty water that's left behind is a solid reminder that we used to eat all that crud. No thanks.<br /><br />We used to get Fit in stores; the price always got higher and higher until they stopped selling it. Finding it on Amazon at a reasonable price is terrific.<br /><br />We swirl a few batches of food in a bowl of water with Fit. Avoid washing food you won't consume within a few days, since cleaning off the outer layer of any food can limit storage life.
