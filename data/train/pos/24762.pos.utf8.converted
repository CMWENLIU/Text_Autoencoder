WOW.<br />WOW.<br />WOOOOW.<br /><br />I had the honour and the pleasure of eating these stroopwafels in Holland. It was my first trip there and I had eaten a few different brands and kinds previous to finally coming upon these bad boys and I have to say they were the BEST. Delicious with a hot beverage, magnificent on their own, even better shared with my brother and my mother. The only part I have to complain about is getting to the bottom of the tin when we were done with them...but that would have to be my fault. ;) ENJOY!
