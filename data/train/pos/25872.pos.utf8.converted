I use this all the time in lattes and frozen frappe coffee drinks.  Very smooth and doesn't have that alcohol bite regular vanilla extract.  A very small amount goes a long way.  Seems expensive, but it lasts a long time.  I highly recommend this if you want a smoother vanilla flavor for drinks.  I have not tried it yet in baked goods, but it should work there too.
