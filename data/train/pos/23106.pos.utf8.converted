What I first look for in a bag of cacao beans is size consistency. With some cacao bean products there are a lot of nib-type pieces and smaller, shriveled looking beans.  The vast majority of the Live Superfoods Raw Organic Cacao Beans were full and plump. They tasted very fresh all the way to the bottom of the bag.  I will be buying these beans from Superfoods again.
