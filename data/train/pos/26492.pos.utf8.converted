This is the best thing since coffee. I love DandyBlend. It is so different than other herbal beverages. Mellow and rich, and satisfying. I like to make flavored lattes and mocha's. It is good hot or iced too. I highly recommend this product if you are trying to avoid caffeine or if you want a delicious drink that is good for you too.
