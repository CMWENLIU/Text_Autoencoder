This is my usual, day-to-day, coffee and there's really not much I can write about it other then "its great", "the best I've tried and I've tried most all" and "its worth its price!".... blah blah blah.. its coffee! ... if you like it, then its good - if you dont, then it's not... Just like wine - dont let anyone tell you what to like.<br /><br />Here's what I *can* say though - this is the best price... especially when you setup a subscription through Amazon. My only wish is that they would carry the larger bags but given the price, I'm good with the smaller ones too... Each bag fills up my espresso machien (Jura Capresso E8) in full and carries me through a week of coffees (I have friends who come over frequently, so its not just my habit ;-).<br /><br />I setup a subscription for 2 X 4 bags every two months. When I need more, I just login and have my shipment sent out sooner... simple as pie.<br /><br />Enjoy!
