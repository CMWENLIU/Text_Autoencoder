I have a year and a half old chocolate Labrador retriever, Loki, that chews and chews hard. I bought this toy because a neighbor who has a yellow lab has had the same toy for over a year.  I can buy a toy and Loki will have it broken or severely damaged within minutes.  It's easy to kiss 10 dollar toys good bye in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br /> I have had the product for about a month and it is by far Loki's favorite toy, even without treats.  I have played tug of war, fetch, and other dog favorite games; the ball-like object is in perfect condition still.  He will carry the toy about the house in his mouth, very regal and proud looking, as if he's King In The Castle.<br /><br />Some dog toys over time will gain a very bad odor.  After a month of constant use, this thing does not give off an odor that I can tell.  I won't put my nose or mouth near it, but from a couple of feet away, it still seems to smell like new.  If this ever gains an odor of some sort, I will probably resort to washing it and then adding some vanilla extract to the water to give it a humanly pleasant flavor.  I have done this for other toys and Loki seems to have a renewed interest in them.<br /><br />I have not allowed him to take the toy outside as we have several feet of snow and that would just be begging to be lost.  Based on the design, this thing will be a dirt magnet on the inside, especially since my backyard is in quasi-woods with zero grass.<br /><br />The treats that came with it seemed to be enjoyable for Loki.  It took him about an hour and a half to eat.  He didn't figure out how to pop them out as some people have stated.  He just gnawed and licked it the whole time.  The treats are a bit expensive, as I can buy raw hides or real bones for less.<br /><br />Peanut butter is your friend.  Smear some on the inside and Loki goes crazy trying to lick and clear it.  You can break up dog treats or put dog food in it and it will slow them down.  Loki has become an expert at getting them out, removing them in less than a minute.<br /><br />With all of that said and done, I would highly recommend this treat to anyone who has a dog that can truly chew.  It has held up over a month, which is very rare for a dog toy, and it has done so with not a scratch or gouge to the toy which has never been done.  I put these on the same level as the dog toys from Old Navy!
