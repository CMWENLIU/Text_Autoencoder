I don't know how much you can write about Coconut Milk, but I will give it a shot!  This stuff is great.  Very flavorful, with a nice sublte coconut flavor, not sweet or icky thick.  I've found that with Organic Coconut Milk I have to open it with a can opener because sometimes the top gets hardened (coconut cream) and you have to scoop it out rather than pour it out.  I use a full can every morning for my protein shake.  Since using coconut milk, rather than cow's or soy my skin, hair, nails, well being have much improved.  I use coconut oil and milk daily and have noticed a significant improvement to my overall health.  I also began using coconut milk because of it's healthy benefits based on Bruce Fife's books on coconut oils.  I get a case of Roland Organic Coconut Milk (24 cans) sent to me monthly using Amazon's subscribe and save.  It is the best deal out there on the best product I have found!
