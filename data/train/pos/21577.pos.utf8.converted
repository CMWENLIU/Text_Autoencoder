I had never worked with Ghee before and I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased it.<br /><br />O.M.G...!<br /><br />Where has this been all my life?  It's officially become a cupboard resident right up there next to the olive oil, flour and salt.  I don't know how I managed to cook BEFORE I began using this product, but I know it's now permanently on my shopping list and I don't plan to run out of it.<br /><br />A little goes a long way...<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this to do a quick egg scramble.  I've used it for pancakes, sauteed veggies, even folded it into the mashed potatoes!  It's a miracle ingredient.  My family was going to throw out some cold french fries from the night before and I said, "No way!" In this economy, I'm watching every dime.  So, with just two teaspoons of ghee, I was able to crisp up the fries in the skillet. They were absolutely delicious, and because this ghee is unsalted, I can control the fat AND the salt in my dishes.  What a godsend.<br /><br />Best of all, it doesn't need refrigeration.  I keep it in the cupboard and at room temp, it's done just fine.  Then again, the longest a 28oz jar has lasted in this house has been one month.  I'm now upgrading to the 56oz jar as it's cheaper by the ounce.
