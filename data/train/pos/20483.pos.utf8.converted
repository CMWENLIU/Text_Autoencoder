I've been eating low carb for a while now and every once in a while make some type of low carb pancake. I tried the syrups that were sweetened with maltitol and they gave me a very upset stomach. I threw out the maltitol sweetened bottle and went in search of what other sugar free maple syrups were out there.<br /><br />I have been using mainly stevia for sweetening so I was SO happy to find this syrup, which is sweetened with Lo Han which is another natural herbal sweetener.<br /><br />It's a little on the thick side, but the flavor is great and you only need a little to get some great maple syrup flavor. Recommended!
