Skippy Honey Nut Peanut Butter Crunchy / B001E4S88W<br /><br />I saw this peanut butter on Amazon and couldn't wait to try it - the combination of honey and peanut butter makes my mouth water. I didn't want to order bulk without tasting it first, so I finally found it locally - but more expensive, of course. I was not disappointed - the peanut butter is absolutely wonderful, with hints of sweet honey throughout, but never cloying or unpleasant. This is the perfect peanut butter for a sandwich, and I usually take one to work with me at least once a week. There's no trans fat, although (of course) there is about 16 grams of fat per serving (2 Tbsp.), which is pretty standard for peanut butters.<br /><br />Having tried it, and loved it, I won't go back to other, non-honey peanut butters. Amazon offers a much better deal on bulk and peanut butter is about as non-perishable as food can get. The last order I received was in September, with a "best if used by" date of the next July, which is plenty of time to finish off the last bottle.<br /><br />This product contains peanuts, honey, sugar, molasses, hydrogenated vegetable oil (cottonseed and soybean), and salt, in case you might be allergic.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
