I was a little worried at first about ordering nuts online; was afraid they might taste old or stale. I was very pleasantly surprised with these!<br /><br />  They arrived quickly and well packaged in a strong envelope, double bagged and in great condition. The nuts themselves are large, whole and fresh - they taste like they were just cracked out of the shell! I would definitely order from this seller again.
