This is the best Pu-ehr available now on Amazon.<br />The earthy-ness that characterizes I would rank at<br />a 9 of 10. The flavor opens up with each sip as<br />it cools down while drinking. By the end of cup one<br />you are ready for more, and each tou che allows a<br />few steepings.<br /><br />Has the deep (and I mean deep) dark red of a good<br />dark Pu-ehr, and the flavor is rich, slight bitter after bite,<br />not unpleasing. If you like strong dark coffee, this would take<br />it's place in a heart beat.<br /><br />One thing not mentioned on the can, while water is set to boil, run<br />the lil' birds nest tou che under some hot water to "loosen" it proir to<br />steeping. Not special to this brand, is just the proper way to prepare<br />the beverage.
