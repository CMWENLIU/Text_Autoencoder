All Judy's sugar free products (and I think I've tried them all) are very well made. So many companies that make sugar free confections forget that just because they leave out the sugar, doesn't mean they should leave out other premium ingredients and flavor.<br /><br />With Judy's you can taste the premium nuts, the slow cooking and other factors that make good candy, whether sugar free or not. As with all sugar free candy using sugar alcohols, you have to watch your intake of this brittle or you'll be a frequent visitor to the bathroom.
