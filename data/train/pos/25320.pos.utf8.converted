I have four older cats.  One of them seemed very, very ill.  Two of them had horrible skin.  I changed their food to this after a trip to the vet.  Within a week - their skin was healthy again & they just looked gorgeous.  This is worth the $.  More than any of the Iams, Science Diet - any of them.  This is what cats would eat in the wild.  I am one of the cheapest people on the planet - but this is worth my hard earned $.  AND is way cheaper than a trip to the vet.  I truly believe this food saved my cat's life.
