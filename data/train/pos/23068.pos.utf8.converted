I can't say enough about this cat food!  My fifteen year old cat is diabetic and has been on insulin since July.  While he is not completely off it YET, I have reduced his insulin by two thirds and hope that he'll be able to be completely off.  The benefits don't stop there.  I have two other cats - one that used to throw up every day - and one that has no current health issues of any kind.  My kitty that used to get sick, for some reason, every day, has only had two episodes of throwing up since I changed her to the core cat food two months ago.  My other cat looks fabulous, sleek, glossy coat(the coat on my two kitties with health issues has improved as well!) and lean and not overweight.  The benefits don't stop there, though!!  An amazing difference in my litter boxes!!  Less waste to clean up and very low oder!  My vomiting kitty used to have very foul smelling bowel movements, too.  Now there is little to no odor at all.  Urine seems to have less ammonia smell as well.  A GREAT PRODUCT! - Low carb as well!
