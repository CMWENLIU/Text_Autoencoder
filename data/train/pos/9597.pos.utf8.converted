I was skeptical at first in spite of all the glowing reviews but this product is even better than described.<br />Everything germinated without any problems and I can hardly cut enough of the herbs to stop them from hitting the lightbulb which does burn them.<br />My only problem is that my cat seems to be addicted to the chives so i have yet to have enough to cut any for myself.<br />My one complaint is that the pole should be taller so the herbs could grow more without burning the ends.<br />Also,I would love something even bigger that could grow something like squash,bell peppers,cukes etc.<br />With gardens getting smaller and smaller this makes a lot of sense to me.<br />At any rate I am considering buying another one for tomatoes and greens or both and wonder if anyone has these placed in a room other than the kitchen?
