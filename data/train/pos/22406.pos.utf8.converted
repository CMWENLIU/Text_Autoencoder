dogfoodanalysis dot com rates all Orijen dog foods 6 out of 6. I had been feeding my puppy Natural Balance Organic Formula (no dairy, only one meat source), but after discovering that it was only rated a 4, I started looking into higher quality foods. Switching was super easy, my puppy loves Orijen. Since she's been on Orijen, I haven't noticed any smelly breath like she used to have, and her poop doesn't stink! I know it sounds crazy, I had read that in reviews about this food before, and could barely believe it but it's true. Orijen puppy has 10 total meat ingredients (it's 75% meat!), including fish, and no grains, which are not part of a wild dog's diet, instead having a good range of fruits and vegetables, as well as vitamins, minerals, and probiotics. All the ingredients Orijen uses are very high quality and their meat sources are closely monitored and sustainable. I've heard some people say that Orijen formulas are too rich for their dogs, so maybe don't try to switch from any really low end stuff. It is a high protein, low carb food, meant to mimic a wild dog's natural diet. I think this is about as close as you can get to that with a dry formula.<br />The only cons I can think of is that it's hard to find, there's only one place I can find that carries it locally (I live in the suburbs of Detroit, lots of pet supply stores...) and it costs $40 for the 15.4 lb bag there. The lowest I've seen it online was for 34.99, but with high shipping. But, I feel that providing premium food for my dog will ultimately save on vet bills later and improve quality of life for her, so I don't mind the cost so much.<br />Also, just FYI, Orijen does do a frequent buyer's program, after you buy 12 bags you get the 13th free. The local store I buy it from set me up, you have to keep receipts and the barcodes from the bags and it has to be the same size bag every time, but I don't think it has to be the same formula. It's kind of strict but I think it's going to be worth it by the time I need that 13th bag.
