And that is no exagerration!  Roaring 40's Blue is a wonderful mixture of strength and subtlety.. it's almost impossible to guess what flavour is going to break through next.  It's superb on thin crackers and with a glass of good red wine. I tried this at a cheese tasting during the Adelaide Royal Show (in South Australia) and was immediately won over, as were the literally hundreds of people lined up to try it for themselves.  I'm of the opinion that once you've had King Island cheese, you never go back!  Try it for yourself!
