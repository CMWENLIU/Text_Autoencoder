These make great cookies.  I think they have the right amount of chocolate chips and they taste fabulous.<br /><br />Be sure to use real butter.  In GF cooking, margarine doesn't work as a substitute...I tested it too and margarine cookies tasted terrible, looked even worse and crumbled into a million pieces.  Butter (as box calls for) were perfect and delicious.<br /><br />These will definitely be my go-to for chocolate chip cookies!  I hope Betty Crocker begins to make other Gluten Free items as well!
