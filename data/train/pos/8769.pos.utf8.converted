Decades later it is still my diet saver! The Double Fudge is by far the best flavor - deep and dark and really tastes like chocolate. Years ago I used to make shakes and puddings using gelatin, but this is my latest iteration:<br /><br />Alba Double Fudge Pudding<br /><br />1/2 bar Morinu Low-Fat extra-firm tofu<br />1 package Alba Double Fudge Shake Mix<br />2 packages artificial sweetener (or to taste)<br />Put all ingredients into a mini food processor and whip. That's it! Sometimes I add 1 tablespoon ground flax seeds, which makes it even thicker. Enjoy!
