At the VA hospital, my dietician asked me to revise my diet.  Most of the diet is no problem, but increasing vegetables can be a big problem.  I need five to seven servings of vegetables each day.  To meet all the "healthy" requirements, I have to eat too much.  I have forced myself to eat it all and I end up feeling  stuffed.  Most days the best I can do is 4 servings.<br /><br />I discussed this with my dietician and she said I could drink vegetables for some of my servings.  V8 vegetable juice qualifies as a vegetable serving.  Somehow its is like that commercial where Bill Cosby says "there is always room for Jell-O,".I can drink an eight ounce glass of V8 and not feel stuffed.  A side benefit is that it tastes good.<br /><br />V8 contains wonderful ingredients: calories 50; Sodium 140 mg; Potassium 820mg; Fiber 2g; Sugars 8g; Protein 2g.  Percent daily value: Vitamin A  40%;  Vitamin C, 120%;  Calcium 2%; Iron, 2%; Vitamin C, 120%; Calcium 2%, iron, 2%.  I try to purchase the low sodium bottle.<br /><br />So, with V8,  I increase my vegetables and eat healthy.  I highly recommend V8 vegetable juice for daily consumption.
