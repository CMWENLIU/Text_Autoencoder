These brazil nuts were fresh & crunchy with a creamy, mild taste .... delicious!  I've ordered other bagged nuts over the internet, but they weren't fresh.  You don't always know how fresh they are (even in the stores, the nuts can sometimes be rancid).  Rancid nuts are NOT healthy and contain toxins, so if you taste one, be sure to spit it out.  These were so good I've ordered two more; hopefully they'll be just as fresh as the first batch.
