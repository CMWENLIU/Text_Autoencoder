I can't remember what "real" sloppy joe's taste like. It has been too long but I do remember I didn't like it. So, knowing that, this stuff is great!!! I want to eat it because it tastes good not just because it is a good source of protein. Reminds me more of my Mom's mulligan's stew base than the overly sweet sloppy joe mix that used to come in a bottle in the 70's.<br /><br />Update: I have given boxes and cooked sloppy joes for non-veggie and they all love it. My parents have regularly eaten beef sloppy joes and have switched to the veggie version and say it tastes better and easier to digest :).
