... if you use cardamom a lot. The powdered cardamom is a waste of money; once the jar is opened, it loses 90% of its flavor within a day or two. The whole pods are troublesome to peel, though if you use cardamom less than once a week, the pods retain the maximum flavor and justify the trouble. But if you use cardamom in the quantities of either a Swedish baker or an Indian curry-maker -- or, like me, both -- a 16-ounce bag of decorticated seeds will 'get you through'.<br /><br />You can grind these seeds in a mortar, and it's kinda fun to do so, but I'd recommend a small cheap electric coffee mill dedicated to cardamom only. It won't clog and it won't need washing.<br /><br />If you buy the whole green cardamom pods, you can use the pods in coffee, putting the pods in the filter cone with the grounds. Assuming, of course, that you like the taste. It seems to be growing in popularity in the USA and Canada; lots of creameries are now offering cardamom ice cream. Yum!
