If you like German cooking and remember the days of potato dumplings, sauerbraten and rich gravies, then you will love these! I made my own dumplings for over forty years, and sometimes, depending on the potatoes, they did not come out that great. But this mix never fails! I just add an egg and some parsley flakes, sauteed breadcubes in the middle when I form them, and my family and friends all love them. Sooo much easier to make than from scratch. If you have a little German in you (or just love German cooking), than you have to try these, absolutely the BEST!
