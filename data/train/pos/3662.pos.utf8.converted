I had been using this Cutter pump spray with picaridin for years with great success, but then it became hard to find at Target, Wal-Mart, etc. I finally found an aerosol version at Target in a white container, but the aerosol version seemed to run out very quickly after just a few applications. I finally found the pump version on Amazon and ordered 4 bottles, so I got free shipping! I would estimate that I get about 10 times more applications with the pump versus the aerosol.<br /><br />This is a great product! I am outdoors a lot, and mosquitoes love me. They will ignore others standing around and swarm around me. I love the Cutter pump picaridin because it works as well as deet but is not greasy, dries quickly, and does not leave any residual odor. The key is to rub it in and be sure to cover all exposed skin.<br /><br />They say it only lasts for about 4-6 hours, but I have put it on in the early morning and have found that one application keeps the mosquitoes away from me for the whole day.
