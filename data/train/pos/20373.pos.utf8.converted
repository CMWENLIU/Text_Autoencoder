Although I did not grow up in India, and have no idea what a 'proper curry powder' should taste like, I have to say that this is my new favorite. I have tried quite a few other US-based brands, and none of them even comes close to the perfectly balanced and nicely rounded flavor this curry imparts. It is not too hot, not too sweet, and does not cast too long a shadow over the foods it is used in. Great stuff - I cannot recommend it highly enough.
