Having lost 120lb with a gastric bypass, I can no longer eat high fat, sugar ladden items.  These little bites (I wouldn't call them cookies, they are more like little confections).  Give me a sweet indulgence without sabotaging my continued efforts at weight loss.  Oddly enough before the gastric bypass, I tried the fat free but sugared ones and disliked them so much that I threw half the tub out.  These however, are well worth the effort to find.  Thirteen little bites for 35 calories and 9 carbs (6 after considering the fiber) and 4 grams of protein.  A wonderful little bite of delight.  The chocolate are just as good.
