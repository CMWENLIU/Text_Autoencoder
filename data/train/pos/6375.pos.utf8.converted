I'm not a real homemaker, but I play one in my kitchen.<br /><br />I've helped the Mrs. can things in the past, but my involvement was pitting, coring, and dumping out really big pots of boiling water. My wife canned the way that worked for her, packets of SureJell and lots and lots of sugar. We have been progressively reducing our families sugar consumption. As summer rolled in and fresh strawberries ripened, I sallied forth and picked 75# of them. (Yes, I know. Nobody needs that much jam. I dried a bunch). I had read that Pomona's worked with low-sugar recipes so I bought some.<br /><br />In the middle of my first batch of strawberry jam, my wife observed the small amount of sugar I was using and told me flat out that my jam wasn't going to set. She had tried SureJell's "Low or No Sugar" with poor results. She hadn't noticed my box of Pomona's. I thanked her for her opinion, and continued on my merry way.<br /><br />After my first two batches set perfectly, she paid more attention and discovered my secret. Pomona's. I have since made low sugar versions of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry jams and all have set perfectly. I could scarcely be more pleased.<br /><br />Next to being being able to get a good set with low sugar recipes, my favorite feature of Pomona's is that I can make HUGE batches. Instead of working in small batches, as some other unnamed pectin requires, I was able to make an enormous batch of jam with 3 boxes worth of Pomona's. Again, I was advised it would not work, but every single jar came out perfectly. Pomona's has a special place in my pantry.<br /><br />Once I knew to look for Pomona's, I have seen it in most grocery stores. It tends to cost more than SureJell but since the yield is higher per box, it's actually a better value. And the best value is in the 6 pack right here on Amazon.
