I've been asking people for years if they remembered the braided chocolate covered candy bar we used to have back in the 70's and 80's? Like myself, everyone could remember the bar itself, but no one had seen one in years or could remember the their name. So I asked a search engine about them and it answered my question and refered me to Amazon, where I could purchace the bars under the name "Curly Wurley". I was very pleased to see that although the "Marathon Bar" had not been produced here in the United States in almost 30 years, I was still able to purchase them under a different name from the good folks at Amazon, and they are delicious, just as I remember from my childhood...YUMMY!! Thank you Amazon!
