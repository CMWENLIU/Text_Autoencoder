It's been a nightmare finding yeast at my local grocery stores - they only seem to be stocking these tiny little 0.25 ounce packets for +$3 for a three pack.  I was so pleased to find that amazon is stocking Bob's yeast - not only is the price unbelievably good, but the quality is impressive as well.  If you plan on doing any baking in the future, I would highly recommend always having some of this in stock - it stores very well in the fridge for long periods of time, and the results can't be beat, especially for the price!
