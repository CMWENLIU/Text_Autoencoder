CET Chews Petite for Small Dogs (30 chews)<br />My dog loves all sizes of these CET Chews. She is a 15 pound Bichon Frise who loves to chew to relieve stress, but only bones, rawhide, or similar chewables. I've heard mixed reviews on rawhide in general, but in the last few years rawhide chews started giving her terribly smelly gas, enough to clear the room! We have discovered, however, that the CET chews do not have that effect, and they help to relieve her stress as well as clean her teeth. We recently switched to the smaller chews because even though she manages the larger chews just fine, we decided it was better to give her smaller ones more often than a big one just occasionally, and that it's probably easier on her small digestive system. Anyway, we love these and would recommend anyone whose dog enjoys chewing to give these a try. Do keep in mind that whenever your pet is chewing something like this that they should be monitored, though we have never had a minute's trouble with these. Thanks!
