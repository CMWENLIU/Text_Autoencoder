This candy is AWESOME. At my local grocery store it sells for $1 for a pack of 4. I bought a 12-pack of 15-pieces (180 pieces) for $22 here on Amazon! That's a bargain! Instead of $0.25 a piece, it's just over $0.12 a piece!<br /><br />This candy is a great gift because it's cheap and not very common. If you like ferrero rocher, but don't want to pay the steep price and enjoy a kick of caramel, this is the perfect candy for you.
