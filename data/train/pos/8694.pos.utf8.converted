These are super delicious!  We tried them for the first time during a trip in PA last June. Since getting home, we haven't been able to find them in NYC or CT. I gave these to my husband as a holiday gift.  I was the first one to rip open a bag and dig in.  Yum, a must eat!  I wish more stores carried the jalapeno flavored combos.  Such a  treat.
