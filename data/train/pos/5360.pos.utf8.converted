I have not personally purchaced conch meat from this supplier, however, I would defanantly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys seafood. I had conch twice while on a trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was the most delicious sea creature I've ever eaten! I had it fried, and scampied in a pasta and there isn't a scallop or lobster out there that could trump conch's succulent, moist, meaty goodness. In fact, ever since I had it I've wanted more, but I haven't had the chance. I would buy some of this, but I didn't realize how much it cost...
