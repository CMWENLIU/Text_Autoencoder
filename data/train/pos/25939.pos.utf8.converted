Bob's Red Mill products are all good but this one is really special.  Zone dieters (and low carb dieters in general) really struggle to add old favorites to their menu ... especially baked goods.  Bob's Red Mill baking mix is very much like Bisquick, but without the poor nutritional stats that Bisquick brings with it.  Bob's Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix enables us to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, etc., etc. that are "Zone friendly" so we can stay "in the zone" and still eat many of the things we were missing while on the Zone program (which, if you haven't tried and want to improve your nutrition or lose weight, you really should!).  Thank you Bob's Red Mill for another great product!
