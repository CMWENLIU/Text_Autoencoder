I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/031612737X">The Blood Sugar Solution: The UltraHealthy Program for Losing Weight, Preventing Disease, and Feeling Great Now!</a>. In this book there is a recipe for Honey Almond Butter Spread that has raw almond butter as an ingredient. You mix the almond butter with honey and cardamom and use it as a dip for apples. It is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. So that is the reason I bought this almond butter and I love that it is all natural and creamy. I was worried that an almond butter would be rancid but this tasted really fresh and it has no preservative or any added anything. It is made out of raw almonds, that is it. Enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
