UDI's GF bread is the best GF bread I have ever tasted because its actually soft like bread.  Most Gluten Free Breads are hard and require toasting or microwaving to become soft but not UDIs.  If you havent tried it, you have to.  They also have cinnamon rolls and lemon struesel (spelling??) muffins that are nice and soft and delicious as well.  Check them out!
