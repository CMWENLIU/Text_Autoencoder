I have been using this product since receiving the 2-oz bottles from the hospital. My baby took to it well and I did not want to switch formula brands any reason. I considered switching to the powder version of this product, but after trying it for one day, we saw the difference; my baby was suddenly very gassy and fussy, which is very unlike him. We decided to switch back to this product and I'm very glad that we did. This liquid formula was NOT affected by the Similac recall, so I felt more safe and relieved when hearing about it.<br />"No Abbott liquid infant formulas are impacted. Products not involved in the recall include all Abbott Nutrition liquid ready-to-feed and concentrated infant formulas and all powder and liquid specialty formulas".<br />Read more about the recall on the similac website and feel confident about the formula you choose to buy for your baby. Hope this helps!
