I think this horchata is just as tasty as ones I've had in mexican restaurants.  The nice thing about this product is that it lacks hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, and dairy products which I have found in some powder mixes and concentrates. It's a little sweeter than I thought it would be, but normally my horchata from restaurants has ice so maybe I'm used to a more dilute flavor.  Adding a bit of water helped cut the sweetness and allows me to extend my yummy horchata a little further.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product are: Filtered Water, Brown Rice (Partially Milled), Dehydrated Cane Juice, Expeller Pressed High Oleic Safflower Oil, and/or Canola Oil, Rice Flour, Natural Flavors, Spice, Carageenan.<br /><br />An 8 oz serving contains 160 calories, 25 calories from fat.  4 Servings per Container.

It was 2. 69, so only a bit more expensive than Amazon.
