This product saved my Dad's life! He had an incurable staph infection on his leg for 10 years that he caught from swimming in the ocean. The doctors had him on every antibiotic you can think of, but it never heeled. The infection was slowly moving up his leg and he couldn't stop it, and was making him sicker and sicker every day. We thought he was going to die from it. I researched a cure for "incurable staph" on the internet and found this honey. He coated his leg with it and his sores were all heeled within a week! The infection may still be there but the sore are all gone. All he has now is some red spots. He no longer has to take pain pills every day, and he has not been back to the stupid doctors since. If you have a skin infection, buy this. It is worth the money!
