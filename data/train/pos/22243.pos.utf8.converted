Great substitute for flour tortillas made with real lard.  Great texture.  Not pretty to look at.  Browns nicely.  Try with Asadero cheese in a quesadilla or with your huevos con chorizo.  Not just as good, but very nice.  I think I can make it through Atkins (lost 30lbs so far) with these tortillas and may even enjoy this low carb thing.  Taste could fool me, but then I am only half Mexican!
