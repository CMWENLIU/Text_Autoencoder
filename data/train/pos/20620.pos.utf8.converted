Another reviewer was upset about the price being more than regular Rice Krispies) and though this does upset me too, it became a small issue after I tasted the gf version of Rice Krispies. They taste just like the regular version and I am so excited about making GF Rice Krispie treats! They are still cheaper and taste better than any other GF rice krispie type cereal. I am not sure when or if GF Rice Krispies will be available at a store in my area-so THANK YOU for making these available to us here online!
