This tea is excellent. The company is reputable and produces an excellent, high-quality product. There are clearly leaves in the bag and I've never had any issues with any residues in the box or the tea bags (other reviewer) and I've been drinking this tea for more than 4 year, ordering in bulk. This tea is great and of the highest-quality. I've tried other oolongs and nothing compares to the quality and freshness - at least according to my taste buds! Steep a cup for yourself - great!
