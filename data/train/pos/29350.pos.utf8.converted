I just got the Bialetti Milk and Espresso set and bought this coffee because it was recomended. It is the best coffee I have ever tasted in my life and I no longer need to go to Starbucks. I can make all those amazing drinks at home and mine are even better. I admit the cost is a bit much, but I pour the extra espresso and milk in a container and refrigerate for iced coffee drinks. So I never waste a drop. Also, the cans are neat looking and will make great cannisters in my kitchen cabinets. I love it so much I ordered another espresso/ milk set and more  of this coffee as a gift. I ordered 2 more cans for me too. It is expensive but worth every penny!!! If you still need help to rationalize the cost, I will tell you that i get a big double shot Mochaccino in the morning and one or two servigs of iced coffee later in the day from one tiny pot-6 oz i think.  I believe I got around 15 batches with one can. So figure what one trip to the coffee shop costs x your number of trips per week... uh huh staggering isnt it. So making great coffee at home acutally saves me money. Plus it is just incredibly good coffee. Much better than you can find anywhere else.
