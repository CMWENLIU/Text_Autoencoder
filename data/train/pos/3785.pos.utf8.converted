I was looking for a way to thicken my protein shakes to make them more palatable and found this to be a great alternative. I mixed the shake ingredients together with about 1/2 teaspoon of the Xanthan Gum and refrigerated it overnight. The next morning I dumped it in my blender with some frozen fruit and it was PERFECT! You can drink it slowly and it maintains the thickness even when not ice cold. When I would use crushed ice it was a race to suck it down fast enough before the consistency got too runny and the flavor was of course always watered down. This is a great alternative and the little bag will last me forever!
