This sugar is heavenly.  Turbinado sugar is nice by itself, but infused with real vanilla pods, it becomes divine!  It is the kind of thing that when I open the lid, I take a deep sniff, and close my eyes and say MMMmmm, -every time!<br /><br />This is awesome sprinkled over buttered toast.<br /><br />Pure Indulgence! Best to buy the 3 pound, since the 3oz is almost half the price of the 3lb!...and 3ozs will disappear in no time.<br /><br />Addicting!
