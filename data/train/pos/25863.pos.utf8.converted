I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome.  Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated.  In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard.  He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive.  To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms.  I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094YKM">Mosquito Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap</a>,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors.  I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard.  The results were stunning!  For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it.  For me it works better than any other product I've tried.  The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs.  I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather.  If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard.  A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control<br /><br />The active ingredient is Permethrin.  Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area.  It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin.  Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry.  Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in.  You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a "likely" carcinogen.  There is also a link to Parkinson's disease).  Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying.  Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you.  Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year.<br /><br />The product can be applied by simply attaching the nozzle to your hose and spraying.  Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc.  The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes.<br /><br />While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside.<br /><br />konedog
