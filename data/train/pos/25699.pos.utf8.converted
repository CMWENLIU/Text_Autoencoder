Love the burst of energy I get after chewing on these leaves. Its good as a tea too. Aromatic and tasty. My husband also enjoyed it for its sedative benefits. He has a bad tooth and it numbed it out for him. Better than any conventional pain killer. Orajel has nothing on nature. Will continue to buy this product. LOVE IT!!!
