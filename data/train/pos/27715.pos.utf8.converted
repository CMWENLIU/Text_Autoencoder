Not much to say that hasn't been said before about the Carbon's Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix.  I had been using the regular mix for both waffles and pancakes with outstanding results, and then I stumbled upon the All Natural mix.<br /><br />I am frankly not sure what the main differences are between the regular mix and the all natural mix, but with kids around the house, it seemed like a no-brainer to be using the All Natural.  The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural, and I still get requests all the time from my kids for "Daddy's Waffles" and "Daddy's Pancakes".  Needless to say, I'll be sticking with Carbon's over any other mix, and I'll be sticking with the All Natural.
