This is the closes thing to the French creme that we have ever had here in the US. No one can come close to Vermont's creme fraiche. It is hard to purchase here in EL PASO TEXAS now that Lomart has closed its doors. That is why I must order it on line. The Greenery at Sun land Park Mall would not order it for me. I AM A CONESURE OF FINE FOODS
