As a resident of the Netherlands, it was funny to find 'our' national drink on an american site. How wonderful for you people that you have been given the oppertunity to tast Hollands Best Coffee. It let you see that there is more to Holland than Cheeses, wooden shoes, tullips and windmills. Yes, there is also coffee. Try dunkin'a bisquit in it preferably a 'speculaasje'
