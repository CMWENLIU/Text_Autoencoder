After finding out I am gluten-intolerant at 41 years old (boy what an adjustment) I don't know what I would do without this!  This cereal has been my comfort food for weeks now.  It tastes even better than cream of rice or wheat and doesn't give me heartburn.  The fiber makes it digest slower so it seems to 'stay' with me longer.  I've also tried the Mighty Tasty Gluten Free Hot Cereal which has a more complex, sharper taste from the buckwheat.  I find a mix of the two is a great change of pace.<br />I haven't tried it as a savory side dish yet but with cheese and scallions sounds good - maybe one night when hubby isn't home :-)
