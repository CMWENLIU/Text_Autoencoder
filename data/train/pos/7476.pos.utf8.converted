When I first got these, I tasted them out of the bag and found them so horribly bitter.  People that say they eat these out of the bag are crazy!<br /><br />However, once you put them in something sweetened, like yogurt or candies or cookie dough, etc....you will never go back to "chocolate chips" again.<br /><br />These look like little pieces of the cacao pod.  They are crunchy.  And they STAY crunchy when you mix them in foods.  I haven't cooked them yet, but I have mixed them in with my peanut butter, coconut oil, coconut shreds refrigerator candy and they give them a little crunch!  As long as your recipe is slightly sweetened, you will love these.<br /><br />I actually didn't use mine for almost a year as I was put off by the taste.  Now that I figured out how to use them, I will put them in anything sweet I make!  Love them.  They keep forever just about also.  Don't need to be refrigerated, but I had mine in the freezer since I wasn't using them at first.
