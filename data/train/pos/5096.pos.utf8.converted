OK guys, what we have here is a basic misunderstanding about how Japanese buckwheat noodles differ from semolina pasta. This was my favorite food when I lived in Japan, so let me tell you how it's done. The cloudy boiling water means it's high quality soba. Eden is right about adding cold water, but only keep cooking it until it's al dente--sometimes three repetitions is too long. When the soba is done, SAVE a cup or two of the cloudy boiling water for a special treat later. Drain the soba noodles and rinse them. Then, and this is critical, soak them in a bowl of ice water for 3 minutes until they're nicely chilled.<br /><br />Japanese people do not stir-fry their soba noodles, as far as I can tell, so if you want to go that route you're on your own. The Japanese tend to eat all their noodles wet. Soba is often in hot soup, but the best way in the summer is to use a dipping sauce. You can buy one from an Asian market (I like Yamaki brand). Sometimes you're meant to dilute the dipping sauce by half or a third with water. Into the dipping sauce grate some radish, slice some scallions, and put a dab of wasabi paste. Mix it up. Then pick up a small clump of soba noodles, put them in your dipping sauce, and then slurp some of those noodles up into your mouth. Make sure that you take in air as you slurp and don't suck too tightly or the noodles will fly up and hit you in the eye! Repeat.<br /><br />When you've finished your noodles, pour some of the left over boiling water into your dipping sauce. Mix and drink! It's healthy and delicious and all the best restaurants do it. Itadakimashou!
