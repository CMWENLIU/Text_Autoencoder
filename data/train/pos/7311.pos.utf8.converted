I love my Baby Brezza and how easy it makes it to cook healthy baby food for my daughter! The machine is very easy to use, and the parts that touch food go in the dishwasher, which makes it very convenient to clean. When my daughter was just starting on "solid" food, I could just chop vegetables or fruit up and put them in the machine and then it would cook and puree them while I did other things. Now that she's a little older and doesn't need things as liquified, I just run the steam function and then pour out some water before hitting the blend button. It's so easy to use! I totally recommend it.
