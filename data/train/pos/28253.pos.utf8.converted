Although I love apple juice, I don't normally care for apple flavored drinks.  However, as many have stated, this drink is very refreshing.  The apple flavor is a little tart (green apple, not red) with just enough sweet.  Over the years, I have lost my taste for soda.  I can rarely drink more than one glass/can because it's so sweet and doesn't quench my thirst.  These Izze canned drinks are a nice alternative when I want something more than water.  Both the taste and the carbonation are quite mild, and not at all overpowering.  Plus, the smaller 8.4 ounce cans are the perfect size.  They fit well in a lunch box, too.<br /><br />Before trying this through Amazon Vine, I never had Izze before.  I don't buy bottled drinks because if you don't finish them, they go flat.  This makes Izze in these small cans very appealing.  It has a good shelf life and stays colder than a refrigerated bottle.  Since I received 24 cans, I was able to share this with my family.  My niece and her fiance (in college) both love sparkling grape juice, and this is very similar.  The main difference is that Izze has a softer flavor.  He liked it a lot; she wished it was stronger.  Another of my nieces thought it tasted like apple juice mixed with Sprite.  The general consensus ampong her college friends was "fizzy and good."  Potential buyers should consider that this isn't as strong as soda or many sparkling drinks.  If you're looking for a kick, this isn't it.  Personally, that was perfect for me.<br /><br />My family also tried the clementine flavor.  I didn't care for it because it tasted like Orangina.  If you like that, then the clementine should appeal.  I didn't and subsequently thought it was too strong (probably because I didn't like it).  My sister and niece, who do like Orangina, thought the clementine was very good.  Since I liked Izze so much, I decided to order the Blackberry flavor.  My family all agrees that this is one of the the strongest Izze flavors we tried.  It's a little tart, more like raspberry than blackberry.  This is the closest to sparkling grape juice in flavor.  I liked it, but do not think I could drink it as often as the apple since it is stronger.  Lastly we tried pomegranate.  Normally, I love pomegranate flavored stuff.  However, we all agreed it was awful.  It is almost bitter and leaves a strong after taste that is not pleasant.  I couldn't even finish one can.  It definitely comes down to flavor preference.<br /><br />Also, people looking for a healthier alternative to soda should consider Izze.  No, the vitamins it's "fortified" with aren't a significant amount and there is still a lot of sugar (still less than 100% juices!).  But, it's better than soda with no vitamins at all!  And being sweetened by juice rather than artificial flavors and sweetners is a plus.  The smaller size can is a reasonable serving, too.  The price is about average, with each can being less than a dollar.  I like the convenience of it being shipped from Amazon rather than lugging it home from the grocery store and intend to sign up for the subscription.  Overall, I highly recommend this.
