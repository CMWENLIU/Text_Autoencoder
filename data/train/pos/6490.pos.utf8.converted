Original Mix (I prefer this one because there is no added sugars)<br /><br />Taste:<br />In a green smoothie: Changes the texture of the smoothie just a bit, nothing too noticeable or annoying.  Also adds a different flavor to the overall smoothie that helps enhance the taste when combined with the right greens and fruits.<br /><br />With Almond milk: I am not used to eating sugars and processed foods, so this actually tastes pretty great to me. I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious!<br /><br />Overall Feeling:<br /><br />I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake. I have tried many from whole foods and other various health food stores. The fact that I have decided to actually buy another container of Amazing Meal must mean I really like it! I've been taking it for 2 weeks and, this wasn't my initial intention, but have lost 5 pounds. A nice little added bonus :)<br /><br />Highly reccomened if you are looking for a great protein/vitamin/healthy living shake. Oh and did I mention it is Alkaline based? Perfect!<br /><br />x x
