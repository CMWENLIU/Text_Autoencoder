This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.
