First time I tried Sumatra in a large order from Amazon and I was not disappointed. I read the reviews before selection and was encouraged to try this blend. When I grind Sumatra beans for a drip coffee maker it is stronger. This Pod-style Sumatra blend is not too strong and should please most coffee drinkers. Very satisfactory - will probably stick with this selection for future purchases. The quick and easy brewing using Senseo is so great for people on the run - or too sleepy to grind and brew. Tastes great from first sip to bottom of cup!
