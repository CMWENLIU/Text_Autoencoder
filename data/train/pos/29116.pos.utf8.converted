I use a lot of protein powder, mostly in breakfast smoothies, or mixed with almond milk after a tough work out.  Since going vegan (dairy and I were not seeing eye to eye...), I had to move away from the whey protein I was used to and find a vegan substitute.  Nutiva has been a source of some great supplements in my household for awhile, so I tried it out.  Let's just say that now I am a 'subscribe and save' customer with amazon.<br /><br />The price through amazon is much less than Whole Foods (much much less!).  There are 15g of protein per serving, not as much compared to whey, but hemp protein is nice because it is not produced from an animal product.  The flavor is quite nice.  It has a mild chocolate kick that is nice with greens and fruit in a smoothie, or at home in almond or soy milk.  I give it two thumbs up.  And so far I haven't found a better price than the Nutiva on ORGANIC hemp protein!<br /><br />Of note though: make sure you order from amazon and not a third party (though the third party offered this item with free Prime shipping, it took over a week to arrive instead of the two days that Amazon Prime items take - they fooled me by pricing it a penny less and offering the prime option).
