I am in serious trouble after ordering a carton of these! I had not seen them in stores for a long time and I did remember how great they were. Well folks--they still are! I think its the fact that the chocolate used to dip these in is really delicious and dark! In fact--they are even better frozen. I got them on sale--these always were the "more expensive" cookies on the shelf! SO now---I have enough to give some to everyone because if I dont--I will have to order new clothes! They are great!
