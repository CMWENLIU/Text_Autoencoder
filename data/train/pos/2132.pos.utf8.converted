I bought these candied orange peels because of the price.  I didn't know if they would be very good.  What a pleasant surprise I got!!  They are wonderful.  They are juicy and tender.  I bought them in a 2 LB pack because the shipping was more economical that way.  We like to dip them in chocolate.<br />  I am very pleased with these and I shall purchase from this company again.
