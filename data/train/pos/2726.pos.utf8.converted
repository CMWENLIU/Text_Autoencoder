I've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.  I've eaten a lot of rice, but this one is making me forget about the rest.
