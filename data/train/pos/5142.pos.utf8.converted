The phrase 'too good to be true' is put to the test on this product.  A 1/4 cup of this clear syrup is only 35 calories!  There is absolutely no after taste that clues you in that this is anything but real sugar.  Trust me, I tried it on my very critical, non-dieting family and friends and all of them thought it was 'plain sugar syrup'.  I have used this in drinks, and in my oatmeal.  Honestly, nothing gives you a hint that it is not 'real' sugar.
