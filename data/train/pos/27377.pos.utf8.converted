I didn't realize at first this product has zero salt in it.  I neglected to read the package directions.  After experimenting a bit, I've found this tastes amazing when you add salt to taste, about 1/4-1/2 cup light cream, about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 stick real butter to every two pouches of sauce.  I add previously cooked chicken breast meat and simmer to warm through. Serve over basmati rice and YUM...quick and easy dinner.  Sure, it's not low fat, but it tastes very close to what I have had in Indian restaurants.  I have also made it with a vegetarian soy chicken called "FriChik" and it tastes great too.
