5lbs of Raspberries is a large amount. For comparison's sake, think of a 5 lbs baby. Now imagine that baby filled with Haribo Raspberries. This is the amount of candy you'll get. Can you handle it?<br /><br />I've given some to friends and family and still have a lot left over for myself. As soon as the product arrived, I stored the majority of the candy in a large air tight jar, and a smaller supply in a more accessible jar on my desk. It's been 10 months since I've ordered it, back in June 06', and the candy in the large jar is still chewy and fresh. I would say the shelf life on this candy is very long, given it's properly stored.<br /><br />Superb product with nice texture and in my opinion, just the right amount of sweetness. The interior is gummy but it's not sticky and won't cling to your teeth.
