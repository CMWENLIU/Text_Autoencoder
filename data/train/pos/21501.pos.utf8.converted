I am Costa Rican and have enjoyed Lizano since I was a kid. I'm so happy you all love it, because it is so delicious!! It's great that we can buy it on Amazon, but the price tag is ridiculous! I live in NY and buy it at Western Beef for $3.99 (yep, 23.6 oz bottle) and have seen it in Supermarkets in Spanish neighborhoods for around the same price. I've also seen it on other websites for around $6.00. Enjoy it, but enjoy it cheaper!
