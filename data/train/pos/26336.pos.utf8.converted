Some time ago, my wife came home with a small container of Mediterranean Sea Salt. I was somewhat taken back by the price, but it was an excellent salt, of that there was no question. Well, that salt is now almost gone, but we were wandering down the spice isle in our local warehouse store and there was a grinder/bottle of Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt. Well, we just had to try it. As for the cost, the Kirkland salt was under half the cost on a per ounce basis.<br /><br />The Kirkland Signature Mediterranean Sea Salt is excellent. The flavor is bright and crisp and wonderful, just like the other sea salt we had. It's just marvelously salty! I wondered, what makes this stuff so good? After all it's just salt and salt should taste like salt no matter what. Yet, this Mediterranean Sea Salt is markedly better than our Diamond Crystal Salt which we have generally used for cooking as well as a table salt. Well, I looked at the Diamond Crystal list of ingredients. In addition to salt, there's sodium silicoalluminate, dextrose, potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate listed. Well, no wonder the salt tastes different! The Diamon Crystal salt is full of additives! I suppose Morton's is the same way, although I've not had a chance to check it. The only ingredient listed on the Kirkland Signature bottle is Mediterranean sea salt.<br /><br />Well, we're planning on using this as a table salt from here on out. Once you've experienced the taste, you just can't go back. Try it. You'll lke it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
