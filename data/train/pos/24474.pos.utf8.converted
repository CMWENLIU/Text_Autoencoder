I buy pistachios a LOT. When I say a lot, I mean about once a month or so. And as far as I'm concerned Keenan is the best. I get very few "bad ones" in the entire container, whether it's this one or the plastic bags I also buy. The saltiness is perfect, the size is perfect, and Keenan really knows how to sell in bulk. I just don't bother looking at other brand names, though I am sure they are fine. But another thing to note is that Keenan's tend to be cheapest per pound. I did all the math for all the brands here on Amazon and I just get the most for my money with these or the large 32-ounce bags.
