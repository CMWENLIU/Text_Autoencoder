As the title says, it's very easy, very good, very quick to use.<br /><br />I don't always even put chicken in, veggies alone taste good!<br /><br />I take one cup of water and the paste packet and put on high stirring until dissolved (less than 1 minute).  Add pieces of chicken, whole with bone, or boneless cubed into liquid to cover.  I then add whatever veggies I want from a frozen bag...  cauliflower, okra, peas, even a can of chickpeas works well.  Cover and cook until veggies are tender and chicken is cooked, 15-30 minutes.  Serve over rice.  I eat flour tortillas as a quick alternative to roti bread.  Just throw the tortilla on the gas stove burner, and flip every 5 seconds until blackened on the corners a bit.
