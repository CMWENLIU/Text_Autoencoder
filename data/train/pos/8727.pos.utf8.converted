I just had a big bowl of oatmeal and I'm not sick!  No heartburn or cramps!  I just feel full and happy!  It has been YEARS since I've been able to eat oatmeal!  These oats are delicious, chewy, wonderful!  I made the oatmeal in three minutes in the microwave...a quick breakfast or snack!  Tomorrow, I am going to create a recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies...then, maybe oatmeal bread...then oatmeal muffins...then...  Having these oats available<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> gives me so many more gluten-free options for baking and cooking!  Hurrah!
