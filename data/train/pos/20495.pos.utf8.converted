I compare these to the dried blueberries that I purchased (for considerably more) at our local organic grocery.  These were far superior in taste.  The blueberries were much bigger, and tasted like blueberries (as opposed to the ones at the organic store, which just tasted over-sweetened, but without any real flavor.  My wife and daughter go through these so quickly by the handful, I almost never have them to cook with, but they work great with oatmeal, pancakes, etc.  Highly recommended.
