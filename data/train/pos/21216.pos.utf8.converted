I have been buying these lentils at my local grocery store for a long while now, but was delighted to find them on Amazon for so much less, no taxes and free to my door delivery!<br /><br />Now, why lentils, and why these particular lentils?<br />1) Lentils are high in protein, vit B1, iron, and fiber!<br />2) Lentils are low in fat, and are also low on the glycemic index!<br />3) Lentils are a great base for many dishes: within 20 minutes you can have a tasty homemade dinner. Here is my favourite (start the clock): put on some basmati rice. In a separate pot, steam a large chopped onion for a few minutes. Add one can of lentils (always with the liquid!). Add dried garlic bits, chili powder, ginger powder, curry powder, all to taste. Stew for a few minutes. Add garam masala (a spice that can be purchased in most grocery stores) and cook for another few minutes. Serve over the basmati rice. There! Stop the clock! This should not have taken more then 20 minutes. Makes two servings (unless you are very hungry). This can be also prepared using oil (you'd fry the onion, instead of steaming it). The taste of the dish can be manipulated by using other spices (turmeric, cumin, etc.) and adding other vegetables (peas, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.). You can also try adding some sliced almonds and a few raisins. You can prepare this a day ahead and take to work with you for an inexpensive, but tasty and healthy work lunch! The cost of the meal, including rice and the entire can of lentils, comes to less then four dollars (or thereabout).<br />4) These lentils are organic, vegetarian, and kosher, for those who are interested.<br /><br />PS: Do not be put off by the "funny" look of the lentil liquid once you have opened the can. It is supposed to look like this. DO NOT drain the lentils!<br /><br />Enjoy!
