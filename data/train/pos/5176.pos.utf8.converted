I love Guarana Antarctica. The problem is that it is hard to find near my home. Since Amazon had it for less than $2 a can with free shipping, it was a no brainer. Unfortunately, this no longer appears to be an option, with the price of shipping actually exceeding the price of the product. Oh well.
