The treats came in a brownish/yellowish package rather than the blue/green color displayed, but though a different color package, the treats are the same as what I had before (in the blue/green pkg).  Being I was getting a package of 10 bags, I was hoping the expiration date was far out and it was (June 2010) so am very happy.  These particular treats (Friskie soft/tender chicken) have become just about impossible to find in stores anymore so was thrilled to find them online.
