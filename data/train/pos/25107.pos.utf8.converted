For all the trouble to take Metamucil, for its fiber content, the gram fiber count "ain't" much; 5 grams.  Fiber one is a crunchy, flavorful, bran tasty, cereal which, in  4 oz gives one 14 grams of fiber.  One cup of Fiber One equals 28 grams of fiber.  When I stop to think of the ordeal involved taking Metamucil for 5 grams of fiber, though ignorant of the existence of Fiber One, and its 14-28 grams of fiber, I could commit Hari Kari!  The cereal is as tasty as ones favorite cereal, a pleasant surprise, and by adding a pear to this morning cereal one hits the 30+ grams recommended by the medics.<br /><br />All hail to Fiber One; wouldst I had known about it sooner!  Fiber One is worth the price of admission!  All hail to Fiber One, the greatest product since sliced whole wheat bread!!!
