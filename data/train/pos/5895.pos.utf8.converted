I bought these as a gift for my a friend of my husband. His favorite drink is single malt scotch (he usually drinks McCallum.) My husband and he often have a glass together at the end of the day and we thought the glasses would be better than the coffee mugs they sometimes use!<br /><br />I wasn't sure why this glass was specific to whiskey or scotch. I did look for information about the Riedel types and shapes. According to the manufacturer, the company did research with the help of master distillers in Scotland. This resulted the design of a glass that is an elongated thistle shape on a truncated stem.  The design incorporates a small, slightly out-turned lip which directs the spirit onto the tip of the tongue, where sweetness is perceived, and serves to emphasize the elegant creaminess of top quality single malt whiskey.<br /><br />There are two lines of this glass, the Sommelier and the Vinum. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZDTZ">Riedel Sommeliers Series Single Malt Whiskey Glass</a> is also available here at Amazon. The Sommelier items are more expensive as the upper part is blown into a mold and the the stem and base are hand-crafted.<br /><br />The Vinum is machine made and more reasonably priced. The Vinum looks very lovely and is very nice and thin, there are no seams on the bowl, stem or base. (The Reidel name is etched on the bottom of the base.) It is made of over 24% lead crystal. The glass is 4 1/2 inches tall. There are 2 glasses per box, they are hand wash only. The box is sturdy and was in perfect condition when they arrived (I worried about this a little bit with such thin glasses.)<br /><br />My husband feels the glasses indeed improve the taste of the scotch, but he isn't sure why. He also said it also makes you appreciate the whiskey more and pay attention to it when you are drinking with the special glasses. They made a beautiful gift with a bottle of his favorite drink. You won't be disappointed in these.
