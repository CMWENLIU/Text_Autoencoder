I have never used better salt.  It is better tasting, prettier, and has more real salt flavor than any other salt even though you use less to get that salty taste. Other  salt always gives me endema and raises my blood pressure.  RealSalt does not give me endema as do other salts, and my blood pressure has even gone down rather than up.  My whole family feels better.  We will never use other salts again.  We just finished using our first 25 # box, and love it.  By the way, we have found that it pours better than other salts, too.
