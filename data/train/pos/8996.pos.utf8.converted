After trying to find a green tea that I could actually drink and enjoy, I found white tea. It has all the health giving benefits of green tea -- maybe even more -- and it's so very enjoyable! Of all the white teas I have tried, this is my absolute favorite. The white tea is smooth: it has none of the bitterness or sharp taste of green tea, and the addition of raspberry is a brilliant touch. To enhance the raspberry flavor, try adding a little sweetener -- your choice. Drinking a cup of this tea is like giving yourself a present. Thanks Stash, you really do create world-class teas.<br /><br />P.S. Remember NOT to boil the water for this tea: it's far too delicate for boiling water. Instead, use water just under the boiling point and only brew for no more than 4 minutes -- it does make a difference.
