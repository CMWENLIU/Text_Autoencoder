I've been giving my 4 Scotties Blue Buffalo kibble along with canned for 5 years.  I've kept and bred dogs for 25 years and find this the best kibble to meet my dogs' nutritional needs.  And they love it.  They are healthy, within a normal weight range, and are eager for their breakfast and dinner each day.  I can't say enough good things about this brand of dog food.  also, if you have questions about the product, the company gets back to you quickly with answers.  I highly recommend it.
