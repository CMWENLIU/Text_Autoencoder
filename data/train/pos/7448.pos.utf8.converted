If you like other Green Mountain flavored coffees, especially if you like the other seasonal light-roast flavors, you will probably like this one.  I really liked the Green Mountain Blue-Berry and thought I would try this and am very pleased.  It seems like a great fit for the fall.  The flavor and aroma seem a bit stronger than in the blue-berry.  Like the blue-berry, this is a light roast.  At first I thought light would mean weak, but it seems like the perfect match for the flavor so that it is still coffee and nicely flavored without either over-powering the other.  It is nothing like a starbucks.  So if you want a strong coffee taste above all, then this isn't one for you, but if you want a nice flavored light coffee, I think it is great.<br /><br />Like other flavored coffees, you should only brew this on the normal default coffee cup size (6oz) on the Keurig brewer or you will water it down if you use the mug size or larger.
