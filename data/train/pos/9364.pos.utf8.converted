But the taste is wonderful. Toss in some Bob's Red Mill date pieces (or figs or dried apples) and you have something similiar to an English pudding. Dense, moist and rich. Wish it came in a larger package. Three of our crowd can eat this up in no time.<br /><br />I don't tell some of my relatives upfront its whole wheat and natural ingredients. They are convinced anything advertised as such tastes terrible.
