For those with Celiac disease or anyone for that matter, this flour is excellent. It is certified gluten free and does not raise your ttG. Only .07% of celiac's will react to avenin in oats. I am convinced that it is still cross contamination from non-dedicated facilities where people say they react to oats or there are other reasons for reactivity. You can use this flour in any recipe you would use a wheat or other flour. The approximate ratio is 1 1/3 of oatmeal flour to 1 cup of wheat. Experiment for the consistency you need. It will also absorb a bit more liquid than wheat flour. You MUST add 1 tsp. xantham gum per 3 cups of oat flour as a binder. Oat flour makes superior pancakes, waffles, shortcake, cookies, I could go on and on. Again, just  substitute as above with xantham gum and you won't be disappointed. Don't waste your time on those breads and cookies at the store that are expensive, fall apart and taste like sand.  Thank you Bob's Red MIll.
