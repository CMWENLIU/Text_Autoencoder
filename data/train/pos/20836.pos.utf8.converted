Being able to enjoy delicious dried beans in 45 minutes is a real plus in my book.  In the past, cooking beans meant hours of soaking and boiling which meant planning ahead and watching the pot so the water didn't cook out. Canned beans are not an option here.  Convenience is only part of these beans' charm, the taste is wonderful enough to enjoy alone or in any dishes calling for pinto, kidney or navy beans.
