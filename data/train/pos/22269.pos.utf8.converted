Our daughter has severe GER and we tried everything from prilosec to every formula out there enfamil, similac, etc...  As last resort our pediatrician said to try Neocate.  We have been using it for a month and all symptoms are gone.  It's very easy to mix and daughter loves it.<br /><br />Only thing is its expensive so if you can get your insurance company to cover it that will help.  Some states have laws that force them to cover it with a doctors note.
