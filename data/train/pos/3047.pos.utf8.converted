This is my favorite chocolate by far. I do warn that it is extremely extremely dark and quite bitter. I started off with the 70% which is quite a bit sweeter and then, when I had gotten used to the 70, I upgraded to the 85 and wow, it's intense and incredible. So rich and dark. They have a 99% as well but I don't think I'm that bold yet!<br /><br />Now, when I eat 60% chocolate it tastes so sweet! Not only is the 85% better because it has more antioxidants but it also has much much less sugar than 35% milk chocolate!<br /><br />If you're not ready for the 85%, start slow. Hershey's has a 45% and 60%!<br /><br />I eat one little square a day whenever I have it in the pantry! Yum!
