This is the healthiest low-sodium alternative to soy sauce or Bragg Liquid Aminos.  It tastes great but can be spendy if you order it through Amazon.  However, it is usually less than $6 a bottle at most "Whole Foods Markets" and even less expensive if you are lucky enought to live in Portland, OR, and shop at one of the 10 "New Seasons Markets" in the area.  The best grocery chain on this planet!  And I don't even work there.)
