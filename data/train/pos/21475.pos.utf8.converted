I am a Nutritionist and a cat lover.  I have placed my cats on wet food only - no kibble - as kibble causes kidney disease, in my opinion, and is one of the top 2 killers of cats.<br />All the Instinct products are superior.  Their ingredients are 100% food grade, and believe me, most pet food cannot say that.<br />My girls had no trouble finishing off all flavors, since they are already used to wet.<br />If your cats are eating wet or dry food from major manufacturers, they are addicted to the sugar and MSG in them and it will take a while to wean them onto real food. (The label doesn't say MSG but that's what the "natural flavors" are).<br />Instinct also makes frozen raw food, my next step.
