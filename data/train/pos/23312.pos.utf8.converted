Found these at a local Trucchi's supermarket, but they don't always carry them. Snow's clams are the worst, mushy and tasteless. Atlantic clams are not bad and around here go for $1.50 a can. These cost me $2.99 locally when I can find them and they're worth the extra money. It's cheaper on Amazon though especially since I have Amazon Prime and get free shipping. Starting to do more and more food shopping on Amazon now that we signed up for Prime.<br /><br />Open a can of BarHarbor and just smell the juice. You'd swear they just came out of the ocean...by far the best tasting clams I've ever had. Tastes and smells like they were just harvested. We have spaghetti and clam sauce one a week...my favorite meal. Olive oil, garlic, fresh basil, red pepper, parsley, little butter, salt. Yummy!!!
