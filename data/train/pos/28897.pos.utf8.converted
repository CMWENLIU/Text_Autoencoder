The  coffee  Gods  has  indeed  spoken,  and  has  truly  blessed  the  farm  this  coffee  came  from!  I  have  been  a  coffee  drinker  for  many  years,  and  this  tops  anything  I've  ever  had  the  honor  of  drinking.  I  think  that  this  blows  away  Jamaican Blue Mountain, which is my new second favorite after trying this! It has  an impeccable taste! A little bit of chocolate, mixed with Big Island goodness. I closed my eyes and could almost imagine being on the beach on the Big Island, sipping on the very finest. Honestly guys, if you enjoy coffee, try this!! I promise you, if you're a coffee lover, you WILL love this! I am now a loyal customer. Thanks for giving me this piece of Heaven!
