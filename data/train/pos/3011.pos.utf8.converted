This is the device that has allowed my 81 year old mother to keep her 60 pound collie. I thought it would take days to train this dog how to use this and it took less than three minutes. The door was installed in room just out side the main door to the house. Some call it a mud room or breeze way. We had a carpenter do the install. The dog is able to let himself in and out all day long. If my mother leaves the house she puts the dog in the breeze way and he is set to go out to his pen and back in again. She can leave all day long and not worry about letting him out. This is just a fantastic product. The dog loves the freedom and we enjoy watching our mother with her cherished pet. I would highly recommend for most families and especially elderly pet owners.
