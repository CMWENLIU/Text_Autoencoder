Root beer barrels on steroids.  These are a sweet and delicious treat.  This flavoring is for those of us who like a kick--there is a lovely herbaceous taste to these barrels that lingers until the barrels are disintegrated in your mouth.  I tasted several herbs and spices, and even tried to read what they are made of (a guarded secret I guess).  For sure there is lots of vanilla and maybe some sassafras,  nutmeg or allspice and maybe cloves.  I am just guessing in order to give the idea of strong flavor treat these barrel will give you.  They are larger than other barrels and delightfully long lasting.  The wrapping is strong and protective, but easy to tear open.  There is not one barrel left.
