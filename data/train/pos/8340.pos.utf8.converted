Love this brand.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GE8N4Y">Nielsen-Massey 32 oz. Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract.</a> also (32 oz. seems like a  lot but it calculates to roughly a little over $1.20 per ounce.  Um, CRAZY SAVINGS.).<br /><br />You can use this as a substitute for vanilla beans for the most part but if you use this with extract you can punch up the vanilla flavor to a sinful degree.  I love using this to make vanilla bean frosting (via a Cupcake Project recipe) that tastes like vanilla bean ice cream.<br /><br />Whoever said vanilla was boring?!  ;D
