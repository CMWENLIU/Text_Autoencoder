Whoever says that cats can't be vegan doesn't know what they're talking about. There are no animal products in this cat food and all three of my cats love it. They've been on it for years and they never get sick and, at check-up time, their vet always seems to be impressed with their overall health, so why would I ever switch?<br /><br />I do wish my husband would order some smaller bags, though. This forty pound bag is difficult to maneuver when it's full!
