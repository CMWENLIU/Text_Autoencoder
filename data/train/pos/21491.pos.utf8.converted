For the price and items included these are great kits. I went by several other reviews and made 5 gallons rather than 6, definitely makes a difference. Instead of using the yeast supplied I get quality yeast that vitners use. For this wine and the Cab I used BM4X4, it does wonders to the wine. Great body and mouth feel. After the secondary fermentation I added Hungarian med+ toasted oak cubes and allowed it to bulk age for three months prior to bottling. Bulk aging brings out more complexity in the wine and because of the size of the carboy the wine is less effected by temperature variations.<br /><br />After three months in the bottle in a wine fridge at 58 deg the wine is just as good as a $50 Barolo purchased at a wine store. Yeast is everything to the wine, get advice from a winery that produces the types of wine you really enjoy, most will be glad to tell you. BM4X4 only comes in 500 gram packaging so I have enough to last quite a while (I use about 1tsp per batch - follow the manufactures instructions to prep the yeast before adding to the must) . Sealed and stored in the fridge you will get your money's worth for the quality of wine it produces. When adding oak, get cubes instead of chips, the chips will be spent in a week, 2.5 to 3oz of cubes in a 5 gallon batch for three months is almost the same as 1 year in a barrel, so taste after the first two weeks for flavor up to the taste of oak you desire. It's better to add more later to taste than add too much and over power your wine.<br /><br />I've made several batches of wine and the Barolo is by far the best one to date. The Italian Red came out very pleasant, but again, the yeast makes all the difference. To date I've made six of these kits and will continue to do so. I've made kits from other companies, but the price didn't show in quality when a great yeast and the type of oak for the flavor desired is used. Morewine website has some great reading on oak varieties and effect on wine. Do a little research and anyone can produce very nice wines.
