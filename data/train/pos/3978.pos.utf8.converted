We have a boxer (skin allergies, etc.) and a boxer/beagle mix (thicker coat than the boxer) that both love Fromm Gold Large Breed food! We tried every top brand of grain-free food (Orijen, Instinct, Wellness, etc) and experienced horrible gas in both of our dogs...so bad that  we kept cans of febreeze in every main room of our home. We started going to a new groomer at a pet supply store near us and they recommended Fromm. The store said Fromm is a family owned company with NO food recalls since opening their business in 1904. We buy our food locally, not from Amazon(we are avid Amazon shoppers in other departments), but I felt compelled to write a review to potentially help other consumers find this amazing dog food. We are on our 6th bag of Fromm and both of our dogs have beautiful coats, are maintaining healthy weights and are totally gas free! There are not enough positive words to say about this food!!
