For 3.5 years i suffered from a vaginal ulcer and scarring from vulvar vestibulitis. I had had the surgery to remove the damaged tissue and ulcer because the damage was done and the pain was permanent so the scarred skin had to be removed. one week after the surgery the doctor noted that the area was not healing at all(probably half the reason i got that damned ulcer to begin with do to my bodies lack in ability to heal itself)so he wanted me to try putting manuka honey all over the stitches and skin down there, but not before expressing his concerns that some patients have reactions to the thoney and it didnt work for them. well two weeks later after using the honey twice aday, the doctor was shocked because I had healed so much. he said in the two weeks of using the honey, it did about three weeks of healing. Today I still use the honey all the time before and after intercouse with the hubby, so if any skin breaks it will heal pretty fast and prevent another ulcer or just help with the pain. There is no itching with the use with the honey and it is actually very soothing to use.<br />Hate having to gross you all out with this review but I noticed there werent any reviews on how this honey helped heal the girl parts. Also, I use the honey while i'm on my cycle to protect my surgical area (although healed) from the blood b/c its too acidic and can "burn" the skin. interesting fact my doctor told me.
