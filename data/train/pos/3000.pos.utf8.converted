We ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AUHAHY">Eden Organic Pinto Beans, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AUBWA0">Eden Organic Black Beans, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. The quality of the beans is great, in my opinion...and of course I love that they are organic...but as another reviewer said - I thought the beans were out of date. I THOUGHT they were out of date, but after contacting the company though edenfoods.com I found out that the dates are just confusing on the packaging. When I saw "Best Before: 12DE07" I figured they expired December 12, 2007. The customer service representative that contacted me said the first two digits represent the year...meaning my beans are good until December 07, 2012. Good to know!<br /><br />And the contact on edenfoods.com was responded to quickly...I had an answer within half of a day.<br /><br />I'll be buying these again!
