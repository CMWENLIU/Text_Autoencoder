These granola thins are a great product.  Absolutely delicious and still healthy.  It's so hard to find something that tastes really good with low calories and carbs.  This particular package of three 10-pk boxes is outrageously overpriced as I picked up a 10-pk box at Kroger the other day for $3.39.  I'm thinking $19.99 for 3 boxes is a huge profit for somebody.  I love buying snacks on Amazon but I'll stick to the grocery for these until a better deal comes along.
