I picked up Bear Naked granola at a chain grocery store (expensive) after pouring over some health and fitness mags....trying to get in the routine of eating healthier.  I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best....and this granola REALLY is.  Less fat, sodium (and all the other stuff you don't want) than other boxed brands I've tried, but tons of flavor you might not expect from a "natural food".  Hats off to the two who started this company.  The banana nut granola DOES taste great!  And I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it again :)...now I just have to get the rest of my family in line...
