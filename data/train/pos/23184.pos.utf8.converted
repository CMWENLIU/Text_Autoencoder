Ramune is the Japanese version Lemonade, and it is a really nice drink, if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink. If you have been sprayed once too often, but love the taste, perhaps you should try this candy.<br /><br />I am pretty addicted to the stuff, and eat them 3 or 4 at a time. I enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste. They really taste quite a lot like ramune should. Sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading, actually. They are quite refreshing.<br /><br />These candies are not hard, and quite chewable for those who prefer that.<br /><br />For anyone looking for a candy that is not over-the-top sweet, give Ramune Soda Candy a shot. It is a nice candy and makes a great snack. Even the container looks like a ramune bottle.
