Eight O'clock coffee has been around since 1859. Can anyone honestly give a product a bad review that has somehow been sold for over 150 years?!? IT HAS BEEN AROUND THAT LONG FOR A REASON. Eight O'clock has known the importance of offering its customers whole-bean coffee instead of that pre-ground stuff in a can. For many years, this was the only coffee widely available like that and I'm glad to see that other coffees are finally coming around to what Eight O'clock has always known. Coffee is so much fresher tasting if ground just prior to brewing. This is a coffee that does not have to rely on a huge advertising budget and doesn't have to sell coffee at inflated prices just to turn a profit. Eight O'clock has been quietly plugging along for many years because it offers a great product at an excellent value.<br /><br />That being said, are there better coffees out there? Absolutely. Is there better coffee out there that can be purchase at this value? Not that I have encountered. The wonderful taste and aroma, the freshness and value, is what leads me to give this a 5-star review. I will mention that the price on line is more expensive than what I can find locally so it pays to shop around. In comparison to gourmet coffees, the roast is not consistent bean to bean as they are of varying shades. However to be fair, Eight O'clock roasts in larger batches and has never attempted to be a gourmet coffee. The other pre-ground coffees are likely the same but who could tell? Eight O'clock does use 100% Arabica beans so there is no chicory or Robust beans thrown in.<br /><br />You can purchase this pre-ground if you like but if you really want great coffee, buy the whole bean and grind just before use. Since coffee is 99% water, filtered water makes a huge difference for ANY coffee. Also, keep your beans stored in an airtight container out of sunlight, and NOT IN THE FREEZER!! If you like a bolder taste, the French roast is excellent as well. A darker roast has less caffeine than a medium to light roast so I sometimes mix 50-50 with the French roast. Either way, I enjoy my Eight O'clock coffee a lot. The bags have a one-way valve to let the built-up gasses escape and each bag has a best-by date. I have found the quality to be consistent bag to bag and year to year. If I had to compare this to my gourmet coffees I sometimes order, this would get an OK rating. But, when I compare it to all the other coffees it shares shelf space with...EIGHT O'CLOCK KICKS THEIR CAN!
