I purchased Chestnut Flour from Pasta cheese for a friend who was having great difficulty finding some in the mid west.<br />We were dilighted to recieve the order in a few days ,all perfectly wrapped,and in good shape. My friend needed it for making some Italian dishes ,and was more than pleased with the quality of the product,and has since made some very delicious recipes<br />Many thanks<br />Is there a catalogue of the other products from Pasta cheese?<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RLUNC2">Chestnut Flour</a>
