I just discovered the many benefits on coconut oil and started using it for cooking and on mine and my kid's bodies after a bath instead of lotion...leaves skin super soft and with a very light coconut oil smell.<br />We just did food allergy testing on my son and he came back positive for milk (we suspected it) so now we use this oil as a spread on his waffles, bread, etc. in all recipes that call for butter and even add a little to my kid's smoothies.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />Please note this comes in PLASTIC CONTAINER MADE OF PLASTIC #1 (botton of bottle has the little triangle with #1 inside and word PETE), most websites state this is a safe plastic (some argued otherwise but do your own research and decide for yourself), I won't argue that glass is better than any plastic but I'm just putting this as reference for anyone that's interested since I noticed all the bad reviews are due to this oil using a plastic container so if this is a big concern for you DON'T BUY IT!
