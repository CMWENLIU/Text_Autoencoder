I bought this to add variety to my diet, and tried the teff pudding recipe on the back - delicious, I think. My family didn't agree, but they did like the bread I made with teff flour. Hmm...perhaps if I soaked the grain overnight first, that would make for a smoother pudding. Try the pudding, or add the grain to a mix for breakfast or as a side dish - it's healthy and it tastes good.
