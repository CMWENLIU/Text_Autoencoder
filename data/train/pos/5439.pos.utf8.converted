Community Coffee's chicory is great for people like me who love "New Orleans" coffee--coffee blended with chicory. I used to order New Orleans coffee online until I discovered that I could buy the chicory by itself and mix it with various coffees at home. This way I can determine the ratio I want and I don't have to order so often.
