These are so good.  You can't beat the price either. There are a lot, but if you love olives it's no problem to use them up.<br /><br />Updated 4/2010 - the price is nearly twice what it used to be.  Still a decent deal, but not nearly the deal it was.  The price has been going up for a while, but when I original reviewed them they were 19.87 for 5 pounds.
