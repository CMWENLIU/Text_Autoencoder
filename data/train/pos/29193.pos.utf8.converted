Fan of Jelly Belly and took a chance on these, not sure if they were the real thing or not.  They are.  A good deal.  A bit more expensive than generic jelly beans but certainly a better bargain than the standard label Jelly Belly.  Same flavors, etc.  If you like high-end jelly beans, these are as good as any.
