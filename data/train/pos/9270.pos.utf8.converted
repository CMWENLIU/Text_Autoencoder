I didn't even know there was GROUND bay leaves and from now on I will definitely use this product as it is much easier to add to recipes and I don't have to fish out any leaves when my food is done cooking. I primarily add bay leaves to soups and stews and a special gumbo recipe I make. I love this version of bay leaves!
