I have an adorable 6-year-old Exotic Shorthair cat. Within the past year he mysteriously developed all sorts of food sensitivities. If he would eat anything containing fish, dairy, glutens, corn, grains, starches, guar gum, xanthan gum, etc, he would have really nasty diarrhea, sometimes with a little blood in it, so i tried different foods for weeks and weeks, losing sleep trying to solve the problem. I was terrified for him so i got him tested for everything. The test results were inconclusive, so the vet said that he probably just had a sensitive digestive system...but when i put him on sensitive stomach foods from other companies, he still had the same problem, and those sensitive stomach foods all contain glutens, corn, etc, and most canned food contains guar gum, so the whole thing seemed hopeless. Plus, i was scared for my cat because chronic diarrhea leads to dehydration, malnutrition, anemia, etc, so my cat seemed doomed. Then during an internet search i found out about Dr. Wysong and his Epigen food. I tried the small bag first. Within 24 hours my cat's stool was 85% normal. And within  2 or 3 days it was totally normal as if he'd never had a problem. This pet food is amazing! It changed my cat's life! Epigen is made for both cats and dogs. I buy the chicken formula. I'm a customer for life and i pray that they never stop making this stuff!
