For an Old Salt like me who has tasted his share of fine chocolates and trouffles over the years it was a nice surprise to come across the "A Touch Of Salt" Lindt chocolate bar.  The dark chocolate has just the right amount of salt to stimulate the taste buds without going overboard.  Great, great flavor that will make you wanting for more, so be careful!  I'm buying a 12-pack to give out to clients!  Highly recommended!
