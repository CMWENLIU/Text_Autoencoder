First of all, I am not really into all that really hot, spicy food. Some spiciness is alright, but bland food is fine with me. Here at the house we were watching some funny videos on youtube, people eating these, and after some talking about it, I bought this 15-pack, and I have to say, the people in the videos weren't trying to be funny; this stuff is unreal!<br /><br />If you just hold it by the stem and bite a piece off, you'd better have a butt-load of bread and dairy products on hand, because the experience is something you'd never expect. I chewed it on the left side of my mouth, and quickly felt like there was a blow-torch searing my tongue and inner cheek. It took my breath away for a moment, and I lost my voice. Then my throat started to burn, and I could feel the heat radiating from inside my body. I drank some 1% lowfat and then got the cold sweats. It definitely is a different experience.<br /><br />So if you want to make your prepared foods with an extra punch, or are just into some college-hazing type pranks, this is doubtless something to consider. It's amazing that something this volatile is even edible.
