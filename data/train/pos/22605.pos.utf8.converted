I have been looking for REAL maple candy for years now.  Not the "creamy" kind that is found everywhere, but the type that has been cooked down so long that the sugar crystals truly harden.  I was hoping that was what I would find from Butternut Mountain Farms after reading some of the reviews, and boy oh boy, was I right!  This is not stale candy as some reviewers claim, but candy cooked to perfection!  I just finished an entire leaf and I am so happy that I could dance the jig!  Thank you Butternut Mountain Farms!  I feel like I'm a kid growning up on the East coast again!
