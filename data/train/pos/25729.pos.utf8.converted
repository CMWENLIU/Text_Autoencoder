I have been on low carb for years and have never really found a replacement cracker. The fakes are too eggy..or taste terrible. I love these. Now granted they really need something on top. But so what. Most crackers do. They are great with a slice of cheese..I have made them into little pizza's..wonderful. Will definitely buy again
