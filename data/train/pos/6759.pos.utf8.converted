Delicious, warming, nourishing tea for a chilly day. This product is a bagged mixture of green tea and little bits of toasted rice. When brewed, you get tea that has a sort of cozy, toasty, nutty flavor to it. It's really pleasant to sip on a blustery autumn day! Some tips: green tea is more delicate than black, so use water that is slightly cooled from boiling--not at boiling temperature--as you would with an herbal tea. Also, this tea, IMHO, is best left unsweetened; the sugar would mask the delicate green tea flavor and the nuttiness of the toasted rice. Brew it for about 3-5 minutes, although (unlike with black tea) you won't end up with an undrinkably bitter brew if left in longer.<br /><br />Also, as noted before--this is tea, NOT soup. The rice is enclosed in the bag with the tea leaves. It lends flavor, not substance.
