Flour is the Key! No store flour feels like 00 flour when it's made. It's like silk.<br />Without 00 flour it's not going to be as good a pizza, that is a fact.<br />Antimo Caputo 00 Pizzeria Flour is the foundation to great pizza.<br />I have been making my own pizza dough for ten years. I have experimented with every grocery store flour around. From Bread, Self Rising, Cake and combinations of them all. I've added light beer, dark beer, cornmeal, milk, special yeast, sugar, honey, olive oil...etc etc etc<br />I cook in oven and outside B-B-Q grill, both camping and at home.<br /><br />If you only add this flour in place of any grocery store flour, you will produce such a better pizza it will shock you!<br /> Find receipts online and refine to what works for you.<br />On baking, I use a stone in the center of a electric oven @ 500
