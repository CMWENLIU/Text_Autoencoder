I bought this coconut oil based solely on other great customer reviews and believe me when I tell you how happy I am that I did! I am 39 years old and at the age where health is something that is starting to become very important to me, as I am starting to see more and more friends and school mates with various health issues.. I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to "fix" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.! I would recommend this coconut oil to everyone because of it's many health benefits and versatility of use (You can spread it on your toast it tastes so great or cook with it as you would any cooking oil, as well as use it on your skin. Google Coconut oil moisturizer recipes, cooking recipes and also health benefits for yourself as well as the  health benefits for your dogs if you have pets. You will be amazed at all the interesting information on the web about coconut oil))! Unless you truly dislike coconuts I think you will find, like me, that you now have a new favorite oil!
