I have bought the Fiber One Bars in Oats & Chocolate, and Oats & Peanut Butter.  I love them both.  The Chocolate are my personal favorite.  It's nice to me to have them individually wrapped for a quick snack or meal to keep in my car while I'm driving to jobs or between jobs.  The taste is sweet and satisfies my sweet tooth without a lot of the guilt and it does fill you up and has 35% fiber.  It's especially nice to order groceries through Amazon when they are having sales and then get them delivered for free to your door.  My kind of grocery shopping!  You won't go wrong with these snacks or meals!
