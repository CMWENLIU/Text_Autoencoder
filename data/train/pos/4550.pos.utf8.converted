A 6-10% solution in H20 will clean your toilet and tub/shower just as well as commercial products and for pennies on the dollar. Citric Acid is actually the main ingredient in many tub and shower cleaners. It chelates mineral stains well, and is actually easiest to use sparingly from a spay bottle right after you shower. I just spray a little around, and after I dry off I rinse it with the shower head. It takes about 30 seconds total every other shower, but you never, never need to clean your tub or shower again if you do this. Be careful not to inhale it as it is still mildly irritating. Commercial products add some surfactants to help reduce mist and help it stick to surfaces, but with every-other-day-use I find that the h20 solution keeps the tub and shower perfectly clean and the chrome shiny without any real work. Kills Germs too!<br /><br />Can also be used as a mild facial peel/scrub.
