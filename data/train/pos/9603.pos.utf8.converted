I purchased this for myself for Christmas.  Love it.  Don't believe those complainers that it's too bright and noisy.  Where did they put--on their nightstand?  Mine is in the kitchen and I don't usually sleep there.  It is bright--you need light to grow plants.  There is a very slight hum and water sound.  Unless you are sitting right next to it listening for something to complain about it won't disturb you.  It's not really "aero" but who cares as long as the plants are growing.  I looked into building my own, but it would cost more and not be automatic.<br /><br />I planted the herbs and they are growing nicely, especially the basil plants.  I have had to raise the lights three times already.  Instructions seem to cover everything--especially how to harvest your crop.  In the box is a coupon to purchase more seeds for something like $4.99.<br /><br />I purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond using their 20% off coupon.  However, I really appreciate the fast response Amazon has for refunds--the same day they receive a return!  Never a problem with Amazon.<br /><br />You can also make your own "pods" and grow whatever small plants you want.  I'm going to try cherry tomatoes next.
