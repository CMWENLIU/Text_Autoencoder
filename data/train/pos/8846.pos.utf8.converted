Easy, tasty mint tea brew. For months I used k cup just for one over sized mint tea cup, but accidently used it again and found that the weaker 2nd cup was very tasty! SO I recommend getting the best value and use it 2x for yourself and it becomes twice as good. Well worth the price for the convenience and taste. :)
