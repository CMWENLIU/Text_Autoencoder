I really like regular Triscuits but (to me) they taste too salty.  The Hint of Salt Triscuits have enough salt to taste great.  The other nice thing is that there are only 3 ingredients (whole wheat, oil, and salt).<br /><br />Just so you know where I'm coming from: I'm not concerned with sodium intake, just the taste (and that it doesn't have 100 ingredients).
