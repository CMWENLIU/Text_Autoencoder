Okay.  I wasn't raised Jewish, I grew up in a series of small towns in the south where the possibility of Kosher food was....remote.  I don't even like celery.  So can someone explain to me why I find this stuff so incredibly addicting?<br /><br />This drink is an enigma wrapped inside a mystery wrapped inside a pea-green can.  Most people in the country have never even heard of it.  It seems the only people who do enjoy it are people who grew up drinking it at their local Kosher deli.  And even *then*, it's a niche all to itself.  Mention celery soda to someone, and they won't believe you.  Give 'em some to taste and ninety-nine times out of a hundred they still won't believe it.  But ohhhh, that one percent!  They are hooked for life, and you've found a fellow sufferer.<br /><br />You'd think, with all the "indy" soda companies popping up nowadays, experiments with new flavors and so on, we'd see more innovative flavors along these lines.  I guess we're still playing catch up with 100-year-old recipes from  doctors who may not even have existed.<br /><br />Seriously, not for everyone by any means, but if you're one of the chosen few, you'll never find anything like it.
