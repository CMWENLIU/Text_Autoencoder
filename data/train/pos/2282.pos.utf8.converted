Nutiva raw, certified-organic, non-GMO chia seeds are a great low-carb, gluten-free, omega-3 containing, high-fiber source of protein.  When added to a liquid, after 5 minutes, chia thickens the liquid to a thin tapioca-like consistency while the tiny tan-to-brownish-grey seeds, which look like shiny, slightly elongated, flattened poppy seeds, develop a clear gel coat and stay crunchy. Chia seeds can also be added to baked goods, porridges, and smoothies. When eaten straight from the package, the chia seeds are crunchy, for the most part flavorless, and become slippery with a faint seedy, bitter finish, which is minimally noticeable if added to foods.<br />The Nutiva chia seeds received were in resealable, opaque, metallicized packages with a "packed on" date of 6/22/2010 and a "best before" date of 6/2012.
