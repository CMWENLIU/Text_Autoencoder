I love this cat food!  I currently have four cats, two of which have food allergy issues.  As if that wasn't bad enough, 3/4 of them are finicky about dry cat foods!  I settled on this brand after trying so many others (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL2IC">AvoDerm Natural Chicken and Herring Meal Formula Adult Dry Cat Food (18-lb bag)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000633ZI0">Natural Balance Original Ultra Premium Dry Cat Food (15-lb bag)</a> among others).  This was the first one that not only did my cats love the taste of, but I saw a noticable change in my female cat who has the worst of the skin/digestive allergy issues.  My male cat also showed improvement in his coat and skin.  I mix this with another wellness product <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BOVE54">Wellness CORE Original Cat Food, 12 lbs.</a> and they're pretty happy cats!  I also use the Wellness puppy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002I0GXG">Wellness Just For Puppy Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)</a> for our Vizsla and she loves it!  I will be sticking with this brand!
