I like to keep my dogs teeth as clean as possible in between her yearly cleanings at the vet.  After trying a variety of methods, I settled on these chews for my dog(lab/shepard mix 80 pounds) because the rawhide C.E.T. chews were too easy for her to tear apart and choke on the large pieces.  The thin slices of rawhide tear too easily for larger and stronger dogs.  My dog nearly choked to death on the rawhide chews.  So I switched to these chews for my dog and they work great.  My dogs breath doesn't stink and this formulation is easy on her stomach.
