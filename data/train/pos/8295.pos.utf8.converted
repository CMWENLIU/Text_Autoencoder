I looked for these in every grocery store within a 25 mile radius, since I needed them for a pumpkin spice scone. I purchased them in the past when I lived on the other side of the country, but absolutely could not find them in my new area. These cinnamon chips add another layer of flavor in your baking. They're also quite nice when eaten out of hand. Mixing them in an oatmeal raisin cookie batter is another way I like these. They give a little cinnamon burst to your baking.
