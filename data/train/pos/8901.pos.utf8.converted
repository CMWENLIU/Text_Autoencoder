I bought this coffee after reading anothers review.(B Edwards)<br />I had also tried different pods trying to find one that would make a strong full bodied coffee flavor without breaking the bank. Note: The pods are 12 grams so they will not fit the standard Senseo pod holder. You will have to use the extended holder to accomodate this pod. If you like strong coffee, this is the pod for you.
