I received the packet of dry starter in just a few days.  I followed the instructions that came with it for bringing the dry starter to life, and the new starter took right off as it was supposed to.<br /><br />I've been making excellent bread with it and have passed on jars of this starter to friends.  So far no problems, except I want to learn how to give my bread a more sour tang.  I'm looking forward to making sourdough pancakes and waffles with it.
