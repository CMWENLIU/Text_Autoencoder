We have loved Jennies Macaroons for quite some time.  They are naturally sweet without additives and chemicals in other cookies and are great for a energy boosting snack in the afternoon.  They have the added bonus of being gluten free for those who are sensitive.  The price from Amazon makes them even more appealing!
