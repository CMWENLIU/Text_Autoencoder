I have been using More Than Gourmet for about a year, and I cannot go back to supermarket stock (even the higher end market stuff).  MTG is so much better than anything out there.  You can actually taste the "roasting" that created these reductions.  My current favorite is the chicken (this product), and I use it for cooking meats and grains, as an au jus for sandwiches, and as a base for simple sauces.  It's even good straight up with toast points!  The turkey is also a favorite, and is indispensible for October through December recipes. Very glad that Amazon is now carrying this line; very high quality and very good company (found a market niche, answered my customer service questions promptly and with a great attitude).
