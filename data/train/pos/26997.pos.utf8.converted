I love chocolate.  This is one of my favorites.  Great dark chocolate with a filling that actually tastes like rasberry and even has some rasberry seeds in it!  I wish it wasn't in the square form factor--I prefer conventional rounds or ovals but that is a moot point.  The other Ghirardelli squares are pretty good too (except the white chocolate--what an abomination!) but the rasberry really stands out as EXCELLENT!
