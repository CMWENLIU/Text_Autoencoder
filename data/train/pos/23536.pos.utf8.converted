First time i tried an un-salted pretzel! In one day I was hooked on them! I've ordered and eat all 12 bags a week myself!!If you dont bring them back REAL SOON I won't ORDER ANOTHER SNYDER'S OR OTHER PRETZEL BRAND. I TRIED SEVERAL OTHERS AND THEY ARE TOO SALTY! NO OTHER BRAND EVEN HAS AN UN-SALTED MINI PRETZEL.. THEY ARE ALL TOO HARD OR TOO SALTY!,,, I SAY: BRING 'EM BACK NOW!!!!
