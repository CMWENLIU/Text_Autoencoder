I had been wanting to try rice bran oil for several months, but couldn't find it anywhere locally.  I even went to an Asian grocery store and they had never heard of it!  After searching I discovered that Amazon had the Tophe 1/2 gallon rice bran oil for a better price than any other that I could find, so I ordered two of them.  I poured both into my deep fryer, and WOW!  I couldn't believe how easily and perfectly everything browned, and everything came out perfectly crispy on the outside.  On the inside, very moist and delicious.  Plus, this oil doesn't soak into the food like a lot of other oils, so you don't really get an oily or greasy taste.  I just received my next three bottles so I can change out the fryer next time.  I'm totally sold on this oil, and I really don't understand why it's not available everywhere. It browns and crisps better than peanut oil, is better for you than canola oil, has a higher smoke point than most oils, has a light taste that doesn't stick to foods, and makes a fantastic coating for charcoal grills to keep food from sticking to them.  After just a few weeks those are my observations, and I'm still finding things I like.  This is really THE PERFECT FRYING OIL.
