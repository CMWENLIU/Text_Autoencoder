I have a 6 year old chocolate labrador retriever.  Chip has been plagued with a dry itchy coat and profuse shedding for the past 5 yrs.  My vet thought that he was allergic to grains and suggested I try the Nature's Variety GRAIN FREE dog food.  After two months, chip's skin stopped flaking, his shedding reduced exponentailly and his coat was as shiny as when he was a pup. I was a skeptic in the beginning thinking that chip was on the pro plan diet and that was good, right? WRONG!  I highly recommend this food.  Do the research and find what low grade ingredients are in name brand pet foods on the market today.  When all of the dog food poisionings and recalls happened you never seen this brand on the list.  I truly am a believer in this product.
