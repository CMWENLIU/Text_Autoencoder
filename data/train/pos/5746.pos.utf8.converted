I discovered this great product about 2 months ago and since then have consumed five jars of it. I love it. Hardly a day goes by when I don't have some. No it isn't peanut butter but it has a near nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry seems to work best) makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this "Peanut Spread" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons).
