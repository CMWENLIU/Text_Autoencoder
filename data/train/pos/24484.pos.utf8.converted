This is one of the best nutrition bars I have ever eaten.  As another reviewer stated, it is like a rice krispy treat.  However, dare I say, this bar is better-tasting than a rice krispy treat.  It's made with rice, oats, nuts, sugar cane juice, and a chocolate underbelly.  The bar is good for a quick snack if you're hungry between meals, and if you divide your meals up to five a day, then it's basically a meal.  Each bar has 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protien, so it will help fill you up more than that junky Snickers.  They're a little on the expensive side, but it's worth it.
