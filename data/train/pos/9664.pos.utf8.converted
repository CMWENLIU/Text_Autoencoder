My 7 year old border collie has a very sensitive stomach.  Purina, Benefit, Science Diet, and even home made dog foods (rice, oatmeal, carrots, chicken) would give her diarrhea and/or make her vomit.  She hates peanut butter, cheese, apples, carrots, and all the standard treats dogs usually love.  But once I put her on this stuff, she eats regularly, never gets sick, and has bowel movements with no troubles at all.  This food is great!  And the price is amazing for the amount you receive.
