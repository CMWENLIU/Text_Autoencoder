Walmart, in their infinite wisdom, decided to remove Brach's Gummi Bears from the shelf in favor of some mystery bears packaged under the "Great Value" brand. These generic Walmart bears are all sugar and no sour/tart/fruit flavoring. The green ones taste the exact same as the red, orange and yellow ones. IMHO, they are hideous. I had to come to Amazon to get my fix. I have had imported bears from Germany that were too hard, too tart and cost 4 times as much. For me, these are the best! Btw, if you are trying to quit smoking and you need something relatively harmless to chew on while you contemplate the demise of all the people you know that deserve it; these bears will fill the gap and help you resist giving your boss a piece of your mind when he/she is convinced you can do more with less.
