I bought a bottle of Dave's Insanity twelve years ago at a hot sauce store in Boulder, CO, back when Dave's was the hottest sauce made. One or two drops in a pot of soup made the whole thing damn near unbearable (yet my roommate managed to use half the bottle in around 2 months).<br /><br />So when I saw the salsa, I thought I knew what I was getting into. I assumed that the salsa would be pretty ungodly hot  but somehwat milder than the sauce, given that this contains OTHER ingredients like tomatoes and onions. Boy, was I wrong. This stuff is as hot as the Insanity sauce, even though it is "diluted" with salsa ingredients. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The heat won't kill you, and it won't even cause any real damage. (It'll just feel that way.)<br /><br />Don't expect to empty the jar at the same rate at which you scarf down that chipotle corn salsa or the green olive tomatillo tapanade, though. I eat a little bit of this everyday with tortilla chips and sour cream, sprinkle a tiny amount on a plateful of nachos, and spread an 1/8 teaspoonful on quesadillas, and have for the last three months. I think the salsa level has decreased by a few tablespoons in that time, and to me that seems like progress.<br /><br />Good stuff, but only for committed chileheads (or, more accurately, for those chileheads who should be committed).
