I have been a subscriber to Gevalia Coffee and tea products for over 10 years.  I started subscribing because of their flavored coffees.  All of Gevalia coffees come in airtight shrink wrapped foil which protects their flavor.<br /><br />Vanilla Nut has a wonderful nutty flavor that the vanilla helps to smooth out.  Once you try Gevalia coffees it will be hard to go back to drinking other coffees.  I tried to save money by purchasing other flavored coffees in my grocery store and the grocery store coffee always tasted stale.  Once I went back to drinking the Gevalia coffee, one sip made me realize that I would never be able to give it up completely.  Their coffee has such a rich and smooth texture that I have never gotten with other coffees.
