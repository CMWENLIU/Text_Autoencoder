I have purchased Broadway dried fruit baskets in different sizes - some with fruit and nuts and some with all fruit - several times for various friends and relatives.  Everyone has raved about them - not just how beautifully arranged they are but also how tasty the fruit is.<br /><br />Shipping has always been prompt and delivery almost always a couple days ahead of the date promised when the order has been placed. So far they have been 100% GREAT! The only complaint was one person who said it was almost too pretty to eat.... LOL ...as he was munching on a piece of it.<br /><br />I hope people are giving me honest feedback on how good these dried fruit assortments are because I plan to continue to order more in the future!
