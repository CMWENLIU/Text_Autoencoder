For those of you that have never had real shortbread or cheap shortbread then you MUST try Walkers! They make the BEST shortbread you'll ever eat! I bought a couple bulk packs since the price was so good, they make a great afternoon snack to tide you over for dinner. Catch these on a good deal and you wont be disappointed!
