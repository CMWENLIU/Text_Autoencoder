This 5 hour energy flavor is my favorite by far.<br />It tastes less "sweetened" than the other flavors and has a more natural, juicy taste.<br />The energy kick from 5 hour energy drinks always affected me mentally, rather than physically... which is a great thing.<br />For example, classic energy drinks usually get me very hyper and restless.  Some particularly strong ones even make my hands shake.<br />But these energy shots don't affect my body like that at all.  Rather, they create a sensation of great concentration and focus, which allows me to perform at my job much better.<br /><br />One word of caution is that if you drink more than 1 per day ( I was shooting 2 per day for a while ) this may create adverse health side effects. It greatly impacted my appetite.<br />If you are to rely on 5 hours for energy I recommend 1 per day, MAX.
