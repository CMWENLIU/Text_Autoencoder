I finally ordered Amy Sedaris' entertaining book after reading that her recipe for pumpkin pie is the one on the can!<br /><br />It's really easy.  I didn't have evaporated milk or I didn't want to look for it and made the recipe with just the eggs and spices.  One hundred percent pumpkin puree is a great idea!  Last month, purveyors in "aristocratic" New York were selling pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving for $50 each.  Considering how many Manhattanites and Brooklynites are originally out of towners who are not unfamiliar with canned food, I'm really amazed at how many rich people there are in New York City who are comfortable paying these prices.  We finally landed a perfectly acceptable 5-inch pie from Whole Foods supermarket that we didn't even finish - the price was $5.99.<br /><br />Some people may find this recipe too strongly spiced.  Wolfgang Puck's recipe is basically less of the spices and more eggs and milk to the same amount of pumpkin puree so that means one is at liberty to adjust the measurements as one pleases.
