Amazon offers a good price for this vanilla.  If you find you bake a lot you will be pleased with the quanity.  We go through a lot of vanilla.  Buying these 4oz bottles on Amazon just makes sense.  They don't always pack them very well.  I guess it depends on the person.  These are glass bottles.  So far none have ever been broken but once, one did leak.  This is vanilla you can feel great about purchasing because not only is it organic but it is also fair trade (workers get paid a fair wage - no slave labor).  No plastic bottles to leach into your vanilla.  Wonderful scent & simply perfect for baking.  Why would you ever buy the cheap immitation vanilla in the grocery store when you can have REAL vanilla?  Do yourself & the enviornment a favor & make the switch.  You'll be happy you did!
