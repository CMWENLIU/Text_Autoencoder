I highly recommend this product, I hope they get it back in stock soon.  It has an intensely smokey flavor.  I had read the reviews, and was cautiously optimistic when I tried it.  I had previously purchased a very expensive brand, received three small tins of hot, sweet, and mild smoked paprika and used it like gold.  It was excellent, but too expensive, and as a result I was not using and experimenting with it as I usually would.  This is wonderfully priced, you receive 24 ounces, plenty to share, or use with ease.  Great flavor, great color, convenient packaging.  Highly recommend!!
