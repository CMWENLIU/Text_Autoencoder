One of my New Years Resolutions is to eat more whole grains so I've been substituting this White Winter Wheat where ever all purpose flour is asked for. Tonight I made up pie crust & cookies.<br />Lost a few pounds & my blood sugar is much more stable.<br />Very happy with the quality no dust in with the grains.<br />Grinds up beautifully!
