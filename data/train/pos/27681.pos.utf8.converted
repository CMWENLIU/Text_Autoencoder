I moved from Northern California to the Ozark Mountains of northern Arkansas. I can get Starbucks at the nearby grocery stores or more expensive "gourmet" coffees, but that's about it. I have been on the lookout for robust,full flavored whole bean coffees at reasonable prices. I tried Pete's espresso blend and liked it, but it wasn't available the last time I checked. So I tried this Fogbuster and I like it even more. Good thing, since it comes in a 5 lb. bag. If you like Starbucks French Roast, this compares quite favorably.
