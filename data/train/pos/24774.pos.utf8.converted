I tried this formula after switching from Similac.  My son was first started on Similac Advance at the hospital, and tolerated it well until week 2 when he became so constipated we had to give him a suppository per his pediatrician.  We tried Enfamil Gentlease, and he seemed to hate it right from the start, then after remembering my cousin rave about this formula with her daughter, we tried the Good start.  I wish I had started him off with this from the beginning.  He immediately drank it down, unlike the Gentlease which he wouldn't even take more then a few sucks of.  He tolerated it so well, and the constipation was gone.  He was still gassy a bit, as all babies seem to be, but nothing excessive like before.  For a few weeks he was still a bit fussy when having a bowel movement, but again, it was such a drastic improvement from where we had been prior.  As time went by his stools became easier to pass, and now there is no fussing at all.  The preparation is easy.  You simply add the powder to water and shake.  There had been different directions on some older cans with boiling water then adding the powder, but that has since been replaced with the simple, add powder to water and shke version.  THere are far fewer bubbles after shaking then the other formula's I have tried (Similac, Enfamil) and the clumping is minimal.  Simply take a spoon etc.. to break up clumps.  The smell is tolerable too, and is much better then the other formula's I have smelled.  The price is good as well.  Babies r us seems to have the cheapest price at around $20 a can, but other stores like Kmart, Target etc... seem to come in around $23 a can and drug stores (not recommended) come in highest at $25-26 a can.  I have actually found grocery stores to be cheaper then independent drug stores for the formula, but by the far babies r us has the cheapest price.
