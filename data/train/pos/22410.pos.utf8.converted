I started buying this brand of food when my dog had a litter of puppies (I bought the puppy-lover's bag).  I loved that it has wholesome ingredients, and that "meat" is the first ingredient on the list.  Look through the bags of dog foods at your grocer and you'll see that meat isn't first or second, and then when you find it you'll find it only contains "meat by-products."  My pets have had a healthy coat & firm stools eating this brand of dog food, and you can't beat the price.  The added chelated minerals and natural preservatives create a holistic pet food.  I will continue to feed this to my dogs and recommend it to my friends as well.
