I was hesitant to buy this product when I saw it in the local gas station however given the odd flavor I was drawn to it.  The gum actually tastes like mint chocolate chip ice cream, its freaking excellent!  The flavor lasts a good 20-30 minutes.  Afraid that they would soon discontinue the gum today I went to my near by bulk buy store and stocked up on 2 ten packs of 15 packs.  I highly recommend this product.
