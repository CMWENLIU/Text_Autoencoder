White miso is my favorite; its sweet qualities make it perfect for braising vegetables.  I used to purchase Miso Master and Eden white miso.  However, the cost for each was typically ten dollars for ten to sixteen ounces of product.  Since I primarily cook with miso, I was looking for bulk product that still had a good flavor profile.  I was so happy to find the Roland white miso on Amazon.  Roland white miso is flavorful and economical.<br /><br />When you order from Amazon, you get two substantial bags of miso that are each 35.3 ounces.  Once opened, Miso really doesn't go bad so I didn't fret about ordering this large quantify.  I use some types of miso less frequently, such as red miso, and from personal experience I know it can keep for over a year or more.<br /><br />As I frequently cook with my miso, I wanted to make sure that the Roland miso could be substitute for Miso Master and Eden without impacting the end flavor of my recipes.  I'm happy to report that I have not noticed any substantial flavor differences in my dishes since switching from the Eden and Miso Master brands for most of my cooking:<br /><br />Nutritionally, Roland's white miso has more calories, more fat, more sodium, and more protein than the other brands of white miso that I have used.  Here is the nutritional profile of Roland white miso:<br /><br />Serving size: 1 tablespoon<br />Servings per 35.3 oz bag: 62<br /><br />Calories: 35 per serving<br />Fat: 1 gram per serving<br />sodium: 740 mg per serving<br />Total Carbohydrates: 4 grams per serving<br />Dietary Fiber: Less than 1 gram per serving<br />Sugars: 4 grams per serving<br />Protein: 2 grams per serving<br /><br />The ingredients and prominence of certain ingredients in the Roland miso differ from the Eden and Miso Master products.  Miso Master and Eden do not put alcohol in their white miso.  Additionally, Roland uses a lot of water in the composition of its product -- water is the first ingredient.  In the Eden product, rice is the first ingredient.  In the Miso Master product, soybeans are the first ingredient.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, soybeans, rice, salt, alcohol.<br /><br />If you are looking for a white miso with less sodium, Eden's white miso has 330 mg. per tablespoon.  Miso Master has about 540 mg. of sodium per tablespoon.<br /><br />For cooking, this product has served me well. Health wise, it may fall behind other white miso brands out there but for my purposes it works well.<br /><br />This product is made in Japan.
