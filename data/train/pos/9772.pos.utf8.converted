I visited a boutique food cafe where I had the opportunity to do a complete balsamic vinegar tasting of high end vinegars. This was the best and until you do a tasting, you can not believe the difference in taste. Since I fell in love with it, the shop discontinued the Elsa so I have purchased it a couple of times online. It's well worth it!!
