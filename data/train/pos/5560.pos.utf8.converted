I buy a case every few months along with a case of Bob's Red Mill Muesli. I combine the 40 oz bag of Muesli with the 16 oz bag of the Lecithin, and mix it all together in a large zip lock bag. It tastes great. I eat it for breakfast, and then snack on it throughout the day. Quite filling, and a healthy alternative to most snacks.<br /><br />I had liver failure several years ago, and one of my doctors recommended Lecithin Granules.  Lecithin helps your liver produce Choline which ultimately helps your liver process fats more effectively.  I can really feel a difference when I skip it for a few days.
