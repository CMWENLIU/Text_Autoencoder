This is high quality coffee and it's well worth it. When brewed, you can really taste the rich flavoring which is added through the unique civet processing method. It tastes like a mixture of coffee, chocolate, peanut butter, and poo. And this is no ordinary poo. It's much better tasting than any other I've found laying around.<br /><br />Though, I have come to prefer eating the beans fresh, that way you really get the flavor of the civet's digestive enzymes and it's a bit nutty that way.
