I honestly don't think there is another dressing out there as healthy AND tasty as this one - I have been buying it for several years now and can truly say that I am addicted to the amazing taste. SOOOO good!!! No sacrificing taste for healthy ingredients here! I cracked up at the other reviewers' comments about drinking whatever was left after finishing off the salad since I thought I was the only one. And how can you go wrong with these ingredients: Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Bragg Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, purified water, organic honey, organic garlic, Bragg Liquid Aminos, organic onion, organic black pepper, natural xanthan gum. The only item on the list I am not crazy about it Xanthan Gum due to its frequent association with corn, a universally mold-contaminated crop, and some controversial reports (not all Xanthan Gum is made from corn, but as a fermented additive I would not be excited if I learned that Bragg's uses the corn version). Fortunately it is the last (meaning least amount used) ingredient on the list. But overall, I LOVE this product and even with the one possble weak link, still think it it WAAAY better than anything else out there (other than making your own, which I used to do before I fell in love with this ;-).
