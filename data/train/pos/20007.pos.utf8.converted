I ordered this product from Amazon with hesitancy, which I normally buy from Indian grocery stores.  When I placed the order the shipping date showed as 30 to 45 days, but it arrived in 7 days.  The product was fresher and cheaper than any grocery stores.  I use it as a snack and to and to desserts. I was thrilled with the experience of ordering a food item from a website, from where I only bought electronic items and books.  This is one of the best purchases I made at Amazon. I ordered the "Frontier Cardamom Pods" along with this order to avoid paying shipping charges and plus I use it in Indian tea and desserts.  I give this product 5 stars as it arrived on time, and when I opened the packet it was fresh, and full of flavor and would highly recommend buying this product from Amazon.
