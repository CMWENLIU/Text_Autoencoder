I became addicted to this stuff shortly after my first child was born.  Between nursing and not sleeping, I ate A LOT of peanut butter sandwiches in those months.  I have tried almost every 'natural' brand out there - I won't eat anything hydrogenated or containing HFCS.  Trader Joe's flax PB is pretty good. But then I discovered this stuff and have not switched back.  Perfect crunch and just the right amount of sweetness to make it yummy, but not what I would call sweet (and I don't like overly sweet things as a rule).  The only minor downer is that the jars from Amazon arrive with the PB separated a bit.  This is no big deal for Natural PB veterans, but it something that you don't find when you buy this in the store.  You have to assiduously stir it up or you'll get to the end of the jar with something closer to modeling clay.
