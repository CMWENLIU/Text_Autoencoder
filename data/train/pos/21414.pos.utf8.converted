I had problems with my gums and had a high C-Reactive Protein reading (10+), a sign of inflamation in the body and not good if you have high cholestorol. I saw a news clip on 5 superfoods and how they could beneift your body. Acai was attributed with lowering body inflamation. I saw a Zola Daily Wellness Shot at a smoothie store and bought it. After two months of a daily shot my CRP fell to 1.5, a low normal reading. My dentist could not believe the change in my gums. Unfotunately, Zola stopped making the shot and I tried other brands of acai berry juice. Horrid taste, akin to fermented prune juice. I found out, however, that Jamba teamed up with Zola and created Jamba-labled shots using Zola Juice. I talked with Zola and the company said it had the same ORAC (3,000) of the Zola Shot and the same 26,000mg of antioxidents. It is not quite as tasty as the Zola shot but it is pretty tasty itself. With the health benefits I get from it, the juice taste is darn good enough. My family has started taking it and I am hearing they are having the same results.
