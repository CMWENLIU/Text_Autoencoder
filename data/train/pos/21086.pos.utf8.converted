I was given a box of this when I purchased my kitten. He loves it and we love it. It scoops well, isn't dusty, is safe for kittens and isn't scented (I am chemically sensitive so this matters a lot to me). Even if he ate it it wouldn't harm him since it is just wheat. If I keep the minimum of 3" level in the litter pan it doesn't stick to the bottom. I've been amazed at how well it scoops. I just scoop it morning and evening and it doesn't get smelly at all.<br /><br />You may want to get this locally since, after shipping, the discount usually works out about the same.
