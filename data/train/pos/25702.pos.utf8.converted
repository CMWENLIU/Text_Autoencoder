After watching a documentary about the benefits of coca leaf I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon. However, I was not too thrilled when the product arrived and the package was filled with tea bags. Dissapointed because I thought I was purchasing whole leaf, I decided to give the company a poor review, feeling mislead.<br /><br />I decided to also try the tea so I would be able to review of the effects. Because I was shipped the wrong item I was already expecting to write a poor review, but then the tea kicked in.<br /><br />Whoa, I had a rush of extreme clarity. This by far is the best tea I've ever had in my life. The tea's mind enhancing benefits kicks in slowly and has no edge like other stimulants. It lasts for about 30 minutes and the buzz wears off gradually. I decided to make another cup. Wow thank you NovoAndina! I will be buying more.
