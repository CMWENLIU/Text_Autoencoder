I can imagine that this cola flavor will have ratings all over the place, because it does not taste like most colas available. It doesnt even taste like the other Sodastream colas available (diet or regular). Most other colas will taste very similar to Coke or Pepsi, depending on which flavor profile the generic is modeling itself after.  This cola, however, tastes nothing like either and seems to have a unique flavor profile relative to the ones I've tried.  Its hard for me to pinpoint exactly what the differences are, but I believe that there is a less emphasis on the citrus flavors and more on the vanilla and cinnamon flavors.  I also notice a slight caramel flavor which is not typical of commonly available colas.  I don't think there is a shortcut way to find out if you'll like this... you'll just have to try it out.
