As a type II diabetic, I've missed sweets most. This low carb baking mix has opened up a whole new world of creativity. I do use this 100% in place of regular flour with excellent results. I even managed to make blonde brownies (using DiabetiSweet brown sugar substitute) that turned out moist and chewy (with about 40 gr net carbs per 8" pan). No special recipes required. Have also tried muffins and quick breads and plan on trying some of my old cookie recipes. Highly recommended!
