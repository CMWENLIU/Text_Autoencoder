When a cereal's description contains a term like "fiber twigs" you might be tempted to throw the box down and run away.  In the case of Kashi GOLEAN, that would be a mistake.  In an effort to eat a healthier diet, I decided to try this cereal because I was impressed by its nutritional content.  What the heck, I figured, if it doesn't taste good I don't have to buy it again.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried GOLEAN and it tasted great!  I was also happy at how satisfied I felt after finishing a bowl; it was filling and nutritious and gave me plenty of energy to get through the morning.  It's gently sweet without tasting "sugary", and I like the crunchy texture.  Kashi GOLEAN Crunch is also available (and tasty!) if you like your breakfast EXTRA crunchy.
