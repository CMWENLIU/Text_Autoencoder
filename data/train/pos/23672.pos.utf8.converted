I have been using nutritional yeast for years, almost every single day, and it not only tastes great but is incredibly nutritious. Our three year old son loves it, and especially likes sprinkling it on pasta--I think he feels empowered, and little does he know that he's literally sprinkling nutrition on his food.<br /><br />You can sprinkle this on popcorn or other snack foods to impart a cheesy taste, add a tablespoon to smoothies, pasta sauce, bread, or just about any other savory food. If you're looking for a cookbook with recipes that use this, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0913990604">The New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook</a>. It's a little hipped out, but there's a recipe for nutritional yeast cheese that's pretty amazing. There's also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570671516">The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic "Uncheese" Dishes</a>, but I would try the Farm cookbook first.<br /><br />Lastly, these are large flakes, but Frontier Coop online offers 1 pound bags of Nutritional Yeast "mini flakes" which have a finer consistency and sprinkle well from a container with tiny holes (like the kind used to sprinkle powdered sugar). Frontier's prices are also very reasonable, and they offer organic nutritional yeast as well.
