Honestly, these beans don't look so hot in the pan. Kind of look like a thick fudge sauce. However, everyone who has tried them absolutely loves them. They aren't even in the same league with canned black beans and have a smoky, sort of sweetness to them. I also like the fact that you just add them to boiling water and voila!! you have something special.
