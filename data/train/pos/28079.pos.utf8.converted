I am pleased with this product as a substitute for all grains.  I am on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet to treat my celiac's disease, so I'm happy to find any substitute I can use for grain flours that will give me something to satisfy my need for something bready.  I like to experiment in the kitchen and I have made a flour using navy beans that I cook, dehydrate, and grind into a flour which I mix with coconut flour and almond flour to make a banana bread that I can cut into squares and put in the freezer for a snack when I need to satisfy my cravings.  This is a lot of work, but worth it for my health issues.<br /><br />I use egg white powder from Waltonfeed.com in place of regular eggs so that the end product of what I am baking doesn't taste too egg-y, which is a common complaint of using coconut flour.<br /><br />Because of coconut flour's high fat content, I try to lower the fat of my recipes using the bean flour and egg whites.  This also increases the protein and fiber.  BTW, the coconut flour is very high in fiber.<br /><br />Coconut flour has turned out to be a great ingredient for this celiac who is prone to blood sugar issues too.  Whatever you are baking with coconut flour will become higher in fiber and lower in glycemic index.  So far, I am very happy with it.<br /><br />You can't expect it to be a cup for cup substitute for any grain flour.  Have faith in yourself to experiment with it and make up some of your own recipes.<br /><br />Another tip:  I don't use oil in my recipes but add applesauce, mashed bananas, and blended dates to add moisture.  I also don't need to add sweeteners when I use the mashed fruits in my breads, except for a couple tablespoons of honey.<br /><br />I haven't tried this as a substitute ingredient to making yeast bread, just quick breads and crackers, but I'm just looking for something to satisfy the bready craving, so I'm very happy with the results.<br /><br />This is great for those with blood sugar issues and celiac's!
