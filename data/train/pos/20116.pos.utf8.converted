Anyone who has to count carbs and is a diabetic should check out getting Quaker Puffed Rice.  It's low in fat and carbs and is quite satisfying.  It's too bad that Quaker took its Puffed rice cereal out of the main market and that anyone who is looking for a low fat and low carb cereal has to go to Amazon to get this product.  Quaker has lost a lot of potential customers.
