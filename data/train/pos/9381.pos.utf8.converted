This is the best quality and best-tasting organically grown green tea, as recommended by Raymond Francis on his website www.beyondhealth.com.  I drink several cups a day, and it seems to curb my appetite, aids in digestion and gives me more energy.  It is high in antioxidants.  This tea is an important part of my health regimen.  I just love it!
