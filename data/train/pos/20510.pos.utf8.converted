It's a feel good tea.  When you need a little something different this light cinnamon taste and smell is so comfortable and enjoyable.  Sometimes adding a little milk and sugar is good and sometimes just plain is good.  Haven't tried it iced yet but I'm thinking in summer I will.  We recently switched to tea after noon...  replacing the afternoon pot of coffee.  Sometimes I like it so much I think I may give up coffee.  Will have to try the other varieties made by Tazo Chai... there is a wake up one that might completely replace my coffee.
