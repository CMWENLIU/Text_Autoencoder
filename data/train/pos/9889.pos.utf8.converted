My husband went to a Seventh Day Adventist boarding school back in the 40s and of course, Choplets were on the menu.  We are not vegetarians but love them as a breakfast side instead of meat or on a bun for lunch. I dredge them in Vigo Italiam Bread Crumbs and lightly fry in a bit of oil. Up until about a year ago we could, at times, buy them at two grocery stores here in Tampa, Fl.  I had never used Amazon before but a friend suggested I look on this site.  What a pleasant surprise to not only find Choplets but find them at about 2/3 the grocery store prices.  Even better, shipping was free.  I have made two other purchases since late Dec. and am looking forward to shopping Amazon for hard to find items in the future.
