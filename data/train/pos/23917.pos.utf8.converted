Just ran my first marathon in October and these were a godsend. Could definately feel the caffeine, electolytes, and carbs. Took them when I first felt fatigued, every 45 minutes to an hour, they kicked in just before I felt like I would collapse. Best boost ever. Use them on long runs, long bike rides, or when I workout and didn't eat much that day.
