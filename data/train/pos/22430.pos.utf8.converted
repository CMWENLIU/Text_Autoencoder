These are some of the very best tasting energy bars I've ever had, and they have some of the very best ingredients I've come across so far. I find the chocolate coated bars to be tastier than the natural (because I love chocolate); however, the natural bars are really quite good, too. These bars are soft, easy to chew, and have a nice texture. Here is a list of all the ingredients for the natural bars:<br /><br />Organic medjool dates, organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+
