I managed to purchase 16-count boxes of the Starbucks French Roast and Sumatra K-cups at the Asheville, NC Wal-Mart and a 54-count box of the Starbucks Caffe Verona at the Greenville, SC COSTCO.  All three varieties make tasty brews, but I found the Caffe Verona to be exceptional.  In my opinion, that blend makes the absolute best tasting K-cup coffee I have ever had.  HIGHLY recommend the Caffe Verona!
