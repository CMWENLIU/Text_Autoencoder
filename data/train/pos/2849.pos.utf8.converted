I make this like coffee, no sugar, hot water with or without cream added later. It is delicious and does not need sugar or (heaven forbid!) artificial sweeteners. Smooth, flavorful, not at all bitter. I can drink it later in the evening than I can coffee. I love chocolate but can not stand sweet beverages.
