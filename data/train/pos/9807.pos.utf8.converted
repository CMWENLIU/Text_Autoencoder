While I've enjoyed fruit and black cherries all of my life and eat them while in season, I noticed after eating a reasonable amount on two separate occassions how good I felt, no joint pain, but then after a day or two the joint pain came back. I couldn't find cherries again at the supermarket, so I tried Black Cherry Juice, Organic Knudsen's, in place of the fruit.  Within a day I started feeling great again, so I drank a small amount each day during the day (a bottle lasted a week) and continued to feel fantastic.  When I went back to the store to buy more, they were completely out - and all the other juices in the same brand were fully stocked - so apparently I wasn't the only one who believed in this cherry juice!  I've tried tart cherry as well, but it doesn't seem to offer the same relief.  I will now stay as stocked as possible on this Juice!
