Love Love Love this Avocado oil. I have been purchasing Avocado oil in a can at the local grocery store (La Tourangelle brand) but was always disappointed by the fact that it contained a lot of impurities in it that made it unusable in certain cooking situations. For instance; for use in sauteing which was a shame because Avocado oil has an extremely high smoking point. This oil is totally pure and delicious. If you like popcorn this is the best oil for it. It's high smoking point and delicious flavor make it ideally suited for it. We are on our 4th liter since purchasing. We received a call from the business about month after initial purchase checking to see how the oil was and if we were pleased with the product. Who does that?!?!?!?!?
