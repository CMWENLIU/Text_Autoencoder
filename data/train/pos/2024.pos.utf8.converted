My wife and I brought this home from Germany last year.  We love it and it is FANTASTIC in a tuna sandwich!<br />Knorr does not offer this product in the States - too bad.  It's probably the best salad dressing mix you'll ever taste.<br />Mixing instructions are in German, but can be translated on a German/English translation web site - it's worth it!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD92C2">Knorr Dill & Herbs Salad Dressing - 5pcs</a>
