This wasn't as bad as expected! It smelled awful and looked like swamp sludge so I expected the worst as I took a sip. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad at all! The more I drank it, the tastier it got. It is reminiscent of Chinese herbal medicine (which is not an appealing taste to most people, but really, you learn to like it).<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I can't just say "Oh I felt energized immediately after drinking it." I'm not sure if I felt anything. But this was my first cup, I'll have to edit in a few weeks or months! As for fullness, it was too thin to make me feel full. I guess if you mixed it with fruits and veggies and maybe some protein powder it would keep you full.<br /><br />All in all, I'm super pleased and will definitely buy again. Furthermore, this is an amazing price!!! It's 30% cheaper than what it would be outside of Amazon.<br /><br />EDIT: After taking this product for a couple of weeks, I can safely say that it is still amazing! It blunts my appetite tremendously, and I always feel lighter and more energized after having a cup or two of this stuff. My bowels have been awesome and my cravings for bad foods have gone away. I drink this every time I get tempted to eat something unhealthy and it works to keep me away! Heh.
