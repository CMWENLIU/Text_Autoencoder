Olio Santo Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a highly rated California olive oil.  I love it on salads and use it for pizza--as an ingredient in the crust and as the "sauce" (add minced garlic to a couple of tablespoons of Olio Santo, let sit for an hour or two, and brush over the crust before adding other toppings).  Also great with pasta in place of a marinara or other sauce.  It is a flavorful olive oil, so you might want to choose a less-flavorful oil for sauteeing when using another main sauce.  Great for dipping or any time you want great olive oil flavor!  Stonehouse makes a standard EVOO that is also very good, but Olio Santo is their star.  Makes a great gift when paired with Stonehouse Balsamic Vinegar or White Balsamic Vinegar.
