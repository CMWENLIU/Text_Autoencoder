When I opened my first can of Roasted almond oil and sniffed,the aroma itself almost made me drool. I prepared a salad of fresh greens topped with fresh orange slices and dressed it with the roasted almond oil and an orange champagne vinegar. I have also used balsamic vinegar. I sprinkled the salad with toasted sliced almonds. Everyone I have served it to thinks it is the best. I have also added a little oil to steamed green beans and added toasted slivered almonds to that.
