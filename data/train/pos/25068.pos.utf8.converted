This balsamic vinegar is so incredible. I think the first time I bought it was at Marshall's or something discounted. It was an impulse buy. I had no idea what amazing product I had just stumbled onto. It is up there with my favorite tastes in life, including cherries, green tea powder, fresh yellow figs, loquats, strawberries, and chocolate. It was so good that when I saw it again at Wegman's, I started buying it. The last time I went to Wegman's, I couldn't find it so I ordered it online from the source in a bundle of six where you could pick what other vinegars you want to buy. You could buy all six of this or try some other kinds, too.<br /><br />It is sweet so if you don't like sweet things, this won't be for you. But if you like your salad dressings and other sauces a little sweet then you will like sweet balsamic vinegar, too. I have never tasted another balsamic vinegar that can even come close to this. It is very rich and thicker than regular balsamic vinegar. Regular balsamic vinegar is just a little too thin and vinegary for me unless I am just using it in a recipe. By itself, I like this sweet version better because it cancels some of that sharp vinegar taste.<br /><br />Here are some ways I use it. My favorite is to pour some olive oil into a dish and then pour less than an equal amount of the balsamic vinegar and dip french bread or similar bread. It also makes a great salad dressing mixed with olive oil and regular vinegar. I have even mixed it with a little soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and ginger to make a potsticker dipping sauce. You could mix it with just one of those items and still make a good potsticker dipping sauce. If you have found a good use for it, I would love to hear about it.<br /><br />I ordered the strawberry and blackberry ones, too, but haven't tried them, yet. It could be awhile before I open them. I was going to wait until I have guests over and it goes with what we are eating. It might be awhile.
