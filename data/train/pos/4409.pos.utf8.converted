My mother's favorite flavor is Chocolate, mine being Butterscotch. These lollypops are extremely delicious and they last for quite a while. The shape of the lollypops are unique and they are as savory as I can remember. I highly enjoy all products from Sees candies, the only downside is they can't ship you a sample chocolate like they give at the store!<br /><br />Quality products, quality service, quality through and through.
