These nuts were purchased for an elderly uncle who is hard to please. Most of my gifts have bearly gotten a grunt out of him, including the deluxe mixed nuts from another company that I selected last year. I guess it pays to buy Planters. I won't say he raved about the nuts (raving is just not his style) but the cannister of nuts that he polished off in less than two weeks was a pretty good indication that he liked them. He is already well into the second cannister and is making hints that he'd like the same thing for Christmas. Whew, I won't have to wrack my brain for another gift idea. Nice, too, to pick a gift that has good nutritional value.
