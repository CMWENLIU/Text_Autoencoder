Many imported olive oils are blended with hazelnut oil and<br />some are labeled as such and some are not.  This is pure Greek<br />calamara olive oil, and the price was so much less than Italian<br />pure olive oil , that the taste difference between Greek and<br />Italian olives to me did not justify the price difference.  If<br />you want pure olive oil, this is in the top two with Pegasus<br />being the other great brand.
