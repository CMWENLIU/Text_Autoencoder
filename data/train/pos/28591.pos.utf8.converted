SOMETIMES A TOOTHPICK CAN BE FUN!<br /><br />50 packs of these seems like enough to keep you in the picks for a while. They taste like cinnamon and its a nice touch that they are sugar-free.<br /><br />Seeing these old standard-bearers among the after dinner set brings back the old days, and then I see all these plastic tooth picks that come with floss already attached and I think, "wow, so this is progress?!"<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Anyway, if you are looking for decent cinnamon tasting toothpicks that are a decent value, come in handy little packages and are sugar-free, you're in for a treat -- HERE THEY ARE!
