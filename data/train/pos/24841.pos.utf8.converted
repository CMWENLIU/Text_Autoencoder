This product is truly odor-free!  Our Black Lab puppy had a terrible dandruff problem, but now has a nice soft, silky, dandruff-free coat.  I give her two pumps in the morning (she is still under 50 lbs), and that does the trick.  It is mixed in with her food and she has no problem gulping it down as usual (but then what lab does).
