PROS:- High Quality Nutritious Cat food, Easily Digestable= less litterbox waste  Helps with Urinary & Constipation/Bowel/Allergy Related Issues, Human Grade Ingredients, Non Allergenic, No Fillers, Good Flavors- even for finicky cats. So even though it's a bit more to pay up front, it actually saves $$ in the long run in the form of healthier cats (most important), less food eaten & less litter used.<br /><br />CONS: Definitely a bit expensive but I bought it for $25.97 w/ Free Shipping through Petco on Amazon.com so I felt that was a very good value!! I will stock up when it is at that price for sure!<br /><br />TIP:- I actually WET THIS FOOD DOWN quite a bit, to a thick spaghetti sauce consistency. It's actually better for the cats b/c it increases their water intake which they desperately need since their thirst drive is so low. That helps prevent & control Urinary Issues such as: crystals, etc. ALL of my cats actually PREFER it this wetter way & it makes the can go a longer ways too, so more value!<br /><br /> I do cat rescue/fostering on occasion & this food has helped me nurse sick cats & kittens to health. The food is highly nutritious & easily digestable, therefore helping stomach & bowel ailments improve. I  also have a cat w/ chronic acid reflux disease & one prone to urinary crystals & this helps keep those conditions under control. Also my sister's cat who was always snorty & snotty w/ allergies got completely better after being on this food, I believe due to no grain being used in this product.<br /> A good way to see how digestable a wet food is  to wet it down w/ water, it should easily dissolve in. A bad food will be chunky & hard to dissolve in water. Just think how it will act on a cat's stomach! A lot of low quality cheap foods will just sit in the cat's stomach, not absorbing any nutrients into the body & then it just comes out as smelly poop!  Also, because they are getting less nutrients, the cats will EAT MORE therefore costing more $ in food, more litterbox waste cuz it goes right through them. I actually have less litterbox waste when I use Wellness & the cats eat less cuz they are more full.<br /><br /> After the pet food contamination scare in 2007, I really educated my self on what actually is in pet food & boy was I freaked out. I used to buy Science Diet thinking it was good for my pets but the ingredients are not species appropriate or high quality AT ALL. Veterinarians are generally extremely undereducated in animal nutrition, and they generally tout the food from the company that sponsors their schooling or otherwise they have a vested financial interest in. After having my cats be on medicines & "special vet diets" that did little to help, I switched to high quality cat foods, Wellness being one of them and my cats are thriving and some of them have gone off their meds completely. I HIGHLY recommended the Wellness brand, I have seen a HUGE difference in my own cats as well as the cats I rescue. PLEASE, PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF ON WHAT IS REALLY IN MOST PET FOOD AND YOU WILL SEE WHY WELLNESS IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.
