This is an amazing hot cereal. It has no artificial ingredients. It is very high in fiber, which means it should lower cholesterol. Since I have started eating it, my high blood pressure has dropped nicely. I try to cook it as little as possible, so I put it in a bowl of hot water, and then microwave it for only one minute. I add a little sweetener, usually stevia and/or Splenda, and then I eat it. Some people may not like the taste (a few might say it tastes like sawdust), but I think it's delicious. Cheap, healthful, easy to fix, filling, and delicious ... what more could you want?
