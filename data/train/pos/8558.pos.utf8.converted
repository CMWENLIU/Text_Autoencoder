This is the best flavor of gum I have ever tried.  I wasn't even in the habit of chewing gum often, but this gum is making me into a habitual gum chewer.  I like it so much!  One thing that you should know about this flavor is that not everyone likes it.  Several of my family members don't like it much at all.  However, I think the flavor is amazing, and quake at the thought that they might discontinue it some day.  What would I do?  There's nothing even similar.  This gum freshens your breath, but it isn't as harsh as some of the other Eclipse minty flavors.  It's mildly spicy, but not quite as strong as most cinnamon gums, I would say.  It does have a pleasant sweet spicy flavor that lasts and lasts.  In fact, one odd (but in my mind, wonderful) thing about this flavor is that it actually gets stronger as you chew it longer!  I don't know how they did that.  It contains cardamom (a spice used in gingerbread and also in Indian curries).<br /><br />Please try it!  I'm desperate for you to try it and like it.  We've got to get more people buying this gum so that the flavor is never discontinued.
