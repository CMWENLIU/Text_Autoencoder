Nothing "fishy" about these little fishes! The sardines are larger than the brisling, but have a very mild flavor and fresh firm texture. The olive oil used is light tasting as well. Because these sardines are skinless and boneless, it is very simple to prepare them in your favorite dish in no time flat! I just open the can (which is the easy open variety) and dump the whole contents on a bowl of salad greens, squeeze a little fresh lemon, and voila!; the PERFECT FAST FOOD! 'couldn't ask for a faster, more nutritious and delicious meal! Enjoy!
