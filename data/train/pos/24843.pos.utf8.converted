This bar is best experienced with other people--just in case you or they do not like it. As a couple of reviewers indicated, they thought the taste was off. When I heard about it, I thought it sounded disgusting. However, when I tried it, it was delicious, delightful, and stunningly good.<br /><br />If you're expecting standard chocolate flavors, I don't think this is the bar for you. However, if you like odd combinations, enjoy fatty or greasy or salty food (like fries & chips), and enjoy new experiences, this bar is worth it. Sure, the price is a bit high, but the quality is top notch.<br /><br />If you buy the bar, or if you like it, I suggest you bring it to a group gathering where you can share it. You may well convert other people who enjoy it, and those who don't enjoy it won't spend their money on it.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best bar's I've ever had, and I love to share it with others!
