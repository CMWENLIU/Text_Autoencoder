Campbell's Cream of Onion Soup is the base ingredient for a Chicken and Rice Casserole that is a family favorite.  We've had a hard time finding this product for many years, and basically impossible to find the last 5 or more (Note found it in stock in Jacksonville, FL WalMart on 4/2008 vacation).  We've tried other onion soups but not "cream", and the difference is clear.  The other "Campbell" soups we use with the Onion are Creams of Chicken, Cheddar, and Mushroom.  They are blended together and baked over boneless, skinless chicken, and served over rice.  We have  subbed for the Chicken on occasion with the likes of Celery, but they do not match up with the Onion.
