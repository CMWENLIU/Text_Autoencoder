I use this on roasted pecans - incredible. Have also used on shrimp, homemade baked potato fries (potatoes cut in strips and baked, not fried) and other items. Love this spice. Use it like salt (as in salt to taste) and you get a very nice hot flavor with cayenne pepper and other spices along with it.<br /><br />A little bit goes a long way - we've been working on one container for a year and will order another soon.
