I bought this product for the first time 7 months ago.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WG180">NOW Foods Stevia Liquid Extract Alcohol, 8 Ounce Bottle</a> three months later.

"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" lists "water", "certified Organic Stevia extract" and "11% alcohol".<br /><br />Sweet Leaf has quite an advantage, since it does not list alcohol as an ingredient.<br /><br />I wanted more evidence about ingredients.  I thought that Sweet Leaf was trying to pull as fast one, by passing alcohol as a "natural flavor"; like many companies have done.<br /><br />So I visited the Sweet Leaf website and found this: "SweetLeaf Stevia
