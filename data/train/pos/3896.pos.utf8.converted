This is a great mix for a 9x13 or two round pans.  It's plenty of dough to do the job nicely.  This came out nice and moist and provides a great base for experiments...  We wanted a lemon cake one day for a special birthday for my husband's celiac mother.  We used a little lemon extract and lemon zest in the cake.  After it was baked we mixed a little sugar with lemon juice, heated it and poured in on top the cake after first poking the cake with a toothpick to create small holes for absorbing our yummy sweetened lemon concoction.  Sorry I can't tell you my proportions as I simply guessed (a habitual way of approaching cooking for me).  Think creatively and enjoy, knowing that you're starting with a great base!
