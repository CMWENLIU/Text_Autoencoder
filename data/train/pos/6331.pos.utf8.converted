Eating this yogurt is like eating cream cheese.  Sweet and thick and absolutely delicious, the kind of thing where you diligently scrape every last molecule out of the bottom of the cup because you can't bear to let it go to waste.  Although, if you're not a big cream cheese fan, you probably won't like this either.  Very low carb, moderately high in fat, very high in saturated fat.  And, to me, worth every calorie.
