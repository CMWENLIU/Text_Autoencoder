This tuna in EVOO is a real treat - you'll have no problem eating it right out of the can! Keep a can in your desk at work with some saltines for a satisfying, fast lunch. Another thing, no one in the office will object to the SMELL because there ISN'T any! (Even the empty tin in the trash does not smell.) The tuna is juicy and delicious, better than any you've ever had.
