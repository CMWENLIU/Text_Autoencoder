Seriously - I get the importance of seeing the ingredients - go check the website instead of giving it a one star review.  Or send an email to the folks at Amazon.  If you are a celiac, then you know the importance of finding good gluten free food, and I lean heavily on reviews and ratings to determine if a product is worth the effort.

It's also lazy.<br /><br />[...]
