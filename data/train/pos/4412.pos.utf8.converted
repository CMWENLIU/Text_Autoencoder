After seeing the Good Eats show about how Alton lost so much weight, me and my b/f were very interested in the Sardine sandwich he makes in the show that calls for Brisling Sardines<br /><br />You can find the recipe here<br />[...]<br /><br />So we went to the super market and the only brisling sardines we can find in oil was King Oscar Sardines but it was almost 5 dollars a can and we needed two of them, well okay whatevers we got it.<br /><br />We got home and made thie recipe... and for someone that hasn't ever had sardines before it was super yummers!  My b/f has had sardines before and said yup brislings is the way to go.  BTW if you were try this recipe at home, they say prep-time is 5 minutes which it is but there is a 1-hour wait time while the sardines soak in the sauce that you have to prepare for, we wanted to eat it right away and it was still pretty good, but since then we have waited and it is better if you wait.<br /><br />Anyways being kind of a frugel person 10 bucks for protein is not what I call a low cost meal for a dinner for two.  Usually with that much chicken we can eat well for a week!  So I was like got to find Brisling Sardines cheaper... and that's where Amazon comes in.<br /><br />This is a great deal for about half the price you can find it at local super markets and free shipping really knocked it out of the park for us.<br /><br />I ordered this early last week and got it before the weekend.  I made the recipe this weekend and yup very good, I would say just as good as King Oscar Sardines.<br /><br />Happy eating!
