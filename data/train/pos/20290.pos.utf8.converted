Since I'm such a big fan of sourdough bread, I'd tried a number of times over the years to make my own sourdough starter. I failed miserably, except for the last time, when it worked well enough (using a potato flake-sugar-water recipe I found on allrecipes.com), but the resulting bread tasted overwhelmingly like beer. Which is fine if you like beer -- my son loved the bread for that very reason, for example -- but not if you want bread with a true sourdough taste.<br /><br />So after seeing all the 5-star reviews for this starter, I decided to give it a try. Since I have all my online purchases sent to my workplace so I'm there to receive them, my starter sat in a mailbox inside the door of my business from Saturday when it was delivered until Monday. That meant I couldn't even begin to start the process of feeding it until Monday evening. So I was a little worried that the starter might have suffered from sitting so long in that mailbox unfed.<br /><br />The starter came in a little zip-lock baggie with a card of instructions. I found it pretty hard to get the sticky starter out of its baggie due to the consistency -- it was kind of a mess, actually. I wish I'd read the reviews that suggested adding water to the baggie first to make it easier to get out, but as it was, I finally just tore the bag down the side and scraped as much as I could out into the bowl. I've read reviews that said how good the starter smelled, but mine kind of had the aroma of wallpaper paste, which worried me a little, I must admit.<br /><br />A day after the first feeding, there were tiny little bubbles on the surface of the mixture, but not a lot of action. By the second feeding, there were a few more. But the third time, when I added the full cup of flour and the water, the mixture took off: There was no question it was alive and well! After feeding it one more time, I used a cup of it to make "Classic San Francisco Sourdough Bread," a recipe I found online. It took a bit of work and a LOT of time, but oh, my -- the results were spectacular! True sourdough taste, just like the bread I enjoyed so much on my visits to San Francisco.<br /><br />I can't recommend this starter more highly. The only negative is that I found the instructional videos and answers to questions on breadtopia.com to be a little less helpful than I had hoped. I think the instructions for the care and feeding of the starter could be a bit more detailed, especially for those of us who are new to the art of sourdough. But that's a minor complaint, because the product itself is so very good it more than makes up for having to research the topic for more information. If you're looking for a great sourdough starter, this is the one to try.
