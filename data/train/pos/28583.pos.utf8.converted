WHAT IT IS!<br /><br />The incredible thing about this stuff is that it is very, very chocolate-ee without a ton of added sugar and calories. It is much better tasting than the usual grocery store brands, but it is harder to find, though not much more expensive. Very full bodied, and ideal for adding to coffee to make your very own Hot Coffee/Chocolate treat, or just drink it by itself. It is about the best Hot Chocolate I have ever found.<br /><br />A great value actually, and it even has its share of iron and protein, a nice touch along with avoiding excessive sugar.<br /><br />IDEAL GIFT:<br /><br />This year, this will be a Christmas gift that alot of people will be getting from me. Buying this here at Amazon has really simplified matters and allows me to give away a rare treat that is easily purchased here though not usually at one's local grocery. The shipping and handling policy of this vendor makes the cost of additional items to be shipped, negligible, making it ideal to buy a bunch at a time. What more could one ask for?
