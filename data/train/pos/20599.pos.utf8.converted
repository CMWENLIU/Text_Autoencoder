Good stuff, but beware: a pound of dried bonito flakes occupies a very large volume. Bigger than Al Roker's head. If you saved the empty bag you could carry your little dogs around in it.<br /><br />When it arrived my daughter yelled out: "Dad, you have a HUMONGOUS package from Amazon!"<br /><br />"What the...?  My GOD that's a big bag of bonito!!!"<br /><br />But it all worked out. Now I have enough dried tuna until I die.
