I have been making and drinking espresso for well over 15 years. As I am sure many of you know, the keys to good espresso are: a good machine, a good grinder, a fresh roast, and freshly ground coffee.<br />I use a Pasquini Livia 90 and a Mazzer Mini grinder. This coffee is not designed for presses or drip coffee makers.<br />That said, short of what you might experience in Tuscany or Northern Italy, this is the best espresso you might hope to make at home.<br />When fresh, as it should be bought, the aroma from the bag is enough to convince you of the coffee's character.<br />The crema is thick, the flavor is rich and full without the bitter aftertaste you experience with many of the Seattle blends (including Starbucks). This coffee is to be enjoyed on it's own, with maybe a touch of sugar or possibly as an Americano, it may be OK as a macchiato, but does not hold up as well as a cappuccino, or a latte, since the milk has a tendency to overwhelm the delicate flavor of this coffee.<br />Once you have experienced Black Cat, it will make an indelible impression on your palate and you will likely become a Black Cat aficionado trumpeting it's amazing flavor to all your friends.
