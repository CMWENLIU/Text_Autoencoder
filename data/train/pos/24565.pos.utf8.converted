I know these bonito flakes are used for all kinds of japanese cooking by my cat moochie loves these things.  We call them kitty chips and she will do just about anything to get them!  They have made her coat nice and shiny and she seems to be a happier cat!  Buy this product here because the dog and cat stores sell this for about twenty five dollars in smaller packages!  You're cat will go crazy for them!
