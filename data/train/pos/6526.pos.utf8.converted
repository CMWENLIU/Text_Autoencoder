I love Vigo's canned octopus and both the marinade or oil packed is wonderful alone as an exotic snack or cooked in a dish.  Here is how I cook it, I empty the can into a medium heated sauce pan and when the marinade/oil is hot add drained canned garbonzo beans and saute till the garbanzo beans are soft and tender and have absorbed the yummy liquids flavoring them like the octopus, during the process I add either fresh sliced green onions, or onion powder, a little garlic, mushrooms and you can add chopped green or red bell peppers or fresh chopped tomatos or both for color.  Makes a nice large meal full of protein and flavor.  The tender octopus goes so well with the garbanzo beans, which really extend the flavor and the meal.  Serve with rice or noodles and for veggies steam or stir fry the ones you like best as a side.<br /><br />I always tell my friends this is a can't lose gift if they want to send me something for my birthday or the holidays.  I love it so and can't get it locally at all.  Yum!
