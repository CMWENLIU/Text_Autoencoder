A friend got me started on candied ginger for headache and nausea relief. I would buy the ginger from a local health food store but when I saw this brand on Amazon, it was less expensive so I decided to try it. Whereas the health food store ginger was chewy like leather, this has more of a gum drop texture. I didn't think I would keep using it but pretty soon I was addicted and it became difficult to keep a steady supply on hand. Yum!
