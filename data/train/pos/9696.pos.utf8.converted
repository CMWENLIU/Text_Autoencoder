I don't recall now why I originally bought Monin's Raspberry Syrup, but once it arrived, it soon became an indispensable member of the pantry. We love it as an ice cream or frozen yogurt sauce (it's surprising how many flavors work with raspberry - try peach, in particular), as well as on fruit or in dessert recipes. It's highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. I also carefully freeze fresh raspberries when they're at the peak of the season and this is as good as the syrups that I've labored to make at that time of year. It does tend to be a bit sweet; this simply encourages us to use less.
