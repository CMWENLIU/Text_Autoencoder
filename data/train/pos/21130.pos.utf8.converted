I bought these grape leaves a couple of years ago in a specialty store. I couldn't forget the taste but I had no luck finding them again. I bought several other brands but nothing even compared. I was so happy to find them on Amazon. The day I received the package I ate 2 cans and 1 can every day that week. I just couldn't get enough of them! They're very tender and taste delicious, highly recommend!
