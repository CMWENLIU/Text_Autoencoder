Irish Breakfast is a traditional black tea blend known for its assertiveness and malty flavor.  It's a wonderful tea - i prefer it with a touch of milk, but it's not overpowering when drunk black.  The Twinnings loose leaf is FAR superior to the bags.  Those are made with "tea dust" and end up bitter and unbalanced.  Do yourself a favor and always order the loose variety of Twinnings teas.  There's an amazing difference.  Great deal on amazon - i can't find the Irish Breakfast in my town and other Twinnings varities average about $6 retail.  At around $3.50/tin, you get a great tea at a good price.
