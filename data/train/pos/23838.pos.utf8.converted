I absolutely love this product.  It is simply wheat cracked into pieces and soy pieces.  I bought it as I thought it is a nice way to add protein to cracked wheat which I am used to eating in Middle Eastern food.  It is a very healthy food albeit on the dry side by itself.<br /><br />Rather than use it as a breakfast food, I use it as a substitute for rice in dishes or as a side for fish or meat.  You can add to it butter or oil in the cooking as you might do with rice or vegetables or meat.<br /><br />It will take getting used to for the commoners:-)  My mother and father told me I fed them feed when I convinced them to try it:-)  They see they may live long if they eat it but it would be a long and boring life:-)
