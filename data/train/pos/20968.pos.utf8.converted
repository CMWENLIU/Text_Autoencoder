Wow ... this stuff is life-changing.<br /><br />I normally like my coffee black, but this stuff has transformed my coffeeing habits. I pour tons of it in the bottom of a mug (about as much as can possibly dissolve in the coffee), pour the coffee on top aggressively (to reduce the need for mixing), and enjoy. It probably can no longer be called coffee at that point. I think it tastes like one of those expensive fancy pants "italian beverages" that people richer than me buy every morning. But I don't really know because I am not affluent.<br /><br />And if you buy 6-packs of CoffeeMate on the Internet, you probably aren't either.<br /><br />Enjoy life. Drink chocolate-enhanced coffee-like beverage. Made possible by CoffeeMate.
