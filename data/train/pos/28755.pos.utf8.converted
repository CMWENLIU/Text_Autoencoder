In reading about alternative help with GERD, I had read about the use of chewing gum to help generate gastric juices and also  mastic gum which has been used in Greece for a couple of thousand years to heal stomach problems. ELMA chewing gum contains mastic gum. Whenever I have issues with GERD, I just chew the gum for a short while and, voila, the problem is resolved.<br /><br />This is really great.
