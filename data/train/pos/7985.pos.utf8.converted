Mmmmm....just got these today and decided to write this review.  This is actually my first review on amazon ever!  I found out about these crackers a few weeks ago, and have been calling all over to find them locally, but to no avail.  Luckily, they are available on amazon!<br /><br />If you like flax, you will like these.  They have some patented process that keeps the flax whole, but makes it thin and crisp, so you grind them up in your mouth when you chew (flax eaters know that a whole, raw flax seed likely won't get broken apart when you chew it, and then you don't end up getting all the good stuff in flax!).  The flavor on these is very slight, with only Bragg's liquid aminos and lemon juice on the ingredient list (besides flax).  Bragg's liquid aminos is a great product, pretty much soy sauce with no gluten (it's 100% fermented soy, so in a sense, it really is a true soy sauce and has a similar flavor to all the soy sauces on the market), and I use it in place of soy sauce for lots of things, so that's another great product to check out, as well.  The lemon juice isn't apparent, and doesn't taste lemony in the least.  These crackers are gluten free and vegan, and are a good match for those on specialty diets.  Also, with just 3 ingredients, they could probably be easily incorporated into rotation diets as well.<br /><br />I tried one plain right out of the pouch, and they are slightly salty (from the Bragg's).  Their texture reminds me of pumpkin seeds with the shell on.  After sampling it plain, I put peanut butter on one, and the slight savory underpinnings of the cracker and the peanut butter go very well together.  I'm looking forward to eating these with all sorts of things, and am very pleased I bought them, even though I had no idea what I was in for with a case of healthfood I'd never tried.<br /><br />Flax is great for many things healthwise, and it is also unique in that it has 0 net carbs.  That's right, all the carbs in there are 100% dietary fiber.  Low-carbers should do a web search for the "one minute muffin" made with flax meal in the microwave....they're really good and totally versatile, and really do make a low carb bread or muffin.<br /><br />The only issue I have with these is a little tiny warning on the bottom saying they use 99.99% clean flax, but sometimes a little stone may be in there.  I'm not overly concerned with this, and have had 5 crackers with no issue (will post back when, if at all, I encounter one, and how many bags it took me to find it....would be interested to hear from others how big a danger this really is....), though a friend decided not to eat one based on this as she had recently had crown work, so just be aware that there is a remote possibility!<br /><br />They have several other flavors, and I may try them one day, but I'm really pleased with these and so glad I found them!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have consumed the entire case (6 bags) and did not find any pebbles or rocks.  I did find a few (3 or 4 in the whole case, so not even one in every bag) very hard seeds (they were definitely flax seeds) that were not chewable and did feel like biting down on piece of something rock-like.  All of these hard seeds were very dark, nearly black in color (burned? under-ripe? not shelled?), though not every dark seed was one of these hard seeds.  I don't think that this is a reason to not consume these, but did want to offer an honest assessment of the "safety" of the product, esp. for individuals who have weak teeth.
