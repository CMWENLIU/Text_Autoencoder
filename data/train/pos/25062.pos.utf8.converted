These are great sardines.  Nice firm tasty whole fillets packed in a good olive oil.  Best part: not having to look at the fins, skin and tails when I eat them.  These are breakfast almost every morning before I go to the gym.  This brand isn't quite as good as the Crown Prince boneless skinless sardines that Amazon carries, but for the substantially discounted price at my local Costco (about a *third* of the current price shown here), they are great!
