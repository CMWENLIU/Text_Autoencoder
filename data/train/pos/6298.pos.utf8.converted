We have six cats --- a few of whom have bladder, skin/allergy and weight issues.  I started doing research on cat foods and landed on a DVM's blog/website that promoted the feeding of grain free and raw food diets for cats.  After a lot of reading, I started feeding our cats the Wellness grain free canned food and then supplemented with the CORE dry (otherwise I'm opening a lot of cans a day!).  My pickiest eater turned her nose up for a few days without something tempting on top of it, however after about a week she now eats it up --- which is huge as I've been making her food for several years and she has a very sensitive stomach.  My two older cats have gained weight and all of them have better looking coats.<br />Another benefit of feeding raw/grain free is that the solid waste does not smell as bad and is smaller in volume.  This food has also helped relieve the symptoms of cystitis in one of my cats.<br />Expensive, but worth it.
