I have several adopted dogs and in my circle of friends, we have over 25 dogs combined (mostly rescues and adoptions).  This treat is everyone's favorite !  And, while they are "not for human consumption", I will admit that I find them very tasty also.<br />If you haven't tried them, I encourage you to do so.  The price is right and the babies can't get enough !
