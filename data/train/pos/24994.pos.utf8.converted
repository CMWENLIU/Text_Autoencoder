I have used both this product and the standard (cheaper) Vacu-Vin...pay the premium and buy this product, as it is SUBTANTIALLY easier to use.<p>In addition to being more stylish than the standard Vacu Vin, the stoppers on this product are easier to use and the pumping mechanism &quot;clicks&quot; when you have pumped enough air out of the wine bottle...the standard model just leaves you guessing about how much air has been removed.
