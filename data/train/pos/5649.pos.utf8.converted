We started making our own bread as the type of bread we like cost almost 5 dollars a loaf. These wheat berries make great bread and I can't imagine going back to store bought bread. We couldn't be happier with the purchase. I would suggest you get a bucket opener as it took me about 1/2 hour to open the bucket.
