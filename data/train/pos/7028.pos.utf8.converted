Thanks to the other fine reviews, I opted to try this cocoa powder. It is delightful. While I really like the idea of fair trade certified, without the superior taste and texture it would mean little. Fortunately, it's not necessary to sacrifice quality when purchasing this 16 ounce bag of cocoa powder. Not only is it organic but it's delicious. The texture is fine/smooth, the fragrance is everything you would expect (maybe a bit more!) and the flavor is superb....all for a price you can't pass up. Unlike other varieties of powdered cocoa, this does NOT seem to have vanilla included which makes it a bit more versatile for some recipes.<br /><br />Excellent product!
