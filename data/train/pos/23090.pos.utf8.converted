I'm glad Amazon now carries this product. I have tried cheap grocery store brands, those inferior corn based products make a difference in my cat's behavior, quality of her fur and overall health. Natural Balance is highly rated by several web sites evaluating cat food as it has no corn or other fillers. Canned food may be a better choice for her health, but my cat won't eat it, this is a good second choice.<br /><br />It really does not cost more than the grocery store types as she needs less food due to it being nutrient rich. One 6 pound bag lasts a little over two months for my 10 pound short hair. Less food fed means less poop to scoop, not as stinky too!  It's rare to find her hacking up a hair ball or vomiting, unlike a major well-known brand where she puked almost daily. Her coat is shiny and soft. No fat belly. She has energy to spare!<br /><br />I like being able to have it delivered to my home, no extra trip needed to a specialty pet store.
