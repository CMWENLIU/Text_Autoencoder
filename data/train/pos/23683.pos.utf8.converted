I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change. Before considering surgery, we decided to give some natural methods a try. After doing some research, we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazon.com. Since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before, which didn't work, we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results. Here is what we picked out.....<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOJ7S0">Ainterol Pueraria Mirifica 500Pure Breast Capsules (100 caps)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D9AW">Wild Yam Root 180 vcaps</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETA6W">Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed 610 mg, Capsules 180ea</a><br />These are the ingredients that we sort of liked and decided to give them all a try. So I guess this review is for all three of them at the same time. She has been taking them for just over two months now and we both agree that we have seen a change. Her bust has grown by a little over two inches and her breasts definately fell and have more fullness to them. She is a lot more confident and says that her shirts sit on her much nicer. Now she has an extra excuse to spend a ton of money shopping for new clothes, but what can I say, I just love her. A little bit of caution, there are a couple of changes that happened after she started to take the combination of all three of those pills. Her natural body smell has changed a little, nothing negative of course or she would have stopped taking them, but it has altered just a little. And she sometimes complains that her boobs are a little sore. But there has been a significant size difference and I believe that this stuff works. Good luck to you ladies and guys remember to love your women, they're just as sensitive about their boobs as we are about our penises!
