I had never had pho before, it doesn't seem to be on most Vietnamese restaurant menus.  I was  interested to try this new product, Happy Pho Zesty Ginger since I am a<br />ginger addict, and love star anise.  Mama mia, this thick noodly soup is really a new taste realm for me (already an asian food addict.) I doubled the ginger since I like more ginger than less, making it with chicken  or with tofu (you could also combine.) I haven't had a lime around yet to use, but did use lemon instead and that was excellent. This product is healthy, and when used with tofu, vegan I believe.  I think it's really going to take off with people who care about their nutrition but don't want to sacrifice taste.  I give it two thumbs up!<br />Karen
