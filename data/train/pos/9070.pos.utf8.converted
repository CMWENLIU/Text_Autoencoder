This is my favorite herbal tea to date...and I've tried many. I wanted to stop drinking coffee, but needed a substitue that had no caffeine. All I have to do in the morning is fill my stainless steel electric water kettle, drop a tea bag in a mug & about 4 minutes later the water is ready. I let it brew a few minutes and add a little raw honey or agave nectar. It's good without any embellishments, as well. Amazon has a great price & no shipping charge if you qualify for free super saver shipping.
