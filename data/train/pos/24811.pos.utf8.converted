My kids, and I, love this candy. The Indian restaurant we go to once a month or so keeps a bowl of it at the host stand, and it's all I can do to keep my kids from filling their pockets and making little pigs of themselves over it. The owner of the Indian restaurant said this was his favorite candy growing up. It's crunchy and tastes like honey and sesame.
