Vegan. Organic. Kosher. High quality. Great side or with rice or on crackers or with chips, or "on toast" as our friends across the pond love 'em. Nice tomato sauce with hint of onion. The touch of sweetness is also just right. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! 420 kcal and 21g protein per can. Ingredients label explicitly states "(Vegan)" even though product name only states "Vegetarian." This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.
