This dark rich coffee is delicious! and the best part is...NO BITTERNESS! I fell in love with this coffee the first time I ever tried it! I loved this coffee so much I even gave some to my dad who is quite a coffee fiend as well, and now he doesn't want anything but this coffee. In a nut shell, if you haven't tried it, you really should. If you have, you know what I'm talking about! :)
