Usually I get my olives at a specialty store, so I was surprised that there was such a pronounced difference. I then found out that some olive companies use lye for quick curing, but these folks don't. Perhaps that's the reason for the better taste. My friends who recommended Sicilian Village olives also agreed that they were the best they'd ever had. I prefer green olives, and that's all I buy, but I have to admit even the black olives I have sampled were good as well, and that's a first for me.<br />There's a reason they're getting such good reviews ... just taste them and see.
