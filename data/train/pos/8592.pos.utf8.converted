This honey is of great quality!<br /><br />It comes from the "Pays Basque" region of Southwest France in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain.<br /><br />I have traveled many times in this region and have tasted a lot of food specialties in the many open air markets that you can find in almost every small towns in France.<br /><br />You can really taste the many flowers used by the honey bees. It has a very hearty taste, great to eat on hot toast for breakfast. I will buy more!<br /><br />Enjoy!
