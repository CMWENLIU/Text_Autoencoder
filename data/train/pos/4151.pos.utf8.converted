I did not buy this at Amazon even though I am an avid amazon shopper.  Needless to say I went to cosco with a friend and got this exact box for $25 at Cosco.  I debated getting it and once it was in my cart I had two different people tell me how much they loved the coffee and with 80 pods at that price I figured I would try it.  I came home at 8 pm and decided to open it up.<br /><br />IN THE BOX:  Inside I have 10 clear plastic bags each with 8 pods.  The bottom has no plastic white thing I am used to and not only is the coffee in a mesh bag making it so you can not store it in the carousel (it is loose and falls out) you would not want to because it would lose freshness.  SO the other 7 went in Tupperware.  I give it 2 points for helping the environment and 4 for the price without trying it!<br /><br />TASTE:  Brew it at 8pm (not the best time for coffee but ahhh)  It smells absolutely amazing!  Super strong odor if you like the smell of coffee.  Color is very dark, smell is strong.  I taste it black and it is stronger then even the jet fuel k-cups.  Add some creamer try it again and then add a little more and it is the best coffee I have had in my life and that says a lot as Paris had some amazing coffee!<br /><br />Needless to say I grabbed the phone and called my friend who also bought a box after the two people commented on how much they loved the coffee to find out she had tried it and loves it as much as I do!  If you are debating trying this like I was I am hoping this review will help as I think I have finally kicked my expensive k-cup habit and I no longer need to worry about losing a bang for my buck!  Hopefully amazon will start matching Cosco prices as I do not have a cosco card though :)
