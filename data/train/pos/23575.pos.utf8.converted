Our cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He hates going to the vet, and from what I have read glucose readings spike when the cat is under stress, so we wanted to be able to test at home. Our cat is already unhappy with insulin shots, so we did not want to have to poke him and draw blood to test his insulin.<br /><br />We just received the Glucotest pack and I have to say this is the easiest way to monitor glucose. I know it's working, because my cat without diabetes uses the box and the test strips do not register a high glucose level. A couple of things are a pain, but that is not the fault of the product.<br /><br />1) You have to watch them and monitor when they go in and out of the box, especially with two cats. We have two boxes, but since we can't gaurantee that the cat always goes to the same box we have to be diligent so that we don't see the non-diabetic cat's sample and assume it is our diabetic cat's.<br /><br />2) We use scoopable litter, so we have to dig around in the clump (I use a nail file & tweezers....eek) to pull out the test strip. It's worth it to help my kitty, but certainly kind of yucky.<br /><br />Otherwise, so far so good. The first time we used this we realized that our kitty's blood sugar was still very high, which surprised us since we had been upping his insulin based on his water intake & other behavioral factors (at the advice of our vet). Now we will be able to gather better info and pass that on to our vet, and adjust his meds acordingly.
