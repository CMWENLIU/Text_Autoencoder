I know it may sound strange, but I use a tablespoon of this almond meal mixed with water as a facial cleanser and mask, and ever since the first use of this paste, the quality of my skin has HUGELY improved. I honestly wish I had pictures to share, because my acne has been reduced in half within a single month. I have tried literally hundreds of different skin care products and homemade remedies, and this is definitely a thoroughly effective mild exfoliant, cleanser, and mask for acneic skin.
