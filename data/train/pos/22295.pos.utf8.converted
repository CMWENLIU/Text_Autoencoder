I use this oil in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite 4-Ounce Old Fashioned Table Top Popcorn Popper</a> and love it. Its semi-solid texture makes it easy to work with, since there's no need to worry about spilling or dripping when adding it to the kettle (it melts to a liquid once heated). I combine it with Flavacol salt, Pop Weaver kernels, and Mor-Gold Plus butter substitute. The result is truly authentic tasting theater style popcorn.
