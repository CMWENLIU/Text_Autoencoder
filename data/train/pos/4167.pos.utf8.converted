While I always liked peanuts, it wasn't until I chose them as a low carb, low sugar snack that I discovered that no other brand compared to the taste of Planter's.  Then they started to get scarce - everyone was discontinuing them, or charging exorbitant prices.  I bought them at WalMart until they discontinued them, and then special ordered from my local market until they couldn't get them for me.  Then I discovered them at Amazon -- and at a good price, delivered.  I am a happy customer!!
