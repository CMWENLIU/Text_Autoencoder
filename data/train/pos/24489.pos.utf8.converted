Just a handful of almonds (about 22) a couple of times a week will help reduce your blood fats, lose weight, and generally feel good.  These Diamond almonds are great, because there's nothing added to make them bad for you like salt, oil, etc.  The six ounce size is great to sneak into the movies and share with a friend.  You can even use that size of bag as a heart healthy stocking stuffer for a health conscious person.
