I buy these to use at work--I like milk in my tea but don't want to take up a lot of space in my mini fridge with a big carton. these containers are the perfect size for adding milk to a couple cups of tea. I prefer the organic valley 8 ounce containers to the horizon 8 ounce--the horizon says that it needs to be shaken before drinking, which is really hard if you are planning on finishing the container later. and yes, you can open it up, use some, put the rest back in the fridge, and safely consume it over a couple of days (at least I have never had a problem).<br /><br />I have never had a problem ordering this from amazon--the date is always good and it is priced competitively.
