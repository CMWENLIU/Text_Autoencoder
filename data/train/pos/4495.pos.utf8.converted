I've been a rabid fan of Huey Fong Sriracha sauce for years, so when I saw authentic Thai Sriracha sauce here on Amazon my interest was piqued.  I wasn't disappointed.  Shark brand Sriracha sauce really does come from Thailand and it really is sriracha sauce.  It's the same hot chili loaded with garlic and yummy sweetness - but there are plenty of differences.  Where Huey Fong is dark almost crimson red (and looks a tad fake), Shark brand is brick tomato red and clearly looks natural.  Huey Fong lists preservatives, Shark does not.  Unlike Huey Fong, Shark is freely runny and comes in a glass (not plastic) bottle without a flow limiting top (so watch out!)<br /><br />Tasting notes:  Shark is hot, sweet, and garlicky.  Compared to Huey Fong it is less sweet, with a more open tomato-like flavor component.  Vinegar is a more noticeable flavor element with Shark brand.  The texture is looser; and the product separates more in the fridge (and, yes, it requires refrigeration) and requires that the bottle be shaken before use if it's sitting for more than a week.  Is Shark yummy?  Yes - it's probably the second best hot sauce I've tried.  Is Huey Fong yummier?  Yes, in my opinion Huey Fong's added sweetness and thickness and less vinegar taste is more yummy - but it's not a slam dunk.  Shark brand feels more real, more homemade, and more authentic (as it probably is). Huey Fong has preservatives and has a color and texture that are a tad artificial.  I find myself going back and forth.  On top of a burrito I prefer Huey Fong.  In soup I prefer Shark.  I certainly do not regret having this stuff.  Highly recommended for the sriracha obsessed.<br /><br />FYI - full ingredient list:  "Chillie" 35%, Water 25%, Sugar 20%, Garlic 10%, Salt 5%, Vinegar 5%.  Sounds like you could almost make it at home.  Manufacturer:  Kosol-Ampa Co. LTD.  OFF: 804D Chet Cham Nong Rd. Cholburi, Thailand 038-282710 (That's the phone number).
