This was my first purchase of Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for my Keurig. I was hoping it would be at least as good as making a pot of tea. I was not disappointed. In fact, I find them to have a fuller body and stronger flavor than a cup from a tea pot. It is handy and quick as popping one in and pushing the brew button.<br /><br />My biggest concern when making this purchase was that it would pick up the flavor from a previously brewed cup of coffee. It did not. As a precaution I do rinse the inside of the cup holder before I brew a cup of tea, however, even times when I don't I can't tell the difference. So now I can have a great cup of Twinings Earl Grey with better results than a brewed pot of tea, much faster and with less waste. I fully recommend this product.<br /><br />I might also add, I have tried many brands of Earl Grey Tea and Twinings is the only brand that I enjoy. I'm elated that I can now get it in K-Kups! Thanks Twinings!!
