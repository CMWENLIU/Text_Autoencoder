This is the best grain free food I've come across. I had my one year old labradoodle on Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core and Super5mix, Life's Abundance, and a few others. None compare with this food. It's well priced, has amazing ingredients, and my dog has never been in better health. Her stool is as good as it gets - no more soft or runny poop. It's also a six-star (best) food according to numerous dog food review sites. The only thing better than this is raw.
