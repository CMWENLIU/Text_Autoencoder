The Le Petit Ecolier (the little schoolboy) cookie is perhaps the greatest cookie commercially produced.  It is a crunchy biscuit covered with a thick, delicious layer of milk chocolate.  A great afternoon snack, especially when paired with a steaming hot cup of coffee, young and old will enjoy this little bit of "heaven".
