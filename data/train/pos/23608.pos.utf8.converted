This mix was fantastic! I subbed in brewed coffee for the 1 cup of water, and made mini cupcakes with it. They were soooo good. I took them to work, and no one thought they were gluten free. The texture is just like gluteny cake, not grainy at all. They were super moist, I put them in plastic zip top bags and they were sticking to it a little. This mix is seriously good.
