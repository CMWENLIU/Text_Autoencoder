There are several types of hams varying in quality.<br />Ham and water product is the lowest, followed by ham with water added, ham in natural juices and then the top of the line HAM.<br />North Country makes awesome hams. We've purchased them many times and the flavor is great. Nicely trimmed and no added juices or water. So you are only paying for a ham. If you want a great ham at a fair price, try them.
