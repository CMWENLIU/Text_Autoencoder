Alright so about 3 months ago I asked my vet how much a dog teeth cleaning would cost me.  Because the dog would have to be put under anesthesia, she said total would be about $350.  Pretty steep but I thought I should give my dog a cleaning since he was in need of one.  Last month I called in to make the dental appt. and was surprised to hear their prices have gone up to $550....c'mon people, I love my dog a lot but in today's economy $550 is a lot of money, certainly almost more than a car payment.  I stumbled on these Checkups at my local Costco and have been using them for a week.  I am AMAZED at how well these work!!!  In just a week I have noticed a real drastic reduction in plaque buildup and in the bad breath.  I highly recommend these, my dog loves em so much, it's his special treat and at the same time it's helping his teeth and the bad breath issue.  Can't beat that, and the Costco price is awesome!  Try these.
