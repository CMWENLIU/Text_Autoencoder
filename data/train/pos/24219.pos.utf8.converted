I love Earth Mama products so I decided to give their Third Trimester Tea a try.  I ordered both Earth Mama and Traditional Medicinals.  There is a big difference between the taste of these two.  While they're both grassy and herby as you would expect, Earth Mama tea has a more pleasant kick to it.  It does not have the bitter aftertaste that Traditional Medicinals has.  I was able to drink Earth Mama without any brown sugar or honey but I had to have something to sweeten Traditional Medicinals.<br /><br />Earth Mama is more expensive but I think it's worth it.  I did not return Traditional Medicinals, I do not hate it, but Earth Mama Third Trimester Tea is definitely better.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do not list the amounts of each ingredient.  That makes it impossible to make a comparison based on potency of ingredients.  Still, I would recommend this product, and would use it exclusively if I hadn't ordered the other brand already.
