Couldn't run my vegetarian lifestyle without this one.  Easy open/close package [in case you don't have a canister with a good lid] and the product inside is useful hot as a healthier substitute for rice, or serve chilled as a base for fresh veggie salad mixture.  The nutrition aspects are the most important - imagine a vegetable with beaucoup protein that isn't a basic bean?  Important: this quinoa has been pre-rinsed so you don't have to - no bitterness, just ready to cook 'n serve.
