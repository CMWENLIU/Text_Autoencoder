I use this in my lunches that I pack everyday. I trust the ingredients and the flavors are quenching. I use empty water bottles to pre mix the Propel and set in refrigerator to chill before I put it into the lunch box with an ice block. I will carry extra with me to a restaurant and do not have to pay 2.00 for one drink, I order water and use my own flavor, it is cheaper on the restaurant bill for me.
