Growing up in a healthy home, low sodium foods were part of every meal - but they always tasted so bland. I am so excited to discover happy pho - it has low sodium, is gluten free AND manages to have SO MUCH FLAVOR. I don't know how you do it, I almost feel guilty chowing down on my noodles - they taste so good, I do a double take on the nutrition information every time. And talk about healthy: brown rice noodles - BONUS! Happy Pho has become a staple for me  - it's healthy AND delicious - who could ask for more?
