I looked at this tea and several others, and actually tried another brand of loose leaf tea before finding this one. After reading all the reviews and comparisons, I decided to bite the bullet and just get this tea. I was quite worried about people's comments concerning the taste, but I figured I'd do what I must in order to keep breastfeeding my son. To my surprise, the tea was actually pretty tasteless compared to the loose leaf nursing tea I was drinking before. And, I think it definitely boosted my milk production. I don't know whether it's the herbs or the increased intake in fluids, but I definitely started pumping 8-10oz per pumping session, which was more than enough for my child. At some point I reduced my intake because I seemed to be overproducing milk and could feed my baby and freeze 12oz each day. When my production dropped a bit, I'd start back up on the tea, drinking a cup after each pumping session. I finished my six boxes pretty quickly and ordered another one two weeks ago.<br /><br />All I can say is that it worked for me. It may or may not work for you, but you won't ever know unless you try it. If buying it in bulk is scary for you, go purchase a single box and drink it to see how you feel about it.
