If you've never had flax seed oil before, you may notice a slightly "off" flavor to Nature's Path's version of raisin bran.  I think even flax newbies will habituate to this taste, especially because of the familiar taste of the multi-grain flakes and the raisins (see other reviews).  As one who sometimes puts a tablespoon of flax seed oil on top of oatmeal, the flax seed flavor was a welcome change from the usual cold cereal offerings.<br /><br />THis cereal is pretty darn good for you> Obviously, you're gonna want to consult a doctor or nutritionist, and I am neither.  From a lay person's pont of view, however, the 11 grams of fiber("11 WHOPPING grams," I should say--that's way more than oatmeal, and more than bran flakes or any other hot or cold cereal I've seen) 600 grams of Omegas and no saturated fat all sound very good for you.  If offers 20% of the Daily Value of iron (see nutritional information below), without any added iron!  Very rare. Perhaps it has to do with all those organic grains (and raisins): Organic whole wheat flour, organic wheat bran, organic oat bran, organic barley malt extract. (See below for a complete list of ingredients.)<br /><br />Nature's Path is making some of the most interesting cereals around, with healthy organic ingredients not often found in other products (e.g., pomegranites, pumpkin seeds).
