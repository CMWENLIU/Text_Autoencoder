This is a good product.  I use once every day although you can use up to three times a day.  It gives you energy - very noticeable boost when you first start using it, not as obvious after a while - BUT, if I don't use it, I notice the difference in my energy level.  On the weekends when I want to stay up late, I mix up a glass and I'm good to go for a couple of hours more; however, I can still sleep if I want to.  I have a really sensitive system and typically "energy" stuff makes me jittery or nauseaus, but this stuff isn't like that at all.  Just a good, solid, healthy, energetic feeling.  It looks awful but it tastes good.  I mix it with Simply Orange, pulp-free orange juice (I like pulp but the grass sticks to the pulp and doesn't mix as well) and it tastes great.  My friend mixes it with vanilla soy milk and loves it.
