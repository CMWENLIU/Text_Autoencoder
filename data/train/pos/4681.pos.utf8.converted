My mother lives in Colorado and is on a very fixed low income. If I send her money she won't use it so I have found I can help her by buying her groceries off Amazon and having them sent directly to her house and this enables me to be able to help her. THANK YOU Amazon for having products like this on your site. I hope you continue to work with companies and make this affordable to have groceries shipped this way and also to save us the hassels of going to the grocery store when we can have it delivered to our house for about the same cost as going to the grocery store.
