For a family who loves cheez-its, this is an excellent way to keep them stocked.  I use the "subscribe and save" and the cheez-its cost less than NYC area grocery stores (nearly 5 dollars a box here).<br /><br />Some reviewers claim that they are over priced - but this is a great deal for my area!!<br /><br />My husband likes reduced fat cheez-its better than the regular.  He does not buy them for dietary reasons - he is in excellent shape.  He prefers the reduced fat variety because they are MORE CRISP than their counterparts.  Highly recommended!
