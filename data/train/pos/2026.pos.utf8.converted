I've been a user of full spectrum bulbs because my office is attached to a computer server room and thus has no windows.  I use this lights with a few desk lamps that I aim toward the walls/ceiling from my wrap around desk to provide some natural feeling light.  It really helps me feel less like taking a snooze under all of the dim indoor lighting.<br /><br />The packaging was all cardboard and contained no plastic.  The bulbs seemed very well protected and I had no issues with them being shipped.  I will definitely consider these again the next time I need more full spectrum bulbs. Also, no flicker that I can notice.
