OMG....These are just as I rememeber them when I was a kid. Except when I was a kid, they were always hard, rubber-like sticks that took FOREVER to chew. Not these though. They are both Soft and Chewy. Delicously different than the regular red vines. Don't get me wrong. Those are equally great, but the grape flavor in these is fantastic. So much so, my wife, who had never tasted one before, has now eaten half my order...Gotta find a better hiding spot:)<br /><br />Enjoy!
