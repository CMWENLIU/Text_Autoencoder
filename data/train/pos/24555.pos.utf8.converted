Without a doubt, Diamond Naturals is the best affordable quality dog food on the market. They sell the 40 pound bags where I live for around $22-25, so I do get it a little cheaper. What makes Diamond Naturals so great is the fact that it does not contain corn, wheat, or soy in the ingredients. Corn and wheat are what causes skin irritation, dryness, loss of hair, and loose stools. All of the other brands around this price contain corn or wheat as their first or second ingredients, like Purina, Iams, Science Diet, Pedigree, and other cheaper brands. Also, Diamond Naturals actually has considerable portions of REAL meat instead of fillers and by-product that the other brands have in them.<br /><br />Is Diamond Naturals the best dog food on the market? No, but some us of cannot afford the $60-70 holistic dog foods. Diamond Naturals rated 4 out of 5 stars on a top dog food review website and a 3 out of 5 stars on another top dog food review site. Some people will say it's a so-so dog food, but do not listen to them. They are quoting from old reviews or they are reading reviews for "Diamond" dog food.<br /><br />My Rottweiler use to eat Purina (bad I know, but I hadn't done the research yet!), but he had loose stools, skin irritation, and had a TON of shedding. When I switched to Diamond Naturals Chicken and Rice, the irritation, loose stools, and the major shedding all stopped.<br /><br />However, the cheaper brand "Diamond" is not of the same quality as "Diamond Naturals," so be sure you have the right brand before you buy. Also, if you're spending $35-40 on this dog food, then i'd upgrade to the Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul dog food which is $40 for 35 pounds.
