I was born and raised in New Orleans. I have been a coffee lover as soon as I could drink from a cup! My great-grandmother would give it to me with lots of milk in it. Anyway, I have been through all of them all...back and forth... Community, CDM, Luzianne, French Market (red label), Union, PJ's...I even tried different types of pure coffee and adding my own chicory. I prefer the French Market Restaurant Blend. This one was introduced to me at a seafood restaurant called Coffee's Boiling Pot in Madisonville, LA. I love it. For me, it has the right blend of coffee and chicory (not hickory as some reviewer complained!) Of course,I wish the whole beans were available so that I could grind it myself.Anyway,it's a personal preference. Try it. If you don't like it, send it to me. I'll gladly drink it!
