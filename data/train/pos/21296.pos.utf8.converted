I have tried most of the Zevia soda flavors. I love the taste now, it took a few days to get use to the different taste from the other calorie free sodas. I love that they don't have the Aspartame and Surcalose as other soft drinks. I don't have the horrible side effects from the major brands give me.ZEVIA Natural Black Cherry - With Stevia (Case of 24) Zero Calories
