It took me a while to warm up to the idea of buying freeze dried fruit in individual serving bags.  Brothers helped me overcome that.  The fruit needs to be in the individual packaging to keep the humidity out so they stay crisp.  I found the mandarin orange crisps delightful.  The texture of freeze dried fruit in general takes a little time to get used to.  These are sort of like a cheese puff in mouth feel, but entirely different in taste.  They explode with a sweet/ tart flavor.<br /><br />If you buy fresh fruit and it spoils before you eat it, or if you run out and need an alternative to canned or frozen fruit, this is a great alternative.  Price an orange some time.  While these cost more than a piece of fresh fruit, they are not too far off.  Don't let the price per ounce fool you.  You are not paying for the water content that makes up most of the weight of fresh. Compare by serving size.  Grab a glass of tap water and a bag of these and you're on.  I also like the pineapple, cinnamon apple and banana flavors.  The berry flavors have a seed problem in my opinion so I skip them.
