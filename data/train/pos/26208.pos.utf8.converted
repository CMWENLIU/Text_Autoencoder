I guess there might be other natural peanut butters for sale in expensive health-food stores, but I haven't tried them.  However, in the regular super-markets, the only peanut butter I'll buy is SKIPPY NATURAL!  It is the best tasting, and won't clog your arteries.  For those who think it is un-healthy because they remove some peanut oil and replace it with natural palm oil, I disagree.  Peanut oil separates and has to be stirred up every time, or you have to refrigerate it, and then it doesn't spread well.  Palm oil has saturated fat, but it is the healthy kind, produced by the palm tree, not chemically altered partially hydrogenated oil like in regular p.b.  Palm oil is high in oleic acid, like olive oil, among many other things, which are good for you.  Sure, plain peanuts and salt makes a pretty healthy p.b., but it is inconvenient and my family doesn't like it, and I don't care for it much myself.  If we can eat a peanut butter that tastes great, keeps well in the cabinet, spreads easily, and is better for us than most, and maybe just about as good for us as any other, what do you think we're going to do?
