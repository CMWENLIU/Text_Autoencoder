I have to admit up front that I selected this product for trial on price alone.  I hadn't read the previous reviews very carefully and was surprised when I opened the box and found a bunch of very un-K-cup looking K-cups.  The second thing that hit me was the great coffee aroma, something missing from K-cups in general.  What the hell!  Skepticism aside, into the brewer went the first one.  Cut to the chase - great cup of coffee!  I expected a dripping mess when I removed the K-cup.  Not so.  It leaves a perfect little disposable piece.  No mess.<br /><br />In addition to the Rainforest blend I also have now tried the French Roast Decaf.  Also a treat.
