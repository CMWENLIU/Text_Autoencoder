The name sanbitter (san pellegrino bitter) tells all. This is a typical italian "aperitivo". A drink that should be drink in small size before having dinner(with snacks like penuts, small crackers, etc.). The bitterness (and believe me is bitter) is suppose to stimulate your appetite. My wife that is born in the US hate it, as it Italian I love it...so I guess it requires to have roots in Italy. Rated 5 as Italian, someone in US will be probably rate this 1.
