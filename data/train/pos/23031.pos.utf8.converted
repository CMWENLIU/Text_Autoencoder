In reality, each bottle is worth two drinks or more. Here's how to get the most bang for your buck. After you spend $16.00 to $25.00 for the four-pack, buy a 1-liter of either (or both) Sprite and/or club soda for a couple of dollars.<br /><br />If you have a sweet tooth, do a 50/50 mix of Tru Blood with Sprite. If you prefer to dull the sweetness, then do the same but with club soda. Be creative and mix to your taste.<br /><br />Remember, this beverage has a slight fizz to it (carbonation), so you'll need a fizzy mixer to help it maintain its integrity.<br /><br />You might also want to keep you first empty bottle so that you can poor half of the subsequent bottle into the first bottle and store your mixes.<br /><br />Also tastes great with freshly-oxygenated arterial blood at 98.6F.  (Just kidding.)<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Jet<br /><br />-
