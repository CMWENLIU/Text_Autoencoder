While in Japan we were introduced to Genmai Cha and immediately preferred the taste of green tean and toasted rice to plain green tea.  Back in the states we found suppliers for bulk mixes until we stumbled upon the Yamamotoyama tea bags in foil pouches.  Each serving is fresh and the flavor is great.  We heartily endorse buying the 90 pouch bulk pack so you can have this great flavor at any time.
