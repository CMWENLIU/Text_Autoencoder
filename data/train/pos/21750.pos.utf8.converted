My friends think I am crazy when I rave about it, but my husband and kids know that this stuff has been life changing for me! For the past 15 years the only thing I drink 99.5% of the time is water because I prefer to eat my calories. :) But I see these 5 Hour Energy bottles EVERYWHERE, so I wondered what was the deal? Then I saw the tv commerial and figured I would at least try it, because I am an avid runner always trying to get my 5k time down, so how awesome would it be to FEEL like running rather than dragging myself to do intervals sometimes. I've been drinking it for the past 3 months and it has worked wonders for me! I'm telling everyone about it.<br /><br />I found for best results I drink half the bottle around 11am and the other half around 4pm usually after eating a snack or drinking a protien shake. This gets me through an tough afternoon workout, and once I get home from work I have the energy/motivation to cook, clean, do laundry, or whatever tasks I would normally just lay around and wish I had the energy to do. Even more amazing I can stay up about an hour later each night, but still wake up early, feeling refreshed and ready for a morning workout. I always drink some about 30 minutes before a race and usually before a hard workout.<br /><br />Cons....Well, I did find that if I drank it on an empty stomach I would get some pain in my right side. :) But I'm still sold on it!  I sometimes just drink half a bottle all day and don't drink it on the weekends or on vacations because it's not good to be addicted to anything (but Jesus) :), and you don't want to get immune to it because you want it to work when you need it to plus it is kind of expensive...<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't found anyone else who loves it as much as I do, but I still say TRY IT!
