Okay, maybe the heading exagerates just a tad... Red Popcorn has a MUCH more tender husk than regular popcorn does and when it pops, it explodes the kernel so well that the husks basically disappear.  When it pops, it looks pretty much like any other popcorn, except that the popped kernels are slightly smaller than usual.  The meet is white, but you can see the little bits of red kernel in them.  You would never know that the pretty, white popcorn you were eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping.<br /><br />The flavor is great!  It smelled "toastier" as it was popping than other popcorns we've tried.  We tried it all different ways, with toppings ranging from sweet to savory and every way was good.<br /><br />We also liked the fact that it is grown by Amish people and are happy to support their efforts to raise their crops the "old way."  They believe in sustainable farming and a clean, wholesome way of life.  No ConAgra multi-national conglomerates here, just real, individual farmers making a living off their land.<br /><br />Great products raised and produced by real farmers.  What better reasons do you need to buy some of this really tasty popcorn!?
