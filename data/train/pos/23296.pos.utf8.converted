This has a distinct aroma and yet it only brings out the original flavor of the foods you sprinkle it on.  It does what a good salt substitute should do which is to bring out your favorite flavors.  Actually, it seems to do the job even better than salt itself.  Most of the elderly folks that live around here prefer this to salt by far because it doesn't have that tingling aftertaste.  I would recommend buying this if you can't find this at your local grocery store or supermarket even though the shipping is more expensive than the product.
