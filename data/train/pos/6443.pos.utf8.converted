I have crohn's disease and put myself into remission the natural way (without medications). I am on a very strict diet (all-natural, organic, gluten-free, vegan, macrobiotic) so these bars were a perfect fit! These are the ONLY bars I like. Luna bars had a lot of excess ingredients and were high in sugar as are most bars. Kashi was okay but not organic and was high in sugar and processed. NOTHING beats the tastes of these bars! I don't agree with the person who gave it one star. The only person who wouldn't like these bars are those who are use to high sugar-processed food diets or aren't use to the taste of macrobiotic foods. I love that these are made with brown rice syrup because it digests slower and gives you long-lasting energy. And 16 grams of protein...WOW!<br /><br />I LOVE MACRO BARS!
