This basket was perfect for my 89 year old father, who is tough to shop for. He enjoyed the meat and cheese, but returned the coffee bits to me (he's not a coffee drinker). So I got to share in the festivities too! If you're looking for something to get someone who is difficult to shop for or to please, you can't go wrong with meat and cheese, sweets, or coffee generally.
