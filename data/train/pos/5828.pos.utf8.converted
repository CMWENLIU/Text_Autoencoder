These are my dog's "inside bones".  They last and last and last without turning into little chunks all over the rug.  The dog is an 85 pound "working dog" - which means high energy and really annoying when bored.  He's had some of these nylabones for over two years.  I only have to replace them when he sneaks one outside and buries it.<br /><br />Yes, letting the dog out has its own ritual.  "Inside bone!" -clunk- as bone drops to the floor, hopefully missing my foot.<br /><br />In comparison, the "outside" bones tend to be the leg bones of ungulates.  Those things are solid, but he eats them anyway.  I think.  He does seem to enjoy burying them, digging them up, burying them elsewhere, and trying to smuggle those filthy things into the house.  "Outside bone!" -clunk-  He also likes to carry and chew up firewood.  Nothing lasts like a nylabone.  Nothing is less messy inside the house than a nylabone.<br /><br />I buy the "giant" size because it gives me a better grip for those tugs-of-war.<br /><br />Very weird that the dog knew there were nylabones in the amazon box and that they were his.
