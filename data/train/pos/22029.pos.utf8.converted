First let me say that we do not eat Indian food very often, and I certainly do not know how to make it and I have never tried. It would probably require a specialty cook book and a bunch of expensive spices that would rarely be used. I also may not know good Indian food from bad Indian food, because like I said, we rarely have it. This stuff is delicious!!! We have not tried them all, but the lamb curry was excellent. I added some sliced onion and threw in a handful of frozen peas at the end and served over rice. It was fragrant, warm but not hot, and delicious! I know this is kind of bad, but I didn't have lamb so I used some thin-siced beef steaks that I had frozen. Anyway, the curries are delicious and easy to prepare, just add meat or vegetables, water and simmer. Some of the packets call for a little butter or something, but you'll probably have that handy. As for nutrition, they all say that they have 2 grams of fiber per serving. Sodium varies from about 480 to 660mg per serving but the veg. briani is 810mg., and calories are relatively low at 45 to 60 per serving, fat is 3 to 3.5 grams per servin, carbs are around 3 to 5. Try it, you'll like it if you are normally just a little adventerous in your food choices.
