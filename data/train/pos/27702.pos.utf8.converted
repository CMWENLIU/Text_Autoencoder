Goji juice really does work, but you need to know how to use it. If you are going to try Goji juice, please try this one because it has 6 times the concentrate of pure goji juice than the rest of the type on the market.  It is in a glass bottle with absolutely no added juice, as every type in the white plastic bottle is and cost almost the same or more to by.<br /><br />Goji juice works, but you have to give it time.  You basically needed to make it a daily routine. Drinking about 1-2 ounces on an empty stomach (you can mix with OJ or favorite juice for a better flavor because pure Goji is not really sweet).  Then take about the same amount in the afternoon.  You can take more ounces depending on your health since Goji juice is organic and pure.<br /><br />After about 1 week of taking it regularly you really will start to notice a difference.  I have been taking this for about 3 months straight and have not had a cold, feel wonderful, happier, and just plain better!  Goji is a daily supplement and really does aid in immune support, so taking it for that is worth it.  You just have to give it a chance to work.  There are never really any overnight miracle cures for anything.  The good stuff that really works takes time and you have to make it part of your everyday lifestyle to see the real benefit.  I have even planted my own Goji berry plants, so I can eat the fruit as well.<br /><br />This is the best price of all the Goji sold.  You can get it straight from Genesis today or from amazon for the same price, give or take a dollar.  Don't waste money on the white plastic bottle type sold under several names because it is mostly made of other fruit juices and is not pure Goji concentrate.  This is pure with no juices and is well worth the price.  Just remember that to see the real benefits you have to make it part of your lifestyle and it will work.  It is not called the "happy juice" for nothing.  It is even used over seas to help ease the after affects of that patients get when taking chemotherapy.  Just remember that sometimes in America we take something that works and blow it up by exaggerating the cost, adding stuff to the original, and not really informing the consumers on the proper way to use it.  This again is the only real 100% totally pure Goji juice and the only one worth spending money on other than growing ur own fruit trees.
