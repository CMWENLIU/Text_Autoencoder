These are excellent, though I fancy the Ginger Chews more.  These are very tender and the young ginger has some much taste.  It's sweet and tart and helps calm your stomach.  As I said in the other review, keep an eye on how much you eat, as too much ginger (like peppermint) can cause heartburn.  For motion sickness, an upset stomach, for digestion help or pregnancy calm or frazzled nerves, this is a great treat.
