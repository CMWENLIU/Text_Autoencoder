i recently cut out my normal breakfasts (which weren't too bad to begin with) but started drinking these shakes in the morning, they fill you right up and you last till lunch time without those grueling stomach pains when your stomach is basically saying (feed me or ill make your life miserable) well, i have stuck to that and just them alone i have lost an excess amount of weight for my body style, very good product, i would recommend to anyone thats on the go and gets that craving to stop at somewhere not so healthy to eat, just so you avoid that, and slowly cut off the weight, very impressed with this product, still drinking every day to this day.
