Wow - my retriever mix dog LOVES this dog toy.  I was hesitant because of the price but considering bully sticks and other nylabones are expensive and don't last long, this one is worth the cost.  My dog obviously loves chewing on the rings but even when they are chewed off, she still chews on the nylabone endings all the time.  We end up only putting on a 2 rings maybe once a week as an extra special treat.  I will say this though - this thing is HEAVY, so watch your toes!  I would only recommend this size for a dog over 50 lbs and a heavy chewer.  Otherise, get the medium size.
