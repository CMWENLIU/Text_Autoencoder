I suffer from Celiac Disease, and various food and allergies.  As such I eat a very pure diet.  This generally means I'm forced to cook everything from scratch.  It's a real joy to be able to open a package of cereal, poor in some milk, and eat ... WITHOUT getting sick.<br /><br />ALL of Nature's Path Organic products are wonderful, fresh and tasty.  Their Rice puffs are easy to digest, free of pesticides and other additives.
