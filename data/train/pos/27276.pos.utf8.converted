I'm a long-time customer of McDougall Right Foods, dating back to early 2004.<br /><br />The main selling point of Right Foods cups is that they are "vegan", meaning that there are nothing animal-related in them (no meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or byproducts of such).  All ingredients are natural (no chemicals added).  Even the cup container itself is labeled "food-grade".  Some (not all) food cups contain only organic ingredients, and some are gluten-free; each cup is so labeled if applicable.<br /><br />The cups provide a fast snack or meal-idea: pour boiling water into the cup, stir, let stand a few minutes, and eat or pour over such as pasta and rice.<br /><br />The company does well to make the food cups taste good, and each individual will have his/her own favorites.<br /><br />Keep in mind that McDougall food cups are aimed at the vegan/health-consicious market.  Since they are pricey (the large cups go for almost $2.00 each), I wouldn't recommend them for non-vegans/vegetarians, as there are many less-expensive (and less-healthy) alternatives.  Amazon sells the food cups for less than the Right Foods website does; the company website has a larger variety.<br /><br />Those who are vegan or thinking of becoming vegan would do well to visit Dr. McDougall's website (drmcdougall dot com) for more information.
