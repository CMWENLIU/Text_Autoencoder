I read in a review that someone stated this product was made in China.<br /><br />I called the 800 number and asked a few questions.  The lady who answered was very nice and e-mailed me the following:<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Hello,<br /><br />As we discussed, please find below the information about where our ingredients come from & our quality control process.<br /><br />All Alacer products are made in the United States. Our ingredients are purchased from all over the world (including China) from suppliers who meet United States Pharmacopoeia standards.<br /><br />We test 100% of our incoming raw materials for identity and we confirm that what we received is what we ordered. We use very sophisticated laboratory equipment that takes a near infrared fingerprint of all incoming raw materials, and it compares the fingerprint to our approved raw materials library. If it does not match, it is rejected from our warehouse.<br /><br />If we may be of help in any other way, please let us know.<br /><br />Warm regards,<br /><br />Kristin Frey<br />Customer Relations<br />Alacer Corp., makers of Emergen-C<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I like the product and take it 3 times a day - I like to mix in a touch of grape juice to enhance the flavor.
