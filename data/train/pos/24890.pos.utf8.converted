I have been getting soy for my boys 8 & 10 with milk allergies and happened upon Zen Soy on Amazon. I loved the panda and thought let's try it. One of the best buying  decisions I have ever made. My boys and I so love Zen Soy. The smooth creamy taste is awesome.  They say it tastes just like ice cream. Now they request Zen Soy and say not other will do. My 10 year old said to never buy Silk again, he only wants Zen Soy.
