I keep jasmine pearl tea on hand because my family loves it. The smell is heavenly and jasmine pearl tea doesn't develop the strong bitter aftertaste the longer it sets out. Maybe this is a quality of the green teas in general.  The tea leaves have a very pleasant mild taste. I strongly recommend this tea to any tea lover.
