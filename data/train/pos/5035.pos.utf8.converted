We've only tried 3 of the 6 flavors so far, but all have been VERY tasty (definitely on the spicy side, but that is what you want from Indian food) you can literally heat and eat, but my husband and I prefer a little more substance - so we added 1/2 a pound of cooked chicken and served it over rice - WONDERFUL!!! We enjoyed them so much we ordered 4 more sets before the discount code I had expired. If you are going to try just one the Mixed Vegetable Curry is Fabulous!
