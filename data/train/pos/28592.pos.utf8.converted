I used to buy the bottle of cinnamon oil and soak toothpicks and paper in it, then sell them in junior high, I always had one in my mouth, the hotter the better. I always wondered what it did to my digestive track! After becoming wise to my little business, i was banned from selling these when a student who bought a bunch stabbed himself in the cheek, thanks alot dork i could have bought that Casio Keyboard I always wanted from the profits.
