In this package you get three varieties of popcorn, all of which are different, light, fluffy, and fun to eat. Two are of the hulless variety (very tasty and won't stick in between your teeth as much), and the purple kind has a thick kernel and a uniquely nutty taste. All of these stand up to any kind of butter, salt, or seasonings that you might throw their way, and I highly recommend this as a starter package for yourself or a nice gift for one of your corn-poppin' friends.
