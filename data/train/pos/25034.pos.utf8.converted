This makes the best pancakes ever and can even be used as a substitute for evil gluten-filled flour in recipes.  We've made bread, cookies, pancakes, cakes, brownies, and even pizza crust. We have to keep buying this frequently since we go through it so quickly.  It has even passed the taste tests of those without gluten problems. Fantastic!! A celiac's dream come true.
