I was skeptical of this blend. I like my coffee dark and bold. But this one is really REALLY smooth, dark and rich tasting. My other fav is Caribou and this one is similar to that. Not bitter, not biting, just smooth and rich and consistant. A great daily brew for my Keurig. Try it. I bet you will like it.
