4 sho.<br /><br />Like seriously, it's really good. Quite cheesy, and with the mix not just the packet of already prepared liquid-solid cheddar cheese. I tend to like the mix packets much better. Because you add milk (just enough) and butter (as much as you want) and then put the cheese in, and blend it all to make a masterpiece in 10 minutes or less (usually less!).<br /><br />It's very quick, easy to make and although it's not healthy, it's convenient.<br /><br />If you're healthy, I would totally recommend this once a week. If you're not, I recommend it once every two weeks.^^<br /><br />The best part about the powder packets is that you blend the whole thing so you have control over how it comes out! and when I have control, the macaroni and cheese will be slammin' tonight!<br /><br />Neeeeeeext!!!!<br /><br />4.8/5
