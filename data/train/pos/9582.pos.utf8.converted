My AeroGarden was an impulse buy that I have not regretted for a moment. After planting and killing countless herbs in a pot on my kitchen window shelf, I finally have a ready supply of healthy plants requiring minimal maintenance.<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pump or timers on my unit. Every two weeks it signals me to add more nutrients. I monitor the water level and keep it topped up, although it does signal if I let it get really low (and the light goes off when I refill it). The unit is nearly silent when the water is at level. Early on in the grow cycle the dripping was audible, but not since the plant roots have grown.<br /><br />As for the plants, the two basil plants are little monsters that I have to keep nipping back (okay, so there is SOME maintenance). As long as I keep the monsters in check the others do fine with the exception of the chives. They're just a thin sprig that I haven't been able to use. Fortunately the cilantro is doing well, since that was at the top of my list and the herb I have always had the most trouble growing. Overall the quality of the plants is very good -- and there's not a pesticide in sight.<br /><br />I've moved the light fixture up three times so far. I have nutrients for another eight weeks on my first bed of herbs, which means these plants will have lived longer than any that I ever grew in a pot.<br /><br />I'm so pleased with my herb I'm planning on buying another so that I can have French herbs too. And then I'll need a third for either tomatos or strawberries. Fortunately, I just noticed the three-garden wall "farm" today.
