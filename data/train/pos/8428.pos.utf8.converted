I have been drinking Douwe Egberts red label coffee for about 4 years now and the last time I was in Holland visiting friends I had a taste of Senseo Crema Dark Roast... I love this coffee... It is a fantastic blend and is so easy to make a cup of the coffee...<br />Last year I was given the Senseo Coffee maker and spent the money to have a special outlet installed in my kitchen and the plug changed on the coffee maker so I could enjoy it... I would not pass on this coffee ever.. It is adictive, it is that good...<br />Buy this coffee maker and this Dark Roast blend and you will see what I mean... It is well worth the money...<br />Also for those who didn't like the coffee, remember to read the instructions carefully because you first have to run clear water thru the Senseo before you use it.... It adds to the flavor of the coffee and prepares the maker for use... If I could I would rate this with 10 stars...
