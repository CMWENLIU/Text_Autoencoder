I've tried a lot of high-end olive oils and Monocultivar Biancolilla is near the top of my list.  This oil has a true pedigree because it comes from a single Sicilian organic farm and is cold-processed which differentiates it from other olive oils.  Most other olive oils are blends consisting of cheaper tasteless oils from places like Spain or Portugal.<br /><br />Store brand oils are virtually tasteless but are fine for cooking.  Others disagree and would use this liquid gold in everything.  They're probably the same people who cook with $50 bottles of wine. Olive oil in general is not so great for frying since it has a low smoke point and burns easily. Extra virgin olive oil smokes/burns at even a lower temperature. In other words, this is an oil best used cold. It's great for dipping bread, salads and as a finishing oil on soups or vegetables.<br /><br />This oil has a little bite and is packed with flavor.  It compliments, as oposed to overpowers, your food.  I recommend it without reservation.<br /><br />The farm where this oil comes from is relatively small and produces under 10,000 liter of oil/year.  This accounts for the high price.  If you want a less expensive oil that is almost as good try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000D9N4Q">Olio Carli Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 500ml Bottle (0.5 liter) by [...</a>].  A quick web search and you can find 3 liters for thirty dollars and free shipping.  I can't post the link but if you find their website add a slash offer to the address.<br /><br />One last thing: Extra virgin olive oil by definition has to contain a minimum percentage of EVOO.  The rest is just regular olive oil.  Monocultivar Biancolilla use a much higher percentage of EVOO than is required resulting in a superior product.  Keep in mind that Italy produces twice the amount of olive oil than they have trees for because they import and package cheaper oils -- technically they are Made in Italy.
