Forget the old garlic you've been getting at the supermarket.<br /><br />That garlic comes from Mexico or China... and is dried out and old.<br /><br />When you order Casa de Fruta garlic, you get moist gloves with rich garlic aroma.<br /><br />In fact after I went to bed, My husband made some garlic butter for some bread; so much for sneaking a snack...<br /><br />I could smell it in our bedroom...!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z8T6ES/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
