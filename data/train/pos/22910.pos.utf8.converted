I just finished stuffing these casings and they are awesome. I thought that it was one long piece, instead it's a bunch of them. Convenient for me as I am a first time user of this product. just rinse off the salt then run water thru casing and your ready to use. Perfect if you want to make a small batch or two. About 2-3 feet long each. I will buy more.
