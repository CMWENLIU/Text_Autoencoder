I have been eating this cereal every morning for breakfast for a few years now. It is just "heavy" enough to be satisfying until a mid-morning snack. I tried granola, but it's too "heavy" for me. I like a lighter breakfast, but need more than fruit. So this cereal is perfect. It has a mildly sweet nutty flavor and stays crunchy until the end. Reasonably priced with healthy ingredients...it's great!
