I've read all of the reviews on Amazon and have to agree with the majority of posters - it's an amazing appliance.  It saves me time and allows me to know with certainty what Baby is eating.  Because of it's versatility, you can really experiment with a variety of recipes with the simplicity of just adding cubed veggies and fruit.  My only suggested food to refrain - cooking beginner meats such as chicken or beef.  I cooked chicken and unfortunately minces the meat as opposes to a true puree.  (Note: this could entirely just be a function of adding more water during the blend which I have yet to experiment with)<br /><br />The trick to the Babycook is to read the manual and employ some common sense.  Here are some suggestions to the common complaints:<br /><br />1) Mold in the reservoir - common sense suggestion:  Let your unit air dry by removing the reservoir lid after each use prior to storing it away.  We wouldn't put blenders, food processors or most appliances away wet, treat the babycook the same way.  In addition, make sure only water is placed in the reservoir (i.e. without any trace foods which could occur when making multiple batches)<br /><br />2) Mold on the blade - as shown in the instruction booklet: remove the gasket and cleaning is simple as using a sponge or a brush.  It's really hard to get into the grooves without removing the rubber seal.  Reattaching it is super easy as well.<br /><br />3) Brown murky water - usually because of the after effects of descaling.  Vinegar browns when scalded so it is likely that this is the cause.  To remedy, as per the instructions, run a couple cycles to rinse out your unit. Common sense tip: regular descaling doesn't mean a couple months in between.  It means every week if you use your babycook daily.
