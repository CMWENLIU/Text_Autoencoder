Folks,this sauce is not for the faint-hearted. I am a chili-head and while I like this sauce,it is almost inedible it is so very HOT!<br />It is like eating magma and I am not kidding.<br />Be careful,BE VERY CAREFUL,with this sauce. You can only put one or two DROPS at the most on a taco or whatever.<br />THEY DON'T HAVE A SKULL CHAIN FOR NUTHIN'!!! It could've been mine,'cos the first time I used  this I dumped it on as if it were "Tapatio" sauce and took a bite of the taco. I never have had quite such a severe head-rush before.Yeeeooowww! The neighbors almsot dialed 911 on me.<br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
