I like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea.  It has a great taste and is not super sweet.  I find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate.  Unlike the other person I am not addicted, but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies.  If you like green tea I think you will like these.  I drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it.  Nice refreshing candy.  Individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time.
