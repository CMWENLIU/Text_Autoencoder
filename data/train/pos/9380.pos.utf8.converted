I bought this tea after reading a superb recommendation for it from a reliable source. I was a little wary about buying sight unseen, but I have to say the flavor matches the outstanding health benefits of this tea. Not surprising, since most quality items that are grown with care tend to excel in flavor as well.<br />This tea is very dry and shriveled, so the package is really packed. I usually get 3-4 cups of great tea per two tablespoons of leaves. This tea is meant to be used up pretty fast. In fact, this package should be used up in about six months, so the size is about right.<br />I find the flavor holds up well, with or without a sweetener. Goes well with honey (I prefer it straight).<br />Nutritional information is on the package, independent lab tested, but this tea is carefully cultivated and it really is a cut above anything else I have found on the market.<br />Great buy for an exceptional product. Worth every penny.
