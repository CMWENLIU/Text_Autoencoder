I purchased the flavor mix pack a few months back.  It wasn't from this link, but I assume this is the same product.  I will agree that it is very frustrating they don't tell you exactly what it is.  This is the review I posted - hope it helps.<br /><br />I just wanted to leave a note of what the composition of the Mixed Flavors pack looked like. I had a hard time finding information on what exactly I'd get. I'm sure they change could change this from time to time, but this is what I had:<br /><br />"Roctane" Gu packets (1 each): Blueberry Pomegranate, Vanilla Orange, Cherry Lime, Pineapple. These are the high endurance packets. The Blueberry Pom and Vanilla Orange are both double caffeine, Cherry Lime is normal caffeine and the Pineapple has no caffeine.<br /><br />Regular Gu Packets had 3 of Chocalate Outrage and Vanilla Bean. The rest had two of each flavor: Strawberry Banana, TriBerry, Expresso Love, Mandarin Orange, Jet Blackberry, Mint Chocolate, Lemon Sublime. The Strawberry Banana, Mint Chocolate, and Lemon Sublime have no caffeine, while Jet Blackberry and Expresso Love are double caffeine - everything else is normal caffeine.<br /><br />If you're looking to shake it up or find a favorite flavor, I think this is a good buy. I don't know that Gu is the best energy gel out there - I actually think everyone just has to find out what they like in taste and texture and what their stomach can handle. I've had good luck with Gu myself and I look forward to trying all the flavors.
