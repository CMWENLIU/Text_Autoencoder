These are the best dog treats ever. The dogs seem to like them and they really, really, really work. We have two Labs (a black and a yellow). The yellow is nine years old and has about the worst breath of all time. You know like when he breathes in your general direction, it causes a physical reaction. Well after about four treats (one per day), you could see err smell a significant improvement. It was amazing. They are a good chew for my guys as well (taking about 2 minutes to get through), as opposed to some other treats which go to fast or Greenies which are way too expensive. I highly reccomend. I just wish more people carried them locally.
