I'm not a personal trainer, but I am a health nut, and I have a few friends who are the same way.  We have tried MANY different bars, including Atkins, MetRx, PowerBar, Zone, Balance, Luna, GoLean, Detour, Myoplex, CarboLite, Advantage, and other "40-40-30" bars.  This bar is one of the best tasting bars I've eaten.  The green color worried me at first, but the flavor and nutritive qualities of this bar make it hands down the best.<br /><br />We visited a health store for about two hours one day to compare the ingredients on this bar versus all the others.  It is perfectly balanced, has no saturated fat (only 4g of mono-unsat, and 1g of poly unsat), and also has NO hydrogenated oils. This is VERY important, and if you don't know about how harmful hydrogenated oils can be, you should definitely read more about them.<br /><br />In many stores you will find this bar for about $2.40, discounted to $2.11.  Here on the site it's an incredible deal to find the everyday price of $2.09 discounted to $1.67 per bar. I ordered 5 boxes!  I think I'll order another 5-10 (since they'll keep up to 6-7 months) if the sale lasts longer.  Hopefully they'll go on sale again.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the chocolate flavored version, since I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but if you are (as is one of my friends), they said the chocolate version is just as good.<br /><br />I hope this company keeps making these for years to come!
