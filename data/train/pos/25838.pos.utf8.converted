About 5 years ago I discovered the "secret" to better baking -- parchment paper.  This little kitchen miracle worker makes baking so much easier and healthier.  No more having to grease cookie sheets or clean up the mess from a pecan pie that "bubbled over" when cooking.  A piece of parchment paper does the trick while keeping unecessary fats and calories out of your foods!<br /><br />The one problem with parchment paper is the variety you find in most stores is 1)  Expensive and 2)  bleached with chemicals.  "If You Care" has solved both of those problems in this 4-pack of parchment paper that your kitchen will love (hint:  it also makes a GREAT gift for a friend who is into cooking -- trust me!).  For the price you will pay for 4 boxes of this parchment paper you will get over 8 times as much as you would have gotten in the grocery store!  Plus you can rest easy knowing you aren't harming the environment by using paper that was bleached (can someone tell me what the purpose is to bleaching parchment paper -- it just seems silly!)<br /><br />I can't stop recommending this paper enough.  This is my 4th purchase from Amazon over the years of this exact same paper and while you may think that 4 boxes is a lot -- trust me, it will get used!  Once you discover how much easier it makes cooking you will be using it for everything!
