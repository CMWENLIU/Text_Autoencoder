I quote the word "instant" because, to the uninitiated, it might come as a shock that you actually have to boil the noodles rather than simply soak them in boiling hot water.  The preparation time is still very quick, and it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />These noodles are far thicker and chewier than your standard supermarket Top Ramen noodles.  They also come with a spice package and a dry ingredients packet that contains bits of seaweed, mushrooms, and carrots.<br /><br />I usually only put in about 3/4 of the spice package and add extra ingredients like nappa cabbage, shrimp, scallops, green onions, mung bean sprouts, and/or an egg.  Kimchi also goes really well with these noodles.<br /><br />The bulk price that Amazon offers is an excellent deal, especially for people who don't have access to Asian supermarkets.  It's the perfect food to have for when you want a quick and flavorful meal.
