I have a 2.5-year-old female boxer with terrible allergies. She scratches, rubs and bites herself raw. She is miserable and uncomfortable all the time and if you've had a dog with problems like this, you know how hard it is to watch her suffer like that. I've tried the vet's prescription formula dog food (at $60 for a 15 lb. bag, yikes!) and other limited ingredient diets, fatty acid supplements in her food, antihistamines, steroids (which have nasty side effects so she can't really take them anymore), plus medicated shampoos multiple times a week and antibiotics for the infections that develop in her scratching-induced wounds. Sure, there are moments of, "Hey, she's starting to look a little better," but none of it really seems to help. Other grain-free formulas showed some improvement in the first few weeks then fizzled and she was back to her mostly itchy self.<br /><br />The first time I have ever seen my dog without any scabs or big red gashes was three weeks after I started her on Blue Buffalo Wilderness (Salmon) with a small amount of a liquid Omega-3 supplement (Welactin) on top. The bald patches where she had scratched out her hair slowly began to grow back in and I found that I was not constantly telling her to stop scratching or biting herself. BIG IMPROVEMENTS! The environmental aspect of her allergies is now also successfully controlled with occasional prescription antihistamines.<br /><br />Some say this food is too expensive but in my opinion it is more than worth the cost. In fact, I am actually saving money compared to the cost of all the vet visits and medication that hardly even worked. My little girl will be on Blue Buffalo Wilderness from now on. I just bought a bag of the duck recipe so hopefully she likes the taste of that too.
