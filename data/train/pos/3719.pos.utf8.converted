My wife and I shared our first can of The Switch tonight with dinner. First we noticed the size of the can. It's just a bit shorter than a Coke can, and about half as big around. The pop top worked well, opened very easily. We enjoyed The Switch black cherry drink with our meal of baked tilapia, steamed zucchini, and a wonderful homemade tomato broth with tortellini and sausage.<br /><br />The color of the drink was quite pleasing. We joked that it looked like a sparkling rose' with a hint of amber. We swirled our drinks and inhaled the bouquet. We noticed there were no artificial odors. It smelled faintly like a fruit juice of some sort--though no distinct whiff of cherry.<br /><br />The carbonation was light, but not too light. For us it was just right. The flavor reminded me of the black cherry sodas we had at home when I was growing up--just a tiny bit lighter and a bit less sweet. All in all, this was a pleasant drink, tasted fine, and contained nothing more than some fruit juice concentrates, water, and ascorbic acid. We both enjoyed it.
