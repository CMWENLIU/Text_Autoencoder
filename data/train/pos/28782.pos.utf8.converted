Love these because you can store the box in a cupboard -- no wasted refrigerator space -- and still have a good / quick meal ingredient.<br /><br />My husband loves these as a light lunch or evening side dish served with butter and grated cheese. I love them in soup, especially a simple chicken broth soup -- to which I add a bit of black pepper, dill, and lemon juice.<br /><br />The DaVinci tortellini are aso great.
