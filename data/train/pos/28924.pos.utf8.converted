...it will last you a very long time.  I use it almost daily and my last bottle lasted over a year!  I use a drop or two (dropper is included in cap) and mix it up thoroughly with whatever I'm eating but, honestly, I would not recommend that for most people.  Actually, I don't think I could recommend this product unless you have "graduated" through the ranks of chili extracts.  If you've tried Da' Bomb, Dave's Insanity, or Blair's "a.m. series" and you're ready for the next step, then most definitely order The Source.  If not, start with one of those (or a lesser hot sauce even).  Your taste buds, or what's left of them, will thank you.
