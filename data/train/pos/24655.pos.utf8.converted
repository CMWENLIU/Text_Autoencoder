If you have never tried Millet you are in for a very pleasant surprise. Millet has been around for a very long time but fell out of favor in American diets long ago. It's a shame because millet is one of the most complete nutritional foods available. It is low fat, has low/no gluten, very low allergic - ie easy to digest making it the perfect choice for many that have allergies to other grain forms and is packed full of vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids like methione that are rarely found in other grains but critical to normal functioning.<br /><br />Millet can be cooked like a hot cereal with a tad of honey added in the morning, added to rice or other grains to make a pilaf type dish, ground for breads or added whole to cold cereal, muesli and other forms. This is a nice starter set for those trying it for the first time, comes in re-sealable bags and is delicious.<br /><br />Millet remains a major source of nutrition in many nations and for those that think they have a memory of millet but not sure where/how...it is those main little round seeds found in bird food mix. This is a clean, organic form rather than agricultural quality.<br /><br />Stores easily, lasts a long time, Packs a punch when it comes to nutrition. Makes a great food for emergency preparenedness since is cost effective, super nutrious and easy to cook with in a variety of forms.
