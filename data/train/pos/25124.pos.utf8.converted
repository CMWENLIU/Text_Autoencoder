I thought I was going to have to give up granola once I went gluten free.  The other granolas I tried, well, let just say they tasted like they should be 'good for me'.  Udi's GF Granola is light years better that all other GF granolas: crunchy and stightly sweet.<br />Purchasing note - you do get 6 bags of granola.  I ordered the subscription and used the discount code UDISO3II (list about 1/2 down from the top of the page) and got almost $9.00 off.
