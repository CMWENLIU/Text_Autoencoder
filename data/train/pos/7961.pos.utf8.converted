These seeds are best ground fresh as you use them, but I grind up a cup at a time and store it in a jar in my freezer and sprinkle it on fruit, ice cream, applesauce etc. I have even sprinkle it on my pasta when making vegan spaghetti and meatballs! I bake with the seeds whole and have been experimenting with adding them to things like peanut butter cookies, rhubarb cobbler.
