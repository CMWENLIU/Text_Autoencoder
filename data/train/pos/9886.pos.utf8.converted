I ordered, asking the fruits to be delivered four days later, and Ethan's Garden confirmed this quickly over email. The fruits arrived at the right time and in mint condition...I mean berry condition. They were of great quality and came with tasting suggestions and planting instructions. The berries are said to go bad after a few days, but they also come with freezing instructions.<br /><br />I did get conflicting shipping information from Amazon after placing my order, but it all happened just like the description said it would, and the delivery was made on the right day. Shipping was already included in the price.<br /><br />You might balk at the price, but assuming the berries truly go bad so quickly, if you want fresh berries, you're going to have to pay for overnight shipping, so it's definitely worth it. And I was very satisifed with the overall level of service from Ethan's Garden. If you want to order miracle fruit online, I doubt anyone could do it better!
