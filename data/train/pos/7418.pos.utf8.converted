Okay, these things are horrible...when you drink the entire bottle. I wondered why sometimes they worked wonders and other times they nearly killed me (by nausea).<br /><br />Unlike other energy drinks, these are harsh. You must eat something before you drink it and you MUST NOT drink the entire bottle in one sitting. If you do, you may feel tired and sick! You can however, drink the whole bottle in a day, just wait a couple hours before you drink the second serving and you will be good to go.<br /><br />These things also taste great (at least to me). They are tart and have a refreshing kick (the triple berry flavor).<br /><br />Easy steps for maximum effect:<br /><br />-Eat a mid-sized snack or meal<br />-Drink only HALF the bottle<br />-Enjoy the high<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone suffering from the devastating effects of accounting classes!!
