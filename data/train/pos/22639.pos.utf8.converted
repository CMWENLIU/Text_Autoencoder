This rice is so delicious, cooks very quickly and is long and kind of has a noodle flavor. Cooked in chicken broth it is like chicken and stars soup, only much better. I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the rice. It needs lots of rinsing, rise under cold water in a sieve till the water runs clear not white cloudy, but I have always washed my rice since learning that from a sushi chef, years ago. This gets top ratings in my book and I will buy again.
