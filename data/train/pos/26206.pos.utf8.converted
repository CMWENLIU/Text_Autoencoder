Just came back from Spain and was reading The New Spanish Table by Anya von Bremzen. She had a sidebar where she raved about Ventresca Tuna (of course, what she was eating was specially canned for Chef Juan Mari Arzak, the Spanish heavy hitter.) But after she raved on and on, I decided to see what the hoo-ha was about. So I bought a can. And it made just about every other canned tuna I'd ever tasted seem like cat food. This stuff is the real deal.
