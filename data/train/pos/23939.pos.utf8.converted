We first discovered chai lattes on one of our trips. When we got home, we started looking for a way to make it ourselves. We went through a bunch of brands before finding Celestial Seasonings Original Indian Teahouse. This stuff is the best. Great aroma, better flavor, and strong enough to hold its taste when mixed with soy milk. Add a banana and you've got a light, flavorful, well-balanced breakfast. We mix the tea in batches so it's ready when we want it.<br />Here's our recipe: 4 cups water, one box Celestial Seasonings India Tea House chai microwaved on high for 7 minutes and left to steep 6-24 hours. Remove the teabags, squeezing the liquid from them so you have 3 cups of concentrated chai. Heat in microwave 1 to 1-1/2 minutes on high, add one cup honey. Combine two cups of chai with a half-gallon of soy milk and voila! Chai soy latte on demand.
