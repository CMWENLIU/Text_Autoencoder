Rooibos tea is "sweeter" than other teas.  I just use a little honey to flavor it.  This tea is very good, I even make 2nds with it.  A nice caffeine-free break from green tea.  Sometimes I will have green in the morning and this before bed.<br /><br />Davidson's used to be very slow on their delivery, but my last 2 orders have arrived ahead of schedule.  Much improved.<br /><br />The product comes in a plain brown bag, but I quickly put it into a sealed container so that is not a problem.
