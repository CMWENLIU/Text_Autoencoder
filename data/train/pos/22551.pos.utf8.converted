Firstly, I have been using this specific deodorant for 4 years. I originally started using it when other products started to give me an under arm rash, I noticed this one said for "sensitive skin" so I gave it a try. Since I have been using it I have not got any more rash or redness. It has a nice, pleasant smell and is not overpowering. Actually, it is rather unnoticeable until you are actually perspiring, which is what I think deodorant should do. Like another reviewer stated, if I want to have a stronger smell, I will use cologne or body spray.<br /><br />Since I have used it for 4 years I have not lost one shirt to this deodorant... it does not stain. I thought I should mention this since another reviewer stated it stained all his shirts. Maybe he got a bad batch or has some sort of chemical imbalance...<br /><br />In summary, if you have sensitive skin and or other deodorants have been bothering you with there wild smells, give this stuff a try.
