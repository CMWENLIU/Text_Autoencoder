My milk supply began to decrease significantly after I started back to work (my son was about six month's old at this time). I took -- and still take, 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day. If I am not able to pump, I add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more, to keep my milk supply going strong. This is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished, if stress, schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way! Five stars for fenugreek (and blessed thistle, too!) As a side note, the lactation nurses have told me, that these herbs do lower your blood sugar, so they should be taken with food. I say that from experience. All in all, it more than met my expectations.
