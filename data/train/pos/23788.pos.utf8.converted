I bought lucuma when I went to Lima, Peru and thought I could never get it anywhere fresh but there. Until I gave Navitas Naturals a shot. The price was reasonable, and I love to put a spoonful in my smoothies. This stuff could have come right from where I used to get it because it is the same and is so fresh. Try lucuma ice cream if you have an ice cream maker, or put it in your smoothies like me. If you like lucuma, Navitas is a good brand to get it.
