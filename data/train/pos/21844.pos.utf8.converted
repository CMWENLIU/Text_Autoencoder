I drink a lot of tea, and over the years I have done my own research. Inevitably, I discovered matcha, its abundant health benefits and its ease of preparation. Few who are not avid tea enthusiasts or those who don't drink high quality teas for their staggering health benefits, or gift of wellness, might not favor the taste of matcha. However, for the majority, matcha honestly does not taste bad, and if you disagree, just add some sweetness to it, like some agave, honey, lemon, stevia, or sugar. You could even mix up the condiments to create your own nirvana for your taste buds. Anyways, through all my searching for organic matcha, SerendipiTea offers the best price, and consistent availability I've seen yet!<br /><br />Thanks SerendipiTea :)
