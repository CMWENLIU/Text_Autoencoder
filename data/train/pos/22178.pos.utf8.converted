YOU ONLY NEED ONE DROP...count it - ONE.  Maybe two in a large portion of anything.  It flavors...more than sweetens (hard to describe) like sugar - but it is more of an after taste of sweetness...which is not bad...give it a try - especially if you need to avoid sugar.  It is really different, but good different - use a light hand and you won't be sorry.  Use too much and you'll get too much sweetness - I guarantee.  Good for diabetics or people who want to avoid sugar.  Great in tea or coffee or anything.  I even put in in cottage cheese.  The possibilities are endless.  If deciding to cook with it - do look up how to do that - I do not know.
