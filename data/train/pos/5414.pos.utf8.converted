We love the Byzatine Country Olives, 5-Pound Unit but admit that we love the Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Unit even more. Because I'm not usually fond of too much rosemary, I doubted that I'd like these as much, but I was oh so wrong! The assorted olives, garlic and red peppers are heightened by the large caperberries which I've rinsed off and deposited into a martini on occasion. This is a lovely assortment of Greek olives, each having its own unique texture and taste. If you are an olive lover, I think you'll enjoy this selection which arrives in a vacuum sealed package inside a cardboard box. As soon as I open a bag, I transfer the olives into very clean jars and share them with friends. I also add olive oil in some of the jars because there's not much liquid surrounding the olives. I also keep a jar for the mixologist to use, free of added oil.
