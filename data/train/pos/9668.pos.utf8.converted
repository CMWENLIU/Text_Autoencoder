I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar. These Twisted Fruit ropes are a "whole" other story. They are Organic and provide ONE FULL Serving of Fruit! Each one is 70 calories and best of it, they are satisfying. And I love its dense, chewy texture. It's SO GOOD that I enjoy it as much as my children do ! So far, I have had the pleasure of trying the strawberry, sour apple, and tropical fruit twists. I love them all although the sour apple is indeed "sour". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children. I just wish that they were less expensive but I can see how they cost more to produce so I am willing to pay more to get a better, more nutritious fruit snack ! Btw, Amazon has the best prices on these esp. if you "subscribe and save". They are not yet readily available and at my Whole Foods Supermarket, they sell for 99 cents EACH !
