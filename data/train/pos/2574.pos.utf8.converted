Honey production is good for the rainforest. This kind of low-impact use is something that we need to support! I use this honey for sweetening almost anything that I used to sweeten with sugar. For a 6 pack of Organic Honey this is a deal! I paid $8 for one bottle of organic honey the last time that I bought it.
