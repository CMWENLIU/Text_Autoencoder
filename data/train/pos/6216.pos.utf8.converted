My 2 yr old has a wheat intolerance and even the baby rice cereal from Gerber has lots of additives she doesn't do well with. Cream Of Rice is just plain ol rice, imagine that. Found it in ONE store here in Austin but it is the Mexican version... glad to find it on Amazon. It's getting too hard to find anymore!!! A little maple syrup and she is as HAPPY girl.
