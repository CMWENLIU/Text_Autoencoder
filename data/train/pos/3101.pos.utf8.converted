It is awesome to find a product still exists from when you were a child.  Quaker Oats Grits have been around for quite some time and are still as wonderful as ever.  These grits do take 45 minutes of cooking time and stirring, however, the outcome is well worth the time and trouble.  These oldfashioned grits, I think, are much better than the quick variety.  I believe that once you try them, you will not return to the quick grits.
