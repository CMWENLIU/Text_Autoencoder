Splenda is a fantastic substitute for sugar.  Since I became diabetic, I had a hard time finding a sweetener I could use.  I didn't like saccharine, and aspartame gave me headaches.  Splenda tastes just like sugar to me, with no headaches!<br /><br />But $30.00 list price for a bag of Splenda?  No way.  You can get this same bag at Sam's or Walmart for around $7.
