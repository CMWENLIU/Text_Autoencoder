In remote Alaska we never get deliveries of fresh milk. Unless you have milking goats out here you'll never have fresh milk. This canned milk is a great alternative to fresh milk. It's much thicker, but perfect for baking when watered down. It's great for mixing with fresh berries, drinks like coffee and hot chocolate, and cereal. The taste is much sweeter than normal milk so kids usually really like it. It's perfect for camping and tastes good warm or chilled. I suggest trying it mixed into coffee or with frozen berries.<br /><br />Taste: 5 out of 5<br />Child-Friendliness: 5 out of 5<br />Usefullness: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Great things to try it with:<br />Hot drinks<br />Making milkshakes<br />Baking (when watered down)<br />Cereal<br />Fruit and Berries<br />Chocolate Milk
