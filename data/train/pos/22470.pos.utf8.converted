I was diagnosed with high triglycerides. The Nutritionist told me that I had to drastically cut my carbs. I love pancakes, but was never able to find a low carb mix that I liked. Then I found Big Train Buttermilk Pancake Mix. I love it. So do all my friends. I serve it to people who don't have any carb issues and they can't believe it's not "the real stuff". Big Train is the only pancake mix I buy now. I give it my highest recommendation.
