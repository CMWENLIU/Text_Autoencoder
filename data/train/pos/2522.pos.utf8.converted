I have a dog who is a very picky eater. I'd been giving her homecooked meals for about three weeks, but the vet said that I should get her something more nutritionally balanced and more geared towards canines. I got this one because it looked like it had good ingredients (i.e. the first ingredient isn't corn meal) and it was a reasonable price. Normally, my dog won't eat dry food for nearly two days (no joke) after she's had homecooked and/or wet food. To my pleasant surprise, she started eating the food within 24 hours. She's been on it for a couple of weeks now and she doesn't seem tired of it.
