I have to admit I'm addicted to this Green Mountain flavor of coffee! It's smooth, rich and not an overwhelming flavored coffee. It's what I would describe as a medium bodied coffee, not weak and definitely not got that bitter bite that strong coffees have. The aroma is wonderful and peaks your taste bud's interest even before the first sip! Be warned though, once you try it you may not want to drink any other coffee again.
