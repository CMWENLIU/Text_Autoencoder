If you like pralines, you'll love these!  Only, they have less sugars and no butter in them.<br /><br />I was diagnosed with Celiac disease less than a year ago and used to feel very deprived of most of what I liked for snacks, until I discovered Oskri products.<br />My first order of Pecan Cinnamon Crunch came this week and I like these the best of all the products. (They aren't low fat, though, so that's a different<br />issue.)  I don't feel deprived anymore when everyone else is eating their cookies or candy bars.
