What impresses me first off about this brand "food should taste good" is the fact it is an all natural brand.  They do not use preservatives, trans fats, they are gluten free, Certified Kosher, no Genetic modification etc.  What is even better about all that is it sacrifices all the unhealthy without sacrificing flavor.<br /><br />** CHOCOLATE TORTILLA ** (6oz bags) [5 stars]<br />These Tortilla chips I just had to try.. I mean chocolate Tortilla chips!?  Rather then getting an explosion of sweet sugary chocolate you get this nice, soft subtle taste of chocolate with each crunch of the chip.  These clearly aren't meant for salsa and in fact the back of the bag suggested  to sprinkle them in vanilla ice-cream or better yet... warm the chips up slightly to bring out the flavor.  Both suggestions worked great.  In fact I prefer these to chocolate chips in my ice cream and they probably are far healthier<br /><br />The chips are rectangular in shape and are delightful to eat.  They make for a perfect snack or to help enhance an existing snack; or satisfy the chocoholic in you<br /><br />Definitely a 5 star product with 5 star quality taste.<br /><br />** JALAPENO TORTILLA ** (1.5oz bags) [5 stars]<br />The Jalapeno tortilla chips are outstanding!  I'm a fan of spicy food so I had to test these out for myself.  The chips do not smell spicy at all which means they are spiced properly (not overloaded).  Upon first bite you might not taste much but that is when this chip gets you.  Very quickly a subtle jalapeno flavor kicks in with a bit of nice spice that isn't to overpowering.<br /><br />With the added kick of the chips these would go perfect with a nice mild salsa.  The chips are crispy and fresh, with that nice subtle spice lingering on your taste-buds for a good few minutes so a small 1.5oz bag will last you some time and allow you to savor the flavor.
