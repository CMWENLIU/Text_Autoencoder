This tea is great. I like the taste. It helps with constipation too. But what I really found helpful about this tea is calming my PMDD. My PMS was getting really out of hand. I was getting to the point where I could hardly function during my pre menstural. When I drink this tea regularly it's incredible the difference I see. Really helps me with my irritability and bloating. This tea has become a necessity for me.
