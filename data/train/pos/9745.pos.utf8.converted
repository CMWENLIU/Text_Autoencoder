Because I'm a vegetarian it's a little tricky getting those highly touted omega-3s in my diet so I'm always happy to find food source that does the job.  This tasty granola contains flax seeds (hence the omega-3s) and a veritable cornucopia of whole grains including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, brown rice and buckwheat, but no wheat so it's gluten-free.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  It does have evaporated cane juice and molasses, but a one third cup serving only has 6 grams of sugar. That same serving size has 5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, 130 calories and only 3.5 grams of fat and 20 mg of sodium so unless you overdo it, and because it is delicious that's possible, it's a guilt-free food.  It's great straight out of the bag, or with milk or (my favorite) yogurt.  There are several other flavors and they all sound good so I know I'll be checking them out too.  Since there's no honey or dairy I believe this would be good for vegans.
