Just got these for the first time, and hope they stay on subscribe & save. They are great just by themselves, am still experimenting to see what toppings I prefer on them compared with rice crackers. I don't particularly like regular porridge-type oatmeal, but love the taste of oats - so these are perfect for me. I used to make oat crackers myself (just whizzing up oat flour in the blender from rolled oats or buying it, adding enough water and optional oil/salt to work it, flattened and baked) but these are much better than anything I made. The texture is a little crumbly when you eat them but they still stay together as a cracker and it isn't hard to spread things on them (such as nut or seed butters, peanut butter, etc.).<br /><br />They come in 4 individual packets within the box (7 crackers in each), which can be helpful in keeping them fresh and also transporting them for a handy snack. I just put the remainder of a packet in a small container. They're quite filling - 91 calories, 2.3 g fiber, 2.3 g protein for 2 crackers. They're also big. about 2.5 inches in diameter.
