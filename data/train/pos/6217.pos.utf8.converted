I've tried many GF noodles.  I was a fan of Tinkyada until I tried this Schar's product.  Everyone in the family (gluten free and not gluten free) found Schar's to taste most like 'real' spaghetti noodles.  The color is like an egg noodle, but the taste is like regular noodles.  I also like that it takes less time to cook than Tinkyada.
