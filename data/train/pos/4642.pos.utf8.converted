I first had Blue Plate mayonnaise years ago when I was traveling for my job. I was in the South, at a restaurant. I had a sandwich, and the mayo on it was SO GOOD. I asked the waitress what kind of mayo it was, and she told Blue Plate. Not living in the South at the time, I couldn't buy it at the store, but never forgot it. When I moved to the Florida Panhandle (L.A. - Lower Alabama) they had it there, and I was in heaven. Now in West-Central Florida, it's not in the stores here, but I was excited to find it on Amazon. I'll never use anything else again!
