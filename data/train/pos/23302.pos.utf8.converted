I randomly bought this at a grocery store one day and absolutely LOVED it. I put this in all kinds of recipes (even mac & cheese) and it works miracles. It's THE BEST! I always use a lot of spices in my food, but this is the only one that I actually find myself craving at times. When I only had a couple teaspoons left I added it to my Parmesan shaker and it is heavenly that way as well.
