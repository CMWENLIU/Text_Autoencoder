I have a 20lb pug and had bought a similar product for medium size dogs. He chewed them up in about 2 min, not very useful for cleaning his teeth. Many people had said that the dog bites off big chunks at a time. SO what i did was bought the bag for Large dogs (same price or may have been a few cents less actually) and i cut them in half. They are a bit thicker so it takes him a long time to chew them up and this way you get TWICE as many. He LOVES them and they don't upset his tummy which is great because almost anything does.
