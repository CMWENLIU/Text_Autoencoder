This is such a delicious cocoa powder. My skin has never been better since I started using this cocoa powder. The key is that is NOT "Dutched" with alkali. Most of the cocoa powders out there have been proceesed with alkali to remove the acids and make the cocoa taste "better". The problem (undisclosed by purveyors of mass cocoa) is that the alkali Dutching removes a significant portion of the antioxidants. Dutched cocoa powders are less robust but will not deliver the same health benefits. Rapunzel is good value and top in its class.
