Red raspberry leaf tea has a long tradition as a tonic for all women. This tea tones the uterus making the monthly cycle easier and also helping achieve positive outcomes for pregnancy, labor and delivery.<br /><br />Of course I can't make medical recommendations.<br /><br />However from my own personal use I can tell you this tea tastes OK and helps me with my monthly cycle. Without it, I am finding myself take up to 600 mg of ibuprofen every few hours. With it, I can be without pain and without pills.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this tea in the winter is to pour 8 oz. of boiling water over the tea bag. Let it steep, covered (so it doesn't cool off) for 10 minutes (15 minutes for a stronger brew). In the summer, just pour over ice and sip as a chilled drink. Very refreshing.<br /><br />Happy sipping!
