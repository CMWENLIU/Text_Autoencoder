This mix makes absolutely delicious pancakes. For wheat-sensitive and gluten-sensitive people, this mix is a Godsend. We make these most weekends as a treat.<br /><br />Now, it is true that this mix doesn't, out of the bag as directed, make a good waffle. But don't let that stop you. Waffles have different requirements than pancakes. They need more leavening (air) and more fat. So we use real melted butter in the batter and do not stint on this (if you are not a butter eater, use an oil.) And for the eggs, this hint is invaluable. Take the time to separate the eggs. Beat in the yolks as you make the batter but have beaten the WHITES separately to stiff or almost-stiff peaks. Then at the end, fold in the whites in the batter. This adds "oomph" to the batter and keeps the waffles from being overly heavy. We do use a flip-able waffle iron and this also keeps the waffles light, as does a Belgian (deep) style waffler. The thinner German or American style waffles come out less good. I have done extensive trials with both styles of waffler and with beaten egg white and we find that this gives a wonderful waffle. We actually prefer this mix to standard pancake mix (one of us is wheat-sensitive, but we both enjoy these.)
