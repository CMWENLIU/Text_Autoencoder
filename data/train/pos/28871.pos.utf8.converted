This is my favorite candy, but impossible to find. There's also "Munch" bars that are the exact same thing, but nearly as good as those use the shells. This is an addictive candy. The only thing is they made the bars smaller- about 20% then before. Also a little expensive at $18+ with shipping. The bars themselves are outstanding and addictive though.
