I'm pretty much a coffee snob and don't care for most of the choices offered for K-cups.  After trying the San Fracisco Bay French Roast I don't think I'll be able to go back to any of the other K-cups!  It tastes so much fresher than the others and has a rich flavor that beats most gourmet coffee at the high-end shops.  Try it if you like real coffee.
