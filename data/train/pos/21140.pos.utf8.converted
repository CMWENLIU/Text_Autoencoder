This is, by far, the best bread machine mix I have ever tried. Thank goodness Amazon carries it because most of the grocery stores in my area have hardly anything on the shelves anymore when it comes to bread mixes like this. The price is very reasonable compared to what is sold in stores with all the preservatives that come with them.
