I remember the first day they began marketing this particular Hamburger Helper variety. I remember it well. I remember I couldn't sleep the night before, due to my overwhelming anticipation to taste this new variety. I ended up sitting on the sofa in complete silence until my local supermarket opened up at 9:00.<br /><br />Got home in a hurry and went straight for the hamburger I had defrosted the night before, and without a split-second worth of hesitation, I ripped the Hamburger Helper carton asunder. When the pasta is finally cooked, they tell you that the "Sauce will thicken as it stands."<br /><br />Well, this is where my story gets interesting. I had become simply fed up with the man getting me down with all his rules and laws..."psssht," I thought. "I'll eat my Hamburger Helper HOW and WHEN I want, and no one will tell me otherwise. I have since decided to take a journey of introspection, wandering the country, a lone vagabond with only one desire--to eat the very BEST of boxed dinners. You just might see me in your neighborhood park one evening, sitting down to enjoy a tasty meal of Hamburger Helper prepared on my trusty camp stove. You're welcome to join me.
