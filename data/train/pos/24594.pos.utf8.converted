I was a little hesitant to get this because all too often, these things lack in flavor or texture, if not both.  The batter was thicker than I'd expected and kind of oozed slowly out of the mixing bowl.  You can tell as it hits the pan that it isn't going to get any fluffier.  The box says to cut and serve after they're cool, but of course- who can wait?  We gave them a few minutes and had them warm.  Wonderfully chewy with a hint of gooey, and they tasted just like brownies made with oodles of sugar.  I will definitely be making these again!
