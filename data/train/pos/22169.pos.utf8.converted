We absolutely LOVE these.  I hate to admit it, but we eat these chips every single day!  My son is on a GFCF diet, so this is one of the few chocolate chips he can eat.  I add them to his snack mix daily, and he also eats them alone as "candy".  I eat just as much as he does.  I haven't baked with them yet, because the bag doesn't last long enough for me to cook with them.  We eat them right out of the bag and they don't last long.  I'll continue to buy these.
