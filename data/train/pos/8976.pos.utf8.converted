My Mom would buy me and my sister a box of Chocolate Pop-Tarts each.  My lovely sister, would eat her pop-tarts immediately, while I would wait till the weekend to eat mine (because I wanted to savor them.)  On Saturday morning, I would sit down to eat my pop-tarts and my sister would complain because she had no pop-tarts.  I tried to explain to my Mom that the reason she had no pop-tarts is because she had already eaten all of hers and that this box of goodness was mine.  Mom didn't care and made me share my pop-tarts with my little sister.  The sad fact is this didn't happen once or twice, it happened all the time.<br /><br />I'm now a grown up and I send my sister pop-tarts for her birthday.  The story isn't really a review but more a testomony to the greatness of Chocolate Pop-Tarts.  Be a kid again and order you a box or send some to someone you shared your childhood with
