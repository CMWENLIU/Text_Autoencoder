I will start by saying I can't drink anything else made by Crystal Light since artificial sweeteners disagree with me. So I was hesitant to try this, but with the disclaimers I decided to go for it.<br /><br />I must say that this is a very satisfying drink and solved my quest to get away from the more expensive drinks and sodas. Crystal light sure has scored a hit with a new, tasty drink with this one.<br /><br />My picky kids like it also, and that says a lot.
