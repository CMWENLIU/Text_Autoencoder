Like so many others, I had this tea on my first visit to Ireland.<br /><br />After my first cup, I thought, "this is pretty good!"<br /><br />After my second cup later, I thought, "this is pretty darn good."<br /><br />The next day I bought a box to take home.<br /><br />Then I started asking friends and co-workers to bring an extra suitcase on their trips to Ireland...<br /><br />Over the next 20 years I heard the same story from many others here, "I asked a friend to bring an extra suitcase..."<br /><br />I'm really happy that this tea is available here now, and my wife and I travel nowhere without bringing a sufficient supply of Barry's, as it really brightens our day in a way that is unmatched by any other tea (or coffee for that matter).<br /><br />This is the "tea bag" version, so some loose leaf tea drinkers may suspect that the bags are filled with floor sweepings, as seems to be the case with many other tea bags.<br /><br />Not so, this is the good stuff (although if you want the hassle, you can get this in loose-leaf).<br /><br />I prepare it in a Krups coffee maker (this and a few others have the correct water temperature), set a timer for 6 minutes in good water (Brita faucet filtered, which beats bottled Mountain Spring water for taste, really, and costs $0.10 per gallon).<br /><br />Don't follow my example and be led into a life-long addiction, stay away from this tea!<br /><br />:O)
