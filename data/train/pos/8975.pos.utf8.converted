This was the first Wine kit that I made. I have made many more after this but it is still one of the best.<br /><br />I sweetened the wine before bottling because it's very dry. The wine needs to sit about 90 days after bottling. I would say that this is like a $20-$25 bottle of wine.<br /><br />I am ordering other kit.
