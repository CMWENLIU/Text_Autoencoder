I have never purchased wheat berries to grind into flour before. I did my research to make sure I could handle the task well. Before milling this wheat I took out a cup full at a time and examined it carefully for dirt, stone, bugs, etc. This grain was perfect! It was pristine clean, no rocks or dirt, and no bugs. I was super pleased and then I milled the grain into a wonderful flour and baked up a loaf of bread that rose beautifully and tastes like a million bucks! So very happy with this wheat. I will be purchasing more very soon!
