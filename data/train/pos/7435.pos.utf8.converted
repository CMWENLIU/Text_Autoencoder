So misunderstood! A little TLC is needed, but Billington's is well worth the time! It quite often arrives hard. The solution: Place the unwrapped sugar in an airtight canister, slightly moisten a clean, folded (larger than the container opening) paper towel, place over the canister opening, not touching the sugar, and secure the lid. Come back in 2 to 3 hours, and you have a soft, golden sugar.  Remove the paper towel and store air tight.  It never clumps, is always soft, and absolutely delicious!
