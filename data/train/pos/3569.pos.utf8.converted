I just got this, and usually I wait a while after receiving a product to review it, but I don't think my opinion will change of this nifty little basket.  I really like it a a lot.  Here is why:<br /><br />1. It comfortably holds about 30 k-cups, 15 in each basket.<br /><br />2.  It seems more modern and stylish (maybe just more "my style") than the other k-cup holders I've seen.<br /><br />3.  I was hoping that it wouldn't be too overwhelming to have the k-cups just piled in the baskets, and it isn't.  My mom has a holder with a slot for each k-cup, and that's nice, but I like the look of this one better.  And, I like taking a second (because that's all it takes) to look through the baskets.  It's fun.<br /><br />4.  The legs have little rubber feet at the bottom (non-slipping non-scratching).<br /><br />The only thing I noticed that I don't like is that the legs are a little flimsy if you hold the basket firmly and push down on the counter and move the basket part around.  It would be nice if the legs were a little sturdier.
