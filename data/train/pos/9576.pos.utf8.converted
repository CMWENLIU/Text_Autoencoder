I recently picked up the Aerogarden for my wife since she loves fresh herbs.  The only Herb she didn't like in the package was Dill.  So we replaced the Dill with Oregano and let me say it worked like a charm.  We simply removed the Dill seed from the sponge and put in our Oregano seed.  Normal germination for Oregano is 10 to 20 days.  We had growth after only 3 days using the Aerogarden.  Big Success - Love the Machine.<br /><br />Take Care..
