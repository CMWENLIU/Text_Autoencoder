I received the Real Cinnamon today!  It is really great.  It has a sweet aroma and a noticeably better and milder flavor than the cassia variety.  I ordered this variety for health reasons although I will use it in cooking as well. Cinnamon is known to have therapeutic properties and can act as an anti-inflammatory.  My acupuncturist has recommended that I take 1 tsp 2 x's a day with<br />honey (I'm taking it with agave nectar).  I have read that this variety of cinnamon (True  Cinnamon)<br />is much safer to take for these purposes and is a superior product from what is sold at the local super markets.<br />I am extremely pleased with the products quality.  Indus Organics delivered the cinnamon in a timely manner as well. I will most likely order this product from them again.
