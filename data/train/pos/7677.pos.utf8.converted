This product tastes great to me, and I use it in a lot of different dishes like chili, hot cereal, stew, chili relleno sauce, braised meats, sauces, and on and on.  It adds a certain something to sweet and savory dishes when added as a condiment, and of course your recipe is a secret, for no one can identify the little added flavoring.
