There is nothing in the market place that comes close to Celsius. I was excited to see right on the can that there is NO Sodium Benzoate. Sodium Benzoate, when combined with vitamin C creates Benzene, which is carcinogenic... its practically in everything. No aspartame is huge also. Look at all the energy drinks in the marketplace and look at their ingredients... Celsius is a winner. My workouts have tremendously improved and I don't get the jitters like I was getting from other energy drinks. I no longer need to take my prework out drinks that are loaded with all the junk. The green teas are my favorite, the wildberry, and orange are also very good! Try it! You will love it!
