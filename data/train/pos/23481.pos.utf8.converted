I first received Zatarian's Creole Mustard for my birthday over two decades ago from a friend in New Orleans.  It is unique, not really having a strong mustard taste, almost like a horseradish/mustard if you can imagine.  When their factory was wiped out by a hurricane, they e-mailed customers from a remote location with updates on their facilities, employees & product availability.  I HATE MUSTARD AND NEVER USE IT ON ANYTHING but I LOVE ZATARAIN'S CREOLE MUSTARD unconditionally.  I have carefully packed over a dozen of these bottles in my suitcases when I traveled on business to the region.  Now I purchase a dozen on line at a time.  They keep PERFECTLY for OVER 1 TO 2 OR MORE YEARS beyond the date on the bottle if they have not been opened & the vacuum seal is intact.<br /><br />Try a bottle if you like horseradish or spicy 'dark' mustard you will become addicted to it as I & many others have...
