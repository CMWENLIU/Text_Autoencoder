This is probably the best dog food you can buy at Petsmart. I'd say 95% of all the dog foods at Petsmart are garbage, but this food gets a 4 out of 6. I really like that it does not have corn. My pug loves this food and the kibble is a good size for him. I started out by feeding him Royal Canin puppy 33 and eventually switched him to Pug 25 once he was over 10 months, but I did not like that both had corn and the kibble seemed too big for his size. Since day one he's loved Blue Buffalo. I've heard of some dogs not eating the darker "life source bits", but my dog eats everything. No diarrhea or gas and his poop is firm every time. I'm glad I switched to this food. It is cheaper to buy it at Petsmart than online AND if you go to the Blue Buffalo website you can get a coupon for $5 off. Also, there is a good amount of protein  in this food and works well. Other foods with super high amounts of protein can be too much for certain dogs. Large dogs that are super active would do well on super high protein and calories, but I have a pug and this food works awesome for him.
