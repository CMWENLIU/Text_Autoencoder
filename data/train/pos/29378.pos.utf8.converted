Since I began following <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425204138">The Maker's Diet</a> in order to improve my health, I have been interested in adding kefir as regular part of my daily nutrition.  Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.<br /><br />When I received my package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.<br /><br />When my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!<br /><br />I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.<br /><br />If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait.
