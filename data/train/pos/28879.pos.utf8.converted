as i write this review, i have one of the honeystix in my mouth. look... no hands.<br /><br />taste is good. portion is okay. easy to just eat on its own.<br /><br />you can consume the honeystix while doing a multitude of other things; to name a few... while playing guitar hero on the ps3, while driving to work, and while mowing the lawn.<br /><br />but, it is not recommended to consume the honeystix while smoking, running and falling down the stairs. trust me, i tried.
