Just had this for the first time at PF Chang's in Sacramento yesterday.  I was utterly amazed at how good it is and I am a tough critic, having been a long-time Earl Grey lover.  It's great with food because the taste is light and refreshing; it's also delicious, by the way.  It's perfect for summertime, perfect frosty cold with lots of ice.  And it's real tea, not a powder.  It smells so good I almost want to wear it! Can you tell?  I LOVE this tea!
