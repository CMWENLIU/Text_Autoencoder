This is my second 30-pack of Mi Goreng noodles. The first I bought was BBQ Chicken flavor, and I was seriously impressed with their taste. My roommate and I polished off 30 of them in less than a week, so I just had to grab another case. These (the regular flavor) are quite good, although I do prefer the taste of BBQ Chicken. Each package comes with an adequate amount of noodles and seasoned oil, sweetened soy sauce, chili powder, and sauce mix. The oil and soy sauce packets are horribly designed. Anyone who can open them and squeeze out all of the liquid without getting it all over the place is seriously talented. Very Asia (the company that ships these) is pretty speedy, although these arrived slightly damaged (the sauce packages were busted in a few of the noodles). The BBQ Chicken case I ordered, however, was completely undamaged, so I guess it's hit or miss in that department. Anyway, buy these things. They are delicious and easy, and much better than plain old ramen noodles.
