I was a little hesitant to buy this.  Glad I did; I love this vanilla product.  From hot cereal and smoothies, to coffee and tea and hot chocolate, to baked goods and fresh fruit ... well, just about anything that could benefit from a little sweet richness without any alcohol.  Now I keep a jar of it right next to the salt and pepper, I use it so often.  It isn't fresh vanilla bean, but a close second.  And it doesn't drip! :)
