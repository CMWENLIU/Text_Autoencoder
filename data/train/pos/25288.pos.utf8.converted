You will receive a mixture of the following gels GOLD, STRAWBERRY, GINSENG, BANANA,and CHOCOLATE Honey Stinger Gels.<br />all of the gels include: Honey, pure water, kola nut extract, potassium citrate, malodextrin, Vitamins B3, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B2 and Vitamin B1.<br />I'm writing this review because I was actually wondering what made these gels different from regular honey, and nobody else did.<br /><br />They are good to take on a bike ride, but I've also used spread them on toast in the morning for a quick breakfast. The best part about this product is you don't have to refrigerate them, or have to worry about attracting ants. The packets are well sealed, and I haven't had any problems with storing them in my kitchen cabinets.
