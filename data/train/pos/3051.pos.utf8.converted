In the past, I've had to wake up with a monkey on my back every morning. The knowledge that I would have to go throughout the day, constantly having my jimmies rustled. I've tried to tell my boss about my jimmies, and how he can help them not be rustled, but all he does is laugh it off, rustling me and my jimmies even further. That monkey made my life unbearable.<br /><br />Now, Gorilla Munch has given me a monkey I want on my back. When I first saw this cereal, I knew, I knew that this cereal could keep my jimmies unrustled, and keep me happy. Ever since my first bite, my jimmies feel like they could fly away to a place without rustling. My jimmies have not been rustled since last Thursday.<br /><br />On a more serious note, rustled jimmies have become a worldwide issue. When I had my jimmies rustled, I was not the only one. Across the world, thousands and thousands of people, gorillas, koalas, pandas, penguins, lemurs and coatis have their jimmies rustled by people they thought were their friends.<br /><br />Jimmie rustling needs to be taken to the supreme court. Jimmie rustling needs to have a law, restricting jimmie rustlers from rustling these victims. If you want to help those with rustled jimmies, please buy a box of this cereal.<br /><br />If your wallet has had its jimmies rustled, then please call 1-800-JIM-MIES. Rustlers will be hung up on and reported to the triumverate.
