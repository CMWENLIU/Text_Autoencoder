This is a very healthy option. I like to mix it with cooked quinoa or brown rice and added beans for a healthy lunch. Low sodium of 300 mg (13% RDA), so I can have 2-3 pouches a day if I want. The taste is rather bland by itself, which is a good thing if you're adding it to other foods. I was able to buy in bulk with a subscription and the occasional discount from Chicken of the Sea making my per piece price about 78 cents.
