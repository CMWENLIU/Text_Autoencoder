This is a wonderful sweetener. Great for cooking, making ice cream, etc. Smooth, and good flavor. However, it is best purchased from the producer "Joseph's Lite Cookies" because they do not charge shipping on the product. When purchased through Amazon, they go through CarbSmart and shipping is charged.
