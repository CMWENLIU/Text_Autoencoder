I read the other reviews and really looked forward to trying this tea. It was every bit as good as the other reviewers said. The smell is strong in the tin, but mild when brewed. The mint is still pronounced, but the chocolate is subtle. Really love this tea and will continue to stock it as long as Amazon and Republic of Tea does.
