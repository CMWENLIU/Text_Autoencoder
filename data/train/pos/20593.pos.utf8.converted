I was very pleased with Love 'N Bake Almond Paste.  It was much smoother, more malleable, and more easily incorporated into other ingredients than the stiffer, dryer Odense almond paste I've used before.  The flavor was excellent as well.  The only negative is the packaging.  It has a pull-ring lid, so once it is opened, it cannot be resealed if all the almond paste is not used.  Not a big problem, but it would have been nice if it came with a plastic lid as well.  This is an expensive baking item, but worth the occasional splurge.
