I use 1/4 tsp in my cats wet food. I noticed a HUGE difference within days.  Not only did his coarse hair become super soft and shiny his tummy problem went away.  I bought this because I was at my wits end and spending money on vet bills was adding up.  So I thought I would just change his diet.  I went from commercial food to Evo & Natures Instinct canned and add this. I am so happy that I found something that works (he has was having problems using the bathroom and his feces would get stuck and then he would prolapse it would be so bad)  I am thankful that I found something that works for my little guy and I will keep using this everyday! Would highly recommend!
