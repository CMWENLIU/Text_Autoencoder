I bought this along with the "Baking with Coconut Flour" book by Bruce Fife. The recipes I've made have all come out as expected which is good. My husband can tell when I've made something with coconut flour  and he likes the flavor but my kids who claim to not like coconut don't seem to notice. They gobble it up regardless. I'm also replacing half of the sugar in my recipes with xylitol which further lowers carb count and is easier on blood sugar spikes. I've never used a different brand of coconut flour so I can't compare that way. It does seem expensive but I've never had a recipe call for more than a half cup of flour which makes your purchase last a long time.
