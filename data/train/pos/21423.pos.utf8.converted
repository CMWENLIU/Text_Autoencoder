I found this in a coffee shop and was delightfully surprised.  this is the best coconut tea I have ever had.  Everyone that I give a tea bag to,  wants to buy it.  It is perfect by itself or with cream.  it has just a hint of cocoa - I found it to be more for coconut lovers than chocolate lovers - although my sister in law who is a chocolate nut loved this tea.  Hopefully Amazon will carry this soon because the coffee shop is gone and I am running low...!
