Looks like flour, add some xantham gum when baking, or use it for other recipes, and it is amazing!  This is the BEST GF flour on the market... hands down.  Their pizza and their pancakes are the 100% best, too.  Muffins... not so much.  Lose the nutmeg.  Otherwise, use THIS flour to make your own items.  I just can't seem to get a good pizza out of it.  Everything else is incredible, though!  CONGRATULATIONS KING ARTHUR!  This one rocks!
