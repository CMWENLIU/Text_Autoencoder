The chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free Nana's cookies, though the lemon is pretty good too.  I have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to.  For those of us who have dietary restrictions, it's a different story.<br /><br />It does take a while to get used to gluten free fare, but these cookies are among the best I've had, which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them.  And the fact that they don't have gluten, eggs, nuts, or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes, there are those of us out there allergic to all these things).  I just wish more stores carried them.  But now that I've found them on Amazon, I'll be ordering in bulk. ;)
