I love that Nabisco came out with these.  I love regular Triscuits, but they taste really salty to me.  I even snack on dry Shredded Wheat b/c I like the taste, but want a tiny bit of saltiness.  (Sounds weird, but I'm a Dietitian and it's a healthy snack!)  I was so happy when I tried these Hint of Salt Triscuits.  I was unhappy when my local Kroger stopped selling them!  I can only find them in one small grocery store and they're usually sold out!  Enter Amazon.  Like the reviewer before me I am thrilled with the natural list of ingredients.  I tried another brand that made a triscuit-like cracker and there were at least 20 ingredients and they tasted so weird/fake.  Next I'd like them to make the Reduced Fat Triscuits with a Hint of Salt.  Please Nabisco?
