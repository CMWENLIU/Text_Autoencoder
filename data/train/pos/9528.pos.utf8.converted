I've cooked with coconut oil for a while but I've recently started using it on my skin. I was using another brand of coconut oil and a friend gave me a jar of Nutvia organic coconut oil. The effect it has has on my skin is amazing! I'm over 50 but I'm frequently told how good my skin looks and the skin on my body is so soft and smooth! I use it from head to toe and it has replaced all other moisturizers for me. No more expensive face creams or body lotions! I enjoy the light scent of coconut and I still cook with it as well. I love this product
