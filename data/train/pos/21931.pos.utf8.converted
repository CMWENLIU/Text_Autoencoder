These are fantastic.  They taste kind of like Munchos (remember those?) but with only 100 calories and one gram of fat for a full, completely-satisfying-sized bag.  They take care of my potato chip / salt craving no problem, and seriously rival regular chips -- none of that fake, baked chip texture or the gastro problems that come with fat free chips.  Highly recommended for dieters or if you're just looking to eat a little more healthily.
