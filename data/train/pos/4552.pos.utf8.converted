I bought this recently to add to my homemade laundry detergent powder so I could eliminate the need for a vinegar rinse. I love making my own detergent; it is actually a lot of fun and so easy! The next thing I will use this stuff for is homemade dishwasher detergent. I love that it can be used for cleaning products as well as for food use! I can sprinkle some on fruits after slicing to prevent early browning, etc. This citric acid could also be used in homemade beverages. This large 5-lb container was the best bang for my buck online. I won't run out for a while!
