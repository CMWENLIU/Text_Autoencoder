I have used this product now for a number of years.  If you do alot of cooking and always need vegetable or chicken stock, this is all natural, no MSG(like alot of broths on the shelves), and is fantastic!!!!!  You only need 1 tsp. for 8oz. water,so its a great deal! Think about switching, you'll be glad you did,I promise!
