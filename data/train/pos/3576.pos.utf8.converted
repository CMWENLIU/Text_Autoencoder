I'm going to ride on the previous reviewer's comments - with the exception that I use it for baking, but use 1/2 Zero and 1/2 original sugar requirements.  I don't notice any cooling and it makes the baked items easier for me to handle (less insulin, I'm a diabetic).<br /><br />So far I've made pumpkin spice cookies, banana nut bread and gingerbread cookies this way and it tastes fine in all of them.
