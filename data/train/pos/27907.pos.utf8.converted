The sharkbanana is an amazing piece of work. While, as you'd expect, the shark is stitched inside the banana, I can tell you, from personal experience, that if you manage to play with your Sharkbanana too hard and the stitching rips out, you too might be shocked to find, THERE IS A WHOLE SHARK PLUSHIE IN THERE. That is what I call attention to detail. So rather than being, as some might describe it, half-shark, half-banana, it's actually whole-shark, whole-banana [peel]. And each piece is fun. Protip: insert a shot glass into the stuffed banana peel and fill it with banana-infused rum for a truly surreal experience. Just don't slip on the peel or get attacked by the shark.
