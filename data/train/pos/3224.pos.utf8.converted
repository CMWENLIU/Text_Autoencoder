I read the other reviews which lead me to try this product.  Our 17 year old cat (Angel) was diagnosed with renal failure and the vet put her on food that she would not eat.  That forced us to mix the vet food with other cat food and Angel still lost weight.  Angel is a very small cat and has weighed approximately 6-7 pounds her entire life.  When her weight dropped to 5 pounds we thought she was on her way out.  We purchased this food and she LOVES it!  Angel has been on it for about 6 months now and she is back to her normal weight. She begs for it. What an awesome product!
