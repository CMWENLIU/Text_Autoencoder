Based on a recommendation, I purchased an order of Claude's Brisket Marinade through Amazon and tried it on a brisket. This is a cut of beef I've never used before, but after tasting the mouthwatering deliciousness of this cut and Claude's, I am hooked. Last week I bought a second brisket and cooked it with the same amazing results. The recipe is on the bottle, however, there's a more in-depth recipe on the Claude's website, plus a brisket salad recipe and others.<br /><br />While the recipe suggests a roasting temperature of 300 degrees, I chose to cook the meat in a 225 degree oven--8 hours for a four pound brisket. I used a Le Creuset roasting pan with a layer of foil placed between the pan and the cover. No juices cooked away and the result was a fork-tender cut of meat.<br /><br />Honestly, this is the best marinade I've ever tasted.
