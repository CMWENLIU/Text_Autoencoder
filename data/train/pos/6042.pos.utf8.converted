With names like Treacle, and Spotted Dick-the sponge pudding industry is usually overlooked when it comes to dessert. These are delicious, and incredibly easy to make.  I always suggest the stove top method.  They come out like individual size cakes that are moist and sweet, and not foreign tasting like they sound.  I am addicted!!!
