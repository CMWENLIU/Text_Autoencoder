I can unequivocally say that a Bloody Mary made using Dimitri's Bloody Mary Seasoning--either the Classic Recipe or the Classic plus horseradish--will be the best Bloody Mary you will ever taste bar none! My husband and I both feel that we have never experienced such great Bloody Marys in any restaurant or bar in our entire lives and we're in our sixties!  If you've ever tried to make one yourself and been consistently disappointed because it turned out too hot, too bland, too spicy or not spicy enough, you will know what I mean. With Dimitri's it makes a CONSISTENT TASTY Bloody Mary EVERY TIME and it doesn't matter whether you are using plain tomato juice or V-8 juice. Buyers should note--this is not a Bloody Mary Mix like Mr & Mrs. T's.  Dimitri's is a Bloody Mary Seasoning mix in liquid form that you ADD to the tomato juice=creating an instant, tangy, completely ready to go Bloody Mary. And once you have tasted it you will never go back to mixing them from scratch and you will toss all your Mr. & Mrs. T's out the door!  You won't find Dimitri's in most grocery or liquor stores, so buying it here is a great find!  And it's cheaper at Amazon than it is on Dimitri's own website. So, if you want a superlative Bloody Mary that both you and your friends will rave about when you invite them over, make it with Dimitri's! You will become an instant fan for life! And don't forget to add a hot dilly bean, celery stick or marinated asparagus stalk to the drink! It's great!
