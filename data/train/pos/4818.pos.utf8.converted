First, since the photo is hard to see and the description doesn't list the "flavors" included, they are:<br /><br />* Apple Butternut Squash<br />* Banana Mango<br />* Carrot Tomato<br />* Sweet Potato Apricot<br /><br />Even though my baby isn't a picky eater and eats his veggies willingly, I loved the idea of combining fruit and vegetables. I figure the more flavors I can introduce him to now, the better--maybe I won't end up with a picky toddler! My baby loved all the flavors, and I even ended up buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O2DGMC">Earth's Best 2nd Antioxidant Blend Carrot Tomato, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a> because in addition to him liking that one a lot, it's the only Stage 2 food I've found that has tomato in it.<br /><br />I bought this variety pack countless times, and I highly recommend it to other moms.
