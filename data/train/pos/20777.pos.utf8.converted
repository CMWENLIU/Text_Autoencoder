I've been a fan of Yerba Mate tea for somewhere in the vicinity of 17 or 18 years and have always had to drink it with a lot of honey to get around the odd after-taste it tends to leave in one's mouth.  This Mate Chocolatte tea solves that problem with its blend of yummy spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and clove) and sweetening agents (cocoa and Stevia).  Stevia is one powerful sweetener, so there's no need to sweeten this tea at ALL!  All ingredients are fully organic, so you're doing your body good by drinking it.<br /><br />Yerba Mate is great for energy, also (one of the reasons I've been a fan for so long!) since it is naturally caffeinated, plus it helps to rid your body of accumulated toxins while providing you with vitamins, minerals, amino acids and antioxidants. Perfect!  If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your morning cuppa joe, this stuff is for you!
