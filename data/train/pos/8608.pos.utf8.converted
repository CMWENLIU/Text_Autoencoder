I disagree completely with the two previous reviewers !  This tastes exactly like real mayo, and the consistency is just fine, spreads easily.  It's the "fruit spreads" that have a rubbery consistency and cannot be spread.  I solved that problem, however, by dumping the entire jar into my Cuisinart mini chopper.  Just give it a whizz in there, and it comes out the consistency of apple sauce.  I did that with the Apple Butter, and the Apricot spread.  Delicious !
