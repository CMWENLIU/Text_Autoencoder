First bought this rice in Montana & loved it, then found out no place in Iowa carried it so was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  Cooked with raisins, this rice makes a tasty breakfast or sweet rice but its also just as terrific in soup!  Nice texture & flavor.  I'm hooked & now I'm getting all my friends hooked on it as well!
