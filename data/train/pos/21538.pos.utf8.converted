I bought this after trying several specialty cat foods which still caused my cat to upchuck a couple times a week. I thought this was an odd ingredient combination and was sure my cat would hate this. Not only does she like it but she hasn't thrown up since. We are both very happy and even though the product is spendy, its completely worth it!
