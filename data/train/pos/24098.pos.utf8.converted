I purchased this set of Keurig Cups along with a Keurig machine as a gift for a charity event.  I have a machine myself and love it, however, when I first got my machine, it only had 5-6 various sample cups included with the machine itself and it took me a while to get a case.  So, I know how inconvenient it is to not receive a collection kit to start out with.  This collection is really terrific--there a a number of different types of coffee included and with 48 cups per box, it would last most people 2-3 weeks.  I really recommend this as a gift of for yourself to try out different flavors.
