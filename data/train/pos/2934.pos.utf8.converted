I was so happy to find this tea available on the web. I was afraid that Dynasty had discontinued it.<br /><br />When I lived in California, I just picked this tea up weekly, at the grocery store. A while back I moved to a very rural area of the Missouri Ozarks. Nobody carried this particular Dynasty tea, which has always been a favorite of mine.<br /><br />I refused to use the last 2 bags I had... until my Amazon shipment arrived. Just in case I had a tea emergency. I cannot list any specific health benefits of this tea, I just know how it makes me feel. It makes me feel better, when I am coming down with something... and it cheers me up, when I am sad. The mild blend, and the soothing aroma, can be the best part of a very rough day. It is so good, I drink it ICED in the summer.<br /><br />Please continue to sell this tea. It is GREAT!!!
