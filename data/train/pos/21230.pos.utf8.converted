I've used all the different GF flour I could find. Most others will do fine for a masked taste like banana bread or pizza crust but this is the only one I would trust for anything where flour is a prominent flavor, such as sugar cookies, white bread and cake.<br />I would love to see this purchasable in bulk, so as not to be $5 a pound. I'll be buying other bulk GF flours (as low as $2.40 a pound) until that price goes down. This makes me sad.
