I have enjoyed standard puffed wheat for more than 30 years. This puffed Kamut performs similarly but is superior in taste and texture. I find it delicious and a favorite of my young grandchildren. Longer grains and somewhat more chewey than standard puffed wheat, this product ranks especially high for a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Very satisfied with the product and find the pricing here provides a substantial savings over even supermarket prices.
