I'm arachnophobic... with an exception of scorpions it seems. Just stating.<br /><br />There is a dense layer of flavored candy surrounding the scorpion which helps you build up to the big moment your tongue brushes a pincer or, worse, its body. After this encounter, you'll want to flip it around and start on an area where the scorpion is not. This is how it was for me. It was about 20 minutes later that I was able to hold the whole scorpion in my hand. 20 minutes later inside of a pizza parlor with an audience of 3 curious customers.<br /><br />As I've stated before in another review, the reason we are so appalled by eating insects is not the taste; it's the fact that you're eating an insect--something you've spent the majority of your lifetime chasing and killing--and it's extremely difficult to fathom putting something you have that sort of relationship with in your mouth as food no matter how you dress it up.<br /><br />The flavor of the scorpion is a bit nutty, but the texture kind of reminds me of chewing on a fingernail... not that I ever have. But I like it. This is somewhat of an acquired taste. If you don't like it the first time, there's a large chance you never will. Don't force it or you will vomit. Either way, these are great for pranks, gag gifs, icebreakers, thrill-seekers and drawing that much needed attention to yourself in public.
