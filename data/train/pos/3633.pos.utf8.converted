Do not buy this expecting it to taste like a chocolate bar. It has a very complex flavor. It is raw bean, that is not false advertising. It tastes like an intense tropical nut crossed with a distinct fermented fruity wine/grape aroma, truly deep and unique, with the texture similar to cashew pieces. This is crushed up pieces of the raw cocoa bean. It does not blend into smoothies well, but that's how I use it. I mix it in with blueberries and hemp protein and it's great. I also put it on oatmeal. You could put it in cereal, or yogurt.. in peanut butter & jelly sandwiches, or fruit cocktails.. anything that has a touch of sugar in it. You can eat them plain, but it is slightly bitter, not at all unpleasant in my book, and actually much more enjoyable to me. I will never buy any other form of chocolate ever again.<br /><br />I am a health nut, and the highlight of this stuff is you can just tell you are getting a mega dose of antioxidants. A dark chocolate bar does not come remotely close to this stuff. I think the nutritional content is probably off the charts. To the person who said the fat in these is bad, they would be incorrect. This is not milk animal fat, like in most chocolate bars, and it is not extracted cocoa butter, it is naturally occurring good fat like those found in avocado, coconut, and nuts, it is rapidly available as energy to your body and is burned off by your liver.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product, it is truly unique.
