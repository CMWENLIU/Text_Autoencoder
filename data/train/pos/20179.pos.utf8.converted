Newman's is hard to find because everybody has discovered organic. They have also discovered that buying from a company that makes it's own food is safer than a company that just labels whatever another company makes for them.<br /><br />Newman's and a few others make and distribute their own food.<br /><br />Therefore, they are very careful what they put in each bag and can.<br /><br />I have been using Newman's Own for several years because it is organic for the most part and the rest of the ingredients are "human quality". They also do not use wheat gluten or rice protein. They do use flaxseed, kelp and sea salt among other healthful, tasty ingredients.<br /><br />The price is reasonable for organic food, and my two girls love it.
