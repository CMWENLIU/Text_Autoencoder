My puppies LOVE these things. I use them in the interactive toys and treat ball items and the girls will work to get them out! They are also good for the puzzle toys that seem to have small openings that most things won't fit through!! You actually get a decent amount for the money and they seem to make the puppies happy. I just bought more. . . .
