I've been having terrible cravings for Ginger and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to find decent 'Crystalized Ginger' 'round these parts.  The candied ginger I've found at the local grocery store could have been plain ol' sugar cubes for all it's worth.  You couldn't taste the ginger and the texture... just horrible.  This ginger however is AMAZING!  Great sweetness with a good balance of 'spiciness' thrown in.  You can definately taste the ginger in these sugared goodies!<br /><br />That said, I've recently ordered a bunch of Ginger products from a company called 'The Ginger People' (I've tried their 'Ginger Chews' which are available locally and they are very tasty).  I'm hoping that their ginger products have even more of a kick because it's the sweet 'spiciness' that I truly crave.  But for the time being, it is safe to say that this is the BEST Crystallized Ginger I have had to date.
