In the past few months, I have upgraded all the dry and canned food that my 4 cats eat (they used to eat Science Diet).  This was the 1st high quality canned food I tried for them and they all love it!  I have 2 seniors (aged 15) and 2 adults (aged 4) and they jump up and pat me when I'm opening the Merrick.  I would recommend this great cat food to all cat owners.  Take a look at the labels - it's all real food product you can identify and it's made by a family owned business with great quality control.  This company loves pets too!
