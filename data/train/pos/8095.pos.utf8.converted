I've always used fresh egg-whites and not worried about them being raw. Now that I have small children, I thought pasturized would be the way to go. I was a little doubtful as I added water and watched the powder just float around - mixing didn't help. then, after about 2 minutes - voila! perfect eggwhites. They act just like fresh in cooking. I've used them in royal icing and merengues.
