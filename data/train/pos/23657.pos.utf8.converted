The Roland Tahini is an excellent sesame paste and is delicious.<br />I use it for all of my middle eastern favorites.<br />The price was also right, if the product had arrived in one piece it would have been a real bargain, but one jar burst in transit.<br />They call it a can, but they are plastic. Still a good product.
