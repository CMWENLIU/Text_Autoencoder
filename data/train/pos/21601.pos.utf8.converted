With every purchase I make from Navitas I'm becoming a bigger and more loyal fan! These raw cacao nibs are no exception.<br /><br />I ordered the 10lb bag since the price just couldn't be beat and I was getting tired of being 'gouged' when purchasing raw cacao in smaller, 1lb packages at the local health food stores.<br /><br />It arrived in perfect condition, double bagged in very heavy plastic. But the proof is in the taste test. This organic raw cacao has a lovely rich aroma and taste! I'm thrilled! Another winner from Navitas!
