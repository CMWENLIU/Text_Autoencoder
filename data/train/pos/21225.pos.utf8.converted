You want to know how tough a ZZ plant is?  I moved in late September and all my house plants were supposed to come directly to my house.  Other items went to storage until we finished the remodel.  You guessed it!  Movers packed my ZZ plant in a box, in a storage pod, outdoors in Arizona.  Our Fall was relatively hot this year--hit 100 degrees several times in late September and early October.  Just unpacked one of the last boxes today that were delivered from the storage pod about 3 weeks ago.  There she was--poor little thing. She was about the size of the picture in the upper right had corner of this page.  Four branches--three of which died.  The other is still green and there are 3 new shoots coming up out of the pot.  Gave her a drink and put her in filtered light.  We'll see how she does but I'm very hopeful!
