Good Taste and Good Portion Control<br /><br />EZ-Sweetz<br /><br />This is concentrated liquid sucralose plus preservatives.  Unlike the granulated forms, it truly has zero calories.  The flavor is good, but there is a slight difference between this form and the granulated form, which is no surprise because the granulated form uses a sugar (malto dextrin) as a filler.  The product stays in the bottle, even if it falls over with the cap off.  You have to squeeze the bottle to get the product to come out, which is does one drop at a time, so it is very easy to get precisely the number of drops that you want.  Some people may feel that you have to squeeze too hard to get the drops out and may need to use both hands.<br /><br />Update: usually the portion control is good, but sometimes you get one with a hole so big that the product comes out as a stream instead of drops.  Other times the hole is so small that a man using two hands and squeezing as hard as he can, can barely get anything out of the bottle.
