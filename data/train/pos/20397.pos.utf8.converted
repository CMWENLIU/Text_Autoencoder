My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!
