I absolutely love this tea.  I was never much of a tea drinker but love licorice so I decided to try it.  It has a sharp, clean taste of licorice with just a bit of spice.  My mother who is a huge tea drinker does not care for licorice but agreed to try it after I raved about it.  She did not like it at all, so I would say that you do have to like licorice to enjoy this tea.
