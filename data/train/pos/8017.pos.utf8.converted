I have loved this tea for many years, but haven't seen it in stores for a long time.  I was glad to find  it on amazon and at such a great price.  This tea has all the vanilla, cinnamon and spice aroma of chai, and all of the rich aroma of a smooth lite roast arabica coffee, without any caffeine, or even any coffee. It's a roasted barley based beverage.  It truly is lovely on a cold winter night, it reminds me of Christmas.<br /><br />(My one tip is, don't steep it for too long.  Longer than about 5 minutes and it starts to loose it's magic.)
