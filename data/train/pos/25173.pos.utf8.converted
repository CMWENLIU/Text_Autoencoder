Some background:<br />I have a history of stomach issues, mainly digestion problems similar to the symptoms of IBS. Up until recently I have treated my sickness by taking prescription medicine, which has had limited success and its own set of downsides. I made a decision not long ago that I would not take a pill for the rest of my life, especially since it cannot completely alleviate my symptoms, so I had to find something new.<br /><br />Aloe and Aloe Juice:<br />After hearing about Aloe juice and its benefits, I decided it was worth a shot. Intuitively speaking, it seems to make sense that given aloe's healing and topical (skin-applied) properties, it would have similar healing affects when taken internally. I tried a few different store-bought aloe juices, realizing some benefits afterward, and then decided to try something a little more potent. (Some notes about my aloe juice research: There are many brands of aloe juice, and as you can expect some are better/more potent than others. When making your decision about which brand/type to try, know that generally speaking you want to find one that is made with the inner fillet, and if it is an issue for you, has a decent taste.)<br /><br />This Product:<br />Since beginning to take this product, I am convinced of its profound healing potential. In only one week, my appetite has drastically improved, my latent pain feeling in my stomach/abdominal is practically gone, and I feel better around mealtime. Compared to a very similar brand, this one has a great taste too, which makes it actually a pleasure to take.<br /><br />My use/dosage (I am not a doctor and this is not a professional recommendation):<br />I take one capful/ounce first thing when I wake up in the morning, and usually a half of a cap/half an ounce in the afternoon or evening. There are instructions on the bottle as well.<br /><br />TL/DR:<br />I have had serious stomach issues for most of my life and I am tired of treating them (somewhat unsuccessfully) with prescription medicine. I heard about Aloe juice, did a lot of research, tried several types, and this one is definitely my favorite. If you even have minor stomach issues that you would like to address, I highly recommend this product!
