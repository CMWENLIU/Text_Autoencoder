I am a long time shark banana aficionado. I've been involved with sharkbanana themed events, lighted sharkbanana signs, defending six foot long sharkbananas from thieves, sharkbanana cakes, you name it, I've tried it, and I have to say, this particular sharkbanana is still the best. He's compact, but cuddly! I can hang him off my wrist, belt, or name badge at parties and he's a great conversation starter. Kids love him, and adults find their inner child thrives when they hang out with him. I couldn't recommend him more highly!
