I've been looking for more choices that give me at least a partial "made-at-home" taste with minimum work.  Sometimes I come home from work and I am so tired that I don't want to cook much of anything - - but I also want something other than take-out, canned soup, or a frozen dinner.  After seeing the reviews for this product, I ordered it.  I figured that it would be average, but I was willing to take the chance because the price was low and the nutrition information showed this to be a healthy choice.<br /><br />To my pleasant surprise, it is everything the other reviews suggested and more!  I came home, threw a couple of potatoes in the microwave, and emptied the roast beef into a bowl.  I ended up with the beef and gravy over lightly buttered baked potatoes.  It was a hearty and filling meal (enough for two dinners) that tasted like a good crock pot roast.  I've since tried the product in stroganoff and creamed over toast points.  Both were fantasatic!  The meat is hearty, lean, and tender; the gravy is flavorful and rich.  Honestly, I'm amazed that something so good is such a secret - - but then again, any canned beef I've tried before this product has tasted (and smelled!) like dog food.<br /><br />Bottom line: THIS IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT!  It is delicious, convenient, versatile, and thoroughly enjoyable.  What a blessing!
