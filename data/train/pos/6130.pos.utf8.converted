Life without Duke's is hardly worth livin'. When I lived out in Los Angeles, my parents use ta' send me care packages from the blessed South, which always included Mrs. Duke's savory prescription. It is by far the best they is! I placed it in a movie that I was shooting in LA last year and when it arrived on set (much of the crew was from the South) it was welcomed as either an old friend or vessels of ambrosia. In short, I highly recomend Duke's, even to our friends from the colder side of the Mason-Dixon (as all of us in God's country are well familiar with it). It is great on a sandwich with peanut butter and bannana. Bon appetite!
