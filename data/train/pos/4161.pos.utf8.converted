I have read that Community Coffee is good and beloved around New Orleans. I'm a regular Kona and Blue Mountain drinker so I had tempered expectations but boy I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I like full flavored coffee and my brewing of choice is a dark roast through an aeropress followed by sugar and cream. The Community dark roast is very tasty. A nice full flavor with a sweet/non-bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Obviously everybody's taste is different, but I'm very pleased with this one.
