Quaker Instant Oatmeal Express offers a nutritious, flavourful breakfast for the commuter. It is a wonderful breakfast for home as well. The need for a bowl is eliminated as it comes in its own disposable bowl, requiring only water to the fill line before placement in the microwave for 90 seconds on high. More oatmeal is contained in this bowl than in the individual pouches.<br /><br />The Golden Brown Sugar is my favourite flavour. It is delicious!<br /><br />This product is highly recommended.
