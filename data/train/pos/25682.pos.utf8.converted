*****<br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea. Perfect!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip."<br /><br />It sounds quite romantic, and it does certainly taste wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
