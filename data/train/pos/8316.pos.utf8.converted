This is a nice bar.  It's about 1/4 inch thick and about 2 3/4 x 5 3/4 inches in size.  The 72% cocoa is nice because it is bittersweet without all the added sugar but not as harsh as the higher cocoa content ones.  The mint taste is light, just a hint of mint. The higher cocoa content like this bar is supposed to be good for you (but does not mean you should eat a whole lot.)  The bar says it has 2 servings, and honestly, half this bar is enough.  (I found that usually the first mouthfull satisfies the urge anyway.  So, unless you can afford all the calories, eat half the bar and put the rest away for another day---OR, better yet, share with friends.)<br /><br />Ingredients are nice--like real food (chocolate, beet sugar, vanilla, etc.--not a bunch of chemical names.  Only 12g sugar.  Also contains 3g protein and is 10% iron and 2% calcium.  10% of the profits are donated to help support species, habitat and humanity.  An all natural, 3 oz/85g product and it is delicious.
