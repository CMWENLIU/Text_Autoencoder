Vegan. Organic. Great beans plus veggies alternative to 'classic' bean chili. Bell peppers are the most prominent added flavor note. Great with organic tortilla chips or crackers. Made with organic bell peppers, organic potatoes, organic carrots, organic corn in addition to typical chili ingredients. Consider adding even more of your favorite organic veggies such as tomatoes, bell peppers, or garbanzos for even more chunkiness and flavor note variety. The veggies change the taste and mouth feel with every spoonful. Great base for a party dip. A small amount of blended organic jalapenos provides some bite. If you prefer, can add a spoonful of agave nectar to increase sweetness. No GMO ingredients. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! Also like Amy's traditional chilis such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CPZQ">Amy's Organic Medium Chili, 14.7-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G176EG">Amy's Organic Black Bean Chili, 14.7-Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>.
