I bought a home with gardens that had  been totally neglected for years.  The grass was so bad, I  thought I would have to tear out all the ground cover and perennials.  Fortunately one of my new neighbors suggested I try Grass-B-Gon.  I bought one bottle of this product, to try.  I picked an area where the grass was especially bad.  I was astounded at how nicely this cleaned up my ground cover.  I went to buy more, and could not find it ANYWHERE!  The area where I used this product is grass free.  I wish I could say the same for the rest of my gardens!  I was thrilled to find this product is once again available!
