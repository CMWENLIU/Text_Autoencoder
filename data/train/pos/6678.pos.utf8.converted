I'm gonna be honest this is my first time I buy seeds at all so I decide to buy from 2 different sites here and E....<br />despite the low rating I decided to try my luck.<br />First of all, all seeds were perfectly in excellent conditions, can't say the same thing from the other marketplace or seller :S.<br />This seller gave me 35 seeds instead of 20, can't say he'll do the same to you but the extra amount was very surprising (Thanks).<br />And if that wasn't enough he also send me another weird seeds called Dracaena or dragon tree  (beautiful when matures).<br /><br />I divided the seeds in 3 separate groups 15/15/5  I'm gonna use pure water(example distilled ) on one group on the other ill use hormones and on the last group I gave them to my father.  I will update this review when I see them germinate or in max 2 or 3 months if nothing happens today is 06/03/2011.<br />I almost forgot to tell you guys I received the package on time the first day of its arrival period, also had and excellent communication with the seller about a question I had, he respond me the next day.<br /><br />So lets say not satisfy but Happy with my first buy.
