After purchasing a Gaggia Titanium I was looking for a great tasting espresso, I found other people's reviews helpful and decided to try Lavazza Super Crema - it is wonderful!  It produces a thick crema and does not have a bitter taste like so many other espresso beans. Each cup reminds me of the great tasting quality coffee one gets in European coffee shops.  If you are looking for a high quality espresso that produces a nice thick crema - try Lavazza Super Crema!
