One reviewer on here stated that Devoon cream is salted butter. That is as far from the truth as can be.<br />Devon cream is the cream of the cream of the milk fat. If this were churned it would become butter, but butter it is not. It is the most wonderful thick snow white cream in the world. Emjoy it on toast with jam or put it in an Italian dish instead of cottage cheese. Because there is NO SALT in this product after opening it will have a shelf life of about 5 days. Delicious!
