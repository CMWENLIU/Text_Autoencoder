The smell is absolutely heavenly. I never smelled vanilla extract like this. It smelled sooo pure and I could tell it was good quality. The owners are so friendly,kind and easily to work with. I had some shipping problems that were of my own fault and I called them at 10:00pm thinking the answering machine would pick up and tell me their hours so I could call in the moring before they ship my order. But, Eric, one of the owners, picked up and was shockingly friendly. I apologized for disturbing him but he didn't seem to mind and continued to help me.<br /><br />P.S. You should also try their Hawaiian vanilla while it lasts! It's even more fragrant then the Mexican!!!!!
