Not sure why another reviewer would give this product 1 star for not having product details (when it does), but to get to the real review, this stuff is awesome. Every cat owner knows/has the finicky cat, but mine add stomach issues to the mess. They love this stuff, even my cat who prefers dry food is hooked. Their stomachs (aka throw up frequency :) seems much better now. Also recommend the Halo dry food for sensitive cats. All natural, for real.
