Black Tiger is my favorite coffee pod. First, it is delicious coffee. Second coffee people pods are the only pods I have seen where you get some crema, or the creamy looking froth that high pressure brewing can get. This is the sign of a well brewed cup and something that drip cannot duplicate. I used to mix up my pods but after trying the Black Tiger I have 4-5 boxes and unused pods that will never be used. The other Coffee People pods also get some crema.
