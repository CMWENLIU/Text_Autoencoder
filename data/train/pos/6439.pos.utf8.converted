This is an amazing little product.  It's great alone on meats and veggies, or with added tarragon or other herbs.<br />It is especially lovely to have on hand as a staple when one has no time to make a veloute from scratch...like after working all day.  Equally terrific is the red wine sauce.<br />I truly consider these sauces as my favorite culinary "find" of the year.<br />Please don't stop making them!  It would be a bit easier, if I could find them at Kroger, though the six-pack was very cost effective...usually the shipping costs make them a tad expensive.  still, worth it.
