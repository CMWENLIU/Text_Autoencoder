I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.<br /><br />Edit to Add: I have revised my feeding schedule to reflect the recent Wellness Recalls.  Wellness is still a part of my rotation, but I feed different varieties of canned food during the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />PS - some have preferred to add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> to rotation, to keep the cost low in more multiple cat households.  It has no glutens, but does use meat by products.
