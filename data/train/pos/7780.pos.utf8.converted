I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>
