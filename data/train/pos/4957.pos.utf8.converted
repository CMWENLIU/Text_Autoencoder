I've been using this for about 8 months now, have used it for gifts for holidays.  Spread the word! Try 1 tsp in 8 oz of mayo and you've got Baconnaise...great for dips and sandwiches. Add a little milk or buttermilk to that and you've got a great salad dressing. Use it on and in almost everything to give a new layer of complexity to your dishes.  Use a little and it adds a new layer of depth and flavor, add a lot for the distinct bacon flavor.<br /><br />You might as well get the big jug, as it is very reasonable for what you'll get.  There's enough in the jug for you to share your Baconsalt with friends, without cutting your supply short.  Believe me, your friends will be scratching at the door for more.<br /><br />This stuff just might be the best new product of 2008....and 2009!  The boys that invented this stuff are getting rich...the stuff is VERY popular. With good reason.<br /><br />Let the sunshine in!  You'll love this.  Plus, IT'S KOSHER so your jewish friends can get in on the fun!
