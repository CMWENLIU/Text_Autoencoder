I'm a huge fan of the Keurig but in the Summer I need my iced coffee and previously I've been using 2 k-cups, or a making a very small cup of iced coffee because I didn't want it to be watered down.  I like my coffee reasonably robust although not quite as strong as some popular coffee shops make it, and I like a big cup, 20 oz. So the small cup wasn't working out for me and using 2 k-cups meant I was plowing through my box in no time at all.  Today I discovered the Green Mountain French Vanilla Iced Coffee. I filled my 20 oz plastic cup with ice just like it said and set my Keurig to the cup size closest to 8 oz. YUMMY!!!!!!  It's exactly what I had hoped it would be. Usually even a small amount of half and half and the ice would make my coffee too light and watered down, but it didn't.  It was great, I'm hooked already and I've only had one cup.  Also in case you are wondering.  There are 2 less k-cups in the box, BUT each cup weighs  more, .60 ounces verses .45 ounces. They simply put more coffee in the iced k-cups and the result makes me really happy. Just had my last sip which has been sitting on ice while I write my review, still yummy!!!  Hope this review helps.
