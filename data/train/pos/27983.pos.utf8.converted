This is excellent and the best I have found for the Keurig maker.  I tried all the assorted flavors that came with the Keurig and they were all weak and horrible.  I didn't know whether to blame it on the machine or the coffee, so I read some reviews and tried the Midnight Magic and the Rainforest Espresso.  Both both make a great cup of nice, strong, flavorful coffee that is good enough to replace my daily Starbucks run.
