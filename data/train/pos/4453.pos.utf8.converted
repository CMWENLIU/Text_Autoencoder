Truthfully, I ordered this because of the potential cost savings and after receiving the shipment and brewing a few cups, I was very pleasantly surprised. I had previously ordered the Timothy's Rainforest Blend to brew as an espresso shot (smallest setting) and as a flavorful cup of coffee (on the largest setting). They taste almost identical...with this version getting my vote as the best of the two. It's roasted just short of the burnt tasting French Roast, so it has flavor without the biter, heavy, overpowering taste some of us don't like...so you STARBUCKS PEOPLE, YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS and may call it weak...you guys have to stop basing all your reviews on that flavor profile as being 'correct'. This is a coffee brewer created mostly on convenience...you can't base a decent K-cup review as a direct comparison to a freshly roasted, freshly ground, drip cup of coffee! Base your reviews on how CLOSE we get to that...not that it's bad if not achieved.<br /><br />The folks caught up in the design difference are confusing to me, all it is is different. It has a solid plastic rim with the standard foil top, with a mini paper filter basket full of ground coffee attached to it...that's all it is. All I did was clean out the detachable basket that the cartridge sits in on the machine to get out any grinds that may have collected in there from previous K-Cups and everything from that point on was exactly the same...other than having to store these unique cartridges in a zip-lock baggie to keep them fresh. To me it was nice to get that coffee aroma once again similar to making a fresh pot of ground coffee...it's a sensory thing with me that I enjoy before brewing.<br /><br />This quality of coffee is a keeper for me and I have since put it on the auto ship program. To get 80 cartridges for $28 delivered (.35 per cup) is tough to beat...like before wholesale coffee prices went through the roof a year & a half ago! To all the Keurig owners out there, definitely give this brand a try in a roast you like...I promise you won't be disappointed.
