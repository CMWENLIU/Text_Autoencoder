I bought this as a gift.  It was much nicer than the Bentley's tea box I have.  It has a higher quality wood finish, is heavier, and has better hinges.  The hinges are especially important so the top stays open, but doesn't flop backwards.  After about three months, the hinges on my Bentley's box were pretty much shot.  I would buy the Bigelow box again.
