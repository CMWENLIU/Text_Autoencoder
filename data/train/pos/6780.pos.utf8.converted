I just recieved my Betty Crocker Gluten Free yellow cake mix today and couldn't wait to make up a batch of cup cakes. They just came out of the oven and with the execption of adding a box of sugar free Jell-o instant pudding to the mix and halving the butter with coconut oil I followed the directions exactly. There was enough batter to make 12 standard size cup cakes. These are a big hit with my kids and husband(who is not a big fan of most GF baked goods) so we will definatly buy this product again and again. I also noticed that these have about 100 less calories per serving than the standard yellow cake mix which is really nice, thus making each cupcake really close to 100 calories each. Mmmm, I'm gonna grab a second before they disapear.
