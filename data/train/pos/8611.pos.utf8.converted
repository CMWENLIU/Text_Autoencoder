My wife and I have been unhappy all these years with any fish sauce brand here in the US since they either have the unnatural sweet after taste (Thai fish sauce) or too strong of a smell and salty (Philippine fish sauce). No matter how we tried to mix or fix them, they still don't come close to the fine taste of quality fish sauce that we sorely miss (good fish sauce needs not to be mixed to taste good). My father, a Phan Thiet's native and his family used to own a Nuoc Mam factory therefore we know what true extra virgin Nuoc Mam should taste like!<br />Until not too long ago, I stumbled across this brand on Amazon, bought a pair ... and boy, my wife and I were blown away. We will be buying more as gift for our family and we're sure that they will be thrilled - We are huge fans of this brand now!
