I have lived in the USA for twenty plus years and have come to love the country I now call home, but of all the teas I've tried (and there have been many) I have not been able to find a better tasting tea than Taylors Yorkshire Tea. Truely a great English product, Typhoo and PG tips don't come close. WONDERFUL, try it, cheers!
