This is simply my favorite ramen.  I love everything about it -- the noodles, the broth, and the spices.  Everyone I know who has tried this has converted from that maruchan garbage.<br /><br />I've always made this by bowling, sometimes throwing in an egg or vegetables for some added flavor.<br /><br />I'm pretty spoiled by online shopping, China/Koreatown is a little further than I care to drive, and this price is identical to the instore price for  case (as far as I can recall), so this is a solid deal.<br /><br />ALthough I admit, I would be a little disturbed by someone who would put this on Subscribe & Save.
