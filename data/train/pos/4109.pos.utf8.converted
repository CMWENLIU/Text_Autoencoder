I can only say that this V8 is the most addicting I've ever had.<br /><br />I've had V8 Tropical before, but this is one of the best I've ever had.<br /><br />It's hard to really review this item as taste is subjective, but for those of you who enjoy berry flavored beverages, this is one to try.<br /><br />The bottle is a moderate size, a lot smaller than a two liter bottle of soda, so expect to finish it very quickly.<br /><br />There is a lot of nutrition in this bottle, but you should be careful as there is a lot of sugar as well.<br /><br />I got this, and finished all 8 bottles within 10 days. Seriously, this was an awesome drink.<br /><br />For those of you who don't enjoy sweets as much, I would recommend putting half and half. Water helps lower the sugar concentration, and the sweetness, but it doesn't take away the taste, it still taste really good.
