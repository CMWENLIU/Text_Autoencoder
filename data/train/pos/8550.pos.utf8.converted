Experiments in Japanese cuisine will inevitably lead to soba (buckwheat) noodles. This brand is available locally, but at far greater expense. The flavor is nothing spectacular or intrusive. The texture and flexibility are the selling point. They have been used in Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, yakisoba and stand-alone hot or cold in dipping sauce with excellent results. When properly cooked, the noodles have a wonderful texture and flexibility. It is Japanese-polite to slurp your noodles (suck them in). Regular pasta will not allow that technique, I've tried. These wrap around the chopsticks just right and slurp just fine. I like the ingredients, just wheat and buckwheat flour. The less expensive brand uses wheat with barley etc., that's regular all-purpose flour, ugh. Just a personal preference.
