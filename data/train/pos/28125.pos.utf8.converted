I'm glad you don't have to order twelve jars of this at once because I don't think the elastic in my pants is rated for that kind of thing.<br /><br />This does taste exactly like the cookies, which if you aren't familiar, tastes sort of like if you peeled the crust off a really good cheesecake, then made that into frosting and - voila! - there you have Biscoff Spread.<br /><br />One hundred percent ridiculously awesome.<br /><br />02/05/12 Edited to add: ummmm, considering the title of this review please *don't* ask how I know this but as it turns out you can order multiple jars of this from seller Vitacost and the shipping charge remains the same, reducing the overall cost per jar.<br /><br />Strangely enough ordering in multiples conversely increases ones waistline measurement.
