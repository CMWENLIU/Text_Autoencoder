I noticed that these sardines were available at Whole Foods so I decided to purchase them.  I'm soooooo glad that I did.  They are the best sardines that I've ever tasted.  One of my granddaughters' shares them with me sometimes.  She loves them!  My husband does also!<br />I was delighted to find out that Amazon.com sells these Crown Prince sardines at a much lower price.  Yeah!!  Now we can have these sardines more often.  Wonderful!!<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EEWZF0">Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br />Thank you, Amazon.com!!
