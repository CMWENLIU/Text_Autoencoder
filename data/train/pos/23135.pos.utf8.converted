I have found these snack sticks to be the best way to stave off hunger pains when dieting.  The resonable calorie count and the 0 carbs is a winner.  My only problem has been in locating only one store locally that stock them and that stock is often missing.  I am going to try ording off the internet as soon as I need to replenish.
