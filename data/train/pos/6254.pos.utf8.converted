Ok, so not sure why the person is griping that there are fake reviews but I have to say this is true to claim. My dog passed away on May 13th,2011 (she was like my daughter) and I was severely depressed to say the least. I wasnt sleeping at all and was just miserable. The following weekend  I decided to help my friend with a project she had undertaken....bad idea since I wasnt sleeping I was extra grumpy so my usual patient and calm demenor was non-existent. So I came across this Neuro Bliss in some far out store and it caught my eye. Can I say instant mood changer! It relaxed me and it was like I drank the stress away! I highly recommend it. Just even as a pickme up. and its yummy :-)
