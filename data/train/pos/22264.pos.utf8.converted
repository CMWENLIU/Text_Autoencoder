I have been feeding this food for several months to my 9-year old "allergy" Lab.  He is doing wonderfully on it.  Shiny coat, good muscle... and best of all... no more ear infections!  He seems to love the taste.  I would highly recommend this food to people whose dogs have allergies to grains, peas, chicken, beef, ...etc.  Actually, I think it's a great food for dogs without allergies, too.  My non-allergic bullmastiff is doing very well on it.
