"Satan's Blood Chile Extract" is a high quality product and I highly recommend it. The bottle is nice but be careful when opening it because the nature of the latch makes it easy to get a small amount of the extract on your finger (which can be dangerous if you wiped your eye). The extract looks like real blood and is VERY HOT... especially if you're not conditioned to using TRUE hot sauces / extracts. When I say conditioned to using TRUE hot sauces / extracts, I don't mean weak sauces like Tabasco, Louisiana, or other so called "hot" sauces from your local grocery store. If you think grocery store sauces are hot then "Satan's Blood" more than likely will be too extreme for you...even one drop.<br /><br />To put things in perspective...the original classic red variety of Tabasco pepper sauce measures 2,500-5,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). "Satan's Blood" measures 800,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)! The means it's up to 320 times hotter!! It's best used as a food additive. I like how I can put just a drop or two in a bowl of chili and it makes it hot but does not change the overall taste like weaker vinegar based sauces will.<br /><br />As a hot pepper enthusiast, I rate this product as VERY HOT...but not extremely hot. Remember though, like beauty, hotness is in the eye of the beholder. Most people WOULD rate this as EXTREMELY HOT...but I've been a fan of hot foods for decades. I've grown many different peppers including but not limited to jalape&ntilde;o, Cayenne, and Haba&ntilde;ero. Plus, I use extracts like "The Source Collectors Extract"...which is rated at hell fire level 7,100,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)!!!<br /><br />Five Stars!
