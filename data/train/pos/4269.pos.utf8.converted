I recieved my package today, much quicker than I expected. The items in the set were so fresh; also I really enjoyed the festive packaging. I love Thai food, and have recently am trying to adopt a totally Asian way of cooking for health reasons, I am now in my third week, and have lost 15 pounds, and pain from my fibro and RA is gone. In addition to the health benefits from Thai cooking, is it satisfies my taste...I don't crave fatting spicy foods, or even sweets anymore...:). I encourge those that want to try, to give it a shot...it's not as hard as it looks. If you live in area, such as I do..and have limited access to Thai ingredients, this package will get you on your way..to health wholesome Thai foods...thanks for offering this product...Pam
