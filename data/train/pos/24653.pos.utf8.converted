This is one of my hubby's favorite candies. We have trouble finding them in our city. We used to resort to buying bags of Halloween candy that would have some mixed in it.  Last year, we couldn't even find those.  So, I did an online search, found them, purchased them & my hubby's eating them. They arrived fresh, and tasty.  So very, very glad I found these online.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Sugar Daddy lollipops are milk caramel. They come in two sizes; this is the smaller size &  approx. 1"x2"x1/4" not including the stick. If you chew on them they will get stuck in your teeth.
