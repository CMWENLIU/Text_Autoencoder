I have been using this product for 3 or 4 years. For those of you who do not like the taste, try mixing it with chocolate. Mix it with chocolate ice cream(I use Soy Delicious, being a vegan). Chocolate seems to netralize the flavor of the hemp. I also mix a scoop of hemp protein with a bowl of oatmeal sweetened with cactus nectar. It tastes very good, provide you use the right amount of sweetner.
