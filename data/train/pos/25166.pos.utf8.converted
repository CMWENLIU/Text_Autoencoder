I love these bags. I have both long and short handle ones from this seller. They are very well made. I will be ordering long handled ones next as I only have one long handled one now. I am so glad I ordered these as they are all cotton and you cannot see through the bottom of them like the ones the stores sell.<br /><br />There is a little hook on both sides of the bag for the rack in the grocery store. You do not have to turn the bag around and make sure you hook the right side because there is one on both sides. Very handy. The size is the same size as a paper bag, which is just right. I would not want to carry a large bag, but I am an older person and she does have large bags for those would would want to fill up a large one.<br /><br />They are not too heavy of canvas, and I think it is just right because you do not notice the bag weight when it is full. The handles are so convienent and comfortable to carry your groceries in.<br /><br />Now if I can remember every time to bring them in the store with me, I'll have it made :-)  I am still new with these bags. The other day I forgot and when I was checking out, I realized I was on a meat buying run, so maybe it was a good thing to forget the bags. I was thinking at the check out that the meat would leak in the bags.<br /><br />The seller is so easy to work with and shipped very fast too. All around these are well made bags of the right weight and functionality.
