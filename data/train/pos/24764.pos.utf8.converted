Because I have celiac disease I must eat a gluten free diet, I'm also vegan by choice.  This item meets both of those requirements and is also absolutely delicious.  It is not spicy hot at all, perfect for typical western tastes, yet the sauce is very tasty.<br /><br />I've been using Tasty Bite products for years, as they have long offered gluten free and vegan items, but this is the best of all of their products I have tried.  I eat it over rice and it causes me to have Happy Tummy, always good for people with celiac disease.<br /><br />The spinach and potatoes dominate, but I love both.  It probably is not as high in protein as many other similar dishes, but not every meal needs to be packed with protein.  I'd subscribe to this product if the option were available.
