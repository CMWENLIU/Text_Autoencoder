I really LOVE this tea. I drink a LOT of black tea each day since I don't drink coffee. I rarely drink fruity, sweet flavored or herbal teas. I drink strong black teas like Early Grey, Irish Breakfast and English Breakfast teas. That said, I LOVE this blend. It's hard to find a flavored blend like this using black tea (typically always find it as an herbal blend, green tea, etc).<br /><br />Those who prefer herbal teas, green teas, etc., over the stronger black teas may not enjoy this flavor as much. It has a taste that's hard to explain. It's not super sweet at all (not a fan of anything sweet in my tea). The aroma almost reminds me of when you walk into a coffee shop and smell the sweet caramel/toffee coffee blends, but the taste is still the great black tea flavor.<br /><br />Highly suggest getting just one box the first time you try this tea. Recommended for those who enjoy black tea blends.
