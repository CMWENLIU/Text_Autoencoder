So I had my first taste of Jamaica blue mountain coffee today and can honestly say it's the best, most smooth cup of coffee i've had. The smell when you first open the bag is divine, when you grind down the beans it only gets better. I use a Bruville single cup coffee maker to make my coffee so i'm not exactly sure if it would taste different with a drip coffee maker, i'll have to use one and then update this review. Not only can you smell the difference from your run of the mill coffee but you can see the difference as well,a dark rich looking cup but not overbearing or bitter just really smooth. The only thing about buying this bag from Amazon is that your paying close to 20$ more than you should. I got the same bag from coffeeforless.com for 54$ and free shipping.
