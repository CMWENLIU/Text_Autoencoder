My cat is an old fart at 16 years old so she doesn't get excited quite as often over things as she used to.  She always enjoys regular treats but for Christmas I wanted to get her a variety of different more natural treats and these were one of them.  She went off her rocker before I even had a chance to open them; she was licking around the seal of the closed plastic container!  Watching her eat them is half the fun - I'll put some flakes on the floor and she acts like a vacuum cleaner, frantically pushing them around to try to inhale them but sometimes they get stuck to her chin or whiskers and she can't figure out what's going on.  It's been a long time since I've seen her this animated over treats, and I never would have guessed it would have happened over fish flakes [they remind me of pieces of onion skin], so I'd say these are a winner in our house now!
