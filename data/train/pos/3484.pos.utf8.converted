My sister discovered these not too long ago and raved about them, and finally this morning I ate one for breakfast before a sprint triathlon. YUM YUM YUM. By the lightness of the package I would've thought it was a piece of cardboard, but no, it's a flat waffle-shaped piece of heaven. It's really the first non-gross food geared toward working out I have come across. Excuse me while I buy out Amazon's entire supply. FRICKIN DELICIOUS.
