I just received the spice box and I can say without reservation that I am 100% satisfied. Everything one needs for a good Indian dish is in the spice box. It is a good starting point for somebody who is just starting out in Indian cooking, such as myself. If one was to buy spices one by one it would be expensive and like this you get everything you need for just a few dollars. Everything comes neatly packaged and labeled so that you don't mistake your curry from your garam masala and so on. Be warned, however, the spice box has a very powerful smell so much so that I had to contain my in a plastic bag and tie it because the smell of 30 different spices together was overpowering my small kitchen. Once in the bag the smell dissipated. Enjoy cooking!
