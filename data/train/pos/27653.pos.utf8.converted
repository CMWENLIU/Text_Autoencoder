I am a coffee afficionado! I'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans I can find. I keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee! This coffee was great and I have tried a million different brands!!! Organic and fair trade is important to me!!! Thanks for the extra effort! I wish the big guys would make this kind of effort!!!!
