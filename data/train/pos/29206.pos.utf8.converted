I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)
