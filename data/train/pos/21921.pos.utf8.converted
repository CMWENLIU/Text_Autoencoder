I first had this mustard in Paris and loved it. It is great to be able to purchase it now in the states. This is a good size crock, well worth the price, I have carried many home from Paris! I can't find any other mustard in the states that has the same quality of taste.<br />Pommery mustard makes a wonderful marinade for chicken with some olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, rosemary, a few red pepper flakes, fry it in olive oil... its amazing. Leftovers (if any) freeze good too.<br /> Also makes a vegetable dip that everyone wants the recipe for - mayo, sour cream, minced onion, minced garlic, pommery mustard: its so good you don't need the veggies!<br />I am not a fan of plain mustard so don't know if you can use this product alone as a condiment.<br />Bon appetit
