I just love alfalfa sprouts on sandwiches; however, over the months. I found that alfalfa sprouts were being sold less and less in the local food markets.  It is my belief that the reason is simply that they do not have a long enough shelf life.  It was this reason that I went online to Amazon and purchased this product. Knowing that seeds have a long shelf life, I stored it in my cabinet until I had the courage to learn how to sprout at home.  It was a You Tube video that gave me the courage to begin sprouting.  I do not know why it took so many decades for me to learn how to home sprout.  Alfalfa sprouts usually take about three days or so to mature, and require no more than watering and rinsing with the final hours on the window sill for Mother Sun.  The sprouts stay fresh much longer than I imagined because they are processed at home and are so very delicious.  I highly recommend buying this vendor's seeds.  They are perfect.  One pound of alfalfa seeds lasts a long time.  I guarantee that you will love sprouting seeds as I now do.  Thank you so much for the lessons!  I just finished sprouting a new batch and had to come back online to sincerely thank The Sprout House!
