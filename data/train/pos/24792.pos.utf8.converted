I've purchased other Bionaturae pastas before, and this, like the others, was a big hit with the family.  This brand is healther than white pasta, but doesn't have the gummy taste you get sometimes from whole wheat products.  The kids and adults alike love it, and I feel a whole lot better about serving it.  Doesn't hurt that it's organic, either.<br /><br />Amazon's price for this and the other Bionaturae products is much better than the grocery store, especially if you use the automatic/subscription feature, where you get an additional discount.  With the discount and free shipping, it's almost the same price as the brand name, white flour products you find at the store, but it's a much better health choice!
