A friend gave me a jar of the Tropical Traditions coconut oil and also a jar of their coconut cream concentrate because I have dairy allergies.  I just emailed her a huge thank you because both these products are good for replacing butter.  The coconut oil is just like white butter (less salty, slightly sweeter, slightly coconutty) and the cream concentrate has a layer of the "butter" on top and can be used to make coconut milk.  So now I have replaced two foods that I had to give up, milk and butter.  You may not be that interested if you don't have diet restrictions but if you do, try this company.
