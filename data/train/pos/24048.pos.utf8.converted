Funny, seems to me that the cereal bits were so much bigger when I was a kid...<br /><br />It took a long time to try to explain this cereal to my kids, the heady days of Quake (sadly, no longer made) the introduction of Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Count Chocula (the only real survivor), and in the end I gave up trying.<br /><br />Man, I've got a bowl full of this stuff, sitting down in front of Boomerang to watch reruns of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301249380">The Banana Splits</a>, and I'm in heaven, transported back to that magical early-70s time when the greatest thing in the world was the Friday-night double bill of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V6IWQ">The Partridge Family</a> followed by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGBSEY">The Brady Bunch</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5RG">Wonderful World of Disney</a>, and the greatest thing on Saturday morning was nonstop cartoons (until 1:00) and grabbing another Frito Bandito pencil eraser with my chips at lunch.<br /><br />For us 40-somethings, this is nostaligia food, and big thanks to Quaker for still making it.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with this gastronomic indulgence, you're looking at the exact same product as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0AJX0">Cap'n Crunch</a>, just pressed into a different form and in a different box.  This stuff stays cruncy a good long time in milk, and then finally settles down into that strange yet endearing sponginess before turning into a single mass of completely congealed cereal-mat--yummy!
