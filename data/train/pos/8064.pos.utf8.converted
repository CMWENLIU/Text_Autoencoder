I've been having trouble finding this in my local grocery stores, so I ordered a case.  This stuff is great - toss with veggies or potatoes and a little olive oil and roast.  Delicious!  Sprinkle over fish with some breadcrumbs and dot with butter or olive oil and bake.  I have no idea if you can actually make soup with it, and don't care.  I use it just to season foods and it's excellent.
