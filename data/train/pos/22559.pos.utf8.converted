I don't think any Mexican cuisine kitchen should be without Ancho Powder.<br />I like to make a mild red chili sauce with it for enchiladas.<br />Recently I started purchasing Ancho from here and have come back [for other products] just because the<br />prices are good and the quality of products [that I've tried so far] have been great.<br />Will be back with other chilie reviews.
