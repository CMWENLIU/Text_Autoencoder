For those of us who love bitter, strongly flavored jams and marmalade, this is the standard by which all others are judged. Incredible on toast or an English muffin in cold weather, it also is robust enough to be satisfying for a breakfast in the hot summer. I like the added flavor of the peel; those who don't will like the fine cut or the version without peel. This is not a marmalade for wimps.
