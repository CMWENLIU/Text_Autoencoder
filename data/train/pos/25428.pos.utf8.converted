In general, I'm a big fan of rice and beans -- though these seemed to be a bit mild in terms of spice. A shot of hot sauce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EISKJ6">Huy Fong Sriracha sauce - 17 oz x 2 bottles</a> and a few twists of sea salt made the flavor pop. I've also enjoyed these with a sprinkling of grated cheese. A convenient, fast meal that doubles as comfort food. Good stuff.
