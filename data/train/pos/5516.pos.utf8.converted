I switched from another, much more expensive, brand and now prefer this one.  This Vitacost coconut oil is not as clumpy as the brand I was using; and therefore easier to work with and mix with my flax and cottage cheese each day.  The flavor is good and I like the statements on the container:  organic, cold pressed (to leave in all the good healthy stuff), lab tested for heavy metals, etc.  Overall, an excellent value.
