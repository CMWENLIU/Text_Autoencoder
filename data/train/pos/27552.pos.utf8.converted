Jyoti makes the most delicious foods. I consistantly eat these as side dishes or as main dishes and am never dissapointed. Indian food is my favorite cuisine and these are the best pre-packaged Indian foods I have found (and I have tried every brand I can find.) Great way to get a delicious Indian food meal without having to go to a restaurant.  They are very versitile - you can add meats, make them into soups, add vegetables, and the labels come with recipes to make lots of different dishes. All of the varieties of Jyoti are tasty but this one (Punjab Chole) is my favorite. Highly recommended.
