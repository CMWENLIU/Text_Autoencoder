I sure thought having to mix powder with water sounded weird, but I thought it was worth a shot after reading the reviews (and after Walden Farms' peanut spread proved yucky, lol), but it's great! The taste and texture is just like peanut butter--I could kiss whoever came up with this, LOL.<br /><br />I don't like to waste food, so I have been mixing it with my Walden Farms' spread, which makes it that much less calorie, and it actually tastes good mixed together. Although I like the mixture of the two, PB2 is good enough and low cal enough on its own that I would recommend it to any peanut butter lover that wants to watch their caloric intake (like me!). I will definitely be purchasing it again.
