I really love this kit!  I use it once a day for lunch and it's also a favorite of my daughter.  All the products are high quality (in fact when I needed to replace them I bought some cheap stuff and then ended up going back for the more expensive....believe me, don't skimp).  I love the fact that it breaks everything down in the instructions.  If you are new to making sushi, I suggest this kit.  I am 100x faster and better that when I started as a novice.
