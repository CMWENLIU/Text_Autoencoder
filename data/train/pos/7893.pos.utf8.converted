I've made these brownies several times and they are awesome :) Are they sweet like a sugar laden brownie? No, they are more like the other vitamuffins in flavor as in they are not super sweet. I like them because they are good and full of nutrition while helping me stay on track with my diet. I would recommend getting the mixes, whether its the brownie mix or the muffin mix because they are *Significantly* cheaper that way. I can't afford anything from Vitalicious unless it's the mixes. Their prices are crazy high for my budget.<br /><br />I will buy these again and again.
