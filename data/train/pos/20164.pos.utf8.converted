I have tried many different types of pasta, whole wheat, spelt, gluten-free. This einkorn based pasta is tasty and is packed with protein and fiber. I like my pasta al dente, but I found that you have to cook it longer than is indicated on the package otherwise it's a bit too hard. I no longer feel guilty having some pasta!
