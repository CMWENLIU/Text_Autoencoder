I discovered this coffee at the New Pioneer Co-Op in Iowa City, and had resigned myself to a reality where it was only available in utopianist college towns and direct from the roaster. Imagine my delight when I found out its not only available through Amazon, but Prime eligible. I'm not kidding when I say this is some of the best news I've gotten in weeks, because this coffee is beyond awesome.<br /><br />Packed with flavor, but not overpowering - brimming with caffeine as advertised - this is quite possibly the best coffee in the universe. Bright, bold, strong. I have long fantasized about driving to Alaska just to see where this stuff is made... it is pilgrimage worthy, even from the lower 48.<br /><br />Six stars.
