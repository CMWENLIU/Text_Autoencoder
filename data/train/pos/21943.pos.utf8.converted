In short:<br />Switch is exactly what it tries to be.  It is a 100% juice with carbonation.  You pay for the carbonation, flavors and convenience.  I have found competitors tend to have a lower juice percentage and/or augment the juice with Splenda or similar alternate.  Just be aware of what you want.  If it is a carbonated, 100% juice drink, give Switch a try (or 24 if you grab the variety pack).<br /><br />Full Review:<br />I purchased the variety pack, with concern for spending so much on a gamble.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks and size.  It is a great treat every other day or so.  I think the 8oz size is perfect for accompanying a meal or on its own.  Like everyone, I have my favored flavors but there aren't any that I find undrinkable or unpleasant.<br /><br />I've seen/read some concerns over the calories/sugar/sweetness of the drinks that reviews say detract from the drink.  Quite frankly, I don't know if these reviewers know what is in fruit.  The only way to decrease these values is to remove the 100% fruit juice element which is half of this product, at least to me. (The other being carbonation)  I die a little every time I find a great looking product only to see the little Splenda logo.  If you like Splenda, more power (and products) to you :)  You can easily add water to this drink if the taste or stats are too much for you, but you can't subtract it, so I think Switch is perfect.<br /><br />Like many fruit juices, Switch uses grape and apple juice as fillers.  An example is the fruit juice order in the Orange Tangerine is "apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola"  I don't find the taste has suffered and I know the price is more manageable, from the use of apple and grape juice.<br /><br />Since there might be parents reading, I don't have kids, but believe it would be great for kids.  I know price is a concern, but I believe soda should be a treat not a staple food.  They are 8oz in place of the traditional 12oz of soda.  This gives your child less sugar (none refined) and a skinnier can to hold on to or package in a lunch box. (Also, no little straw to break off and get lost!)<br />I can't honestly tell you if I would have been willing to be different as a kid and have a Switch in place of a soda, but I know I definitely want it now.  If your kids don't want it in their lunch box, put it in yours. :)
