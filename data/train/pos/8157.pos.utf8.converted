This is my favorite coffee and it is difficult to get in the store.  I have been buying it through Amazon.com since March and it has gone from $32.00 to $44.00 in one month.  I finally called my local store and asked them if they would order it for me.  No problem.  Cheaper and will be waiting on me.  Sorry Amazon...you got too expensive.
