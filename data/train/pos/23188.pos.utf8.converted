This tuna will make you rethink those casserole and sandwich recipes.  Packed in good quality olive oil, it is tender and flavorful and tastes like -- well -- tuna!<br /><br />Cook your pasta, add your favorite sauce in a jar, and at the end, put in a can of this tuna (drained).  Don't break it up too much, just heat it through. Or just pile the tuna on a sandwich with a little mayo and some pickles on the side.<br /><br />I buy it by the case (much cheaper than in the Italian delis) and give it to people I really really like.
