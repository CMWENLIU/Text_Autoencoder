This is the BEST whole wheat pasta we've had, and trust me- we've tried most of them. My daughter, who is four years old and a SUPER picky eater, prefer this over her regular semolina pasta. Not only does it taste really great, it stands up to just about anything you subject it to- overcooking, baking with sauces, being sauteed in oil, refrigeration, etc.<br /><br />The bionaturae pastas all cook up lovely. And unlike other whole wheat pastas, there's no weird aftertaste or bitterness no matter how long you cook it for. No matter how al dente (or how tender) you like your pasta cooked, this pasta holds up to whatever you subject it to. We tend to like pasta more on the tender side, and the pasta retains its shape, doesn't disintegrate or get glue-y even after 12 minutes in boiling water. Holds on to sauces very nicely. Also refrigerates well after being mixed with sauces.<br /><br />The Penne Gigate is a nice pasta for everything from baked macaroni dishes to just a quick bowl of pasta with some chopped tomatoes and herbs tossed with it. Also great for pasta salads.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
