I by chance found this on the bottom row at a super Wal-Mart. I have tried a few other brands...some made from just corn and some from rice, but this company has got to be the best so far. It is just like eating regular pasta. I am hoping Amazon will carry it, but for now, I will just have to hope they are still being sold at Wal-Mart. Being allergic to gluten is not enjoyable. The alternatives that we find, most times are just not the same, so it was nice the night we sat down to dinner and discovered how good dinner was.
