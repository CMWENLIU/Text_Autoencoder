This is the best natural sugar replacement I've found.  It looks and feels just like sugar.  The taste is sugar-like, but less intensely sweet, which means you can either use it to wean yourself or someone else into less of a sweet tooth or you can use more Organic Zero than you would sugar, to get equal sweetness.<br /><br />It's healthy and doesn't give you either the chemical aftertaste of Splenda or the buzz-and-crash of sugar.  Love it!
