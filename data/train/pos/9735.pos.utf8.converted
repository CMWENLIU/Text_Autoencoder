I got hooked on Green Mountain Southern Pecan coffee when my husband and I lived in Maine. I stocked up on it when we moved back to the South and continued to order it in bulk until a couple of months ago when I got my Keurig. Brewing it one cup at a time is the next best thing to living in Maine and being able to go to just about any convenience store and take my pick of the flavors (I almost always chose Southern Pecan). I've ordered the K-cups from Amazon three times now and just placed my fourth order, the second with this company. The last arrived in record time and the price can't be beat--believe me, I've checked. Add in the free shipping and you have a definite winner!
