Update 5/4:<br />Culinary Elite brand on Amazon is a better value now over this brand ...Culinary Elite is peeled so you get WAY more black garlic for the price aince there are no cores and peels in the bag.And all those cloves are good quality. I liked this one but it took forever to peel, got wasted by peeling off and sticking to the stems and the cores and peels weighed as much as the garlic so I got about half the garlic for the price by the time I was done when they were in containers side by side.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />Yep, black garlic is addictive.<br /><br />When you get good cloves you can pop a whole clove in your mouth and chew. On this brand, I did have some bad cloves in the bag but most were really good.<br /><br />It takes one month to make a bulb of black garlic...although it's called "fermentation" it's far from anything else you'd think of as fermented. It is kept at a very low oven temp with high humidity for 30 days, wrapped.  This causes the bitterness and pungency of the garlic to subside and concentrates the sugars and antioxidants so you wind up with what tastes like a caramelized garlic or slightly balsamic reduction taste.  It's amazing...<br /><br />spread it on anything, heavy...I love to chop it up in green beans, many put it on a steak at fine restaurants so it's often seen there ( I don't eat steak so I cannot comment on this use, but apparently it's becoming a "thing".)  Mashed potatoes are a work of art.<br /><br />Anything you might sprinkle garlic on just goes to a whole new level with this flavor.<br /><br />The texture is entirely different as well, no more hard cloves, they become almost gel-like.
