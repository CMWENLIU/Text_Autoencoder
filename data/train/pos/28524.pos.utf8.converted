For years now we've eaten MaraNatha organic almond butter because I have a terrible peanut allergy.  I came on to amazon to see if I could order it cheap and found Barney Butter.  It's made in a peanut free facility (which is really hard to find these day)!!  And, it tastes just as good.  I will admit it is runner than MaraNatha but due to it's consistency it's easier to spread on bread.  I did have to stir it a little but not like normal almond butter.  I gave it five stars because it takes great and is much cheaper than MaraNatha.  Not to mention the almond only facility.  I will definitely be buying Barney Butter from now on.  I might try the crunchy next time too!!
