Vegan. Organic. Kosher parve. Fat Free. High protein. Beautiful small & very tender lentils in their own pre-cooked 'gravy.' Can just heat and serve. Great with organic brown or white rice. Easy 'dal' for any Indian meal. Add diced or chunky veggies to make your own creation. Made with organic lentils and sea salt only. 300 calories, 0g fat, and 24g protein per can. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also.
