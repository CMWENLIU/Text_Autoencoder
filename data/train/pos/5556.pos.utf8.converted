This product is great!  No one in our family is gluten/wheat intolerant, but I saw it at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  My little boys, 2 and 3 1/2, love it and ask for it all the time. It is super easy and quick to make. I definitely recommend adding a frozen veggie (we like edamame or lima beans), but cut up fresh tomatoes and avocado work well too--it really makes it into a meal.  We look forward to trying some of the other varieties soon.
