KIND PLUS Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio bars are very delicious.  I enjoy one bar and a glass of orange/carrot juice every morning.  Dr Oz recommends that you eat protein within the first hour after waking; you will get protein from this bar.  I really love the fresh taste and texture.  2012 UPDATE: I usually get bored with food, but not these bars!  I still have my juice and this Pom/Blue/Pistach bar every single morning for breakfast.  I don't kind-a-like KIND, I totally love it!!!
