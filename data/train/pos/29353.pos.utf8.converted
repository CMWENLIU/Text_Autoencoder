Once I tried Illy, everything else tasted just OK.  Truly an excellent coffee flavor - smooth, not bitter of overly strong.  And the price is lower than any store I've check and even better than ordering directly from Illy.  At a price of $13 per can, I was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping.  I love that I only have to order two at a time and it's delivered to my door!
