I am very happy with this product.  The 1 lb container will likely last for years because it takes so little to sweeten my food.  Both my husband and I use this in place of sugar in everything that doesn't require sugar for structure, (like some baked goods).  At first we felt that the sweetness was a little different than sugar but after 2 weeks, we cannot really tell the difference and find on fruit, like berries, it is enhances the fruit flavor in addition to adding a little sweetness, making it better than sugar.  We even had some watermelon that didn't have much flavor or sweetness and once I cut it up and sprinkled a pinch of stevia on it, it tasted like good watermelon.
