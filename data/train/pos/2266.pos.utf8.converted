I realize that people may think it's kind of expensive for coconut water, but it's at least twice the price where I live! If I had a coconut tree in my building than I wouldn't bother, but I don't! It is the best thing after a long workout or if you have forgotten to drink enough water during the day. It really saved me when I got really dehydrated. I recommend coconut water to everyone! And the light pineapple and citrus flavor is very nice. The original flavor is good too.
