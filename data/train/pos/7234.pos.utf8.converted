My Standard poodle is getting old. He is 12 now. His stools have been very difficult to clean up after- they are soft and often very loose. We tried it all, numerous Vet visits, enzyme and other blood tests, changing his diet to rice and lamb only...wet food, dry food. We have been going crazy trying to learn what will stay with this dog and keep him from having accidents...We tried this Wilderness dog food in the dry form and he loved it! In two days he was back to normal stools. We were worried about boredom with this diet as he seldom likes dry food but we have no trouble getting him to eat both the chicken and the duck varieties. I got a can or two of the same food in the wet formula and I add a spoon ful of it to the dry food. HIs bowels<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZNW346">Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food, Duck Recipe, 24-Pound Bag</a> are now back to normal and he is not suffering any longer. Two people mentioned recently to eliminate grains from his diet, even the Vet hadn't thought of that! Now, with his new grain free diet, the dog will be healthy and happy and so will his owners!
