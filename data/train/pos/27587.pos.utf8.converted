My yellow lab has both allergies and digestion issues.  We tried every type of dog food including lamb and rice and he couldn't tolerate it.  He finally was ok with venison and potato by Royal Canin but still had bouts of diahera and stomach pain.  We were very happy when we found Natural Balance venison and sweet potato.  Our lab no longer has any digestion issues and is doing great!  We also like the fact that they make a biscuit so he can also have a treat.  Amazon is great to order from.  We don't pay any shipping and the orders get here in good shape.
