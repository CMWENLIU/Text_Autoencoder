I haven;t tried other companies versions of wheat grass powder but this seems top notch.  It may be less expensive to grow on your own but you have to buy a grinder, and invest time into grinding time you want to take a shot.<br /><br />I mix this in my morning smoothie with bananas, blueberries, strawberries, spirulina powder, coconut oil, and protein powder.  It makes a pretty good smoothie I'd say.  When I first started I could feel the big energy boost throughout the day.  Now that I'm more accustomed to it I don't feel as much of the boost, but it feels good knowing I'm getting complete nutrition.
