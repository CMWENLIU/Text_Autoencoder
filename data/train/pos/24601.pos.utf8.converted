Okay, I am hooked on this stuff! They did an absolutely fantastic job of replicating traditional jerky texture and taste (but without the meat and all the MSG and preservatives). It is so tasty and healthy and you can literally eat it anytime...before workouts, or as a really healthy snack for me and the kids. The Hot N' Spicy and Ginger are my favorite flavours. I would like them to create a Spicy Ginger..yum! I would like to see greater availability, perhaps through local supermarkets, Trader Joes, and maybe even Costco/Sams Club (if their production would permit). The world needs more healthful tasty eats like these!
