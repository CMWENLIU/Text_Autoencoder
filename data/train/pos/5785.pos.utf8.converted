I bought this for Christmas for my wife who is from France. She was very surprised and said it was excellent. I would buy this Foie Gras again. This company sells different types of Foie Gras, they have a Grade A or B, they have de-veined and they have fully cooked. This was a Grade A which was not de-veined, but it only had 1 small vein in it which was very easy to remove. We spread this Foie Gras on toast and also cooked some on top of deer tenderloin & backstrap. I think this Fois Gras is the closest you'll get to the traditional French Foie Gras. It arrived in a styrofoam cooler box with 4 freezer packs in it and it was still cold when delivered. I give it a 5 stars and will buy it again.
