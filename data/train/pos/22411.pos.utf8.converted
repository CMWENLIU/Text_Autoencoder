I have been researching and studying canine nutrition since about 1988. Ironically, my interest sprang from a program that Hill's (makers of Science Diet) used to offer called the Small Animal Dietician program. I completed all levels that they offered and learned quite a bit about food, most especially, NOT to feed Science Diet, lol.<br />That being said, I have been showing and breeding dogs for over 20 years. I have tried virtually every high end food on the market: Core, EVO, The Honest Kitchen, Before Grain, Prairie, Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, California Natural....I could go on. The *extremely* high protein content in some of those foods can be quite dangerous, especially for puppies. I just had to euthanize my 3 year old Staffordshire Bull Terrier in December due to kidney failure, and I am certain it was brought on by being on Before Grain, Orijen & EVO as a puppy.<br />Chicken Soup is a fantastic food and a great value. I am currently feeding it to my Bullmastiff and 2 Chihuahuas, one of whom is almost 16 years old. It is my exclusive food now and as long as they don't change the formula, I see no reason to switch to another food again. The price for the quality of food in unbeatable. I'm very happy to see it offered on Amazon now with free shipping! Makes things even better!
