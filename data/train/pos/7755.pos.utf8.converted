Campbell's "CHUNKY Beef with Country Vegetables" is the best of the beef soups - a meal in a bowl, like beef stew. Shelf stable, so can sit around indefinately, ready for an emergency meal. We keep a case of this at our cabin. Not too salty, either, as soups usually are. It has 300 calories, 3.0 grams fat (no trans fat,) 42 carbs, 20 grams protein, 10 grams fiber, a perfect meal. Yes, it makes popping noises as it heats in the microwave, but the red lid is well vented, and there is no mess. Just give the hot soup a good stir and ENJOY!
