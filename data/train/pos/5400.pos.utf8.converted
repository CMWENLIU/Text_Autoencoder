I havent actually purchased these here yet, but I grew up with the Milk Brand in Europe, and I am SOO pleased to see them here for sale. All I can say is if your a chocolate lover, you WILL LOVE MILKA, its in no way close to any of the chocolate I've had here of just regular store brand typs. So if you need a small push, here it is, you wont regret it, I dont know anyone how doesnt absolutely love it when they taste it.
