I have been building up my gluten-free repertoire for some time now, but getting the sugar out of recipes has been a REAL HASSLE.  Stevia and Xylitol are both MUCH too sweet-tasting for me, although the glycemic load is lower.<br /><br />I also don't want carcinogenic chemicals as substitute sweeteners.<br /><br />I bought this product to try in my Easter Cake and it is DELICIOUS.  It hasn't elevated my blood sugar at all.  I will buy from Amazon using their subscription plan and lower my cost that way.<br /><br />UPDATE, December 2009: Because ZERO is expensive, I use half Zero, half organic sugar and this is an excellent way to reduce the glycemic load of most baked goods.  Most recipes start with way too much sugar, so I generally halve the total sugar to begin with, then use 50% ZERO and 50% sugar to fulfill the sweetness requirement for the product without murdering my budget.<br /><br />Best price off the shelf so far has been $10 per 12 oz. bag on sale at Whole Foods Market.  Check it out!<br /><br />THANK YOU, WHOLESOME for an excellent product.  Peace.
