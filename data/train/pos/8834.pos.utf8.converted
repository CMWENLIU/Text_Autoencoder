This is a delicious gluten-free bread and muffin mix; it is also free of potato and polysorbate.  No one would guess is gluten-free! I feel most oils are a more nutritious alternative to dairy-free margine, so I always use a different oil (walnut, almond, grapeseed, etc) and they all turn out delicious. I also substitute different sweeteners for the sugar such as maple syrup, honey, yacon syrup, date sugar, and coconut sugar and have been consistently very pleased. The bag also offers variations to make the following breads/muffins:  poppy see, blueberry, berry, zucchini, apple, banana bread, pumpkin, dried cranberry apple, carrot raisin, streusel, tropical, and chocolate chunk.<br /><br />The following information is from manufacturer's website and was missing on this webpage before I posted it in my review:  Create-Your-Own Quick Bread & Muffin Mix-NEW Net Wt. 14.75 oz (418 G)UPC 833330001184<br />MIX IS NOT PRE-SWEETENED<br />Description: vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg flavored mix.
