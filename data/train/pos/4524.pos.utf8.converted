It's quite the eclectic list of ingredients here...<br /><br />First, they have 4 meat products to start the product, which is among the best you will see anywhere. The grains they use afterwards are the types we like to see, such as rice and oatmeal. There aren't any cheap fillers like corn, soy or wheat.<br /><br />There are potatoes for a high-quality carb source, and eggs for further protein. Duck and salmon are somewhat far down the list, but they only add to the variety of meat sources in this food. Plus, look at the fruits and veggies: carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries and spinach. It's hard to beat that.<br /><br />All of this in a food that is VERY reasonably priced!
