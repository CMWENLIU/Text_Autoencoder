I am trying to get more natural and healthy foods and that started me on a journey to finding Barney Butter. First I started with natural peanut butters but found that peanuts are a natural inflammatory product. I don't want to promote inflammation or add to pains I already have so someone suggested almond butter.<br /><br />I tried a variety of almond butters but I have my own taste expectations. I started looking for something that was made in an almond only facility, did not have to be stirred, had a little bit of sweetness, was NOT gritty, and had the "right" kind of palm oil. The palm "fruit" oil is the good healthy kind of oil and the palm "kernel" oil is the bad. Most of the non stir butters have the palm kernel oil.<br /><br />In my Googling I eventually found barney butter and it had all my requirements. It already has a touch of sweetness added to it and all I had left to taste it and see if it lived up to what I was expecting. I found it at my local Publix grocery store and tried it. I give it a big thumbs up! Right out of the jar, with no "doctoring up" it tastes ready to eat. No stirring and slightly sweet. A real winner.<br /><br />The grocery does not seen to stock it very well and is often out of stock, so now I am buying it on Amazon and that makes it even easier. The purists who want nothing but almonds can find that in another brand, but I always had to FIX those brands in my Vitamix and doctor them up to be blended well and taste right. Now I just buy the Barney Butter and I'm done. They deserve the business. They use the almonds ONLY with no husk, the right and healthy kind of palm oil that is actually good for us to eat, and add a twinge of sweetness to it. It's a terrific product - well done.
