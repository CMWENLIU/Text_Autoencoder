I don't even know where to begin to express my relief in finding this tea! I've been determined to exclusively breastfeed my daughter since she was born and was doing so with no problem until I got mastitis. 2 weeks of antibiotics and pumping & dumping took a toll on my supply, especially when my daughter got used to the bottle. At three months my supply went down to about 14oz total all day. I had to start supplementing which I hated and was almost in tears for a week as I watched my supply get lower and lower. i was told about this tea by a nutritionist and it's been a Godsend! My milk is up to almost twice as much from just having one or two cups a day. I'll admit that i'm not crazy about the flavor. Tastes like black licorice which I hate, but it's definitely drinkable. I just drink it cold with lemon and sugar and hold my breath. I'm a believer now and would recommend it to anyone!
