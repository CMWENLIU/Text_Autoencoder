I had tried this tea when I bought it in a grocery store and like all revolution teas, it was not cheap!! Buying it on amazon let me buy more of it at less cost.<br /><br />I love this tea - it's very subtle - delicate earl grey flavors with a hint (HINT) of lavender. the other lavender earl grey's i've tried have been much too heavy on the lavender side. This one has a nice blend of both. It needs just a hint of sweetener or sugar/honey and it's perfect. It's good with milk or without. It is a black tea so has caffeine, but it's still relaxing - perfect for a stressful day at work where you don't want to be tired but want something mentally soothing.
