I bought Nutiva X-Virgin Organic Coconut Oil for the first time because of numerous possible Health Benefits. The reviews on this Brand were great except for one that discourages using anything in plastic. Researching that, it appears that inside the recycling symbol, Nutiva container has the number 2 which is considered safe. The numbers 2-4-5 are considered safe, number 1, which is most water bottles, is considered safe but not for re-use, and the numbers 3-6-7 are considered unsafe. Most Foam cups are number 6, many 5 gallon water bottles are number 7. Also, although there are microwavable containers, it is not recommended to Nuke plastics. Hope this helps any concerns.
