these are delicious and full of green foods-what could be bad? my daughters fight over these bars, i had to get a case. the flavors are natural and realistic, not too sweet. true, the chocolate coating may melt in a toddler's hand or on their face, but that always happens.  i keep them in the fridge to keep that at bay. enjoy!
