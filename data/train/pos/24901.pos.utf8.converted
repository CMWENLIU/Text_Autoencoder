For mom's on a budget, this is a nice sized package of variety fruit snacks for a great price. The kids always fight over the gushers, which leaves me more fruit by the foot to eat. The kids can have the neon colored fruit by the foot and roll ups snacks while I hide the strawberry fruit by the foot and roll ups for myself. Worth the buy and no running to the store while they are on sale hoping there are some left.
