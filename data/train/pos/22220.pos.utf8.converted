You are receiving this from the world's biggest skeptic. My 13-year-old son convinced me to buy four of your Brain Toniq drinks at Wholefoods even though I told him it was a big joke to think a drink could make you focus any clearer or have any positive effect whatsoever. We each drank one of your drinks around 2:30 pm. I couldn not believe it--I felt clear headed, in a great mood all afternoon and evening. I felt "sharp" in two business meetings that afternoon and actually forgot I had taken one of the drinks. My 17-year-old son commented about my great mood and why was I so happy? It was then that it dawned on me that my day was no different than most, except for the Brain Toniq drink. My skeptism kicked in again. The drink could not be responsible for how I felt.<br /><br />So the next day I took another one of the drinks and again, same great mood, same happy feeling, same sharpness of thought and my entire family noticed. Wow! If anyone thinks this is just another marketing ploy or scam to get people to buy some kind of energy drink, forget it...this is the REAL deal. You have my permission to let anyone read my email to you or even inquire with me! Finally a company that actually delivers on their promise. Thank you so much!
