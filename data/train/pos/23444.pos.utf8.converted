I first bought Coconut oil at the health food store and spent ten bucks for a 16 ounce container. Once I realized the flexibility and benefits of coconut oil, I wanted a better price. This is it. Though this price varies (I've spent in the range 35-45 dollars for 128 ounces on Amazon which amounts to a significant drop in cost to what I paid locally.)the price is right.<br /><br />I've had one container that had hard, tiny beads of coconut oil, but it still did what it was supposed to do, though they were a little more resistant to melting. Otherwise, in the three batches we've purchased, this is the only minor complaint.<br /><br />I use it to replace shortening, or to fry, and it's perfect for baking. The coconut flavor is there, but it's subtle. If you hate the flavor of coconut you might want to think twice. I thought I did, but the more I started thinking along the lines of embracing coconut I realized the texture of shredded coconut was what I had issues with. Coconut oil makes delicious stove popped popcorn that doesn't need butter for more flavor ...it ends up with kind of a sweet/buttery taste. Cookies, brownies, etc are delicious with coconut oil replacing butter or margarine.<br /><br />This product is also my only moisturizer and lotion of choice. We scoop some out of the main container (into a recycled hummus jar, short, with a wide mouth) and store it in the bathroom. This past winter, before I started using coconut oil as a moisturizer/lotion, my skin was painfully dry. I drink lots of water, and I was using different products, but my skin was not happy. Seriously, Coconut oil is the best. It soaks in quickly, though not immediately, and it really took care of the itchy dry. I was a little more concerned about my face. But my skin was so dry I felt like smiling would crack my face, so I dove in and tried it. Perfect. Again, it doesn't soak in immediately. I put it on, get dressed, do my hair, then apply my makeup. My foundation brush has sucked up some of the oil so I'll need to replace those maybe sooner than I would otherwise. But for a facial moisturizer that works as well as anything I've ever tried and costs about $.35 an ounce...I think I can live with that. I also haven't had any clogging of pores and I'm an aging T-Zone skin.
