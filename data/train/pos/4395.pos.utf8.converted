If you like a strong coffee, this is for you.  Most K Cups I've tried are too weak, with the exception of Newmans Own Extra Bold, which I like.  However the Starbucks is even better than Newman's, the smell of the coffee wafts through the house.  It will be really hard to drink any other kind after trying this!
