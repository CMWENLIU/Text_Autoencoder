I'm one of those people who feels I should like dark roasts more than I do, as I am always a fan of strong flavors in food and drink. But somehow dark roast coffees have always been more challenging than rewarding for me, and I usually end up retreating to the milder roasts.<br /><br />This is now my third order of Midnight Magic. The first time I ordered it I thought it was really terrific, but what really impressed me was that nearly everyone I made a cup for had the same reaction: they'd look surprised and say, "Wow, this is REALLY good coffee!"<br /><br />Dark roasts can so often just taste burned, but there truly is something different about this roast. It is rich and complex, as you'd expect. But it is never acidic or burned in flavor. I can finally say that I have found a dark roast that rewards rather than challenges.
