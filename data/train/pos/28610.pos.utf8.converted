I am a huge fan of Ruth's Hemp Protein Powders, in this blend with Flax and Maca you get a ton of great nutrients and the boost of Maca (which is a good energy source).  I use this with 10oz of almond milk, 5-6 frozen strawberries and a 1/2 frozen banana (Blended up in my Vitamix).  The only thing about this powder is that it does have a distinct taste, I like it but some may not. If you do find you like the taste, you'll be hard pressed to find a better protein powder on the market!
