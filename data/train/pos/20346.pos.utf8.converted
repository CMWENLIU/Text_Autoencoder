I love Bleu Cheese...I really do...I'm not a big fan of Bleu Cheese dressing, but if I make a salad I will make a light dressing of lemon, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar and then crumble blue cheese in with the salad. Oh, dang...it is like heaven...well, I hope not, because even though I really like bleu cheese, it kinduv smells like dirty feet and it would be a drag gettin' to Heaven and having it smell like dirty feet.<br /><br />So buy a block of this cheese and put it on some really good crackers...or better yet, barbecue a tri-tip at a real low, even heat for a few hours and then slice it real thin and put the meat on hot, garlic infused ciabatta bread drizzle with olive oil, top with fresh rosemary and sliced bleu cheese and eat with sliced hot house cucumbers and a frosty mug of a light ale...that's good eatin', right there.<br /><br />Oh, dang...I'm hungry now and all I have is Velveeta. Is this some kind of sick joke?<br /><br />Peace and blessings, people...<br /><br />=)
