Although I like to try lots of different olive oils to explore the many and varied flavors, if I had to choose just one, it would probably be Laudemio, from one of the greatest wine estates of Tuscany, the Marchesi di Frescobaldi. Laudemio is produced from early harvested Tuscan varieties of Frantoio, Moraiolo and Leccino olives grown and pressed on Frescobaldi's hillside estate in Chianti Rufina.  What makes Laudemio so special is that it combines the best of the classic, "grippy" style of the best Tuscan olive oil with the softer, more buttery notes more typical of the better olive oils from southern Italy and Spain. That makes it great not only for drizzling over grilled meats and vegetables, but for dipping in your favorite loaf of crusty Italian or French bread.  Clear and intensely green, fruity, full, well-rounded and spicy, this dark olive- green has subtle floral and mineral aromas, and it is full -bodied and peppery, with a very fresh and lively after taste. It is a classic olive oil of the highest quality, and I highly recommend it.
