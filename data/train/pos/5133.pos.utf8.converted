I have tried numerous protein bars and all have that lovely aftertaste like I just ate cardboard covered in multivitamins....but not this one!!  This one is absolutley wonderful.  I am a hairdresser and there are a lot of days where I dont eat at all because I am booked back to back, so I have been looking for not only something that tastes good but will be relativley healthy and keep the hunger pains away and I have forund all of the above with these bars!  Again, I love them....just saying.
