My 5 year old Yorkshire Terrier, Molly, was diagnosed with a serious bowel disorder and according to my vet, had maybe a year to live after being put on prednisone to control the disorder.  After much research, I found Dr Harvey's Canine Health and Molly quickly adapted to the food instantly.  I literally changed her over to Dr Harvey's food in one day and her diarrhea problems subsided and have been gone for almost a year now; WITHOUT the prednisone; which would have eventually shortened her life.  With Dr Harvey's Canine Health and some recommended supplements she is well and thriving.  It really is easy to fix and she gobbles it up every day.  I would give it ten stars if I could!!!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B185I6">Dr. Harveys Canine Health - 5 lbs</a>
