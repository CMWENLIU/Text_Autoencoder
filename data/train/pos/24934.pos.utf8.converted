I tried this product for the first time off Amazon, and must say that before, I have always used the Really Raw Honey.  Well, I hate that kind because it has all the " Crown" on top which can be parts of bees like wings, etc.. GROSS! So, I always scrap it off and trash it.  But then I tried this one and it has a wonderful flavor and no "crown"  it even has a more floral flavor.  A wonderful product!
