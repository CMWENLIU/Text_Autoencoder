I have a 6 year-old black lab mix and a 2 year-old lhasa-poo that were both having major allergy issues...they would puke every day on Iams, Eukanuba and even the low-res stuff the vet gave me.  I tried a pre-packaged raw diet, but it was a bit pricey for 3 dogs.  I found this one and I'll never go back to another.  I haven't had any issues with this one in the year they've been on it...my dogs love it and my third black lab has the most BEAUTIFUL coat!  I'm extremely happy with the results of this food!
