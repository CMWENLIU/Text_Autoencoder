Finally! A hunger satisfaction product that actually works and tastes great, too. One of my main problems when I am on a diet is that I am constantly hungry. I've tried so many other products that claim to reduce hunger, yet I don't notice any real effects. However, this Crystal Light product does reduce my hunger pangs and enables me to go longer between meals. The instructions indicate the powder should be mixed with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but I find the flavor a bit strong, so I usually mix it with a 20 ounce bottle. The strawberry-banana flavor is very fruity and I can't discern any chemical or artificial aftertaste. I take this with me on trips, it's great for avoiding the temptations of airport fast food. I also mix it into liquid diet meals for a boost of fiber. It doesn't blend particularly well with anything other than water, so I use a blender for this. Even with water, you have to shake the bottle vigorously, but it does blend well with vigorous shaking. All in all, this has really helped me to be more successful on my diet.
