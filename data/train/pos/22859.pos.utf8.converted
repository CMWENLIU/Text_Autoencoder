My dog was having a lot of digestive problems with her old food and I started researching online for a good quality one. I started giving her Taste of the Wild around a month ago. I mix her dry food (same brand and flavor)mixed with 2 Tbsp of the wet food and I can tell she loves it! Her bowl movements are now perfect (if you can say that about them), twice a day, formed and easy to pick up.<br />One important thing to mention is that this food has lower calories than your regular food, so read the label and find out how many cups or cans you need to give your dog... and adjust if necessary!
