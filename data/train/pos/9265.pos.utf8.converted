I am a candy bar addict and a sugar junkie, and when I head to the candy bar isle at the local Quicky-Mart I always pick up a 5th Avenue.<br /><br />5th Avenue is a wondeful blend of chocolate, peanut butter and crunch that will leave you hungry for more. 5th Avenue is unlike any other cany bar on the market, and if you've never tried one...do yourself a big favor. You won't regret it! Yum!<br /><br />Some history on the candy bar from Hershey's:<br /><br />William H. Luden (1859-1949) launched his fledgling candy business in 1879 and offered an extensive line, including cough drops, hard and soft candies, chocolates and marshmallow products. Unlike many confectioners during that time, Luden manufactured his own chocolate for his chocolate novelties and chocolate-coated candies. In 1936, he introduced the 5TH AVENUE candy bar, a milk chocolate bar with a crunchy peanut butter center.<br /><br />World War II forced Luden's to concentrate production efforts on Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bars for military use. Immediately following the war, Luden's reverted to producing a full line of confectionery products including the famous Luden's menthol throat drops and 5TH AVENUE candy bar, as well as penny candy consisting of ladyfingers, pillowcases, mint patties, penny jujube novelties, penny hard candy, penny coconut novelties, cast marshmallow novelties, and a line of penny sugar-rolled jellies.<br /><br />Timeline<br /><br />1859  William H.
