I began using Chef Paul's Magic Seasoning blends 3 yrs ago. This salt free product is THE BOMB.<br />Plenty of flavor--but no salt. It's perfect for adding that extra kick to a recipe without making it taste too salty.<br />I use it in my traditional Chex Party Mix this time of year. It's great on chicken, hamburgers, just about any type of meat.<br /><br />LOVE IT
