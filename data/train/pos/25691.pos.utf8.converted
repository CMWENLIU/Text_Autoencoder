I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday, as he is an avid lover of Double Bubble gumballs. They taste exactly the same as the regular pieces of gum, and arrived safely at my apartment. He is now the most envied person at work with all his gum.<br /><br />To those who say the flavor doesn't last--have you never heard of Double Bubble? It NEVER was able to keep its flavor, that was the fun of it. Silly people!
