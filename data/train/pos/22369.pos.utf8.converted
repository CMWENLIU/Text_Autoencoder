This miso is a tremendous value and it makes a wonderful broth for miso soup.  To make a mug of miso broth, I simply boil water and add about 1 tbsp. of Maine Coast of Sea Vegetables Dulse (dried and minced) and a very generously rounded teaspoon of miso.  I pour boiling water (very warm water would work fine also) into a mug, then I use a whisk to blend the miso in the water.  It tastes outstanding, it's healthy (dulse has 330% of DV of iodine) and it really staves off hunger for a long time!  Enjoy!  Add small cubes of tofu and the chopped ends from scallions and you have an authentic miso soup.  I also found that adding a few drops of toasted sesame oil to the broth adds some "complexity" to the flavors. Don't boil the miso in the water.  It needs to be added afterward in order to maintain it's nutritional value.  This miso will last for a very long time stored in the refrigerator.  You'll probably want to put the plastic package in an airtight container.
