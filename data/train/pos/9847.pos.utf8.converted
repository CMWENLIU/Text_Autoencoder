We have 3 long haired cats and have tried every litter box under the sun that promised "no tracking".  This system is the first that truly delivered.  WE still get a few pellets outside the boxes but they are easy to pick up with our hand vacuum.<br />We've been using the system for 4 months now and here are some tricks we found to make it work. We find that Pet Fresh (made by Arm & Hammer and usually used for carpets is a BIG help in keeping the odors under control. It's really cheap too.)<br /><br />1. Right after they go number 2, we sprinkle Pet Fresh on it.  This is because one of our cats doesn't cover his poops after he goes. The scoop works best after they have a chance to dry out a little.<br /><br />2. The loose stool issue.  It can be a real mess trying to get them out with a scoop.  I found that using paper towels or toilet paper to pick them up is the easiest and cleanest way to get them out.<br /><br />3. The pan that holds the pads starts to retain the smell of urine after a month or 2.  Solution:  Sprinkle Pet Fresh on the pan, then put the pad in the pan.<br /><br />4.  Issue: the sides of the pan start to smell and poop gets stuck to it. Solution:  We keep Wipes, paper towels and spray cleaner near the box and wipe the box and scoop whenever it gets dirty.<br /><br />5.  Expense:  We have found that if we look out for coupons and sales we can get the pads for about a dollar each and the pellets last a month in each box.  We used to change the litter ever week and went through so much that we have found this system to actually be cheaper.  The worst place to buy the pellets and pads is Petco  - they are triple the price. Best place for us has been Target and Stop & Shop - we stock up when they are on sale.<br /><br />6.  Transitioning: It took us almost a month of increasing adding the pellets to the old litter.  Every time we scooped the old litter we added more pellets.  The whole time we had the new system right next to the old one. By the time the old system was almost all pellets they were using both so we got more breezes and got rid of the old. We did have a couple times where they went outside the box, but that was it.<br /><br />It wasn't easy to change, but to not have litter and urine tracked all over the house is such a god send that it was well worth the trouble.  My greatest fear is that they might stop making the refills!  I was glad to read that someone said you could use the system without with the pads if you dump the urine every day.  That would be not be ideal but it's nice to know it works.  I was also thinking you could use doggie pee pads if necessary. As for the pellets, I'm going to try "Yesterdays' News" pellets and see if they would work.  or may even tiny river rocks that are washable?  washable pellets you don't have to replace would be awesome for the environment.  Trouble is they won't get to make as money off them - but I"m going to be on the look out for something that works!
