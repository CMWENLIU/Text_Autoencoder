The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives (the food, in fact, contains ingredients that have never been frozen and so it is vacuum-sealed in the packaging--which incidentally makes the bag quite easy to carry). I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />Since it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content--which is used as a filler in all your standard grocery-store dog foods because corn is so cheap), I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. I swear I laugh every time she does it. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly. Husky's usually "blow their coat" once or twice a year with mild/standard shedding in-between; it was this mild/standard shedding that decreased.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.<br /><br />(Edited for typos and some added content).
