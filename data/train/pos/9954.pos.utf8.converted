I orderded my first bonsai plant ever in my entire life online and I have to say I was rather onedge as to how it would arrive or be packed.<br /><br />Well I live in the Great Northwest where it is plenty cold and my plant arived at my place of work and was placed in my wharehouse by UPS and it was there for a day before I arrived back to work.<br /><br />Never the less it arrived in perfect health and was packaged very well indeed and I was impressed to say the least.<br /><br />I think this bonsai is absolutley fantastic and I give a five star thumbs up to buussel's and amazon for a terrific product.<br /><br />In fact I loved it so much that I just now placed my second order for another plant on this 8th day of January 2006 and I have no doubts that it will be just as nice if not better than the first.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product and I will continue to order more for my own personal collection I'm absolutley that impressed.<br /><br />Thanks to all invloved.
