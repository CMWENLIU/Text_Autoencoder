For the price, you can't beat it.  I love honey that has a distinctive smell, whether it's flowery or grassy or...  This smells clean, flowery and intense.  I actually don't like honey that's too mild.  If you add this in tea, you can still smell the honey.  You'll also like it if you just add a spoonful in plain hot water.  On top of all this, the raw honey is certified organic.  Somehow, I feel safer using certified organic products without the added pesticides and whatnots.  You'll also be helping the environment and the people who are working in these farms.  A definite 5 star product!  I actually used to buy this honey from Whole Foods Supermarket at a much more expensive price.
