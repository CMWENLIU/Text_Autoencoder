My mother and I just had our own mini chocolate tasting party.  Each of the bars has its own distinct flavor, and we had a wonderful time identifying all of the different subtle flavors present in the chocolate bars -- Amano chocolate bars are rich, strong, chocolate.  Not too sweet and not too bitter.  The perfect dark chocolate. Worth every penny.
