This bowl arrived quickly, but it was safely packed inside an attractive box. The glaze is a very reflective black with a single, subtle cloud-like accent mark for character. I was drying the bowl upside down today and noticed a seashell-like design at the bottom which may indicate who made the piece or it may just be a nice flourish. It's really amazing the quality that went into the piece for this price, my bowl is just as perfectly crafted as the one in the picture. If you zoom in on the picture you can really see the quality of the glaze, it's especially evident in the blue-cream accent mark but also the perfectly smooth piece as a whole. A handmade piece like this never depreciates in price and would cost much more if purchased at a retail store, that's why it would make an excellent gift for anyone interested in tea, Japan, pottery, or just quality housewares.
