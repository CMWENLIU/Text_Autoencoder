If you're looking for genuine Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil, you're looking at the right product.<br /><br />Styrian pumpkinseed oil is pressed from the seeds of Styrian pumpkins, which grow only in Styria, Austria.<br /><br />My husband grew up eating salads dressed with a simple pumpkinseed and vinegar dressing, and raved about it for years. His grandmother would visit "the old country" every few years, leaving America with a suitcase full of Levi's and coming home with a suitcase full of meats and cheeses. One thing she always brought back was plain plastic bottles filled with this nutty green oil.<br /><br />After scouring every grocery store I went to for years on end, I finally caved and bought this very expensive bottle of oil. When he saw it his face lit up. When he sniffed it he drooled. Yesterday I made him a salad with it as a dressing, and he just about died.<br /><br />This is the real thing. If you want pumpkinseed oil, you will not be disappointed. There is nothing else like it.<br /><br />The shipping was pretty hefty, at $10 for the single bottle. I assumed that was because it was coming right from Austria and was a little dismayed when I saw my box came from right here in the States. It was so well packaged, though, that it was worth it. If the bottle had been broken I'd have been far more upset.
