This stuff is awesome, I am a diabetic and so this sugar free rockstar is great for me. I love the buzz it gives me in the morning. Suffice to say this drink has less caffeine than 2 cups of coffee. My husband and many other people I know drink way more than that during the day. So the caffeine if anybody is worried about that is not really that much. The FDA recommends a person consume no more than 300mg of caffeine in a day. I don't drink coffee (Yuk) and I don't drink soda so I don't have to worry about that. I wouldn't have more than two of these a day though. Each can contains 160mg of caffeine. The taste of this is soooo much better than red bull (should be called red butt). Anyway I can't live without this stuff now!
