I love this vanilla stevia.  I use it and other flavored stevias from the same company to flavor and sweeten naturally carbonated water (Perrier).  In fact it tastes good even in plain filtered water--not necessarily carbonated.  Also delicious in herbal teas.  These drinks with these flavored stevias really did get me off my soda addiction.  Previously I just couldn't give up the soda.  Now I love these stevia-flavored drinks so much I don't even miss the sodas.
