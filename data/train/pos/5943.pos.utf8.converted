I first made this product a recurring purchase about 9 months ago, after realizing the benefit of frequent gum-chewing. (I took to chewing several times per day - typically after meals when tooth-brushing isn't practical).<br /><br />Went from buying cinnamon Altoids gum at Trader Joe's, to buying this Spry brand from xlear.com, then switched my buying to Amazon.com, when I saw the potential cost savings.<br /><br />What can I say? Useful product at a good price from a reliable retailer - all at a lower cost than ever. Can't ask for more than that!<br /><br />My only "word of caution" would be: if you're single & don't share your gum a lot or if you just don't chew so often, you may find the product hardening over time; something that can't be helped, of course. Solutions? Chew more gum, be more generous, or buy a smaller tub. (c:
