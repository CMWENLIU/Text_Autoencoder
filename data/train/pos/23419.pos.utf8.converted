It all started when a co-worker and I found a trade show branded super ball in a forgotten box of office supplies. You know - you throw it, it bounces - it's all fun and whatnot. We got a coffee break's worth of entertainment out of it before we moved on and forgot about it.<br /><br />Well, I never forgot about it. I jumped on Amazon where I found these bad boys (seriously, what _can't_ you buy here?!), and they shipped in just a few days. I brought the bag in to the office a couple weeks ago, just for fun. Since then, I'm quite surprised that we haven't gotten fired with all the crazy pranks and games we've come up with. From rigging them to fall when the door is opened, to hiding them in the mini-fridge for an after lunch store-the-leftovers WTF, we've certainly gotten every cent worth of entertainment out of these things.<br /><br />Sure, we made up games to pass the time during rainy lunch breaks (I bet you can't bounce it from the whiteboard to the wall, off the window and into the trash can), but the situation quickly devolved into all-out war. Some afternoons start out mildly enough with a simple game of double-bounce into the coffee mug, but wind up with tables overturned and 250 bouncy balls flying at near-mach speeds to land squarely between the eyes of a hopeless co-worker. I don't care that you volunteered to implement the latest changes to the product at the last sub-committee meeting; when the super balls come out, there are no friends anymore.<br /><br />At any rate, I don't know what you're expecting when you buy a bag of bouncy balls on the Internet for eight cents apiece, but trust me, whatever your plans, it's worth it.
