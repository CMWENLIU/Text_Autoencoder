This is the best coffee ive ever had: hands down<br /><br />oily, aromatic, dark beans<br /><br />opening the bag was a pivotal moment in my life.  the aroma hit my like a sack of brick.  i wanted to roll around in a pile of these beans.<br /><br />the coffee i brewed was even more amazing.  the perfect medium body: the coffee i had been searching for.  oh how many other coffees i had tried before finding the blue mountain beans!!!<br /><br />i would just love to drink this everyday of my life, however the price excludes this reality.<br /><br />dont kid yourself, dont keep yourself away from this coffee.  try it at some point in your life.  have your friends over and share the experience.<br /><br />5/5
