I am very pleased to have found an all natural treatment for so many conditions. I have used this honey for a nasal staph infection I had that wouldn't go away with oral antibiotics.  I felt completely safe using honey rather than artificial ingredients inside my nose.  After using manuka for a week, the staph infection cleared up. I've used this honey for cuts, burns and any kind of rash (as a massage therapist, I've picked up a few skin conditions) that develops and it has never failed to heal them.  When used internally, it's helpful for fighting off colds or at the very least, cutting its duration.  This is an amazing product!
