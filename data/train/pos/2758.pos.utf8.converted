I can't open this bag.  It is just too beautiful.  Five glorious pounds of gummi.  It sits on my kitchen table.  The rainbow of colors twinkling in the sunlight.  Every time I get close to picking this HUGE bag up, my heart starts racing.<br /><br />These Gummis were made in Turkey and imported into Baltimore.<br /><br />The bag is not resealable so ensure you have some tupperware or a resealable bag when you open it.  A resealable bag is a must.  Gummis that have been exposed to air will harden and lose flavor.  To waste a single, solitary gummi would be a crime.<br /><br />For those who track such things, the average gummi serving is 17 pieces.  That serving will get you 140 calories.  With FIVE pounds of gummis, you will be counting all night long.<br /><br />It takes, on average, approximately 45 minutes for a gummi to melt away in your mouth -- that is, if you can keep it in your mouth that long.  Most people, myself included, will immediately start chewing on the gummi to get at the tasty fruit flavors.<br /><br />Speaking of flavors, let's talk about the goodness that goes into a gummi.  There are many ingredients:  Corn Syrup, Sugar, Gelatin, Dextrose, Citric Acid, Starch, Artificial and Natural Flavors, Fractionated Coconut Oil, Caarnauba Wax, Beeswax Coating, and Artificial Colors -- Yellow 4, Red 40, and Blue 1.<br /><br />I'm not sure how they cram all those ingredients into a gummi less than an inch tall and a 1/4 wide...but they do...and it tastes amazing.<br /><br />Even now, as I write this review, I'm enjoying a pair of gummis.  My mouth is doing a dance as I type.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
