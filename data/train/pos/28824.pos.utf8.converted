I should have named my Yellow Lab Thief because he seeks only to kill and destroy. (Gospel of John 10:10). He ate the outlets off the back of my house. He ate part of my car...You get the idea. The only toys  he can play with are the solid Nylabone (no rubber , no matter how hard). He even breaks through bones and figured out how to chew the top off a Kong to get the treat inside. But he loves hidden treats. So I begged Nylabone to make a hollow Nylabone and sure enough they did. My Lab absolutely LOVES it. He carries it around and the only thing that comes close is his Frisbee. Can't recommend this enough. There are plenty of teeth marks on the trunk but it's still great and keeps him busy trying to get treats out of the "log." I even tweeted Nylabone a photo. This is literally just what I asked for? You'll love how your furry friend will love it!
