It's a good replacement for olive oil in sous vide cooking (where the olive oil, cooked at low temperatures for a long time, takes on a metallic, or even bloody, taste). Good quality oil with just a bit more flavor than the (cheaper) Costco grapeseed oil. I prefer olive oil for dressings and the like, but prefer to cook with grapeseed oil.
