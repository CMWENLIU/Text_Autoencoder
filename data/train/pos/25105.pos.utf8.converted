I recently bought a Senseo machine and the Douwe Egberts Coffee pods.  The pods make a full-flavored decaf that is very enjoyable.  I agree the medium roast and mild roast are weak sisters compared to the dark roast.  <p>Medium is what several of my guests prefer, however.  I use the dark for myself and they all make a very good cuppa joe. MUCH better than my drip machine, and a lot easier to use than my espresso maker.
