I was looking for a healthier alternative to my favorite Campbell's soups (Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken). I was THRILLED when I saw Pacific came out with these condensed soups! Yay! I bought them on sale and the price was only .50 more than Campbells. So I gave it a try.<br /><br />They are excellent! And a lot more healthy for you than the competition.<br /><br />Here is my rebuttal to the person who gave this soup only 1 star:<br /><br />I have the box in front of me right now. It DOES list the sodium content. It's 850mg per serving, and there are 3 servings per box. I also have the Campbell's Cream of Chicken nutritional values in front of me. The sodium for Campbell's is 870 mg, which is more than Pacific's. Campbells has about 2.5 servings per can. (See for yourself: http://www.campbellsoup.com/condensed_soups_product_details.aspx?prd_product_id=2326&family=classic )<br /><br />Here's the deal. Not only are you helping the environment by choosing Pacific's soups, but the list of ingredients are way more healthy for you. Take a look:<br /><br />Pacific Organic Cream of Chicken, Condensed Soup<br />organic chicken broth<br />organic creme fraiche<br />organic rice starch<br />organic cooked chicken<br />organic rice flour<br />sea salts<br />organic chicken fat<br />organic garlic powder<br />organic onion powder<br /><br />Campbell's Condensed Soup: Cream of Chicken Soup<br />chicken stock<br />water<br />modified food starch<br />wheat flour<br />cream<br />dehydrated chicken<br />soy protein concentrate<br />MSG<br />chicken fat<br />yeast extract<br />flavoring<br />beta carotene (for color)<br />chicken flavor<br />partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil<br />butter<br /><br />I would tend to disagree. This IS a Healthy choice!!<br /><br />Andrea
