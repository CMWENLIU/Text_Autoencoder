While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. For the price, you can't do better--it's affordable, easy, and fun to make!<br /><br />The panang curry has a nice mellow flavor with some spice and goes quite well with seafood. Some great compliments to this sauce: scallops, shrimp, squid, and fish; if you add all of these, you get an insanely tasy, luxurious meal. Another thing you can do is add a hint of thai basil to cook with all this--it gives it an extra authentic feel and works well with the overall dish!
