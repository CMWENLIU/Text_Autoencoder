In my opinion, the best way to make a cup (or more cups, using a larger filter), is to use a first-class paper filter inserted into a reusable filter cone and throw away the filter and the coffee grounds after it is used. Melitta makes the best single-use paper filters. I regularly use the #4 filter made of Natural Brown paper, with a ceramic #4 filter cone. This pack of 600 of these filters (in 6 boxes) was by far the best buy of these name brand filters that I could find. Kudos to Amazon for providing these in the smallest possible package!
