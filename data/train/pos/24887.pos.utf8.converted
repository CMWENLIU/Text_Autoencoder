I had several of the carousel type K-cup holders. When I saw this, I knew I could get rid of those and make more room on my counter. This item does just that. Since my brewer sits right on the top of the "drawer".  It is well made and holds 36 k-cups...more than the carousel type.  I highly recommend this item.
