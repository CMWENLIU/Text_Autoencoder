I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend<br />Tully's French Roast Coffee<br />Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend<br />Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Black Gold Extra Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven:<br /><br />Tully's Full City Roast Coffee<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend<br />Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic Extra Bold<br />Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0TZO4">Sharpie</a>, of course, "Breakfast", "Lunch" and "Dinner". So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors I'm going to wind up with.<br /><br />I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip.<br /><br />I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on caffeine. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.
