I've tried many brands of coffee over the years and I have found this to be one of my favorites. It tastes better than many of the expensive brands I've tried. Whenever I serve this to guests they always love it and ask what kind of coffee I use. I prefer buying the whole bean variety because I like to grind my own coffee beans right before I brew a pot. I get a more flavorful cup of coffee that way.
