I received my case of Izze Grapefruit Sparkling Juice on a Tuesday, and it was gone by Friday.  My wife and I sampled one can together, and immediately put the whole case in the fridge, pushing aside other juice beverages to make room.  For the next two and a half days, my wife and I eye-balled each other every time we went to the fridge, keeping tabs on how many cans were left.  And on Saturday, the day after the last can was gone, we felt like Izze addicts, jonesing for another can.  Just one more...<br /><br />If you are a Fresca fan, you will more than likely love this beverage.  It has a snappy, zingy body, light and refreshing, perfect with ice.  This would make an outstanding summer drink in a tall glass with ice, out on the deck, reading a book in the sun.  I dare say it wouldn't be a bad mixer, either, if you wanted to spike it  ;^)<br /><br />The nutritional content of the drink is what you make of it.  With 70% juice and 30% sparkling water, it's 8.4 ounces are going to have some calories (90 in a can).  It's also going to have vitamin c and niacin.  I've noticed some reviewers say that you'd be better off taking a multivitamin, but if you're drinking it strictly to get vitamins, I think I'd have to look at you with my head tilted slightly to one side and make a Scooby-Doo noise at you.  :^)  No one should get all of their daily recommended vitamins from a drink like this; what Izze is going to do for you is be a tasty, refreshing drink that's a much, much better option for a health-conscious person than a diet soda or most other drinks that you enjoy as a treat.<br /><br />If you're ever in a convenience store and notice an Izze drink in the cooler door, pick one up and try it.  Don't buy a case because it might not be your thing... but do try it.  I loved the Grapefruit version, and I will certainly try the other flavors as well.
