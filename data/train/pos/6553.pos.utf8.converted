I have consumed at least 30 tins of Vigo Octopus in olive oil over the last few years. The meat is tasty and firm without being rubbery. I enjoy sashimi octopus and that's the basis of my comparison. The canned meat is not as flavorful or tender as the fresh meat, for sure, but it's thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. I enjoy it occasionally as my protein accompaniment to fresh vegetable or pea soup, or canned tomato soup or lobster bisque, along with some crackers. I have another 20 tins in my pantry right now. In my experience, you an buy this product with confidence.
