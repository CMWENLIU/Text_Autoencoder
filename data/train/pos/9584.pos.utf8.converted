I got this for Christmas and started it up on December 27th. Today is January 27th. The green basil and chives are probably ready to be harvested. The others are probably a couple weeks away, but all look to be doing well.<br /><br />It is quite an ingenious little machine. Setup was a breeze for me, and all of the parts worked as advertised. It's pretty easy to see if it's working correctly. If you look inside the bowl, you should be able to see water dripping down from each of the seed pods. If not, you have a problem.<br /><br />There are quite a few resources on the web about how to "hack" the Aerogarden so that you can grow your own seeds instead of their expensive little pods (be careful, however, as you might guess the type of seeds that many of the sites refer to). That will make it a much more cost effective proposition. Someone else referenced that there will be some third-party equipment available soon to accomplish the same thing.<br /><br />If you can afford it and like the idea of growing your own herbs, this is a great product.
