Amazon offers a great deal on this. At the Celtic Sea Salt site, you have to pay $7 for shipping, which brings their price for the 5 lb bag up to $29.50 so Amazon's price is still the cheapest I've found so far.<br /><br />Celtic sea salt livens up any food. Wait until you taste an heirloom tomato sprinkled with this. :)<br /><br />TIP: The salt arrives rather moist. Transfer some of it to a clay pot, or a glass jar, and leave uncovered for a few days. When the salt dries up, run it through a spice grinder and you'll have the most wonderful flaky sea salt to use on tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, salads, etc.
