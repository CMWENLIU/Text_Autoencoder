I have a severe shoulder injury that cannot be improved with surgery or physical therapy, I have tried.  My doctors have turned to various painkillers instead, these work to a certain degree, but the worst side effect is the constipation.  I can't help being blunt, anyone who has been on opiates for a period of time has probably experienced this.  The Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears can apparently cause diarrhea if you eat more than 15, for example (YMMV).  They are a godsend for me.  They taste great, they are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than all the medications to relieve the constipation I have been given (both prescription and over the counter), and more importantly, they actually work.  I am a normal person if I eat 25 of these in a sitting every day.  I have told my pain doctors about this and they are now recommending this product to all their patients.  They really are yummy, particularly the pineapple ones.
