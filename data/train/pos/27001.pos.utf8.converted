I have at least 10 "Tuffy" toys and they are all sizes and shapes, with some have squeekers.  I have 5 dogs, 3 labs and 2 misc. mixed breeds.  These dog toys are so great, the only thing my dogs have been able to do is unravel a small area, which did not affect the toy as they are repeatedly reinforced. Every other toy I have purchased and wasted money on, my dogs have destroyed.  These are expensive, but are well worth the money, because they last!  Remember, I have had 3 rescued (unstable) Labs!!!!<br />I would stick with the ones that have a lot of black stitching (octopus, alligator, boomerang) and not so much animals with filling lamb, bull,etc), as the material they use for the  first ones, the body and seams is very strong.  They also have a rating of strength, if you want to look that up, 1-10, 10 being the toughest.
