I have tried many varieties of k-cups and this one is by far my favorite.  Having said that, this cup of coffee is not for the faint of heart.  This is the strongest, boldest cup of coffee I have found.  It has almost a burnt flavor that I adore!  When this coffee is brewing the aroma is just about Heaven!!  If you prefer a more mellow blend I don't think you will like Big Easy too much, but personally I don't like the flavored cups which taste diluted to me.  You know you are drinking a strong, flavorful cup of coffee when you pop this in your machine.  It will stand up to cream, and is the perfect wake up beverage.  I love Coffee People French Roast, and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but I have to say they now taste almost ordinary to me after having discovered Big Easy Bold.  If you are looking for the boldest, most THERE cup of coffee you have ever prepared, you will not be disappointed,  Emeril Rules!!!!!
