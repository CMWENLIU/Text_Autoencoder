I just got my order of the sampler pack in the mail today and decided to try out the Chocolate flavor first.  OMG, this is good!  I mixed it in a blender with 1 cup almond milk, 2 tbsp of PB2 (powdered peanut butter) and some ice.  It's like drinking a peanut butter cup.  Who knew eating well could taste so good?  I'm actually looking forward to trying the other flavors.
