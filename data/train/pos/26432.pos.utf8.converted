The product is great.  It is packaged very well.  Much differently from other Farmer Cheese sold in the market.<br />The company's shipping however, was not so great.  The customer should have been advised that it is necessary to buy expedited shipping. I assumed that the packaging was satisfactory for a perishable product.
