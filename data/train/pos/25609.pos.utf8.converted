Tender Bits are a variety of seitan/wheat meat and replace chicken breast in many recipes.  They are best prepared sliced and sauteed until crispy with olive oil and garlic, and spiced according to taste.  Prepared in this manner, they make an excellent topping for rice or pasta dishes, and are especially good when finished with barbeque sauce.  What's great about Tender Bits is that they can be kept on hand in the cupboard instead of the freezer, where many a package of seitan has met its untimely end.
