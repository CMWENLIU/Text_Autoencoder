I had decided that just for fun, I wanted to try what I thought would be better olive oil than what I was buying at Walmart and Sam's, so I thought I would look at my favorite online store, Amazon.com!  While I wanted to try good olive oil, I still needed to keep within some kind of budget.  When I came across this olive oil, it sounded so good, I just had to try it, and we have not been disappointed! It has a great flavor, and although you can taste the garlic, it is not overpowering, by any means.  It has a good consistency, and I like it so well, I am thinking about trying their lemon version.  I am thinking it will be great in salads.  With the garlic flavor oil, I have mixed a little bit with some balsamic vinegar, and it makes a great salad dressing!  And as for price, I think it is VERY reasonable, since you get 3 34 oz. bottles of it.
