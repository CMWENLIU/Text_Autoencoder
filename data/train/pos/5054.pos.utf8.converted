I've been drinking Eight O' Clock Coffee for quite a while now, and it never disappoints. 8:00 is easily one of the smoothest and best tasting coffees that I have ever had. It's blend of Arabica beans is never bitter and always brews up a quality pot. Rich color, good smell, and dependable flavor provide for one of the best coffee bargains around. This is easily the equal of more expensive coffees, and you won't find a better coffee bargain at this price point. This stuff sells out like mad at my local grocers, so buying in bulk may not be a bad idea.
