I have one large mug of lychee tea every morning and I really like this brand.  The aroma is delicate and not overpowering in the morning.  This company's tea is the nicest I have found.  The leaves are also nice and large, not little dust mites!!!  I have been drinking this flavor for several years and truly enjoy it.  Much nicer than other brands I have also tasted/tested :)  Hope you enjoy it as well.
