Ancient Harvest Quinoa Flakes cook up into a hearty hot cereal.  They taste great on their own, sweetened or with butter.  It cooks very fast, which is a definite plus.  Just don't expect a texture like you'd get with whole quinoa.  It's more a mush like well cooked cornmeal, but it's higher in protein.<br /><br />For those who can't eat gluten or are allergic to wheat as I am, this makes a great substitute for Cream of Wheat.  Actually I prefer the taste of the quinoa flakes.<br /><br />BTW, I was happy to find it here at this price since the few times I was able to buy it at the store it was $5.99 per box.
