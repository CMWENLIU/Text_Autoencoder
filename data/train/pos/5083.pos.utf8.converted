This is a superbly delicious, sweet and tangy glaze.  I use it on all kinds of salads in conjunction with Caroli's Basil Infused Olive Oil (Amazon, please stock the latter!).  It can also be drizzled over all manner of savory appetizers served on a white platter for a stunning visual effect.  Blaze offers other flavors such as fig, chocolate and strawberry for dessert lovers, but this, the Original BLAZE is, in my opinion, their best and most versatile product. Enjoy, I promise you won't be disappointed.~~~  Trish O. in Phoenix, AZ.
