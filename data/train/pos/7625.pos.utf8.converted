I've been purchasing the Nutiva via subscription, in the two-pack jars. Recently I found the 8 pound pail available, and decided it would be a good purchase since coconut oil has such a long shelf life.<br /><br />Having seen another review that said there was a difference between the pail product and jar product, I was concerned. However, after having used both I can assure you that the product you buy in jars is the same product packed in the large pail.<br /><br />Eight pounds of wonderful coconutty goodness, creamy and fragrant and delicious! Since it turns liquid in warmer temps, I poured the liquid into my olive oil dispenser and can now add oil to my skillets without having liquid coconut oil running all down the sides of the jar. When the weather cools down I'll have to make other arrangements, of course. But this coconut oil is fabulous and a bargain at this price!<br /><br />I might have to order another one soon as my mother likes this also, and took some of my coconut oil.<br /><br />*Edit 6-14-11: when I purchased this and raved about what a bargain it was, the pail cost me just a little over $50.00  You may find that doing the math on any additional price increases changes whether this is a bargain for you or not.
