I was leery of trying the Amy & Brian's again after having this experience: AMAZING pulp-free tall cans. Horrible candy-water 10 oz cans. So, I have several cases of the short cans I refuse to drink. Awful. But I went through the cases of the tall cans. Wonderful.<br /><br />I wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans, and I did not reorder. THEN..this big sale and sub/save showed up. Tempted me. I ordered TWO cases of this one, with the pulp.<br /><br />WONDERFUL. I like it even better than the pulp-free (which is weird, as I normally avoid pulp-containing packaged coconut water). I even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp.The flavor is NOT too sweet, very nicely coconutty, not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new Zico, nicer than ONE and VitaCoco.<br /><br />So, I feel free to order more now. Clearly, there is some issue with the smaller cans. I strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague. They taste nothing like coconut water. They taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve. Really icky sweet and NOT AT ALL coconutty. (I have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood, my family being from the Caribbean, and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on Amazon, and I know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc. Coconut water IS variable, so I don't expect homogeneous flavor. I do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water (or corn cereal milk like new Zico)). So, yeah, avoid small cans. Amy & Brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting, cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror.<br /><br />The Tall Cans: Yes, buy these. I've sampled out of four different cases sent to me, always good. The pulp-free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak CW's I've tried, and the higher carb count makes sense. I even emailed the A&B people about it, and they said it was due to the blend/selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count. I can see how the selection could do this. I like the sweeter flavor, personally, but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs. When I want to drink coconut water by itself--I choose a lower carb variety, like original Zico was or ONE in a smaller quantity than the 17.5 ounce can.<br /><br />Thumbs up. Refreshing, sweet, coconutty, lovely. I love, love, love this coconut water in the TALL CANS.<br /><br />But I beg the Amyy & Brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans. That stuff is vile and I have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that I cannot drink. (Add that to the Zico I can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right/screw with a tried-true formula).<br /><br />Happy sipping!
