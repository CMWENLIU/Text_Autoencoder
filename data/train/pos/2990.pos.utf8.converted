Great smoky flavor.  Seems quite fresh.  Packaging is high quality - bags never fall apart.  I also like the energy pick me up in the morning.  It keeps me awake if I drink it at night.  It does, in fact, seem to aid digestion, especially at high altitudes.  Overall, it's what I was expecting.  A good substitute for the fresh leaves I had in Peru!
