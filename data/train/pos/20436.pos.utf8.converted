I have loved hot food and hot sauce since I was quite young.  I only found out about the "Blair's Death Sauce" range recently.<br /><br />Firsly I must say that I found their "After Death" and "Sudden Death" tasted very much alike but the "Mega Death" is by far and away their best sauce.<br /><br />First one is hit by the great taste, you can really tast the Habanero Chile (something you can do with their other sauces)plus it has a slightly sweet side to it.  Then you are hit by the heat, I say "then you are hit by the heat" because it's not the first thing you notice with this sauce.  Though it is much hotter then their other sauces it sneaks up on you.<br /><br />I would use about five drops or more on a big staek but I like a lot of heat so try one drop at a time.<br /><br />The best supper hot sauce I have yet tried!
