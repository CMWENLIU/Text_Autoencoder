I had never tried this product before nor heard of it until I came across a vegan recipe I wanted to make.  Incredibly, low sodium soy sauce has an astonishing 575 mg. per tbsp.  Bragg's Liquid Aminos only has 160 mg. per 1/2 tsp.  One squirt adds a lot of flavor.  The first time my husband and I tasted it, we were impressed.  It is better than soy sauce.  Has an all natural mild taste loaded with flavor, but not too salty.  Would be excellent on vegetables, soup or  rice.  Liquid Aminos also contains 16 essential and non-essential amino acids.  I had a hard time finding this product in a regular grocery store.  There are no health food stores near, so I was delighted Amazon carried it.  I will never go back to soy sauce.
