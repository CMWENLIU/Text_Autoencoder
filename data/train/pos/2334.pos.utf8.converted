Hi, my name's Kat and I'm a coffee snob. We love this coffee. It has such a smooth taste. We do not like burnt-tasting coffee. To us, Starbucks and many others claiming a "bold" flavor are just over-roasted until they are charred. We love a strong, smooth, mildly roasted coffee. Coffee that is just toasted, not overdone. To give you a good comparison, this coffee is similar in taste, smoothness and richness to Dunkin Donuts Original whole bean, Pilon from Dominican Republic, Breakfast Blend (not House Blend), From Africa to Africa, and Brazil (all three "mild roast" from Starbucks), Magnum Jamaica Blue Mountain Blend, Land of a Thousand Hill's Rwandan Blend hand-picked, and Tim Horton's.<br /><br />The best thing about Cameron's Breakfast Blend is the taste! Add to that: Organic, Shade-grown, Rain Forest Alliance Certified, Fair Trade AND the price! With Subscribe and Save, it costs under 6 bucks a bag. You can't find another coffee with all that going for it! We LOVE it! Remember, though, if you like bold 'n burnt as in MOST of Starbucks coffees, this is NOT even similar... Enjoy your coffee!<br /><br />FEB 2012: Update. We've been drinking Cameron's Organic Woods and Water (whole beans) and it's even better than the Breakfast Blend! Wow! Enjoy! The only sad part is how expensive it's become in only a year, even with "Subscribe and Save" prices. It's gone from under $6 a bag to over $10 a bag! That being said, we still order it and love it.
