Seems I was the only one buying this ketchup locally, since our stores stopped stocking it.  My husband, on a 2 gm. sodium diet has always "doused" his foods with salt, ketchup, mustard.  The salt is now off the table,but he can enjoy himself with his ketchup.  Helps him maintain his restrictions and tastes the same as the "regular" ketchup.
