I used to buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDG598">Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> and I am SO glad I discovered the NOW almond flour.  The Bob's almond meal works, but I didn't really care for the flavor or the texture--I just thought I needed to learn to like them.<br /><br />This NOW Foods almond flour is so much better!  The Bob's almond meal is kind of gritty...so I just thought that when you grind almonds, that's the best you can hope for.  Not true!  This NOW Foods almond flour is soft.  Bob's also has a distinct flavor to it...when I made GAPS banana bread, the recipe calls for 3 cups of almond flour, and I used to substitute 2 cups of coconut flour, because I didn't like the result with 3 cups of Bob's almond flour.  With the NOW Foods almond flour, I PREFER it with only almond flour.<br /><br />If you're doing GAPS, it's kind of tough because you can't have grains.  Almond flour is one of the ingredients that makes it possible to have "normal" food while on GAPS.  My other favorite ingredients that make GAPS food taste like normal food are coconut flour and date sugar.<br /><br />Anyhow, this is EXCELLENT stuff!  If you've tried Bob's and didn't really care for it, definitely order this and see if you like it better.  As a bonus, the NOW Foods almond flour is slightly cheaper than Bob's, and the packages have actually been updated, so it looks more modern than the picture that is on the Amazon page.
