The best part about this bar is that (unlike most others) I cannot taste the dates.  They're a little sweet, but not too much so; the tartness of the cherries helps balance things out.  I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.  I'm new this whole raw food thing, so these have been life-savers for when I'm tired of eating whole foods and salads.
