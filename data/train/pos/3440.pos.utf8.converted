I love these Pearls. I was very skeptical at first, not sure what effects the minute ones vs. the regular ones had on the taste. I'm happy to say that it had none. They taste the same as far as I can tell, and I have had these drinks for years, these stores are everywhere here in Irvine - California. If you like that more tender leave them in the boiling water for 9 minutes instead of 5.<br />Side note; when you drain them, make sure you put some honey on top and stir it in, the better the honey the better the sweetness of the pearl.<br />The only thing I don't like is that the shipping os so expensive.
