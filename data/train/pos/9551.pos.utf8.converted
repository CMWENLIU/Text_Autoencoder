After having Dunkin Donuts Mocha coffee at a small fortune, I decided to try the Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha coffee in my Keurig machine at home.  I absolutely love it!!  The taste, the price, everything is wonderful about this coffee.  Low in calories, too.  I highly recommend this coffee if you enjoy a little "chocolate" with your java!!
