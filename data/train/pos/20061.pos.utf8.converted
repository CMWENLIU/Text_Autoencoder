Bought frozen crab cakes from a couple places. They were OK. Tried crab meat from Sam's & Wal-Mart. This product is superior to any thing else I've tried. Good price on a good product.<br />Here's my recipe:<br />Southern Style Crab Cakes w/ Roasted Pepper chive Aioli<br />Ingredients:<br />12 oz lump crab meat, drained (reserve liquid for later. May be used to make meat mix the right consistency or to extend mixture with extra bread crumbs if needed)<br />
