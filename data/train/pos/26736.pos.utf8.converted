this stuff smells and taste great seems to have a little stronger smell then the kind I buy in the store.the only problem is pouring it from the bottle it tends to spill. so what I do is refill a empty store bought bottle of Extract other then that this is good stuff I will be buying again shipped and rec on time.<br /><br />WARNING keep it away from open flames this stuff contains 90% ALCOHOL
