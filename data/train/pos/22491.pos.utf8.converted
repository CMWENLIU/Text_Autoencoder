I am a fruitcake lover, and am extremely particular. If a fruitcake doesn't measure up to the ones I used to eat as a child, the deep, dark, aged-in-brandy, old-fashioned type, I don't really feel that I've had my fruitcake fix for the season. But this one fills the bill. It's dense, moist, spicy, nutty and PERFECT!
