Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Hearty lentil soup with some added veggies. Less sodium allows the natural flavors to come through. Heart healthy. Can be used as a quick 'n easy "dal" (lentil curry) over rice. Great with organic crackers. Not spicy. Smooth & delightful taste. Six star company. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen!
