Of the Better Than Bouillon lineup, I've used chicken, mushroom, beef, vegetable, ham and lobster; they are all very good (much better than any other bouillon I've tried), but lobster stands out as both unusual and good: complex, balanced, not fishy.<br /><br />Here's what I've been using it for recently: I separate a big bunch of<br />CHARD into leaves and stems, slice the<br />CHARD STEMS fairly small and saut&eacute; them for a few minutes in<br />WALNUT OIL; add a teaspoon of<br />LOBSTER BOUILLON, some<br />CASHEW PIECES and some<br />RAISINS; while this cooks, slice up the<br />CHARD LEAVES; add the leaves, cover, and cook for a few more minutes (mix it a couple of times to get the flavored oil distributed evenly).<br /><br />The number of raisins has a big effect on sweetness; I've tried it at various points between almost none and enough that there's a raisin or two in every mouthful, and I'd say that somewhere in the middle is optimal (a lot of raisins is good too, but shadows the lobster).<br /><br />I echo the comments of other reviewers: if you use BTB, omit the rest of the salt from the recipe until you're sure it needs it.  They make a "reduced sodium" version of some flavors, but it's only 25% less; I couldn't tell that it was less salty.
