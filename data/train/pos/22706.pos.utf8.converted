We have this on automatic order with Amazon to take advantage of the improved pricing. We go through about 1 32 ounce box per day and buying from amazon saves us a ton of money (prime members so no shipping cost).<br /><br />Every once in a while we get a box that was beat up a little bit but not that big of a deal for the amount of money we save buying this stuff in bulk.<br /><br />I am 100% certain that should I ever feel like complaining to amazon about the shipping issue, they would send me a replacement pronto. That being said, it's really no big deal.
