I was never a fan of sardines, too strong, fishy and salty. My huband bought that awful stuff at the grocery store that even the cats wouldn't eat. But I wanted to start eating healthier foods and sardines seemed like a simple, mega-3-rich, quick and healthy snack. Seasons had great reviews so I took a chance. These arrived today and I am already addicted. The easy open container comes packed with 4 good sized fish in a light olive oil. The fish have a very delicate flavor as well as aroma and minimal saltiness. Thanks Seasons!
