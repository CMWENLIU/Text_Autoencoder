This product is excellent for a dog chew stick and my dogs absolutely love them.  It will not swell in their throats like rawhide can sometimes do.  The price on amazon is much better than at dog shows, pet shops or discount catalogues ( but still a little more expensive than Costco).  It came within a few days of ordering.
