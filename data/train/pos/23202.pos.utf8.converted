My family loves cheesecakes, blueberry being the favorite.  Until now I have only been able to find the 21 oz. can of blueberry pie filling locally and that has always been to much for one cheesecake.  The 12 oz. size is just the right amount to top a standard cheesecake and it contains small tasty blueberries, NOT the huge ones found in most pie filling.  It's delicious....I am going to try the rasberry next.  Price averages out about the same ounce for ounce with the larger can.  Exceptional taste & value delivered right to your door.
