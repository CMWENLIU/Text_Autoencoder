There are over 2,000 types of trace minerals and natural minerals and even iodine in this power packed seaweed!  Especially if we do not eat much iodized salt anymore.  The sodium tastes like it is so high, but only 122 per serving (1;3 cup)!  I do not sell this, nor make a profit, I grew up on this stuff in Nova Scotia.  I can no longer get it at local health food stores, so I order it from Amazon.<br /><br />I eat it as a snack (with a tall glass of water to drink) and I have put it in hot frying pan to make it crispy (changes color a bit) great for tossing into popcorn or in salads.  I get the seaweed in pieces, it comes also in flakes which you can use to spread (pieces to large to use in salt shaker) but you can get a shaker with larger holes.  Then, you use as if it were salt on foods.<br /><br />The taste is aquired, and different than sushi type Nori or green kelp seaweed, but if it is for you, you have an electrolyte packed source for life! Affects thyroid (iodine) so check with your doctor if you have an issue, but, if not, is a great weight loss healthy aide.  Take apple cider vinegar (can be taken in pill form, it is only food, not medication) can be taken with the seaweed as an old-time diet aide.<br /><br />I guess you can figure out that I LOVE this stuff!  I used to eat it all the time, but now I eat it in moderation as it is such a powerful food, then my body does not have ups and down in nutrition and iodine.<br /><br />This is the ONLY brand I am aware of for Dulse.
