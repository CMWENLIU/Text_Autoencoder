Why are people so concerned with China? I bet half of these people's furniture is from Ikea which is one of the most frequent recalling companies ever! Chemicals, shmemicals... there are very, VERY few unhealthy, overweight, unfit people in China. If you are THAT worried, go eat a real Fuji apple! It's not like you can't just throw one in your purse as easily as a pack of these tasty treats. Am I right?
