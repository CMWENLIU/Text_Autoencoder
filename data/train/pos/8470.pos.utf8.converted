My boyfriend and I are absolutely addicted to these little flavor nuggets. I like strawberry the best, but he really likes the blueberry which is kind of sad because you only get 2 blueberry in a pack of 12, but it makes them more special, I guess. They don't come with a twist off cap like in the picture, you open them like a regular old paper drink carton. Also there are only 3 flavors, strawberry, blueberry and orange. no apple as is pictured. The flavor is amazing. If you like gummies, that's kind of what the texture is like.
