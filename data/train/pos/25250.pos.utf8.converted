If you're searching for a coffee replacement, something that fools you into thinking you're drinking coffee, this probably isn't it, but if you're looking for a great tasting, healthy alternative to coffee, I don't believe you can do any better.  As I'm typing this, I'm drinking a huge glass of 2 cups brewed Teeccino added to 1 cup light soy milk and a packet of Stevia with ice.  I have it once a day and look forward to it, knowing I'm actually adding something healthy to my body, and there are no sugar or caffeine jitters. I've been buying Teeccino for about 15 years, first at the health food stores and then on Amazon.com where I always get it for the best price. (Love free shipping!!)
