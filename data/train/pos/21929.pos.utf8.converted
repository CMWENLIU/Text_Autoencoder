Previous reviewes told of the mess involved with these, they obviously have not had freeze dried fruit before. Wether it is blueberries, strawberries, lychees or any other fruit, you will have a bit of a mess from the product. Get over it! Wash your hands, brush your teeth. Now for the item at hand, Blueberries. Typical freeze dried berries with good taste and that wonderful powder! Can not be improved.
