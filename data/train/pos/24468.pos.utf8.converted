My in-laws are from the Norfolk County, England, which is also the home of Coleman's mustard.  And, the Coleman's jar is on the table EVERY meal.  My father in law practically reignited the American Revolution in Boston one day when he could not get any english mustard with his eggs.  It took the entire family to explain to him that he was not in England, and it is no surprise that he will have a tough time getting english mustard.<br /><br />Anyway, about the mustard:<br />It is smooth, yellow, and just looking at it, one could assume flavorless.  They would be WRONG!  This mustard has KICK.  It has a spicy undertone that on occasion will rise up and clear out the sinuses.  Try it on a turkey sandwich, and you will never go back to mayo.  Try it on hot italian sausage, try it on eggs, try it on chicken, asparagus, fries, just try it.
