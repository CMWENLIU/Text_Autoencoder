Read about Larabars in a diet book, and I went Larabars' website. I got several boxes including a variety box. The Pecan Bars are out of this world, tasting amazingly like a pecan pie!<br />Also great was their cinnamon bun bars. They were very nice in processing and helping me with these orders...BUT<br />The GREAT NEWS is Amazon has these bars for $5-6 cheaper!<br />Order through Amazon!<br />I am using this product as a meal replacement sometimes, and it has been a great hit.
