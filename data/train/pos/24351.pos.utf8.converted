Anyone worried about this should read the review from Eden Foods website about Hiziki. They tested the arsenic levels after the Hiziki was prepared according to package directions (soaked with water discarded after 15 minutes then rinsed) and found it to be well within established limits.<br /><br />[...]There are more worrisome levels of arsenic in other foods such as chickens who are often given arsenic laden feed. Eating hijiki in moderation is unlikely to hurt you and the alginate in hijiki is thought to actually draw out heavy metals.<br />I don't work for Eden or anything I just really like sea vegetables and find them to be a good source of trace nutrients
