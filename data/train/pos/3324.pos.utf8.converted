In general, I'd recommend that you would go to a local brewing store and work out exactly what you need and want to get started brewing your own beer. You'd likely end up with a setup that is pretty similar to this one. That leaves price and flexibility as the main issues. Glancing at a brewing catalog, it looks like this setup isn't a bad deal pricewise. And of course if you don't have a local brewing store, then buying this one is that much easier. Do compare the items included in any of these kits, there are a lot of them listed on amazon, some for as little as half of the price of this one. And remember that you can save a lot of shipping cost by buying kits without bottles. Use your own collected bottles.
