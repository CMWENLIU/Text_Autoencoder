I've drank many teas over the years and have always been a lover of Lipton teas but this one is absolutely exceptional.  For my taste, this is the perfect tea.  It is very much like the original Lipton Tea with a blend of orange pekoe and black cut pekoe, but this variety is somewhat stronger and smoother than the regular Lipton.  It is not too tanic and the infusion provided by the pyramid style bags is much better than the traditional tea bag.  This tea costs a bit more than the regular Lipton variety, but compared to many other brands, this one is a great value and in my estimation it is the best tasting.  I really couldn't be more pleased with it.
