I have been using Bob's red mill unsweetened coconut for about 2 years now and it's great.  My favorite use for it is as part oif a coating for chicken or fish.  You just toast the coconut in a nonstick pan until nice and deeply browned and then mix it half and half with Panko crumbs or regular breadcrumbs.  Dredge your chicken pieces in flour, dip in egg and then coat with the coconut & breadcrumbs.  I bake mine in the oven but you can also deep fry. This coating is also excellent for shrimp or scallops.  Since it's unsweetened, you can use it in carribbean stews or any other savory dish.  For baked goods it's especially helpful in controlling the amount of sugar in the final product.  Coconut doesn't really need to be sweetened when it's added to other sweet ingredients.  For example, those 7 layer dream bars with chcolocate and butterscotch chips as well as sweetened condensed milk don't really need sweetened coconut now do they?  I also add this coconut to banana nut breads, chocolate brownies and icings for cakes.  If you are making a regular white cake with coconut icing, you can punch up the coconut quotient by trhwoing in a half cup or so into the mix and then some more into the custard filling and get triple coconut cake!  Yum.  It's not hard to toast this coconut  but be aware that once it starts browning, it browns VERY fast and will continue browning even after you remove it from the heat. Once you have bought this and used it, you'll find a hundred other uses for it.  try the coconut encrusted chicken for something different!
