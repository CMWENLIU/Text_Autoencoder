I bought this at the local Asian market, sat down on a rainy weekday to watch Garden of the Finzi Continis and was instantly mesmerized by its freshness, seaweedy taste, and the whole harmony of that moment.  I couldn't get enough of it- I drank 6-8 cups a day for a month.  It's just a great complement to anything that you've eaten.  I bought the Sencha Special Grade from Upton Tea, thinking it must be better than this since it's twice as expensive, but the Yamamotoyama is a shade better for my taste.  I can never go back to tea bags, especially tasteless brands like  Bigelows or Tazo.  I don't mind some black tea bags, but not the fannings they use in green tea bags.  Green tea has got to be one of the best things in life.
