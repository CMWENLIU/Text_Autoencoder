After receiving a gift card for Amazon, I had to buy this tea sampler box.  My wife and I both love tea and have it at least every other day if not more often.  We particularly love samplers too since we have different tea tastes.  I really love the Nana (mint) tea, the lemon and the raspberry.  She loves the English breakfast and Earl Grey.  My highest compliment is that these Wissotzky teas taste real, unlike many other flavored teas that often don't taste as you'd expect.  When you brew a cup of lemon tea - guess what... you get delicious lemon-tasting tea.  The box is nice.  Nothing special, but a nice clean look and I really like the inside lid's labeling that gives a little information on each tea flavor in case you're not sure what flavor you want any given day.  Oh yeah, the other great thing about this sampler are there aren't any "filler" flavors.  Each flavor is unique and delicious and I'm sure we'll happily finish the entire box and be back for more.
