Though it's now out of vogue, I'm still a fan of a healthy version of the low carb Atkins style diet.  This is the perfect meal bar for that diet (probably great for South Beach, too).  It is delicious, the peanut butter is creamy, and the chocolate on the outside is superb.  I've used the Atkins bars for years, and they taste of chemicals and artificial sweetners.  These Think Think bars, though, are practically candy bars.  They have low net carbs (2 for this version, I think).  Even when I'm not dieting, I still love this bar.  It isn't a large, filling bar, and I can't really eat one to replace a meal, but if you're looking for a snack to cut between meals, or just a desert to eat with a nice cup of coffee at night, this is the bar for you.<br /><br />This price on Amazon can't be beat, either.  I pay about $1.7 per bar at Trader Joes, 2.20 a bar at the local megamart (when they have them in stock), and only about a buck fifty here on Amazon.  Great deal.  I was kind of sketchy ordering food online (though I order everything eles online), but Amazon grocery proved me wrong.  Give 'em a try.
