I am reordering this from Amazon. We have gotten it at Whole Foods as well but we go through it so quickly it is easier to get in large quantities from Amazon. My husband and I are coffee/tea junkies and I am embarrassed to say went through 4 pounds of sugar a month! We made this simple switch and I lost 6 lbs-no other changes. Granted, I eat very healthy foods and sugar was my big indulgence. This is the only substitute I have found that tastes just like sugar. We learned about it from the Jorge Cruise Belly Fat Cure book and also highly recommend that book. My husband followed it to the letter and lost 21 lbs in 6 weeks.
