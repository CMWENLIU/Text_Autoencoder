I'm no fan of instant coffees. They're usually extremely bitter and off-tasting to me, even if they are made from Arabica beans. But, I absolutely love this product. This is the only thing I use to make iced Americanos at home. The results are very good and I don't miss the Starbucks stuff or my money! Haven't tried this hot though. Overall, highly recommended!
