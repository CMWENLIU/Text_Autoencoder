Outstanding product and even more so if you are a Amazon.com prime member with the shipping being free 2 day. My oldest takes these pop top can to school and has it for lunch (he keeps extras in his locker). He packs it in a with a little pepper or lite lemon pepper and /or a lemon wedge and he's a happy camper. His friends parents have also ordered this product. There is a world of difference between this tuna and the regular market brands. You don't need mayo!<br />Learn the difference between "Minimal" and "Low" Mercury tuna.
