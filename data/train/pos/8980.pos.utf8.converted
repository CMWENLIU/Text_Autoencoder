We tried this with grapefruit, lemons, limes, and sour candy. We will definitely be trying this again with more of the food that is listed in the description. Everyone seems to have their own reaction to miracle fruit, varying sensitivity but most people had a very positive experience after taking a whole tab, not just half. When you let it dissolve on your tongue it's a bit gross as it is mostly corn starch, but that passes quickly. We will definitely be buying this product more and having more "flavor tripping" parties, and I would recommend that anyone tries it at least once.
