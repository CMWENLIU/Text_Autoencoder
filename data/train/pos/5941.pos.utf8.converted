This gum contains xylitol as one of its main ingredients. I am currently in dental hygiene school and thus have recently learned the benefits of xylitol. The reason this is so good is that it is a natural sweetener that tricks bacteria into thinking it's regular sugar. When bacteria ingest it they have no way to digest it, which results in death of the bacteria and therefore lowers your risk for cavities when used daily.<br /><br />Now for anyone who has TMJ issues (if you don't have TMJ, then you don't have to bother reading this one paragraph) it is recommended that you not chew gum at all. I myself am one of these people. Whenever I chew gum my jaw ends up hurting for days. However, I spoke with the dentist at my college about this issue and he actually recommends to continue chewing xyliotol gum but to only chew for 5 minutes maximum, particularity after sugary snacks only. For myself, this seems to work. If I eat something high in sugar and chew Spry gum for only 5 minutes afterward, it'll help get the xyliotol in my mouth to fight off cavity causing bacteria but won't be long enough to cause me pain in my jaw.<br /><br />Overall, if you're one who gets cavities often, try Spry gum!
