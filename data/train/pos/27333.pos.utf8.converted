Purchased the Bayer Brush Killer to get rid of several Bradford Pear trees that a previous owner has planted. I had cut the plants down to stumps but from the stumps and along the root lines of the tree kept coming back. It got to where I would cut back only to have more growth. I did some research and came across the Bayer Brush Killer, unable to find it at a local store I turned to Amazon. After cutting back the trees again so there was fresh cuts, I applied the product. I actually applied twice last year, this year the trees are dead and the stumps had even dried and rotted out to where I could pull them out of the ground with no problem. Again, great product!
