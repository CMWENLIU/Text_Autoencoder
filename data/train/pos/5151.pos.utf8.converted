We had received the Anthon Berg 64 piece Chocolate Liqueurs with Original Spirits as a gift for Christmas 2008.  When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them for my mother right away (for Christmas 2009).  The price was very competitive, best I'd seen actually, and we already knew the chocolates were superb.  Well, there was a problem with almost all of the chocolates arriving damaged which dries them out.  I made a remark on Amazon and the Candy Shoppe contacted me to get in touch with them.  I'd like to mention that The Candy Shoppe was professional, polite and cheerful, explaining to me that in an effort to be more "green" they were working out issues finding suitable packaging. That's understandable and commendable. What was even more impressive was that they had my replacement order packed and shipping WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM.  The chocolates arrived undamaged and as delicious as we remembered them. We will most definitely be buying from them again in the future when we are looking for this wonderful product.
