We have enjoyed Millstone Coffee for years and until receiving our Keurig for Christmas, only drank Millstone Hazelnut Creme. (See my review for that coffee).<br />But now, we have discovered another joy by Millstone. Breakfast Blend is a light roast coffee which is what we enjoy drinking. It is a great cup of coffee to wake up with. It is not bitter and does not leave a bad taste.<br />Like Hazelnut Creme, I only wish it was easier to purchase. I wish Amazon would routinely carry this coffee with Prime.
