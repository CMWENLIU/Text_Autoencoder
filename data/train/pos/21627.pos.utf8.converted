Quinoa is great stuff!  I just discovered it a few weeks ago and ordered some from Amazon.  Go read about all the nutritional benefits online somewhere.  GREAT source of protein, fiber and lots of other nutrients and minerals.  It's quick and easy to prepare, just heat up some water, dump in the Quinoa and cook for about 15 minutes.<br /><br />It makes a great substitute for Pasta and/or rice.  You can use it for stir fry meals, soups, toss some tomatoes, garlic and olive oil in it for a nie simple tasty dish, mix it with seafood and anything else you can cook up.  Each box is about 2 cups dry which is 6-8 cups cooked.  It's more expensive than rice and most pastas but well worth the extra expense!  Like pasta or rice, the flavor is little bland if you don't add anything to it but it does taste ok just plain.
