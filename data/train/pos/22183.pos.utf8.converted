Many gluten-free baking recipes call for arrowroot, which is hard to find in health food stores.  (I'm in Austin, Texas. ?)  Anyway, this is incredibly cheap--it's a tenth the price of some suppliers.<br /><br />When to use this:  in any recipe where you would use wheat flour for a thickener, like soup, sauce, gravy or pudding.<br /><br />Why to use it:  your alternative is corn starch, which can be shiny and tastes like corn.<br /><br />(Imagine vanilla pudding that tastes like corn.)  Arrowroot isn't as gluey as corn starch, and doesn't thicken as well, but it won't overwhelm other flavors.  (Imagine chocolate pudding that tastes like corn.)
