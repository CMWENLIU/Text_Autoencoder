I got the Brezza as a gift right before my son transitioned to solid food.  I didn't think I was going to be the type to make my own food, but it was so easy with the Brezza.  I would throw a bunch of raw veggies in the cooker and in 10 or 15 minutes everything would be cooked and pureed. Seriously, the easiest thing ever.  Plus, after having bought some jarred baby food from the market, I can truly appreciate the difference in food that is homemade.<br />The clean-up is really easy too since all of the steaming and the pureeing happens in the same canister.  It is definitely a great purchase if you are considering making your own baby food.  It spans beyond purees too, because you can use the steam function to make veggies for the kids as they get older.  From one mom to another, I would highly recommend the Brezza.
