At 130 calories, 6 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fat, this is a guilt-free treat. This is not your usual soft, chewy, sugary granola bar; this is for the dark chocolate lover, the cocoa flavor intensified by the addition of coffee, a trick that every gourmet cook knows. Kashi's "Seven Whole Grains" which include "hard red wheat"--not gluten free, sorry!) add 4 grams of fiber and a satisfying chewy crunchiness. This particular flavor is hard to find. Often I am greeted by empty shelves, so I am glad that I could find them here and set up a regular shipment! And by the way, these were part of my recent 28 pound weight loss. They certainly helped fight the cravings for the dark-chocolate and almond confections that are my downfall!
