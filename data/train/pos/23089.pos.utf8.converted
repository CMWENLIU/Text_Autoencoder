Our local pet store owner suggested this food when I showed her my dachshunds ears that were red, inflamed and never seemed to clear up even after I don't know how many antibiotics our vet prescribed. Within a few weeks they were totally cleared up and we never had the problem again.<br />Also, he used to get hot itchy spots on his belly in the summer and those never came back either. I highly recommend it!
