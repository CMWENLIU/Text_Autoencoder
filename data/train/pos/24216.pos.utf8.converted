If you are looking for fresh, organic coffee roasted to perfection, Basecamp coffee is definitely worth a try! This is the most consistent, quality roast I've found by far. Living in Seattle, that is no easy task as I am surrounded by the king of coffee's. Yet Backcountry Coffee roasters comes through with an amazingly bold Espresso roast. I highly recommend this product... you won't be disappointed!
