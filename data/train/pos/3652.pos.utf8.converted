Have been buying this product for some time now - saw complaints about made in USA or not so I called the company. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with a woman there who was weary of this complaint but very nice. I told her we love our pets, have learned to trust almost no one anymore and they were hurting themselves by selling products from China.<br /><br />As she explained,the confusion comes from the following: the "Made in USA" labeled chicken breast strips - what I have been using for my golden retriever puppy (who ABSOLUTELY loves them - really a healthy nutritious chew toy that lasts about 3 minutes - maybe 10 minutes for a little dog - when he sees it, he goes nuts - has never choked on them or had any negative effects I can see) is, as it says on the bag, Made in USA - they are processed in the USA and come from chicken raised in the USA.<br /><br />Smokehouse DOES sell another chicken product that does NOT say made in the USA on the package and this product DOES come from China.<br /><br />Buy whichever one you want.<br /><br />As to the complaints about not being able to cut them up easily - this IS absolutely true - so, if you want tiny bits of treat to use for reward based training, this is definitely NOT the product you want. I use other natural treats for this purpose (Merricks lamb lung is terrific for this use and my dog loves this product just as well - a one pound bag goes a long way - very easy to break up in whatever sizes you want in seconds)<br /><br />Finally, this product (chicken breast strips) has ONE ingredient: chicken. It is made in the USA from chicken grown in the USA. Because it is dried, it lasts forever, does not need refrigeration, makes no mess when fed to your dog, dogs love it - what else do you want for a treat?
