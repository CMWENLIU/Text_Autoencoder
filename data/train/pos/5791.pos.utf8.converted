Healthy, Natural, Organic, Low-fat and it tastes good? One might find one or two of these qualities in a product and then find themselves willing to sacrifice good taste for a healthy choice, or low-fat for an organic and delicious meal. However with Amy's Minestrone Soup, one need not sacrifice any of these. In fact to describe the home-cooked flavor and the hearty filling ingredients of this delicacy is a task best left suited to the taste buds. It's simply unfortunate that they are unable to talk!<br />Not only is this can of soup akin to a home cooked meal, it is also easy to prepare (only minutes in a microwave or stove-top), and perfect for quick lunches or for a last minute dinner. Of course it could also be passed off as if the preparer had labored hours in the kitchen, preparing the pasta, slicing the vegetables and carefully adding the spices to prepare a soup worthy enough to be called Mom's.<br />Finally, it is very low in fat (only 3 grams a can!) and has lots of fiber and a minimal calorie count. So one can slim out, eat well and know they are eating only the best organic food items!
