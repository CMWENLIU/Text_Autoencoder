What can I say, I just love this product.  Ideally for ME I would like it to be a little bit more tomato-ey and a tad less spicy, but when I taste it I remind myself that it is truly more authentic in its current state and I can taste the eggplant more despite the spiciness as I've gotten used to it.  Sometimes I just eat it as is without heating it up, which also lessens the spiciness level.  But it is SO good, I just ordered one of the vegetables packets and I doubt it can be as great as this one but it's worth a try.  It has a comforting smooshy testure to it, with bits of well-cooked onions intertwined in it.
