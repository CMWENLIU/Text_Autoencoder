I bought this product a couple weeks ago and wanted to provide some feedback on my usage of the extra virgin coconut oil.  I am a brown-skinned lovely and I have used this product on my naturally loc'd hair, my skin as well as use as a health supplement.  My hair & skin have more sheen and luster and is much softer overall. I also use this coconut oil in my green tea and it is decadent!  I love this product and will absolutely buy again.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.
