I admit that there was an adjustment period for my body to fully embrace this supplement.  I experienced some edginess, etc.  But I stuck with it and here's what I found.<br /><br />As a woman of a certain age, I had been having some cardiac distress associated with hormonal changes, particularly overnight. I know that more women experience heart attacks during the night than the day, and that more women over 55 die from heart attacks than from cancer. Neither of these facts was "heartening" given what I was feeling, prior to taking Maca.<br /><br />I have also been using Magnesium which helped and which I recommend, particularly Natural Calm by Peter Gilham, as well as Nattokinase, Serrapeptase, and Dr. Pauling's protocol( high Vit C, Lysine, & Proline) to remove plague from veins and arteries, and felt that these supplements were working but clearly there was still some distress.<br /><br />Using 1 teaspoon of Maca alnog with my powdered wheat grass juice 2-3 times a day has eliminated that feeling of cardiac distress and has contributed to a growing sense of physical well-being and calm.  I believe that Maca, which works on the endocrine system is gently nourishing my body and eliminating physical stress as well as emotional stress.  I continue with Natural Calm and everything else I do to maintain physical wellness, but Maca has made the biggest difference in my life.<br /><br />If you're feeling stressed, consider trying Maca. I think you will find that it nourishes your body in important ways and makes you feel energetic and very calm.
