I've been using this truffle salt for about a year now, and I can't say enough good about it. It is, in fact, fabulous! You need only a tiny pinch to add an incredible truffle flavor to what ever you are serving. Try roasting asparagus with a little olive oil and a light sprinkle of this truffle salt. While it seems expensive initially, it takes so little to make a big impact, it really isn't that costly. The truffle scent is so intense, you can smell it through the jar. And if you're a truffle lover, that scent is almost better than French perfume.
