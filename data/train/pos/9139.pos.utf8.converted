This tea is very tasty. It has a little bit of sweetness what makes the flavor very drinkable. I drunk like three mugs at once. But take in consideration that this option is only for herbal tea lovers. My husband didn't like it all. So, in order to keep everybody happy, for those who hate camomile or verbena tea don't even give it a try.
