For many years I used Locatelli Romano cheese, and truly enjoyed it. I still do, however the price is, and always has been, staggering. Several months ago I began using the DeLallo Romano brand cheese. I think that it would be unfair to compare it to the Locatelli as they are two very different, though same type of cheeses. I love the Locatelli's texture and consistancy, but I love the DeLallo's flavor. For the difference in price, I will continue buying and enjoying this cheese (DeLallo). For those who may be sceptical, try it, you may find as I did that you not only have a money saver, but a terrific alternative to high priced name brand cheese.
