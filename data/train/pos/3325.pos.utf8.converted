Ordered and received kit in Jan 2011. Started brewing March 3 2011, drank first bottle around April 4. Bavarian Hefweizen, very good taste, about 5-6 percent alcohol or 10-12 proof. Must follow directions and keep everything clean. Quality kit contained everyting to make your first brew, but I've added a few things like hops bags and thermometer and extra bottle caps. I do not recommend buying inexpensive kits. I also recommend buying "Joy of Home Brewing" to go along with the kit. The kit directions are basic, the book has helpful tips. The price I paid was better than what I would pay locally, in this area, by about $40. I prefered new bottles, as I didn't want to mess with finding and cleaning bottles with non twist off caps. Extra 12 oz. bottles run about $12 for 24 bottles. First batch figures out to about $3 per bottle, which includes the cost of the kit. After that it's about 50 cents a bottle. As a side note, I started my second batch May 19. Enjoy! :)
