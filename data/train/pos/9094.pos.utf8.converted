My Australian Cattle Dog/German Sheppard mix is a very picky eater.  She loves Orijen. Right from the start when I put it in her dish she ate it up, and she continues to do so every morning.  My other mutt, the chow hound, especially loves this food and can't get enough.  I have now had both my mutts on Orijen for 8 months and will continue to keep them on this food.  They both eat it, their coats continue to be healthy and glossy and neither has had any digestive issues since I've put them on Orijen.  Great stuff, worth the price.
