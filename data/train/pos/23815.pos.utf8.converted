Wow, no wonder you can't get this anymore.  They probably can't make them fast enough.  This is such an unusual gift set.  The pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item.  The teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Makes you want to drink tea all day.  The box that it comes in (as well as the individual tea box) is reuseable and so pretty.  I hope that this item is offered for sale again soon, as I would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts...and maybe one for myself!!!
