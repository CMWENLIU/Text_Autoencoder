The tea is sweet and has a strong apple flavor. Interestingly enough, I have never liked apple juice or apple cider, but I love this apple tea. The flavor of apple isnt quite as acidic, and the sweetness of the apple is showcased in this tea.<br />I suggest getting a packaged deal with the cups because they are so cute!
