First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good.
