When UPS dropped them off I was anxious to see how they fared as every product of this brand that has a review makes adverse comments on packaging. I think the manufacturer must have corrected it since they came in a nicely made, well fitting box lined with styrofoam on the top and bottom and dividers. In fact I saved the boxes to use for seasonal mug storage. The product containers are thick plastic with a screw on lid that could also be reused. I washed a couple in my DW and they held up perfectly. As for the flavor and quality-WOW! I would like to have tasted more capers and basil,as there is a lot of onion, but the tomato cream base is good right out of the jar by itself. I ended making a chicken pasts dish that was wonderful. I hoped for leftovers, but one jar is really only enough for 2 servings with pasta. Take advantage while it is on sale by trying the gift pack. This really is an incredible deal.
