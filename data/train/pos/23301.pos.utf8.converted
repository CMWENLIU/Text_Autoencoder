My wife and I drink about six glasses of iced tea daily... each.  We have two pitchers that we rotate through in the fridge at all times.  Whoever empties a pitcher is responsible for rinsing it out, tossing in four bags, refilling the pitcher, and putting it back to get cold.  The pitcher on the inside is the current one.<br /><br />My wife is a year post-bariatric surgery patient.  Until we discovered this stuff, she used to have problems keeping properly hydrated.  The doctors don't particularly like the idea of her ingesting so much caffiene, but they frankly prefer it to once-every-two-month visits to the ER for intravenous fluids.<br /><br />Personally, I love Monin Blackberry syrup.  I learned about it through Chili's restaurants; I used to gladly fork over the $2.50 for their iced tea, which was always too weak and didn't have quite enough blackberry syrup for me.  Now, thanks to the Amazon subscriptions to both products, I have all I want for about 25 cents a glass total.  My daughter is equally fond of Monin Mango syrup, I may send her a case for Christmas!
