Let me tell you folks -- several years ago we tried the<br />Dreamfield pasta and also the spinach.  I never bought<br />diet kind of pasta again until I found out I had diabetes<br />a few months ago.<br /><br />Had to revamp my cupboard with foods to help my problem,<br />so I ordered this pasta from amazon.com.  You would be<br />as amazed as we were:  1) the first time I was questioning<br />cooking al dente following the instructions, but 2) cooking<br />just beyond al dente a bit made all the difference in the<br />world and this pasta tasted as good as Ronzoni or any other<br />pasta.<br /><br />I will bring this name with me to my next diabetes class<br />in August to share with all the other folks.
