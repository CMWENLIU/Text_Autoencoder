I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as another reviewer noted, the addition of sugar (NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!<br /><br />P.P.S.  I have a new "best way" to make this:  take a "Working" glass  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LL83X6">Luminarc 3053195 Working Glass jar 21oz, 12 PACK.</a>, pop the contents of one packet of iced Via into it, fill with skim milk up to the top of the highest indentations in the glass (exactly 16 oz!), and stir.  Done!  I used to then plop some chocolate syrup into it but now find I no longer need even that.  Behold, in seconds a frappuchino that is bigger, non-fat (as opposed to "low fat"), and lower in sugar than the commercial bottles.  And if you need to take it away, put the matching lid on the glass (search "working glass" -- all lids fit both sizes of working glasses).  My new, 8-second method of preparing a marvelous frappuchino to start the day!!! (almost as fast as just grabbing a bottle out of the refrigerator, and both cheaper and lower in calories, too!).
