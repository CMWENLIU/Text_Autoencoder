I have 4 cats who will eat anything I put in front of them and a few thing I don't. I will buy other brands when they are on sale, so I am able to conduct taste tests with the cats to see if they have a preference. I will say my cats prefer this to "Kit and Kaboodle" and "9 Lives." They like it slightly better than the kidney friendly Walmart brand.<br /><br />My vet recommends this brand, if I am not going to spend the big bucks on Iams or canned food...which they get from time to time. Like another reviewer stated, I too have a cat with a sensitive stomach that likes to decorate with recycled cat food. This brand seems to be best to calm her tummy.<br /><br />I am unsure of these flavors. The well balanced flavors my cats seem to like are: baby bird, vole, grass, lizard, baby squirrel, rhino beetle, and for desert a good lick of cat butt. There's a challenge for someone.<br /><br />In my neighborhood, Wal-mart has the cheapest price about $9.00 a bag.
