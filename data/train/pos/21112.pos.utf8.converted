If you can't get to a specialty shop (e.g.candy shop, Cracker Barrel-type-joint) to obtain any type of candy resembling peppermint bark (I never can), then get these suckers. They are at Target, and they do go fast. Not too strong, not white-chocolate-chalky at all, slightly crunchy due to mint specks added by the elves...I just ate one right now in order for reporting purposes, and I feel like I am in the Andes. Without rugby players, of course.
