*****<br />If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea. Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception. It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star. I noticed that it has been mentioned here that the bergamot flavor is too mild; to me, the bergamot flavor is quite prominent, but I don't drink artificially flavored tea, so if you do, this might be a change for you. I love it and would not go back to fake bergamot for anything--real bergamot is a treat and hard to find. Over time, you really don't want anything else and the fake stuff tastes chemically. So if you want to try the real thing, I think you'll love this tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia). It is also kosher. On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea. When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments. Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a nice savings over single boxes. If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
