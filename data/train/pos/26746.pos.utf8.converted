Best value I've found after years of searching. This pepper is stronger and more flavorful than anything you'll ever find in the supermarket, and is reasonably priced. You can use a little less than normal if you like, since the pepper flavor is so much more pronounced than you're probably used to. But I like to use my normal amount  and thoroughly enjoy the great pepper flavor. As long as you have a good pepper mill and grind it fresh, this is really the best I've found.
