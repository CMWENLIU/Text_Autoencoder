This coconut milk is delicious and a real bargain for organic!!!  I use 2 or 3 cans a week of organic coconut milk because I use it in smoothies and like to drink it plain also or pour it over cereal.  I pour the contents of the can into a glass quart container, then fill it the rest of the way with water, shake it up, and put in the fridge.  When it gets cold, it is nice and thick again!  This is the only milk I drink because I don't do cow's milk and I no longer do soy milk either.
