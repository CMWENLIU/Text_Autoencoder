I am very salt sensitive and search to find helathy low sodium products.  On a recent trip to San Diego, I happened to find Nana's Oatmeal sunflower cookies.  It is a meal in a cookie!  It tastes good, moist and wholesome and very filling.  I have ordered a large quantity and carry some with me, so I always have something to eat when I can't find low sodium food.  Routinely, I eat one a day along with a serving of fruit, either for breakfast or lunch. It has been a wonderful find!!
