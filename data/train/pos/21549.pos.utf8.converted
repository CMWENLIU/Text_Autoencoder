Having lived in Switzerland for several years, one of the things I missed coming to this country was the ready availability of good breakfast cereals. I have never quite understood how the sugar-filled granola stuff could ever have been mistaken as healthy and nutritious.<br /><br />Since the stores in my area do not carry decent m&uuml;eslis (Trader Joe's has a "blueberry" m&uuml;esli, whose "blueberries" are actually blueberry-flavored cranberries...), I tried to order online, and ran into this product on Amazon, which I ordered based on the reviews.<br /><br />It turned out to be a lucky choice. Bob's Red Mill m&uuml;esli is the way m&uuml;esli should be: a short list of ingredients (10), none of which require a degree in chemistry to understand. A mix of cereals and nuts, to which a delicious combination of dried fruit add a wonderful fruitiness and a subtle sweetness. Great with cold and warm milk, yoghurt, or as a base for a Bircher-style m&uuml;esli.<br /><br />This m&uuml;esli ranks right there with some of the best stuff you can buy in Switzerland, and if you have ever had m&uuml;esli there, you know this is no small praise.
