Some time back, I saw really foodgasmic reviews of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKU1TO">Pacific Natural Foods Organic Soup, Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato, 16-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)</a> and despite almost always making my own, it was on sale, so I got it (the 32 oz though, since they're the same thing, the 32oz "creamy" listed here not actually saying creamy anywhere, maybe a marketing change). On it was a coupon for $1 off this, so at my store, since I only live a few hours from where this stuff's made, well, that made this 17.6oz box a buck sixty. Seeing the ingredients and nutritional profile, I had to seriously hold back from using more coupons right then and there and buying them all.<br /><br />Does it say much to tell you I went back two days later, lots of coupons available, and got EVERY SINGLE ONE (granted it was only 7) and even went--because that location of the co-op didn't have another item I wanted--to the other location a couple days after THAT and got even more? Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />The flavor is savory, aromatic, lovely. The base has a clear tomato flavor, the red peppers definitely shine through, and it also has a warm, "fully cooked" onion presence in the base. The main spices that are apparent are cumin, a touch of garlic, and a bit of chili powder. The celery is thankfully extremely mild (too many soups are heavy on the celery flavor, which is not my idea of yum). There's a touch of sweet corn in it that contrasts the otherwise savory-on-savory flavor blend really nicely. The most important part, though, are the beans! By volume--I'm not a bean counter :D--it's about 50% black beans and 50% lentils, which I thought was excellent. If you're looking for lentil soup that's the traditional style, ie 80% lentils, 20% accents like onions and such, this isn't it. This IS, though, awesome and pretty unique. It's good enough for me to buy, and again, soup's easy and I'm SO picky I can't stand most processed stuff!<br /><br />It can easily be spiced up--some Madras style curry and maybe a bit of creme fraiche or greek yogurt would be great. Since I also got, for a mere four bucks each, my beloved Dave's Killer Bread (Good Seed)--the only honest to god truly healthy and whole bread available--I of course experimented! All in the name of science and fair reviewing! The broth--thinner than you'd expect for "lentil soup" but exactly what you would for "vegetable soup"--is improved by this bread (can't speak for others of course), whereas the beans I preferred with just a touch of the broth, no bread. I could, however, see this being a pretty cool base for, say, salsa--maybe drained a bit with the broth saved--I wouldn't throw out anything from this, and I'm a food snob!<br /><br />The last thing I have to mention is the PACKAGING and prep. Did I mention it took a mere 90 seconds to cook in the microwave? It's AWESOME for commuting and even CAMPING and here's why: like other tetra pak boxes, it can handle quite a bit of tumbling around (wouldn't "test it" with puncturing, but I know for a fact they can get crushed on the corners and survive or be squeezed pretty tight and not leak/explode). What's DIFFERENT about these "tetra brik" ones is that to open, you simply pop the triangles on the side up, squeeze the upper 4 corners to make it shaped like a capri sun, and unzip the sturdy box. The zipper's quite easy (I was able to grip it with a thumb that had just been busted 12 hours prior) and even I--a red food magnet--didn't spill or splash it a bit! To dispose of it, just rinse and recycle (in cities that do Tetra, which mine does or else I'd probably not drink hazelnut milk as much as I do let alone eat soup--I DO wish plain ol' beans and canned tomatoes would be put in these though--Muir Glen, you listening?)... so to camp, just rinse if you can but otherwise, just fold it several times, shove it in your waste bag, and you have a VERY small container for the amazing nutrition in it. That said, while I consume the (actual, 100g) recommended amount of fiber to stay healthy, this is not the right choice if you have a formal event later in the evening or on the next day. To quote an old professor, when you pick what you're eating, "you've got two choices: fat or fart." This one doesn't make you fat, so ease into it if you eat a lot of sugar/refined carbs or drink juices, soda, beer, etc. regularly instead of naturally fiber rich options :P
