I can't believe it happened, but it did: Sudden Death was no longer a one- or two-drop test of strength.  I'm actually putting tablespoons of it in the sixteen-ounce salsa jars now.  Two years ago, I'd have run outside and eaten grass to put out the fire.  Now?  I've gotten my tolerance up.  It's time to go a little further.<br /><br />Mega Death is that next gradation of heat, spice, and taste.  Really tasty, the single-most important criterion when picking a sauce.  It adds distinct flavor and, when properly used, gives you the blend of heat and spice that turns you into an addict.  You could literally overindulge with a good sauce, so be careful.<br /><br />I have to revert to my one- or three-drop amounts, and that's not only economical but good sense when dealing with Blair's sauces.  If not graduallly tested, you could end up eating grass instead of salsa, and that's not a good way to get fiber.<br /><br />Fred
