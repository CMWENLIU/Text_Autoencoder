i have eaten nutella for ever,i just wanted to try something new,so i purchased this product,WHAT A MISTAKE!this is just what i did not need,one more food addiction nocciolata hazelnut spread is not quite as sweet as nutella and is softer.this one is not for the kids,save every indulgent smear for you,IT IS WORTH THE PRICE!!
