this is my favorite chai tea!  it's high in caffeine, and the spices give the allusion of sweetness so you dont have to add much sugar if any.  the teabag is strong enough for two or three cups (if you want to fill up with more hot water), and it's not too spicy or peppery like other chais, but is also not weak.  for some reason i cant find this in any retail stores, so I'm really glad that it's offered here.  you wont have any trouble getting through all six boxes-it's THAT GOOD!
