My local supermarket sells one ounce bags of dried oyster mushrooms for four dollars.  For a little bit more than twice the price, you get a whole pound.  They rehydrate back to near fresh quality.  I boil some water in the microwave and soak the mushroonms for about 20 minutes.  At that point, you can use the liquid to fortify a soup or gravy and cook the mushrooms as desired.<br /><br />Angelina's packs these in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box.  Four boxes fill a carton and save on shipping charges.  I mixed it up and got some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHXMCY">Woodear, First Quality - 1 Lb Bag / Box Each</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV5C">BOLETES, CHILEAN, FIRST QUALITY,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSV02">BLEND, NORTHWOODS,MUSHROOM(DRIED) 1 lb.</a>.  I would like to get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RHSWSS">LOBSTER,MUSHROOM,(DRIED) 1 lb.</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YQ6TDK">Dried Morel Mushrooms 1 Lb. Bag</a> but I can't justify the high price.<br /><br />I am pleased with all of the products I received from Angelina's and will order again.
