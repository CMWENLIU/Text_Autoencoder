I have noted some of previous reviews saying the cans arrived w/ broken package. Luckily the sardine cans I received were in very good condition, and they taste perfect, not to mention the high-protein and low-mercury constituents. Also, I recommend this two-layer one over the one-layer, the fish meat is more delicate; and I don't like the sardines w/ mushroom, which tastes weird.
