Compleats were on sale at Safeway, so I bought a few of each. This one, is among my top favorites. The chicken chunks are large and tender. The noodles are thick and wonderful. The veggies are a good size. The sauce is delicious. I add a little black pepper and mix it all in and have a great, filling, inexpensive, and FAST meal! Love 'em!!!
