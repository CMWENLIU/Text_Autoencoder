Bigelow's Green Tea a la Mango infused flavor is hands down a tea drinker's swoon.  I love it, plain and simple.  It makes me happy. The whole house smells better. I believe it's good for me.  We drink it hot and also as iced tea. What else is there?  Well, in a more perfect world, I'd also like it optioned as Decaffeinated too so I could drink it into the night.  I conquer this by brewing half of Green Tea Mango with a Decaf black tea bag and tell myself that there's surely less caffeine in green tea anyway, but heck, I'm not a scientist, I don't know that for sure.  But your taste buds will dance and trust me, you will start carrying these bags to restaurants rather than settling for some hum-drum tea you're offered.  It actually brings a smile to my face.  How else can I say this?  It's amazing even for a coffee drinker like me to find a tea that I'll root for like this one.  The fact that I now keep it stockpiled is my little secret.  But I don't want to ever be without it again.  Now that's some cup of tea....
