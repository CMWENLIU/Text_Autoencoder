My cat loves her food and telling from the ingredients, it also seems to be a very high quality food. I debated between this brand and Innova Evo but ultimately decided on this one as it had some fish in it and my cat absolutely loves fish so I figured she would like it. I don't like the fact that it has potatoes in it but the over all carb count is still relatively low.  I would prefer if my cat ate only wet food but I have tried countless times to get her to eat canned food and have not had any luck until recently (except with fish which she LOVES but I try to give her only rarely). One point to remember with this food is that it is much higher in calories than the crap-filled stuff so it's not wise to free feed with this food. I've always free fed my cat yet she gained some weight on this food her first few weeks. Now I'm giving her measured portions so that she doesn't eat too much. I feed her half dry and half Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken canned which is supposed to be very good for prevention of UTI's and struvite crystals.
