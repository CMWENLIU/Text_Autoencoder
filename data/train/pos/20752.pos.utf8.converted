My dog has severe allergies to wheat and beef.  Try finding something without either of those two things!!<br />This doesn't have wheat or beef and she's been doing so much better.  She has been on this food for about a year now, and I haven't had any problems.<br />Just wish it wasn't so expensive....but that's what you get with Holistic food.  My dog eats better than I do!
