This is a great product, that is really delicious. It works in a variety of recipes, and is a great healthy alternative for chicken chunks or tuna. It is particularly delicious when allowed to marinate in sauce of choice in the refrigerator over night, allowing it to become saturated with the taste.<br /><br />Great in chili, chicken 'friendly' salad sandwiches, soup, enchiladas, stir-fry, and so much more.<br /><br />Suggested Instructions: boil 3 cups of your liquid of choice (such as veggie broth). Once boiling, add 1 cup tvp, and continue to boil for 5-10 minutes (longer makes it more tender and juicy). Drain, and use.<br /><br />Note: this stuff is not meant to be eaten raw.
