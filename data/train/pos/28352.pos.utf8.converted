What can I say? This is the best Pop-Tarts flavor. The marshmellow, chocolate, and graham cracker crust really does taste like S'mores.<br /><br />The chocolate actually taste like melted chocolate, the marshmellow tastes like real marshmellow.<br /><br />These are perfect for when you are having craving for chocolate without as much guilt as a candy bar.<br /><br />I loved these when I was a kid and I love them just as much as an adult.<br /><br />Easily 5-stars from me.
