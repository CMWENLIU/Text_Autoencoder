As this is my first review, I'm delighted to be able give five stars to a worthy product. I was actually quite happy with a national brand, until I was given a jar from a friend.<br /><br />The difference is night and day. It's pretty difficult to describe how something tastes, but suffice it to say that McCutcheon's has really captured the essence of the apples. That is perhaps the biggest difference. The national brands seem to contain more molasses. But this brand is all about the fruit. As I said, it is simply the best I have ever had.<br /><br />I also like that it comes from a nice family business in Frederick, Maryland.
