These hazelnuts are delicious and the best!  They are packed in resealable 1 lb. vacuum bags and are really fresh, and I can't wait to use them in certain baking recipes I want to try (if I can stop myself from eating them all first) such as Jacques Pepin's chocolate brownie cake with Grand Marnier flavored whipped cream--yumm!  The nuts I've bought locally--usually imported from Turkey--have been extremely disappointing, with about 1/3 of them being rancid, and they would ruin any recipe.  When using hazelnuts in baking, roasting them first really improves their flavor.  Store them in the freezer and they will stay fresh much longer.
