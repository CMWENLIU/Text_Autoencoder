If you have a cat with urinary problems who must eat a special diet Royal Canin Feline Urinary SO Morsels in gravy is worth a try. We used the dry food for some time but found that we needed a wet food for morning feedings. My cat is so hungry in the morning that he would eat the dry quickly and then regurgitate it immediately. When we gave the wet food for morning feeding it solved that problem. My cat loves to lick the gravy out of the can as a bonus. He seems to eat the wet more slowly and is able to digest it well. And, of course, it is a formula made just for his Urinary problems so this is a win, win item. The fact that I can purchase this sometimes hard to find item through Amazon is so convenient. I do not have to run around from store to store trying to find someone who carries this speciialized product.
