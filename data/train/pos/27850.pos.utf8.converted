This is a good alternative to oatmeal.  It takes a little while longer to make in the microwave than oatmeal, but it can be done at a lower power setting.  (I microwave it for two minutes at 70% power as opposed to oatmeal for one minute at full power.)  With a little pure maple syrup or agave nectar, it's very good.
