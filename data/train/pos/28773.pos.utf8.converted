This is great wheat bran.  It's economically sound--as of now, it's well below $2.50 per 16oz, which is cheaper than I can find in any grocery store in California.<br /><br />Besides being relatively cheap, the quality is on par with every other wheat bran I've tried, including Bob's Red Mill, and Quaker.  I mean--come on, it's wheat bran, how can anyone screw it up?<br /><br />In short, this is good.  Buy it.
