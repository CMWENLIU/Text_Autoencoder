It arrived in a generously packaged box, in his little box with a carrying handle. about the same size as expected, but the weight surprised me, it seems heavier then 5 lbs. He's quite tasty, (Blue Raspberry), good conversation peice. overall - very satisfied. would recommend to a friend.<br /><br />ps. He's so friendly, he was quickly named, he is known by several names, but prefers and responds to Junho.
