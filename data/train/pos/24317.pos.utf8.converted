I purchased these as a Valentine's gift for my wife. I knew she would love them, because they're practically all we ate when we backpacked through Europe years ago. These chocolates are impossible for us to find locally, so she's been getting Hershey, Dove, Godiva, Ghiradelli... for the past few years. Then I checked here. Totally worth it. I'd forgotten how good these chocolates are. Those others pale in comparison to the flavor and super-smooth texture of Milka. She'll be expecting these from now on. I wasn't sure if I ordered in time for Valentine's, but they actually arrived 2 days early. Excellent all around.
