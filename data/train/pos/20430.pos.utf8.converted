I love Strawberry Pocky it is my favorite desert.<br />I love the Flavor Strawberry,  in general.<br />There are three types of Pocky Flavors..<br />I have to steer clear of the chocolate Flavor,  because I am allergic to chocolate.<br />What can I say about this.. or compare it to..<br />It reminds me of the taste of Ice Cream :)<br />Strawberry,  creamy,  delicious,  Ice Cream!<br />It's a wonderful desert,  I love it..<br />and the individual packages make it easy for you if you don't want to eat too many and want to stay on a healthy diet with a little bit of a treat here and there :)<br />I mean,  when I get pringles or oreos I can eat the whole container or bag... without even knowing sometimes..<br />But with this,  the little packages give you a very stern and well understood reason to stop.<br />( because the small packet is done,  and the rest are for another time! )<br />I know I am not the only person on this earth with a sweet tooth,<br />so i just figured I would add how this helps me not overdue the sweet cravings :D
