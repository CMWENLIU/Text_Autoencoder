Kar's sweet & salty mix tastes great to me. Everyone I shared them with enjoyed them. I was expecting the raisins to be on the harder/smaller side. The raisins in the case I received were moist and plump. I will be purchasing this product again.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />I'm back for more. Thought I would add this information for anyone who is interested:<br /><br />Each 2 oz. (purple) package contains 280 calories; 19g fat; 115mg sodium; 26g carb; 4g fiber; 18g sugar; and 8g protein
