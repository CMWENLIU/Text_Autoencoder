Fast and easy, and great flavor.  About as close as you are getting without making them from scratch.<br /><br />My wife sadly is addicted to refried beans from a can.  If you can't tolerate refried beans that look like jellied cranberry sauce and smell like a bad cross between dogfood and other unknown substances (let alone taste ugh!), then this product is for you!<br /><br />Ingredients are very simple, it's just that these are pre prepared and dehydrated.  Very lightweight, so if you are going outdoors, these are great to pack and rehydrate, and will definitely help keep you warm in the sleeping bag later, and the packaging is lightweight, so easy to dispose of after.<br /><br />On top of that, there's normal beans in this pack as well, very yummy also.<br /><br />Packaging wise, they come in a 2 part box, dispose of the top and you have a bottom display like container to keep them well organized.
