The only source for Vital Wheat Gluten available locally is a 1.5 Cup package on sale at Wal-Mart as a baking additive -- at a cost of nearly $2.00 (USD). This 3.5 pound package was a godsend as I have an entire folder of seitan recipes I've wanted to try -- and now I'm working my way deliciously through it!
