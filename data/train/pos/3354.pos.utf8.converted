My cat couldn't keep food down and went from 10 lbs to 6 in a short period of time despite lots of vet visits and a $600 endoscopy. He seemed to be slipping away. After reading about possible food allergies and the fact that cats don't need any carbohydrates since they are obligate carnivores, I examined a lot of cat-food labels at my local super pet store, looking for an all-meat food. This is the only one I found. My cat immediately began gaining weight and has been completely healthy since he started eating it about six weeks ago. He has remained slim, active and playful. I wish more people would realize that carbohydrates aren't good for cats! And since it's canned, he gets the moisture he needs.
