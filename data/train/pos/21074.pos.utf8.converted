I'm a vegetarian that did not drink soy milk because I didn't like the taste. I started drinking silk a few years ago and haven't stop drinking it. My favorite is the chocolate. Not crazy about the vanilla and plain flavors so I still use fat free milk for that. Silk chocolate and surprisingly the refrigerated eggnog are great. Drink the Chocolate you wont miss milk.
