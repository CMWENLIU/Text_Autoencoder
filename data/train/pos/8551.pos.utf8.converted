This soba's quality and taste are very good!<br />Since I am Japanese, I have eaten many kinds of sobas in my life.<br />So, I know the real Japanese Soba taste. It remains firmness and soba flavor after<br />boiling it. It is made in Australia, but the quality is guaranteed, and I can highly recommend it.<br />Pricewise is also very reasonable. Please enjoy real Japanese taste!
