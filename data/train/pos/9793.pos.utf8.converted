This is the second brand of ghee that I have tried and I like this one far and away above the other one (Nanak Pure Desi Ghee). This one doesn't separate and has a smooth creamy consistency, whileas the other one is more gritty and the flavor is not nice just straight out of the jar. Purity Farm has me eating it straight out of the jar and it smells just heavenly.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product and would definitely buy it again. I especially like that it is casein-free as I have a dairy intolerance so even the small amounts of milk protein in regular butter might be an issue, but with this ghee I don't have to worry about it.<br /><br />*update* It is now a few months since I started ordering this and I have started ordering two jars at a time to make sure that I'm never without. I have confirmed that regular butter DOES cause me issues but ghee is perfectly fine due to being casein-free. I read that ghee is also an ayurvedic remedy for many things and is supposed to be healing for leaky-gut syndrome.<br /><br />I also have to say that it makes a FANTASTIC moisturizer for the face! I have ultra ultra sensitive skin that just cannot handle the slightest amount of chemicals on it. I thought to myself one day to try ghee as a facial moisturizer as I desperately needed it. I put it on, thinking that I might get red from it or break out as I have from every other moisturizer attempt and... no reaction! Best of all, my dry, scaly patch on my face is now soft and smooth after only two applications! I've had that scaly patch for months! I am so excited about this find since most of the time I cannot do any topicals at all, but my skin just loved the ghee and drank it up. A little goes a long way, so if you do this, a pea-sized amount is plenty for a large area. Rub in gently but if your skin is dry it will soak up quickly leaving you feeling soft but not oily if you put on just a little bit at a time. You can always put more as needed, so don't overdo at the beginning.
