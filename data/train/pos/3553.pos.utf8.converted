I was tired of grocery store red pepper flakes that were stale and lacking in heat so I gave Tone's a try. I was surprised to find fresh chili oil on my fingers when I opened the package. I thought this was a good sign and it was. These peppers taste fresher and spicier than any I've bought at the grocery store. We'll see how long they stay that way but so far so good.<br /><br />UPDATE August 2012: I have noticed that the peppers stay spicier in the fridge than at room temperature. So if you like to keep a little dispenser at the table, you may want to only fill up 1-2 week's worth.
