This is some of the best flavored coffee I've ever had, and I have lived in 5 different east and west coast locations.  True the shipping box is not gift ready or pretty to look at but those coffee jewels inside makes it more than worth the purchase.  You and you're guests will be more than overjoyed with the flavor you taste.  Have ordered sampler box and a specially flavor tailored box.  Making a 3rd order today.  Give your tastebuds a coffee reward, you'll be back for more.
