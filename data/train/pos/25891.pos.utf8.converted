Ferrara Pan Candy Company is the only Atomics I know and they have been around since the beginning of time. They are consistent in quality.<br /><br />I buy around 200  each week for people a t work. Some people just live on these animals. Others just see how long they can suck on them before changing to the other side of the mouth. It looks like people are going around with fat jaws. When the red coating wears off it seems that they just get hotter. And you can hear the tell tale sound of people crunching to get it over with. Then they come back for more.
