This oil is very light and doesn't have a distinct flavor, so, you can pretty much use it to fry/saut&eacute;/bake/etc. anything. It's a great oil for cake-mixes because of the no-flavor factor. For stir-frys, this is also excellent because it has a decent smoke-point and the same goes for making excellent old-fashioned popcorn on the stove-top.<br /><br />This oil is also delicious mixed with oil in salad dressings for a bit 'lighter' flavor.<br /><br />Oh, and yes, this oil is very good for you [which is always a bonus].
