This is a cool organic fruit snack great for all ages not just kids.  I was looking for an organic fruit snack for my sons lunch box and this  is prefect.  Great prepackaged, keeps well, no refrigeration required. Great for  on the go, lunch boxes, camping, picnics, anytime.  I can keep organic fruit on the shelf now ready anytime.<br /><br />We are never put off by labels like for tots or babies ,unfortunately  most of the organic snacks seem to be geared toward them.  My son loves bananas and apple sauce, so we thought we would try this.  So he calls this his  banana sauce.  He even wanted to freeze it . So we popped it in freezer and then cut off the bottom for a banana sorbet. He loved it.<br /><br />Also he loves the caps and is collecting  them to make something. They have holes so could be strung together.
