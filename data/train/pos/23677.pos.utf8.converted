The amazon price and subscription service is a great deal most anytime. If you buy Bob's products, this is the way to go.<br />This particular nutritional yeast has a great taste. I've had several brands, and so far this is my favorite. I keep some on the table in a small jar next to the salt and pepper. My daughter and I routinely add it to foods---potatoes, beans, wraps, soups, etc., in order to make sure we are getting the B12 that is important in a vegetarian diet.
