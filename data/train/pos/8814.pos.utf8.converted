Here is Brothers All Natural food and safety report.  It sounds better than our own food guidelines. :-(<br /><br />Here is an small excerpt from their report:<br /><br />"Our product is freeze-dried and is made without any preservatives or chemicals using our own internal safe inspections and 3rd party inspections to make absolutely sure that our process is secure and safe.  In fact we go well above and beyond any US company that we know in regards to food safety and quality.  We test all our raw material and finished products 4 times so that all our customers have peace of mind.  Pesticides, heavy metals, allergens, extraneous material and many other items are all checked on every single batch.<br /><br />Our product is pure and safe.  We are a very responsible company.  What we are suggesting is that when it comes to food safety and quality it all comes down to the company and the brand, not just the country of origin.  There have been so many recent recalls on food products produced in the USA and unfortunately even deaths that have happened due to the sloppy and total lack of concern from USA food producers...peanut butter, beef, eggs, and so many more prove that product of USA does not ensure safe food products.  You do not have that concern with Brothers-All-Natural products."<br /><br />So let's give this company the benefit of the doubt since they make such a good product. "USA" was included in this line up along with China on the back of the package; they were even first in line. Was that overlooked or what? People are so quick to judge but then turn around and still eat tons of chicken and have no idea what is given to the chicken or how the chicken lives.  We think it's great but we aren't allowed by Tyson (the largest chicken supplier in our country) to see the chickens living conditions. I wonder why? Are they hiding something. Obviously they are because the chicken farmers tell us that if they say or let anyone look at the chickens, they are OUT. How do we know what is going into our chickens or how they live? Check this out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Foods. Maybe they eat other dead chickens or droppings from other chickens. We don't know because our great USA Tyson chicken company won't let us see....it's all a big dark secret. One chicken farmer got tired of keeping the public in suspense (it just made her sick, so she gave up) so she showed what the chickens went through. It was HORRIBLE! Dead and sick chickens all over the place because they cram them up so tight and feed them corn and who knows what else, to make them fat fast. Some chickens can't walk because they are so big that they just lay there until someone takes it away to be slaughtered. They are kicked and thrown when they are going to the slaughter house. It's awful to see. But I am greatful to that farmer for showing the public what Tyson chicken is doing.<br /><br />And we're concerned about this apple treat? Let's try to be fair to this company. At least they claim to be on the legit. Maybe,  have the dried fruit checked out if if there is that much concern. :-/<br /><br />The only thing I wonder about is why isn't there more vitamins in the package or fiber if it's 2 fruit servings?<br /><br />I hope that this company survives because they do make a good product.<br /><br />Good luck!
