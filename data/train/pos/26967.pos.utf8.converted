Classic Zotz fizzy sour candy - kind of like Pop Rocks in a hard candy, or a lozenge filled with sour Pixy Stix powder.  The box contains 48 strings of 4 individually wrapped pieces, for a total of 192 pieces.  This is basically the same as the Zotz candy that was popular back in the 1970s, but it's now imported from Italy.  The flavors in the box I received from Amazon Grocery weren't as pictured in the item listing (cherry/orange/lemon/lime); instead, it contained equal numbers of cherry (red), apple (green), and watermelon (pink).
