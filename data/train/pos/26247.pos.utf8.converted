My wife is from Fresno and brought this into the marriage. The big country-style ak-mak is ten times better than the little crackers. Break off a chunk the size of a credit card, spread it with unsalted butter, and cover it with a vegetable-peeler shaving of romano cheese. Serve it to a room full of church ladies and they'll body-check each other into the boards to get the last piece.<br />At Amazon's price for the Country Style, it's way cheaper than Triscuits. And I'd much rather give the money to the Soojians than to Nabisco.
