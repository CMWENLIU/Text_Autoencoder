I have been a Starbucks French Roast "addict" ever since Starbucks opened. That said, I have been advised to severely limit the amount of caffeine I consume, so I have had to look for Decaf french roast coffee.  Until I tasted Jeremiah's Pick French Roast, everything paled in comparison to the Starbucks French Roast (they don't make a Decaf FR).  Jeremiah's Pick decaf is as close as you will get to that real arabica dark roast flavor I've always enjoyed with Starbucks -- you'll get that full rich french roast aroma and taste as you take your first sip.  It's a winner, and as loyal a Starbuck's customer as I have been, I sense a real change in the wind. . . . .  Jerimiah has won my heart!
