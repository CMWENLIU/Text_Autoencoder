We tried several formulas. At first we went with Similac Sensitive, which worked well for our baby's gassy tummy. With all the coupons for Similace we found it cheaper but after talking with my pediatrician we finally decided to look at the ingredients on the back of the container. Both Similac and Enfamil list corn syrup as their number one ingredient. Only Gerber Goodstart  has real ingredients and it is the only formula I will trust for my little one.
