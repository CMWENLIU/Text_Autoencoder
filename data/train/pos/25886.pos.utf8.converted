I recently purchased the Carnation no added sugar drinks, the "with sugar" version, a 4 pack of Kellogg's version as well.  Decided to test drive them all.  Label comparison puts Carnation's no sugar added breakfast drink on top.  A third the carbohydrates as all the others, fewer calories by far, same vitamin content basically, and Carnation's no sugar version came out nicely on protein.  And, here's the surprise, it tastes really good.  So why down 20g more carbs, less protein and a lot more calories with Kelloggs or Carnation's sugared version, when this is available.  Yum.
