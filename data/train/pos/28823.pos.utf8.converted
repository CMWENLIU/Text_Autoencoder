Ok, I admit it.  I go a bit overboard for my kitty sometimes.  He was eating Wellness brand pouches for a while, but I felt like he was getting tired of the same 4 (grain free) flavors.  I decided to try this, although I was hesitant about the pumpkin soup aspect.  My boy loves it!  The "soup" is just gravy, and there is a good amount of it which pleases me since I'm concerned about hydration.  The chicken actually looks and smells like shredded chicken that I would eat myself!  My kitty gobbled it all up at once.  I've since tried all the other flavors with similar results. (with the exception of the Polynesian  dinner flavor, which my boy didn't like.)  No fillers, good quality meat/seafood, lots of variety.  I'm pleased!
