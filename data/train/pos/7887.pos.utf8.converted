This really works!! Within a week I noticed a huge difference in my under eye circles. I work night shift and I usually do not get enough sleep. I bought a very expensive La Mer The Eye Concentrate and used it twice a day for 4 months with no improvement. In fact they were getting worse!!! Out of desperation I searched Amazon and based on the reviews bought 100% Pure. I am sold for life. My little wrinkles are also becoming less noticeable. The smell is fine, honestly it could smell like a sewer and I would still put it on because it works. It is so refreshing to buy a product that delivers on their claims. Thank you :-)
