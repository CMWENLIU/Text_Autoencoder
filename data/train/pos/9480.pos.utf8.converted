I've been using this Manuka Honey for my ulcers and have noticed such an improvement.  I take some in the morning and usually once more in the afternoon.  I've also used it on canker sores, and it practically stopped it instantly.  It was gone in a day or two.  It has a thicker consistency than regular honey, but is still very sweet.  I would recommend this honey for anyone with gastric problems or canker sores.
