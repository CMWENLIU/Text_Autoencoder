I am from the Caribbean, so I know how coconut milk for cooking should taste.  For many years I have used either a fresh coconut (which to me is a lot of work, with the breaking open the coconut, removing piulp from the hard shell and grating or blending) or canned Asian products (some with strange aftertaste - you have to use entire can unless you freeze remainder).  When I went back home for a visit this year, I saw this powder in the store, bought a pack because I was skeptical, and was amazed.  I use it for cooking and you can make it as creamy as you wish based on your recipe.  I brought some back with me and thought I would have to get it sent in the mail from back home.  I checked Amazon and I am very happy to find this right here. I am not vegan and I know where "MILK based sodium caseinate" comes from.<br /><br />If you are looking for a no-hassle authentic tasting coconut milk - this should be your choice!!
