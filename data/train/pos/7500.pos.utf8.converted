I had been searching for a healthy low-sodium stock cube that I could use for my one-year-old son's meals. Everything I could find was full of chemicals and/or high salt. (I boycott Whole Foods after getting severe food poisoning from their food during my pregnancy and discovering that the management could not care less about their customers, but that's another story...).<br /><br />These stock cubes were a real find - they taste great, are healthy, low sodium, and you can use them in an amazing array of meals. Perfect for flavoring a soup, rice/paella/risotto, stew or even a stir fry. Bonus: you will save money buying them here!
