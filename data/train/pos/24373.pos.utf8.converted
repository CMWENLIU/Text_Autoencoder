Those of us who must limit sodium intake tend to be desperate for palatable low-sodium seasonings and grateful when we find them. BaconSalt has leapt way beyond merely "palatable," however, and brought new seasoning products to market that can make salt-hungry, bacon-deprived deprived folk like us absolutely giggle with delight. When we first learned about BaconSalt, we bought one of each flavor (the basics on Amazon, some special ones on the company website), plus extras for gifts. We sent a half-price gift package to loved ones at an APO address (as of this writing, the company actually gives military buyers/recipients a 50% discount -- imagine that!). We have no interest in the company, BTW ... we're just happy consumers grateful to find that we needn't abandon the savory flavors of bacon in the pursuit of good health.
