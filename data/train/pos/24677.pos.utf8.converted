This rice is a little tricky at first due to thicker bran.  Once you figure the right amount of water and time (about 45-60 mins) they turn out great.  You can time them tight and have fun chewing them or let them puff out a bit for a more cloudy rice.  The taste is great...I eat them by themselves with vegetables or they work good in burritos or Mexi-style dishes as well.  Recommended.
