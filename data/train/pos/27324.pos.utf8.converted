I make no claim to being a tea expert. I simply like to drink tea. This one makes a nice change. The flavor is gently smokey and smooth; one could call it lapsang for beginners :-). If you find you enjoy its gentle smoke then be daring and try lapsang souchong which is _very_ smokey indeed. Go easy on the amount, a little goes a long way, and give it a few minutes to fully unroll its leaves. Then enjoy!
