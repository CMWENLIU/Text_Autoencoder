Xylitol is the best sugar substitute right now. The other artificial things like sucralose (etc) taste weird but xylitol has a clean sugar taste. Also, since I have a very cavity prone kid, it is nice to allow him to  have sweetner in his tea and not worry since xylitol also inhibits the growth of bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />I have used it in baking as well. Works great.<br /><br />Given the cost of filling a cavity, the extra cost of xylitol is worth it.<br /><br />Oh...and one more thing, it can be diluted and used as a nasal wash for people with sinus problems because it inhibits bacteria growth (in the nose as well as the mouth....it may even be good on wounds for all I know).
