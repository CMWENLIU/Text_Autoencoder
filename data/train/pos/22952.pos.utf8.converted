I love coconut aminos!  If you love asian cooking and cannot eat soy, this is a lifesaver.  It is definitely sweeter than regular soy sauce, so I don't love it in fried rice, but it goes very nicely in stir fries or teriyaki based marinades and sauces.  It is SO NICE to be able to eat asian food again!  I wish it came in a larger bottle or in bulk quantities because it is so expensive!
