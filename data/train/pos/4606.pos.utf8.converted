I love Fionna, really I do. She is sleek and black and such a cat. However, her daily doody brought tears to my eyes. Company would suddenly remember forgotten appointments. It was enough to wake me from a sound sleep....in my three story house. I also noticed bloody poo some of the time. My daughter had similar problems with one of her cats. Her vet recommended NB Cat Food. It is the best!! Both of my cats looooooovvve it! While I cant' say the litter box is completely odor-free, the aroma is much more tolerable and within normal range of kitty smells. Both cats are grateful for the change. I highly recommend Natural Balance Green Pea and Salmon Cat food. The one made with duck makes my cats quite happy, also.
