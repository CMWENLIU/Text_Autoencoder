We have a household of 6 cats and they all love this dry food.  The ingredients are wonderful and you tell the quality of the food because it does not contain fillers such as cornmeal which is used in the cheaper brands.  In cat food, you often get what you pay for and although you may feel a bit woof sticker shock with the price of an 111 lb bag .... It is worth it.  You save money on the other end when you buy a food without fillers ... Less feces in the litter box and a lot less odor.  Our cats have coats that are silky soft and they lave this food.<br /><br />I've been a Wellness dray cat food fan for 6 years and they a love it.  This formula has been popular with all 6 cats.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
