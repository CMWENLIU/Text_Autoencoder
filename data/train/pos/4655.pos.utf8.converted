I'd seen ice wine tea from another online seller -- one who wanted half again as much for the tea and twice as much for the shipping. A little Googling found CulinaryTeas both on Amazon and on their own website, and I'm glad I did the comparison shopping since I ordered several CulinaryTeas teas and like them all. (Personally, next time I'll order straight from their own website rather than through Amazon, because I wanted to add something else to my order and the owner said that she could do that for orders through their own site but not through Amazon's system due to Amazon's separately calculated shipping fees and such. I did figure out how to combine orders through Amazon, but talking to the owner also provided recommendations about other teas to try in the future.)<br /><br />One thing I particularly like about CulinaryTeas' setup is the ability to order by the ounce or by larger quantities, and to choose between a tea tin and a resealable bag. Since I'm ordering for a local tea-sampling club, the resealable bag is better for me since I distribute most of the tea to the members and have a small sample of my own left and can 'squish' the bags down into a smaller space. The large tins with a teaspoon or two of tea left in the bottoms just take up too much space until I get around to brewing and drinking my samples from the month's teas.<br /><br />People who are buying purely for themselves will probably want the tins, since most people don't go through 4 oz. of tea in one afternoon's mad bagging spree and would want something tidy and stackable for long-term storage. But since we're buying several teas as a group to maximize our 'tea-sampling' potential and distributing our sampled teas to each other, the bags work better in our situation.<br /><br />About this particular ice wine tea -- it smells and tastes wonderful, with floral-and-intensely-grape-and-wine scents and tastes. I've made it both hot and iced, and I liked it both ways -- going into summer I'm more likely to drink it iced for the next few months, of course. CulinaryTeas also offers flavor blends I've never seen anywhere else, and I'm looking forward to tasting my various samples!
