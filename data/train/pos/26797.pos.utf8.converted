I have always loved the brown jasmine rices of Thailand and other specialty rices of the Far East.  The Mekong Flower rice has become my very favorite and my husband now raves about it as much as I do.  He was not too excited that I had bought 11 pounds and was disappointed that he wasn't getting the brown jasmine last night.  When the Mekong Flower rice started cooking (in a small clay pot on top of stove) and that wonderful aroma began to fill the kitchen, he decided this new rice might be a winner.  It was perfect. The flavor was delicate, the grains cooked perfectly and there was not even a grain leftover.<br /><br />For an unforgettable and really flavorful dinner, try it with any of the Rancho Gordo heirloom beans (cooked in a clay bean pot) and laddle the beans over the rice.  I'm on the list to be advised when this rice is back in stock.  It's just that good!!!  Both grains and beans just taste better and earthier in a good clay pot on top of the stove.
