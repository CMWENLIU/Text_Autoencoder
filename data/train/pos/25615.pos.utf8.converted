Perfectly packed with a years worth of gel ice, every oyster was fresh like we had spent the 59 dollars to drive to the ocean...  Metallic, flinty, a bit salty, just a hint of earth on the finish.  These are at least 1/2 to 1/3 the cost of ANYONE else on the web. I only hope they can continue at that price!  Great job, Amazon and oyster guys.
