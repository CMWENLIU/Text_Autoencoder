I cannot begin to state how excited I am to find this available from Amazon.com. Carnation Chocolate Malted Milk has been a favorite of my Mother Velia all my life, and therefore it was expected on the breakfast table. I'm 35 now with my own family and I have an incredibly hard time finding the chocolate version in particular. To be able to order this "comfort food" and have it shipped means a great deal. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys chocolate milk!!
