I should have known something was up when I saw my local Safeway store selling this custard at something like $.69 as a "while supplies last" advertisement. Needless to say, I bought all that they had on the shelf at the time - something like 16 boxes. To my dismay, when I had used all that I had found and returned to buy some more ... I was nearly heartbroken! Then one day I was tooling around online and decided to "google-in" Jello custard, and low-and-behold Amazon came up. I opened an account, bought a case at an excelent price, and now I am going to sign up as a "frequent-buyer" and get an additional %15 off, plus free shipping. I want to be buried with at least one box, because it is so fabulous. I highly reccomend the purchase through Amazon.
