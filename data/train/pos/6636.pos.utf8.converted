My dog LOVES Zukes.  We had never tried the fillets before, the stores around us carry Zukes but not the fillets.  Dog went NUTS for them.  Would do ANYTHING for them.  Normally we leave his treats in the bag on the counter out of reach.  The little stinker wanted them so bad he somehow jumped on the counter, knocked them onto the ground and ate the bag to get to the treats.  He did this the day after we got them.  So they don't last long in our house!!!
