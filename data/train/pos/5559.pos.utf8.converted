All you you have to do is search the web for Lecithin and Cayenne.  Lecithin is a natural emulsifier that suspends fat in your bloodstream instead of on your arterial walls.<br /><br />Cayenne is a vasodilator that lowers blood-pressure and increases blood-flow.<br /><br />This unique combination both lowers cholesterol and reduces blood-pressure plus it reduces plaque on arterial walls.  There is no excuse not to try this homeopathic remedy.<br /><br />Personally, I take one cup of hot water with one dropper-full of cayenne tincture (homemade) and one tablespoon of lecithin with one teaspoon of granulated garlic per day.  I don't take any statins whatsoever; nor, do I take the hypertension drugs at the high-dosages I used to.  My blood-pressure and cholesterol are both within the safe ranges.<br /><br />As a replacement for the statins, I take presciptions fish oil (Lovaza) and niacin (Niaspan) daily as medications.<br /><br />Comment if you want to know how I make my cayenne tincture.  Also, check lobelia if it applies to you.
