THIS IS MY HUSBANDS FAVORITE MARMALADE.  HE'S ENGLISH AND HE LOVES THE SLIGHT BITTERNESS IN THE TASTE, HE FINDS MOST BRANDS TOO SWEET.  BUT HONESTLY THE PRICE OF SHIPPING WILL KEEP US FROM ORDERING AGAIN.  TOO BAD AS IT REALLY IS A FAVE.  WELL, MAYBE COME CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAY.  HE REALLY LOVES THE STUFF!
