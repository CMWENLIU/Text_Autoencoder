Added these prunes to our baby girl's diet to get things "moving" again.  She loved them, and now is as regular as mom and dad!  As far as the BPA? - we researched: amount is negligible and is contained under a non BPA layer.  No contact with the food at all.  Therefore - no BPA in the food whatsoever.
