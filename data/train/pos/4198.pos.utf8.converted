Crunchy is the key word here.<br /><br />I purchased these snack bars because they don't contain the usual bugaboos: high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, artificial sweeteners, etc. However, they're mighty hard to chew. And that's *probably* a good thing.<br /><br />I'm a hardcore fan of Quaker Oats granola bars, because they're a quick snack and they're heavy-laden with sugar, but they also have the HFCS (bad, bad) and hydrogenated oils (bad, bad, BAD). However, they are easy to chew (probably because of the nice, soft plastics they contain). I am striving to slowly back away from the QO granola bars because of their unhealthy and lengthy ingredient list.<br /><br />The Kashi brand snacks are agreeable to the palate and they do have enough sugar for my personal tastes, but I have a couple crowns and I wonder if my over-priced prosthetic teeth can survive this healthy eating experience.<br /><br />That being said, these are the snacks of choice for long car trips. For one, I'll never pig out on them and two, they're good for the tummy. They provide a little energy boost and they're high octane fuel for this four-layer bio-suit we call a human body.<br /><br />I'm working my way through the different flavors. My favorites are the pumpkin spice and peanut butter, yet honestly, I can't discern an enormous difference between these three (pumpkin, PB and honey toasted).
