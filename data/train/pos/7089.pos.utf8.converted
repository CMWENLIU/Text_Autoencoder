I never saw the flowers, but my Mom reported that they were absolutely beautiful. She is 91 years young so I knew she had plenty of vases around her house so why pay for glass vases when she loves flowers. In fact, there were so many flowers that she used two vases. If my Mom loved them, they have to get a 5 star rating!
