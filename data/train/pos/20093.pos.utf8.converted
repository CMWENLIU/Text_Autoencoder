I honestly believed I'd have to use some sort of fancy chocolate to get something that tasted this good for our new Wilton fountain. I didn't have the time to research recipes, etc so just decided to buy the Wilton chocolate and I'm so glad I did. It tasted GREAT! It was so easy to use. You microwave it right in the bag and just pour it in the fountain. The fountain flowed so well all night and had a perfect cascade down all 3 tiers. Buy it for the convenience or the taste...they're both amazing.
