My dog has numerous allergies and have tried several foods, her ears are the biggest problem and she chews her feet and other areas. she is a golden and on  the food 3 weeks so need more time to detox old food and see how her skin does. In the past I know right away if a food works, she goes crazy itching in about 1 week. So far so good!
