Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) tea is the best tea in the world! If you can't get the pure, unlabelled tea leaves, plucked off the cool hills of up country Sri Lanka, this the next best thing. I usually get my tea directly from SL but when I run out I have to fall back on Dilmah...and having moved here from Australia (where the tea is widely available), I'm very happy that Dilmah is finally available in the US.<br /><br />Update - March 18th, 2010<br />I've been drinking Dilmah Premium for a long time now and love it but lately wanted to widen my horizon; With that in mind, I tried the Dilmah Supreme and Dilmah English Breakfast. Dilmah Supreme rated an average on my scale but ah, the English Breakfast! If you wish to have an extra special cup of tea, bold and rich in flavour with subtle nuances, then the English Breakfast is definitely your cup of tea! While more expensive than the Dilmah Premium, it is well worth the price! Enjoy...:)
