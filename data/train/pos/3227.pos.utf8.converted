My cat has two issues, early CRF and IBD.  The IBD caused her to stop eating completely.  Prior to that, she was very picky and wouldn't eat any renal diet(and I tried them all).  I originally passed on Hi Tor because of the by products, but I was bent on getting her to eat a renal diet.  Fortunately, she loved Hi Tor.  She is always crying to be fed now, and eats 2 cans a day, and would eat more if I let her.  Cats are picky, so not every cat will like it, but if you have a CRF cat that isn't eating, it's worth a try.  If your cat won't eat it, donate it to a shelter or a rescue group.  I'm sure they have CRF cats that could use it.<br /><br />Update 2/20/10:  They have changed the formula for the food.  It's more dense, and the cans are 5.5oz rather than 6oz. It looks more like regular cat food and less like chopped bits o' parts. My cat doesn't like this as much, but that may be the fact that she can't lick it up like the previous version.  I have to try adding water to it to see if it helps.
