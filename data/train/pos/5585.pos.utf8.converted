UNFROSTED is just ... BETTER!!<br /><br />I, too, have had trouble finding these here in Arizona ... although the Kelloggs website lists three different Walmarts, I don't believe any of them carry the unfrosted Blueberry ...<br /><br />Maybe I've just outgrown that surgary phase at 56 ... but I really can't stand the frosting on these things...<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for carrying these.
