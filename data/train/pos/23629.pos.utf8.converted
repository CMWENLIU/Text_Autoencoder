This smoked salmon comes in a sealed, metalized pouch. There are two pouches in the pretty cardboard box. Each pouch needs to be refrigerated when opened, but the unopened (second) pouch keeps at room temperature. Each pouch contains nearly a whole fish. It is filleted and boneless, but it still looks like a fish. The skin is on one side. I like the skin and it is totally edible. If you don't want the skin, it is easy to peel off. Thus, you can serve the fish flesh side up, or skin side up, depending on how you want it to appear. The fish is smoked and flakey. It is NOT like some smoked salmon or lox sold in grocery stores -- which comes in thin, bright "salmon colored" slices. This fish is not sliced, but flakes very easily, a bit like a high quality canned tuna. I find it great for sandwiches, but you have to smoosh it down on the bread with a fork or it will be too thick. You can put it in salads or an omelette, but you will have flakey pieces, not solid slices. The fish has a wonderful smokey aroma and taste. It is also fishy in both smell and taste, but a "nice fishy," not the unpleasant fishy smell that most people think of when you tell them something smells "fishy." This is clearly a more natural "fish like" product that the more processed smoked salmon or lox usually sold in deli's. I thought the quality, texture and flavor were outstanding, and I an pretty picky about my fish and seafood. So, I rate if five stars on all counts. But you should understand the product you are getting.
