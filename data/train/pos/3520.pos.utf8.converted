This stuff is so yummy, I'll be buying it again and again. I don't even like pomegranate and I resist the ubiquitous pomegranate juice in stores. But this stuff - is great! I used it as an addition to a sauce (an Iraqi recipe I was trying out) and it is tart and sweet at the same time. I can't resist helping myself to a teaspoonful right from the bottle now and then. Its flavor is so intense, that's all you need....
