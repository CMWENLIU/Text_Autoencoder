When I bought these I was a little hesitant, as they were brand spanking new on the market and there were no reviews.  I decided to try them out, because they were cheaper than the Lansinoh bags I have been using.<br /><br />I love, love, LOVE these bags!  And the fact that they're biodegradable makes me like them even more.  While I do agree with a previous reviewer saying that there wasn't a spot to put the volume size, I just use the place where it says "name" since I know my baby is getting it anyway.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with these bags!  The company itself is amazing too, they will give you free samples of the bags if you ask for them on their Facebook page, and also they do giveaways every Friday-last Friday I won a free 25 pack of storage bags :)
