I enjoy one of these bars per day as a mid-morning snack.  The chocolate satisfies any sweet cravings and the extra fiber makes up for breakfast which often doesn't provide enough.  As the box warns, do not consume in excess to avoid consuming too much fiber.<br /><br />Subscribe and save makes the price very reasonable and convenient.
