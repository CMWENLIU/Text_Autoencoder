Both my husband and I really enjoy the ExtendBars.  They were recommended by my husband's diabetic counselor and they are a great snack at anytime.  The taste and crunchy texture are excellent and he doesn't have to worry about raising his blood sugar.  We have tried the peanut butter chocolate delight and mixed berry delight and have already re-ordered twice.  The only improvement would be to have a box of mixed flavors so we could try them all.
