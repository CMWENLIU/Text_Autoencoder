I work random hours, and often don't have time for real food, or just get the munchies.  In the Emergency Dept, healthy snacks are ironically hard to come by... that taste good.  I adore all the Good Bean products.  They are great alone (and although maybe sacrilege, I love mixing the salt, pepper and chili together).  I was skeptical about the cinnamon, but oh my goodness.  so tasty.
