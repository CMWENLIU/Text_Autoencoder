I bought these on a whim.  I enjoy flax, use it in all my baking from breads to cookies.  I usually laugh when I read reviews about products and folks note how "addicting" the item is.  Ha ha jokes on me!  It is SO true with these.  They are not very sweet at all.  The flavor is very mild and subtle.  My kids like them for one piece.  I on the other hand, devoured the whole bag within a day!  I found myself just eating them for no reason than they tasted great.  They do taste flaxy there is no doubt about it.  I got this flavor thinking the kids would enjoy the sweetness, but I also want to try the BBQ one as well.  I put the other bags on a box and put them in the garage, too much of a good thing is just plain too much!  Will enjoy eating them again and again!  Plus, I confirmed with the manufacturer they have no peanuts in their plants so these as safe for people with peanut allergies!!!
