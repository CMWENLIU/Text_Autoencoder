I was a raw vegan for 2 years. 100% devoted.... and this was such a treat!  Now, I am still "high raw" and thought I would not miss Bob's Red Mill.... yet I do!  I love it in so many different recipes- but most of all I love to mix it with garlic, red peppers, sea salt and a dash of olive oil for a fantastic dip/salad dressing....
