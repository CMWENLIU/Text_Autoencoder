I bought this olive oil because it was the top rated by America's Test Kitchen, and I wasn't disappointed.  It has excellent flavor and color - much better than anything I've been able to find at the local stores.  I use it primarily for dipping bread and for salads, as the flavor is too good to use for cooking - I use my regular supermarket olive oil for that.  Highly recommended.
