This salt is very tasty and a noticable difference in flavor. However, if purchasing the coarse grind make sure that you either also purchase the grinder offered by this seller or use a stainless steel type grinder, as the usual grinders will not be able to do the job. The coarseness of this salt is truly a strong crystal that is not easily broken down otherwise. The fine grind is perfect for the normal table shaker however. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try something other than the usual iodized salt found in the supermarket.
