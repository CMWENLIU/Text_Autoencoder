After moving to the US from England, I searched long and hard to find a decent cup of tea.  The usual US tea is weak compared to tea in England.  Twinings Irish Breakfast Decaf Tea has great flavour.  It's a very satisfying taste and the beauty of decaf tea is that even though it is stronger in taste, you do not feel wired.  I would highly recommend this product.
