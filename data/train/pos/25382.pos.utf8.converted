Everyone, including the vets, comments on my small Munsterlander's gleaming white teeth and clean mouth.  I give Pedigree DentaStix all the credit.  Brushing my dog's teeth didn't sound like something I wanted tackle, but the thought of my dog having dental problems that he couldn't tell me about was out of the question.  So my dog has had DentaStix every single day since he came into our lives (at the age of nine weeks).  My dog thinks they are wonderful treats, and he doesn't have to put up with having his teeth brushed or scaled.  It's a win-win situation.
