YUMMY!!! Arctic Zero is delicious & has great nutritional stats.  Even though I never thought I'd eat the entire pint in 1 sitting, I did, but at least I didn't feel tooooo guilty.  I've tried the Choc & Choc PB.  Now I'm going to order the Vanilla.  Still on the fence about the Strawberry Banana.  Only negative is the price, but if you consider the 6 containers you get for $46, that's a little less than $8/container or pint.  Even if you eat 1/2 pint at a time, that's only $4.  You spend more than that buying an ice cream at your local ice cream shop, plus you're saving a ton of calories.  You can add on fresh fruit, whipped cream, etc. & make your own sundae's for a fraction of the calories.  GREAT STUFF!!!  Love it!!  Also, the containers were still frozen solid when they arrived!
