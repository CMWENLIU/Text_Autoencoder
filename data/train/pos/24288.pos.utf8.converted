Fantastic tomato based sauce has the most versatile sauce for barbecued foods; a tangy sauce with a hint of smokiness and slightly sweet but without the overwhelming sugar and raisin  sweetness of many other commercial sauces.<br /><br />Great for pork and beef ribs by itself, use light coating on barbecued steaks and roasts. For yummy ham glaze; use microwave to dissolve crystalized honey, mix with ground cloves and worcestershire sauce into Open Pit.
