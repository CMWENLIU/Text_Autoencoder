I ordered these cookies and maybe it was due to the heat.I didn't care too much for them and found them dry and crumbly. Well there is always a chance to redeem oneself and the manager caled and offered me a free offer. It just so happened we were having a party and the cookies came just in time. They were all eaten at the party and were a smashing success. Sweet! Fresh! and with a glass of mild divine! I highly recommend these sweets for a treat or just for someone special. Order two boxes and keep one for yourself.<br />Thank you Geoff and Drew's! I have added your website to my favorites!
