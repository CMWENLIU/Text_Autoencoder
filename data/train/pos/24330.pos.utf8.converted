My dog would eat these all day long if he could.  He loves them.  Gets all bouncy and happy when he sees me getting one out for him.  They only last about 6-8 minutes, but I have a large dog who is a healthy chewer.  I feel good giving him this treat because of the ingredients, and because it's made in the USA!  Recommended, though a bit pricey.  I love my dog, so he's worth the cost.
