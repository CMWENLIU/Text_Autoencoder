This is hands down the best dog food out there. I adopted an adult Samoyed that had been tied to a tree for the summer, which resulted in him having heartworm, a damaged coat, flaky skin, and he was extremely underweight. After his heartworm treatment, he came home with me and I started him on Orijen (originally started him on the fish flavor because it was a little easier on his weakened immune system). Literally within DAYS his coat began to shine, he started to gain muscle mass, and his energy level went up SIGNIFICANTLY. After I went through the first bag of the fish flavor I switched to the Regional Red (it smells much better than the fish!) It's been almost 4 months since he came home with me and people stop me on the street to tell me how "healthy" he looks.<br /><br />Because the quality of the food, you won't have to feed your dog as much (my now 55 pound samoyed gets about 1-1.5 cups twice a day depending on if I throw some fresh veggies in his bowl) so it doesn't end up costing as much in the long run. Since there are no fillers, they don't need to eat as much of the food to get the proper nutrition. My dog will gobble it up at first and then sometimes stop when he's almost done eating. My friend's Miniature Pincher does the same thing - it seems to actually make them FULL.<br /><br />I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this product - definitely at least try it if you're considering it. It's well worth the money!
