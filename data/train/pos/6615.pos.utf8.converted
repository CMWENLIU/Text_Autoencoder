Cincinnatians all know the story of Skyine, created by Nicholas Lambrinides, a Greek immigrant.  The recipe is different than the standard chile favored by Americans because it has spices such as cinnamon and cloves.  Of course out of a can, it is not the same as in the restaurant (I still favor the one off Oakley Square when I go back to Cincinnati).  The frozen doesn't ship well so we are left with the canned as our only choice if there is  no franchise nearby.<br /><br />My main problem with the canned chili is it is too watery.  Either cook it down a bit or strain before serving.<br /><br />Here are the typical recipes:<br /><br />Pour chili over a plate of freshly cooked spaghetti.  Add a VERY generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese (mild is favored).  This is a three way.  For a four way, add diced oniions.  Five way?  Red kidney beans.<br /><br />Take a hot dog bun and apply yellow mustard.  Use a good quality beef hot dog.  Pour chili over it, sprinkle some diced onions and add a VERY generous amount of shredded chedda.  This is the cheese coney.<br /><br />Finally my son just likes chili cheese fries, with fries, Skyline and lots of cheddar cheese.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, or those with hardening of the arteries, this is a little taste of cincinnati.
