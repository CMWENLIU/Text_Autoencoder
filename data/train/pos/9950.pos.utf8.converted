I had my original white porcelain coffee pot for over 30 years.  I accidently broke the lid to it this morning.  I have tried the grind and brew coffee makers and other electric type brewing, but I continue to return to my porcelain melitta coffee pot. That's why I'm buying a new one tonight.  Coffee brewed in this porcelain maual coffee maker tastes fresher and richer.  I'm a busy, working woman and it doesn't take anytime to brew.  I highly recommend this porcelain coffee maker.
