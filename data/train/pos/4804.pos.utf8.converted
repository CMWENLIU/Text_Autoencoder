Bought this popcorn salt looking for an alternative to pouring/dripping butter over freshly popped corn...nothing worse than soggy popcorn.  I have always loved the salty/buttery taste of the movie theater popcorn, but couldn't find anything similar until now.  This stuff is really delicious!  The only complaint I have is that the container cap/lid has the double opening, so that you can choose to just pour it on or choose to sprinkle it over the popcorn.  Unfortunately, the sprinkle holes in this cap are huge, so there's no sprinkling the salt around evenly, it just pours out anyways.  To remedy this situation, we've purchased an extra salt shaker and just refill it when needed.  That way, we can get the popcorn salt sprinkled on evenly without overdoing it.
