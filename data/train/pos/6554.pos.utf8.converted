After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle. Schweppes is also FULL of sodium, and Fever-Tree is not. Check this tonic water out: you'll be glad you did!!
