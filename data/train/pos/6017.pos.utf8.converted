I live in New York so I have had the liberty of actually visiting Serendipity--famously known for their desserts, ice cream, and frrroozen hot chocolate. Residents and tourists alike are willing to wait TWO HOURS just to sit-down and get their hands on this. I am NOT a 'dessert' guy nor do I care for a 'frrrozen hot chocolate', but I have to say this is delicious.<br /><br />I purchased two of these gifts and they were received with much delight.<br /><br />==PROS==<br />- consistent and tastes the same as if you were to go in-store<br />- easy to make and followable directions<br />- includes the actual cup they use so you can have a serendipity in the comfort of your house<br /><br />==CONS==<br />- pricey but in the end--it's worth it.
