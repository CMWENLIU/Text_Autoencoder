My small toy puppy loves the small heart shaped bite size.  This food does not have a lot of cheap fillers so her stools don't smell as bad, nor does she poop as often as with the other brands of foods.  She loves the small bite size bananas, raisins and carrots included in the meal.  I feed her one cup twice a day and she's growing fast.  Her coat is shiny and healthy looking too. Normally priced around $14-16 dollars at PETCO, I found it at Big Lots for $5 dollars with a six-month expiration date so the food was still good. I highly recommed it for small puppies.  They also have organic snacks and training treats.  I use them as well to keep her digestive system healthy and organic meal plan consistent.
