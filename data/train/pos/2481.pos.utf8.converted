A few months back, my wife decided to put flaxseed in nearly everything...smoothies, muffins, waffles, bread.  You name it, if you can put some flaxseed in it, she's done it.  I tell you, since the flaxseed revolution, I have been more regular than at any point in my life.  I'm telling you, you can set your clock by my regularity.  In fact, the flaxseed muffins have my drive to work a perilous activity as I have limited time before the flaxseed does its magic. Flaxseed meal is rich in fiber, lignans and omega-3 fats.  You can't go wrong there...try some flaxseed, this stuff is magic.
