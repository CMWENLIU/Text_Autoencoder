This appeared to be the purest coconut cream I could find that was not in a can.  I still do not prefer the "juice box" packaging (there is a ton of controversy over the aluminum used in this type of packaging still leaching into the food) but this is the best I could find.  And I was not disappointed.  I was wanting to make a Coconut Layer cake for my birthday and it was delicious.  Very good product.  Would recommend.  :-)
