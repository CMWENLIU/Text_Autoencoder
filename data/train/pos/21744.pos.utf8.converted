Dare I say that these jellybeans are by far my favorite - yes - even better than Jelly Belly jellybeans.<br /><br />In my opinion, the humble jellybean should possess several qualities: 1) appropriate "pop" of flavor, 2) without being cloying or gummy, and 3) a satisfying, consistent mouthfeel.<br /><br />I am not completely enamored by "novelty" flavors of jellybeans.  I only require an assortment of the ubiquitous flavors: grape, orange, strawberry, lemon and cherry.  The Starburst package also offers green apple (which has become one of my favorites in the bag).<br /><br />Starburst jellybeans are a little smaller that other products on the market (with exception to Jelly Belly products).  The reason I feel that is important is because the food engineers at Starburst were able to achieve an intense flavor in each bite of the jellybean.  There does not seem to be extra gummy/jelly "filler," the sole purpose of which is to add heft/size to the jellybean, but which does not otherwise contribute to the overall experience of the product. Part of that great experience is the mouthfeel of the jellybean.  Because the Starburst product is a bit daintier than most others, the consumer gets to enjoy the initial "crunch" of the outer shell of the jellybean (which is also infused with the jellybean flavor), and then to have that crunchy exterior shell work its way into the soft jellybean nucleus as you masticate through both layers of the candy.<br /><br />So if you're on the market - or on the fence - about this Starburst product - do yourself a favor and enjoy one of life's simple pleasures and invest in a bag (or 6 per this Amazon product) of these great candies.
