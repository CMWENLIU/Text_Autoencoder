I've seen this cereal in Wal-Mart several times but kept passing it up for Kashi's Honey Toasted Oat, a healthier version of Cheerios, but I decide to buy it today based on the great reviews I've read and this cereal is absolutely delicious. I WAS going to buy the pack but it's WAY more cost effective to buy from the grocery store, Wal-Mart in particular. There it's being sold for 2.82 and depending on where I purchase it, county-wise, I only pay 6 or 7 percent tax. So you figure 2.82 * 6 = 16.92 * 7% = 18.10. Sorry Amazon, Wal-Mart though they are terrible in their business practices, they have you beat on this.
