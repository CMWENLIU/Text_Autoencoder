I am an Insulin Dependent Diabetic and carry the honey sticks in my purse and car. I do tend to get low blood sugar and need some  immediate fast acting glucose to prevent Hypoglycemia. I just bite the tip of the end of a honey stick, squeeze the stick and I have instant glucose. I used to buy glucose in tubes .....at $4.00 a tube which became too expensive. The Honey Sticks are a great substitute at a reasonable price.
