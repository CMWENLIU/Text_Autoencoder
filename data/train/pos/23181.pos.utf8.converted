My parents were never very religious, but they still celebrated Easter Sunday.  By celebrated I mean they gave us each a basket of candy in the morning and then we'd go out to eat for dinner.  Jesus, God, and the crucifixion were never discussed.<br /><br />They used to give us a variety of different chocolate Easter related products, like Cadbury Eggs, chocolate bunnies, and Peeps.  On the eve before Easter 1990 my parents gave me a box of 48 full sized Snickers bars.  It was purchased at Price Club (which became Costco) and was the same box supplied to convenience stores.<br /><br />After dinner I opened my box and had a bar each before I began playing what would become a marathon videogame session of Rambo for the Sega Master System.  My father sat down and watched me play.<br /><br />"Did you open your Easter box?"<br /><br />"Yeah, but I only had one."<br /><br />"Just one?"<br /><br />"It's not like I could eat them all tonight."<br /><br />He considered me for a minute and then said, "You know what, I bet you could eat them all tonight."<br /><br />After hemming and hawing with him for a couple of minutes he finally began to taunt us.  "What are you, a wimp?  Go ahead and start eating, do it!"<br /><br />My manhood was then challenged and he was getting angry.  I knew better than to poke the bear.<br /><br />The first 10 bars went down pretty well.  Since I knew I was in for the long haul I began pounding the candy bars with Diet Pepsi (hey, why waste calories?)  The combination of the massive amounts of sugar and caffeine made me loopy.  I paused my game and laid down for a bit.  My father yelled at me to keep going.<br /><br />The next couple of bars weren't so easy.  This challenge would be won by pacing.  I decide to eat no more than 5 or 6 Snickers bars an hour.  I must have polished off an entire case of the soda as well.  At midnight my father went to bed, but before he left he told me that I had better finish that box.  "Make the family proud!"<br /><br />I ate the last bar around 5:00 am.  My brother celebrated the victory with me and then we started waiting for my parents to get up.<br />The wait was broken almost two hours later.  Ever since the first couple of bars I had felt gross, but now I felt deathly ill.  At around 7:00 my stomach lurched and the urge to purge hit me like a truck.  I ran to the bathroom and lost all control.  I shot nougat, chocolate and peanuts everywhere.  I filled the sink and the toilet.  I was so loud that I woke up my parents.<br /><br />For a second I had imagined a triumphant victory where my father exclaimed that he was proud of me.  That image evaporated when he yelled, "You ate all of those things?  What are you an idiot?"<br /><br />Over the next couple of hours I evacuated half digested (and fully digested) Snickers bars from both ends.  If you melt a Snickers bar in the microwave you can get the same image as I saw...once again, from both ends.  After the first bout of vomiting my nose was bleeding from the small jagged peanuts that had flown out of it at 30 mph.  Luckily the nougat kept most of the blood from spraying all over the place.  It felt like I had wet cotton balls shoved up my nose and a serious case of stomach flu.  It seemed like I had an endless supply of material to spew forth, and after 48 bars I guess I did.  No one seemed to care that I was heaving all day - even my brother lost interest after an hour or two.<br /><br />By late afternoon everyone else was ready for dinner.  We all piled into the car and drove to a Chinese restaurant.  We had to pull over twice for me to chuck, once I didn't open the door fast enough.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I remember placing the order for egg drop soup.  The next hour was spent in the bathroom.  By the time we got home though, I did manage to eat and keep down the soup.  It didn't taste very good and it was cold, but it stayed where it was supposed to.<br /><br />It was at least five years before I ate any chocolate at all - the smell made me gag, and almost 13 years before I risked eating a Snickers bar again.  I remember eating the thing and then waiting, but luckily nothing happened.  I no longer like the taste of Pepsi - that night converted me to Coke.<br /><br />So, yeah.  Buy the box.  Just don't eat them all in one sitting.
