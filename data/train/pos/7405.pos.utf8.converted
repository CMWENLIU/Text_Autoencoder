Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack is delicious and a great way to take the edge off of hunger!  This snack is delicately toasted in sesame oil, and come in little wafer thin "slices" of seaweed. The package is definitely something you could take on the go. I am not sure as to how long they keep - not that they will last that long. A great alternative to potato chips and more fattening foods!
