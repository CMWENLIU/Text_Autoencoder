This is my third purchase of the case of 12 and the flavors are cherry, grape, green apple, pineapple, and orange. In other words, there are no watermelon and raspberry. You can tell by looking at the package what the five flavors are. Just thought I'd mention that since the contents listed in the "Product Features" is inaccurate :. The sour apple and the pineapple taste the best. The grape has a chemical taste and the cherry tastes exactly like the Cherry Sucrets throat lozenges.<br />Oh, the ingredients are: Isomalt , Citric Acid , Natural and Artificial Flavors , Sucralose , Colors , (Red 40 , Yellow 5 , Blue 1) , Soy Lecithin and there are 30 Calories for 4 candies with 13.0g sugar alcohol.
