What the heck is up with popcorn salt... stores don't carry it anymore.  You can't find it on line.  All they have is that crappy flavored stuff...  People!!  There's a conspiracy afloat.  I'm stocking up so I don't have to worry about it anymore.  Hope this stuff is good.. of course how can you screw up sodium chloride?  All it has to be is ground fine so it stays on the corn.
