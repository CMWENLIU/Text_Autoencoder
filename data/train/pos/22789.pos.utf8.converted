I can't eat wheat, and it's hard to find cookies and baked goods that don't taste like cardboard, or worse. These chocolate chunk cookies are so good, even my kids beg for them. There are lots of large, chocolate chunks, and just enough cookie to hold them together. They're gluten free, so whether you have a wheat allergy or a gluten sensitivity, these work. I've tried every brand of wheat-free cookie, and these are by far the best.
