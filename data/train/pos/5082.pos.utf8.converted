This coffee is one of my favorites especially when the bag is freshly opened; however, it takes a while to go through two pounds of coffee. It looses some of the flavor over time, but regardless it remains pretty darn good. I just wish I could find a way to keep it really fresh. I have tried freezing it in an airtight zip-lock bag, refrigerating in an airtight zip-lock bag, and storing at room temp in an ceramic airtight jar. Regardless, this coffee is a amazing (especially when brewed with a french press), and I highly recommend it.
