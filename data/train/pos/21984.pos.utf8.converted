As a Thai-American growing up with a Thai mother, I ate Masaman frequently, and usually saw my Mom with this brand.  It is absolutely delicious.<br /><br />When I have friends who tell me they don't like curry, I make them try this.  It is sweet (being made with coconut milk and cinnamon) and savory (having potatoes and peanuts), only mildly spicy.  Since it is made with coconut milk, it is also naturally dairy free!<br /><br />It is also highly adaptable - the recipe calls for potatoes, onions and chicken, but you could also use beef, shrimp, pork, or throw in some carrots, whatever you want!
