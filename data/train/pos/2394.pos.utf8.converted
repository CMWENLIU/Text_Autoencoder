I am a research fiend.<br />When we bought our cat the vet recommended Science Diet, which, compared to the Orijen nutrition/ingredient lists, is a far cry from a quality cat food. I have found nothing else out there that comes anywhere close to Orijen. It's made where I live (Alberta, Canada), and almost all of the ingredients are sourced locally, which makes me feel confident as to the quality and production standards.<br />All I can say is check out the website, and read the newspaper articles about the company that are available on the web, and you will know that this is the best food available.<br /><br />Also, my cat loves it.
