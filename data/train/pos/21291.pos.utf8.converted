I had read about these bars in various low carb blogs. Yesterday, I came across some at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try. I purchased the milk chocolate bar. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a bite of heaven. They are mildly sweet and have a creamy texture, as evidenced by the fat content. However, what pleases me the most is that they are sweetened without sugar or the use of malitol. I need to eat low carb due to medical reasons and I stray away from sugar alcohols due to gastric reasons!
