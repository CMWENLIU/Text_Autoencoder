This is a real review from a real person. I was not compensated in any way for making this review, though I wouldn't mind receiving a few boxes of these crackers from TH Foods because I'm always running low!<br /><br />I bought these CrunchMaster crackers randomly one day when they were on sale, and I must say WOW, they are extremely tasty!<br /><br />I've gone back and purchased another box already as I am snacking on them all the time. Just the right balance of saltiness, very crunchy of course, and just overall good taste. Fantastic with medium to strong cheeses. I love how this good taste is found in something that is whole grain and baked.<br /><br />The only downsides I can find is that they are so easy to snack on, I keep having to go back and purchase more. They are becoming a permanent fixture on my grocery list.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
