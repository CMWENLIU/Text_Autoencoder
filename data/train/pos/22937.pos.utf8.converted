I recently read in one of Alice Medrich's books that the best crystallized ginger comes from Down Under, and in that book she recommended Royal Pacific as one of the best brands. Since the publication of that book (1994), Royal Pacific is now known as The Ginger People. (The VERY BEST Australian ginger is produced by Buderim, Queensland, but unfortunately only 3 of their many products are available for sale in the USA.)<br /><br />Prior to trying the Baker's Cut, I had been to Penzey's and tried a small jar of their Australian Ginger (sold under their own brand so I have no idea who supplies it). There is a definite difference between the Penzey's ginger and the Ginger People's Baker's Cut; the Penzeys is noticeably sweeter, and the Baker's Cut has more heat. The ingredients on the Penzeys product is shown as "Cane sugar, ginger", whereas on the Baker's Cut is "Baby ginger, cane sugar". Since ingredient labels must begin with the highest-proportion ingredient and 'work downward', this isn't surprising.<br /><br />I use the Baker's Cut for cooking and will be finishing up the Penzey's by nibbling. ;-)  Not because the Penzeys is "better", but because the Ginger People's product has a flavor that will hold up much better when combined with other ingredients.
