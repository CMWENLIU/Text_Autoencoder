If you are going to eat this pasta naked you will see, feel and taste a difference from wheat pasta.  But who does that anyway?  It's the sauce that makes the pasta, and this brand of rice pasta is terrific.  Unable to eat wheat, I brought this pasta with me on a visit to my sister's house, and her husband Paulie "the Goombah" refused to eat it.  At least, he thought he did.  He ate it, just didn't know it.  But here is one warning about this product:  if you are going to have it in a macaroni salad or similar, you should plan for hardly any leftovers.  It does not keep well in the fridge, becoming hardish and crunchy-ish and unappetizing.  I don't think it is the cold that makes it that way, because I store leftovers with marinara in the cold and it does not react the same way.  Maybe it is the salt in the salad dressing, or some other ingredient that reacts badly with the pasta.  But other than that this is a Godsend to folks who can't have regular pasta.
