I am from New Zealand living in the USA and have been getting this sent over as I have not found any other black tea that is this tasty.  It is nicely balanced and perfect black or with some milk.  Love it!!!!  So happy I can finally purchase it from within the USA and not spend so much money having it sent over from New Zealand.
