We love these oats just as much as the whole grain, rolled version! This quick cooking oat works wonderfully in cookies. The quality is so fresh, much better than the oats I used to purchase before my Celiac diagnosis twelve years ago! These oats appear to me like they just came out of the field a week before they arrived on my doorstep!<br /><br />Thank you Bob's Red Mill for taking the drastic steps needed to create a gluten free oat! I understand how you have to create an entire seperate part of the mill, with machinery dedicated to the oat only, have a clean field to grow in and clean transport as well! Your perseverance has allowed my two celiac children and I are happily eating oatmeal cookies again!
