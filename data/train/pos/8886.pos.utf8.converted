What a tasty and different treat this salt is!  I have been using it for about a year now and it is the only salt I use for grilling and cooking.  This salt is much stronger than normal salt so you have to take care at first not to overdo things.<br /><br />When used in grilling, I use it as part of my rubs.  The course grains slowly dissolve as the meat or vegetables are cooking, giving the dish a dice even salt spread.  It works so much better.  I use to use only Kosher salt for these rubs but have more or less replaced  the Kosher with this product.<br /><br />I do not serve it on the table as it will indeed muck up a salt grinder.  The few times I have used it, I have ground it up in a ceramic mortar bowel and severe it in small salt cellars.<br /><br />This is a good product and I am glad I started using the stuff.  As far as I can tell, this is a pretty good price it is being offered at here.
