I research everything I buy!  One thing I wanted was to make homemade babyfood.  I spent weeks watching videos online and reading all I could.  I made a list of everything I would need and marked videos to remember how to make each food.  Then I found the Baby Brezza!  I heard about the Babycook and thought about buying that one.  However, the Baby Brezza has one button that not only steams the food, but then purees it automatically after it steams (Babycook does not)!  As I write this review the steamer just stopped and started to puree..I am in the living room playing with  my baby as the babyfood makes itself in the kitchen!  All I had to do was buy the veggies and fruits (I bought organic) and then peeled, followed the steamer time in the recipe book it came with and that's it!  This is a busy working moms dream!  I just poured the puree into ice cube trays to freeze and I can't wait to feed them to my little one.  I would HIGHLY recommend this product if you are at a loss of where to start and want something super easy.  I bought organic carrots in a jar last week for 79 cents for 2.5 ounces.  I did the math tonight and I was able to make organice sweet potatos for 14 cents for 2.5 ounces!  Carrots would have probably been even cheaper!  I know using kitchen gadgets I already owned would make it even cheaper, but since I bought it for convience and not for the cost, saving money is a bonus and it will pretty much pay for itself!  And it was $50 cheaper than the Baby Cook.  So happy!  And my little one loves the baby food I have made so far!
