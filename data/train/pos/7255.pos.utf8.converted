Not only does this soda taste great, but it is sweetened NATURALLY.  High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is in practically everything these days, and it is one of the worse things we can consume.<br /><br />I discovered recently that being AmerAsian I am an easier target for Type 2 Diabetes and HFCS is a huge contributor towards that condition because it is an extremely refined sweetner.  Therefore, I've done my best to stop buying products containing HFCS.  When it comes to fruit juices, this is pretty easy.  However, I have been a Coke consumer for many years.  Boylan's CaneCola is the only cola I've tasted that actually tastes like a soda, but doesn't contain HFCS.  I have tried one other brand called Cricket.  While that is good, you can tell it is made with tea.  Boyan is better!  And I think it is even better than Coke!
