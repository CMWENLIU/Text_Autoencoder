We had been feeding our pup another premium brand of large breed puppy chow. Though early on when we first got him he would eat without a problem at times he would leave some and maybe eat it later. He finally reached a point where he became very picky, and to get him to eat we had to mix canned food with the dry. He was having some tummy problems and our vet suggested the Royal Canin. We figured we would give it a shot, none of our local pet stores carry the puppy chow so we ordered from Amazon. It arrived and we gradually switched him over, you could tell right from the start he liked it ALOT. Once we had him fully switched over to the Royal Canin there were no more tummy problems (nice solid stools) and he absolutely LOVES this dogfood! It has been a month now and when feeding time rolls around he starts getting excited, and is very enthusiastic about the meal, once he starts eating he doesn't stop and it's gone in no time! He looks good, has lots of energy. Oh, and no more smelly canned food to deal with :).
