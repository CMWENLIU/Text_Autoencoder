:: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia. The form I most often use is the shaker jar, the blend with FOS, from this same reliable company (Wisdom Naturals).<br /><br />But I also buy their product in tablets for the convenience. I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product. I really believe AMZN's price here cannot be beat -- particularly if you're calculating in the current promo of 20% off and free shipping.
