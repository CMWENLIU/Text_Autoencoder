I love my tea, and my favorite is Yorkshire Gold tea.  It has a rich, full-bodied flavor that is not diminished by adding a little milk and sugar!  The color, after adding milk, is a beautiful, golden tan.  Each bag will make 2-3 good, large cups of tea, depending upon how strong you prefer your tea; therefore, the cost is comparable to "lesser" teas.  It is also my wife's favorite, and we have tried many different brands over the years.
