Over the last six years that I've had my Kureig brewer I've seen the price of K-cups steadily rise along with it's popularity.  Finally someone has come up with an alternative that is just as easy to use, tastes great and is substantially cheaper.  THANK YOU San Francisco Bay Coffee for marketing this product.  I got the breakfast blend which is actually stronger than the Green Mountain version I normally buy.  I compensated by increasing the size of the cup from the regular mug to the travel mug size.  Now I'm actually getting a larger cup of coffee for less money.  Yippee!
