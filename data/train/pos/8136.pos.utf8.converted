This is my absolute favorite yeast.  Someone (and for the life of me, I can't remember if it was Alton Brown or America's Test Kitchen) measured the packet yeasts and found them to be wildly inconsistent - significantly over or under the stated amount.  Maybe that explains some of my past issues with raised breads, but since I started using the SAF yeast, it's been absolutely perfect.  Great in a bread machine, no proofing required, and I always get a consistent rise.  I've used the bulk Red Star Active Rise as well and didn't like it at all - I just didn't feel it was as consistent.  The SAF never makes me wonder if it's getting old or losing it's potency - it just works.<br /><br />I tend to bake in phases, so I also appreciate the shelf (or in my case, freezer) life.  I usually keep a small container in the refrigerator and the rest bagged up in the deep freeze.  I even found some at the back of the freezer that was about three years old and it still worked perfectly.  I have *never* had this stuff fail on me.<br /><br />Since I'm not that serious of a baker, I can't compare Instant Yeast to Cake Yeast or other exotics, but for the bread machine and everyday bakers, this is the best I've found.
