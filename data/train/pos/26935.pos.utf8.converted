We bought these mostly for house centipedes after moving into a home in the suburbs. Some reviewers have complained about ineffectiveness on roaches - I can't comment on how effective they are on them since we don't seem to have roaches.<br /><br />For us, they have caught many centipedes, millipedes, ants, silverfish, spiders and beetles. They're easy to put out and seem effective for around 2 months, at which point we replace them since they can be fairly full in "high traffic" areas like the garage or basement.
