This is my favorite bouillon, and I am surprised at its strength!<br /><br />I was having troubles digesting Rapunzel bouillon cubes, which used to be my favorite... better than bouillon was great, but didn't have the rounded flavor....<br /><br />This Marigold stuff is definitely the best, and has a very nice background of herbs and spices that makes it truly delicious.  I found reference to it in the Plenty cookbook.  Reading the label, I am surprised that they include nutmeg and lovage.. it really is a nice blend for all my vegan soups, even my Thai basil coconut soup.<br /><br />The only think you should know if you are worried about salt is that it has 459 mg per serving (4.5g), and it does pack a punch.  Flavor-wise, you really get a nice kick with this stuff, so you don't need to much, but it is savory and salty, so just be aware.
