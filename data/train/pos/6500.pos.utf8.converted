I have a bread maker, but I only used it to proof the bread.  I baked the loaf in a hot oven (425) after I had turned the dough out on foil covering a cookie sheet.  The crust was outstanding.  The bread was gone in under 3 hours.  I guess that makes it a dangerous product- since it's so good you might eat more bread than you meant to.  I'll be serving this to my guests next time we have friends over for dinner.  The herbs taste really fresh for a box mixed- and of course it's so easy.  All you have to do is add water.
