I've been buying espresso pods for a long time through various sellers and at Starbucks (although they rarely have any in stock). It's nice to find so many different pods available from one seller, much less in one package. I'm looking forward to trying them all. Unlike another reviewer here, I consider the price to be more than fair considering what it'd cost you otherwise to try all these coffees. The shipping was very fast too.
