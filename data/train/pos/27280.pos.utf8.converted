My dog is on a totally raw diet, which clearly presents challenges during travel.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Florida I took along a few bags of Stella and Chewy's steaks in lamb, beef and duck flavors.<br /><br />While you can feed the food dry, I opted to add a little water and rehydrate them.  While my dog had never eaten S&C food, he immediately took a liking to it, finished everything on his plate, and asked for more.<br /><br />IMO the real measure of how good a food is lies in what comes *out* of the dog, and this food totally agreed with his digestive system.  His stools were just as perfect eating S&C steaks as they were eating raw food.<br /><br />I will definitely keep Stella and Chewy's steaks on hand for those times when feeding raw food is impractical or impossible.<br /><br />If you're looking for an easy, practical and healthy solution for traveling/camping with your dog, Stella and Chewy's is it!
