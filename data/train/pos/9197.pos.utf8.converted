I just bought a case of these as well as a case of Crown Prince's cheap line of Sardines (known as Ocean Prince).  The difference in quality is quite clear.  These sardines have excellent taste, texture and aroma.  The pure olive oil really makes a difference in the taste, and the sardines are thick and tender.  The can is also easy to open.  For the same amount of money, you can buy 12 of these or 24 of the Ocean Prince Sardines.  Well, you get what you pay for, and it shows here.  This is the first brand of Sardines didnt give me gas/bloated stomach after I ate it.  Go for with the premium line...you pay more, but its well worth it.
