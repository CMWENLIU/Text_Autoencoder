I'm really glad I bought the Ateco 12-Color Food Coloring Kit.  I found it searching for Black food coloring for my Halloween cookies.  I just finished my Christmas cookies which turned out amazingly thanks to this food coloring kit.<p>Each color is very bright and solid.  The pastes mix very well with frosting (I have not used them for anything else yet).  These are the nicest/brightest Christmas sugar cookies I have ever made.<p>You don't need to use a lot of coloring, just a drop or two, to get the perfect shade.  As such, each bottle will last a long time.
