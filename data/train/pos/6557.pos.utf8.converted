This actually enhances the taste of a Gin & Tonic. Hey, if you're using a top shelf Gin, why degrade it with the standard supermarket tonic water? Nice and smooth taste, not bitter at all. The 6.8oz size is perfect for one mixed drink. I'm always throwing out partially used 1 liter bottles of tonic water sitting in the fridge, so there's no waste with this size bottle. The free Amazon shipping made this purchase worth it.
