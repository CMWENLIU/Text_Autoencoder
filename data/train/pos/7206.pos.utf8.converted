In the past, I have avoided brown rice, although I knew it was much better than white rice from a healthy eating standpoint, because I just couldn't get into the taste and texture.  While this blend does not have a significantly different texture, the taste and aroma are wonderful.  Rice is a large part of the Southern diet and this blend takes dishes to a new level.  Following the cooking directions will yield a perfect product, not gummy,  but very satisfying, especially for a meatless diet or entree.
