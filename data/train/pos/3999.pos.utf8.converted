I was  so excited  to try  these in spite of all the negative reviews that tried to scare me away -  maybe some folks were confused  by the title  however  please note **these are not K Cups -  they  are One cup  made to  work  with  our  beloved Keurig K-Cup Brewers.<br />Thank  goodness -  for any of you  who have  had to deal with  that  puff of  air sending  the K Cups  coffee  grounds up inside the  Kuerig needle  which after  only one use can  clog  the needle. I thought I was  going crazy going through the process of returning  my Kuerig  which was still full of water back to either  Amazon or in my case Costco - because I  thought it was just a lemon -  yeah,  did that 4 times -<br />The beauty of these little One Cup filters is that  they are  not vacuum sealed -<br />I  keep mine in a  large  glass, clamp lidded jar.....The freshness  is  a divine improvement -  and  less waste  in the landfill ...every little bit helps... So far, no bitter taste and I am loving  these...
