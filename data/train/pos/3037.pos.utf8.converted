Although, I understand that the Goreng part of the name means noodles without broth, I'll never stop calling this ramen (meaning noodles with broth). The Indomie products that I've tried (original, satay, and pedas) are all delicious. Make no mistake, not all oriental noodles do it for me. When our local Asian market ran out of Indomie, the owner told me to get a different brand that he promised I'd like better. I ended up throwing it out, because the taste was just awful. Indomie (original) however, has a mellow taste, with enough spice to keep you interested.<br /><br />This how noodles are done. Classic.
