I received an assorted gift pack of Stacy's chips, simply because my name was "Stacy".  Little did I know this was the start of an addiction.  The other chips were great - but these cinnamon sugar pita chips are absolutely out of this world!  I am now on the hunt for how to get some more - but Amazon is out of the large 12 count package.  AMAZON - GET SOME MORE IN STOCK!  I need my fix!!!
