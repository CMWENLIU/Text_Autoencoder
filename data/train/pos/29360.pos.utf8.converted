These are hands down the best chocolates I've ever tried. I live in New York, I've had every possible type of chocolate here, and in Paris I indulged in many kinds... but this is unbelievable. Godiva is far too pedestrian to even compare to these. Eat them SLOWLY and let one melt in your mouth. You'll be in heaven.
