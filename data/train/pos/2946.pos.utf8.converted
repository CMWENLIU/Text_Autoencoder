I wanted organic dry milk and was unable to purchase it locally. I had to adjust to using it, but love it now.  Less of the product is required for the same amount of milk than in the regular dry milk product to which I am accustomed. I have also discovered that it is best to put the dry milk at the bottom of my cup, rather than stir it into hot liquid.  I also mix unsweetened dark chocolate powder with the dry milk before pouring in hot liquid (coffee).  Pouring the dry milk into hot liquid makes it clog together.  Before I realized that it would mix well if I scooped the milk in first, I ordered a little smoothie mixer and that is the best way to go, but it really is not needed as long as one remembers to put the milk in first, then stir in the hot liquid. This makes an inexpensive, low calorie mocha-type drink that is often better than the real thing.
