I have a couple finicky eaters with my cats.  I have tried numerous brands and varieties of food for them.  This is one where I know that they will eat every one of the flavors in the box.  I like the convenience  of the tear open packets so I don't have to wrestle with can openers and spoons in the morning.  I actually order mine off the subscribe and save program and it comes to my door every month so I don't have to go out and buy it.  For me the cost is just about the same if I went to the store to buy it directly, but the time saver of having it delivered makes it a better value for me.
