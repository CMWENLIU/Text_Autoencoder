Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body.
