This escargot is the perfect addition to any meal featuring Burgundy Wine.  To this date, I have prepared several dishes featuring this particular brand of escargot consisting of:<br /> Patrician Escargot-mushrooms stuffed with Escargot<br /> Parley Pesto Escargot<br /> Escargot with wild rice<br /> Snail Butter to top various seafood dishes with (extremely delicious topped on scallops)<br />With Escargot consisting of primarily protein and about 10 calories per snail, (until you add butter) it remains a very fulfilling and easily prepared meal.  The average cleanup for the cooking endeavor remains at roughly one pot, a spoon, and a food processor in cases such as snail butter or parsley pesto sauce.
