I'm so happy to see this sauce here on Amazon! I'll be buying more from here as soon as my current bottle runs out. This is Unagi Kabayaki sauce just like they use in sushi restaurants to put over unagi and spider rolls - the exact same flavor and consistency. You could say it's similar to a teriyaki sauce, but not really. This is less sweet, stronger flavor, thinner texture, and really its own thing. Delicious!<br /><br />I love using this over broiled salmon and catfish as well, and I highly recommend it for seafood lovers and anyone seeking that sushi-bar amazing flavor at home!
