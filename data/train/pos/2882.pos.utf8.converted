I have always fed my Siberian Husky high-end, grain-free premium kibble.  I'd prefer to feed raw, but at the moment it is a little too much work and costly.  In the past I've fed Evo, Orijen, Wellness Core, and Blue Buffalo Wilderness.  Rising prices caused me to look elsewhere.<br /><br />My dog loves this food just as much as any of the others, and has transitioned seamlessly.  No runny poops, his coat is as soft and shiny as ever, and he is one happy pup when mealtimes come around.  It has been given top ratings by all of the dog food review/analysis sites that I've seen.  And quite simply, this food is by far the most cost-efficient of the grain-free foods. One bag of this at &lt;$50 lasts for over 7 weeks (your mileage may vary), whereas a $60+ bag of the "other guys'" food might get me 6 weeks.  And if you're coming from lower-quality kibble, remember that your dog will actually require *less* food on the premium kibble, due to the lack of fillers which serve no purpose other than to not be digestible and take up space...<br /><br />I see no reason to feed something other than Taste of the Wild, given its quality, and the fact that my dog has remained in excellent health since switching over.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
