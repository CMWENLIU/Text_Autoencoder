My adult daughter ( who has long been out on her own, raising her own family) recently stayed with me for a week. Several times, she asked what made my food taste so good and because of "Mom pride" I attributed it to her just eating Mom's cooking again. But then I remembered that I never was a very good cook and my kids all turned out to be far better cooks than I. After much discussion about "taste" we narrowed it down to the Himalayan salt that I use. We went immediately to the computer and I ordered a box of the Himalayan salt to be sent to her house.  Now, she's back at her home and she told me how much better her food tastes since she's been using the salt.<br /><br />I've been using the salt for quite a few years and I've never noticed a salty after taste in my mouth, especially in the morning. But when ever I have to eat in a restaurant (or someone else's cooking) I do notice a salty taste in my mouth in the morning. I'm not saying this salt changes my life drastically but it does add enhancement to the taste of food.
