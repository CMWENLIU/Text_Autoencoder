The two people who gave negative reviews must be owners of competing brands of xylitol. I've been to the Emerald Forest plant in Broomfield, Colorado. Its a very clean, well run place. The owner is a genuine, warm and friendly man, Doug Stauffer. A photo of him sitting on a tiger with a pony tail reminds me of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.<br /><br />The employees care about their product and are excited to show a visitor around. I started using his gum a couple of years ago and haven't had a cavity since! My dentist asked me what I was doing differently (as I used to have cavities all the time) and I said, Chewing Emerald Forest gum!<br /><br />Doug personally inspects the factories where he buys product from and knows that all are quality places that treat their people well.<br /><br />Highly Recommend Emerald Forest!
