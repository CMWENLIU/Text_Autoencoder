Which is for the potassium, itself. I've never used it as a salt substitute, however, although judging by the taste, you probably won't be thrilled with it unless you have a strict sodium-intake dietary restriction.<br />This stuff is just incredible in the amount of potassium it packs in such a small amount. 1/6 teaspoon will give you a whopping 530mg of potassium. Because, by law, in the US, supplements are limited to 99mg per tablet, I didn't feel like spending all that money for pills and downing a bunch of them throughout the day (3500mg being the RDA, for potassium). I have current restriction on my food intake that make it impossible to receive the RDA of Potassium the natural way, so I needed to find a different way to get it in my system. The supplements you would otherwise have to purchase (unless you had a prescription for a higher grade from your doctor) are capped at that amount (99mg) for specific reasons that you should check out on the wikipedia entry for "potassium", if you want to be sure you'll be OK.  I only take the 1/6 teaspoon at a time-4 x's a day-just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't recommend taking the whole daily allowance at one time. You'll be asking for trouble that way.  I have serious cramps in both legs at times, and while I'm unable to prevent them while I'm sleeping, as soon as I feel the crap coming on, I rush to the NuSalt, place a bit under my tongue to get it in my system immediately and then dilute the rest in water and drink it. Cramp and soreness gone. Same goes with cramps after running. The Potassium works almost instantly. An inexpensive way to supplement with potassium for those who require it. Great product. Highly recommended.
