I spent a great deal of time researching premium dog foods on the internet and at my local Natural Pet Foods store when I finally came to realize what a subpar product that Science Diet has been producing and calling themsleves a "premium" product.  Once I learned what constitutes a quality kibble, i.e. meat and meat based products, no corn fillers, chelated minerals, all natural products - I could go on and on.  Based on the quality of ingredients, the high ratings given by a number of respected dog food reviews and forums, and its price point, I decided to give Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul a try.  I did a slow changeover with my 7 year old chocolate lab in order to use up the balance of the old food.  After now several months on the new Chicken Soup food, I feel comfortable in stating that this is probably the best dog food kibble you can buy for the money.  My lab loves it - her poops are firm and effortless - her coat has a sheen and luster that we never saw with the Science Diet - her minor dandruff problem has disappeared - she doesn't scratch or itch at all - and she looks forward to her mealtimes.  Yes, there are higher quality kibbles available, but at his price point and with this list of quality ingredients, you can feel comfortable that you are feeding your dog a premium quality dog food without breaking your budget.  Highly recommended!
