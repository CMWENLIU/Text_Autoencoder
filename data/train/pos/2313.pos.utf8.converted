EZ-Sweetz is a life saver.  I use it in EVERYTHING -- never touch Splenda anymore.  Perfect for fasting days to sweeten my black coffee without any calories from the fillers in Splenda.  Perfect for a keto diet (a pint of heavy cream, a tsp of bourbon vanilla, and 16 drops of EZ-Sweetz in a WhipIt, and amaze your friends by squirting endless sugar free whipped cream in your mouth and screaming I'M DIETING!  It's delightfully annoying).
