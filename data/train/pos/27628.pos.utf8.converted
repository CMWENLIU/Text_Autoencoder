Bought these for a friend and he enjoyed them so much he had to eat a second can. I have not tried them personally but he sure did thank me. Maybe a nostalgia thing? (He's 31)<br />I didn't grow up on Chef Boyardee myself so I'm not a "connoisseur". Mom never let us have it. I never knew why. I always thought maybe it was too expensive and was more of a rich person food. LMAO I'm older now and know better. Still I always felt left out because all my friends would eat the Chefs creations every now and then yet I never did. awwww lol
