I used to grind Crema e Gusto beans in a grinder and use it in a $700 Gaggia semi-automatic espresso machine.  After losing the best espresso machine ever made (for $700) to a divorce, I've invested in a $20 stovetop Bialetti and use pre-ground Crema e Gusto.  In both machines the coffee is excellent.  Full-bodied, smooth, never bitter (unless you leave the Bialetti on the stove for too long and come back to a melted handle and rubber gasket).  Excellent coffee.
