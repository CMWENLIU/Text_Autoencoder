This is the freshest and most flavorful powdered ginger I've ever purchased. My husband puts it in a beverage that he drinks for medicinal purposes, and he's very happy with it. It's a fraction of the price that you encounter at the supermarket for the volume, and worth the extra effort. One bag goes directly into the freezer, and the other into a jar in the fridge. Sure beats buying those little jars in the spice aisle.
