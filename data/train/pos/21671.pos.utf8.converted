I've never been fond of sodas with just corn syrup and artificial flavors.  While, the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers aren't that much healthier, they do taste incredibly delicious.  I've tried many other similar products like izze's sparkling juices, but they can't compete.<br /><br />Most of the R.W. Knudsen spritzers use apple juice or white grape juice along with sparkling water as the main ingredients.  Still the strawberry does have strawberry (and pineapple) juice in it, and the flavor is undeniably strawberry-esque.  They are pretty sweet, but not sickeningly sweet.  Most sodas are probably a little sweeter than these spritzers.<br /><br />I would recommend this strawberry spritzer as my favorite flavor.  I also really like their peach spritzer.  The only one I've disliked has been the Lemon and Lime.
