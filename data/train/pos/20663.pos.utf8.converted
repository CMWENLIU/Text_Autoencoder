I have tried many Indian curry recipes in hopes of finding one that would taste as good as when I eat at an Indian restaurant, but they have all fallen short.  On a whim I tried this Butter Chicken Curry (I usually stay away from packaged foods)and couldn't believe how amazing it tasted--the perfect spiciness with fantastic flavor.  Also, there are no preservatives or crazy chemicals added to this product.  I am so excited to find such a great tasting curry; I can now have great Indian food that is so easy and quick.  I can't wait to try all of the different 'Kitchens of India' flavors!
