Finally Starbucks comes out with K-cups!! I have been waiting for Starbucks K-cups over the past 5 years. I love strong & bold coffee. The monopoly of coffee from Green Mountain largely can't deliver that bold taste. But I just brewed my first Starbucks French Roast K-cups. First, the aroma from the brew instantly reminded of Starbucks. Then the first sip. WOW!!! I couldn't believe how good this coffee is. I couldn't believe that my machine just made it. I can honestly say this was the BEST cup of coffee from my machine over the past 5 years. It is as good, if not better, than what you get when you visit Starbucks. If you are a Starbuck fan that enjoy dark, rich, bold, & strong coffee; you will NOT be disappointed!
