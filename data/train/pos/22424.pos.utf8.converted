There isn't much to review about a product that I use every day, and is consistently just what I need for my "sugar" bowl. Stevia in the Raw is much easier to use than those little packets of other brands....it dissolves better and you can use it just like sugar, in baking, coffee, tea, on your cereal, etc. It can be conveniently measured cup for cup in baking. It may seem expensive, but when you realize the ease of use and how far a bag of it goes, you will be satisfied.
