Here's an item that we like keeping on the kitchen shelves. It's a 13.5 ounce plastic jar of Kirkland Signature Dried and Chopped onions. We usually use fresh onions wherever possible, but these fine-grained chopped onions lend themselves for using in meat balls, meat loaf, soups where the fine grain size is important and in a variety of dips. Nice taste. Easy to store. Long shelf life. Ours is now over the "best by" date, but the still work fine and I wouldn't think of throwing them out. It's a good, useful product to have around.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
