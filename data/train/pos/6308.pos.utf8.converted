This really is the missing ingredient to all of your attempts at making traditional japanese food!  It may seem odd that fish is used as a "spice", but it really almost is just that.  I tried making steamed japanese vegetable with mirin & soy sauce figuring that Mirin was the missing ingredient.  But it wasn't until I read on one of the packages that hon dashi is required, that I discovered the true missing ingredient!  I bought fresh miso to make miso soup, and it too didn't taste right.  Added a spoon of hon dashi and suddenly I had real Miso Soup!  (actually i found out later you can buy fresh miso for miso soup with the dashi already added)  Hon dashi is great for soup stock for udon or soba too.  Buy some and add a little to whatever doesn't taste quite japanese enough.
