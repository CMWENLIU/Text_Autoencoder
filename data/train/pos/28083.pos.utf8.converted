I made the blueberry muffin recipe this morning from "cooking with coconut flour".<br />I substituted  3/4 cup of raspberries  instead of blueberries and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.<br />I took frozen raspberries and pinched them between my fingers to  easily "chop" the raspberries.<br />The musffins baked up beautifully and I served them with a  bit of cream cheese to the staff of Henna Caravan.<br />"Delicious" was the consensus and we will continue to eat coconut flour produts.<br />I can't wait to test more of the recipes.
