I prefer using dried beans as opposed to canned for various reasons. These chickpeas are an excellent product; I would definitely recommend them. Remember that the chickpeas will double in size after soaking, so, although six one-pound bags may not look like much, you will end up with plenty once they have finished soaking. I have used these to make falafel and sundried tomato hummus, and they worked beautifully.
