Barry Farms High Gluten flour makes incredible pizza, French Bread and other breads.<br /><br />This flour is the kind that responds best to a BAKING STONE or PIZZA STONE.<br />(That is the other big secret to great pizza & breads).<br /><br />Basically, with HG flour, a baking stone and using high temps (i.e. pre-heating<br />the stone at high heat for a full hour before starting baking), and with a little reading & practice,<br />you can make better pizza than most of your favorite pizzerias.<br /><br />For typical pizza/French bread dough, I like a 3-2 mix with regular store flour (3 parts HG Flour<br />to 2 of regular flour), although other combinations get good results too.<br /><br />I like Barry Farms' products--They arrive fresh & make great, quality ingredients<br />to many recipes.<br /><br />Even just simple dinner rolls made with this flour & baked on an oven stone will impress your friends.
