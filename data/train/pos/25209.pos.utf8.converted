This is probably the best dark chocolate that I have eaten.  85% is definitely something one has to acquire a taste for, but once you're there, this is outstanding.  I much prefer it to the 70%, which now tastes a little too sweet to my palate. Out of several fine chocolate makers- Godiva, Lindt, and Scharfen-Berger- Green & Black's has probably got the finest overall taste.
