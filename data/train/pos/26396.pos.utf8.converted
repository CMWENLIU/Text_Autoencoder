I find other cereal/granola bars way too sweet, especially if they use artificial sweeteners. These bars are exactly what I like. A good amount of fiber, just enough sweetness, and not overloaded with fat and calories. I was buying the "fiber one" bars but they were still too sweet. I hope Amazon finds a way to replenish stock before my 10 boxes run out. I keep sharing them to let other folks give them a try.
