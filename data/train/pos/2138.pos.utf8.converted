These shave ice syrups did not dissapoint!  I bought some less expensive syrups at another retailer, and they were dissapointingly thin and less flavorful.  In contrast, these syrups are viscous, tasty, and really cling to the ice as they should.  Any lover of shave ice or snowcones should pick up this 10 pack from Amazon.  I looked all over the web trying to find a better deal, and Amazon absolutely has the best price.  Even better, they were on my doorstep about 3 days after ordering.
