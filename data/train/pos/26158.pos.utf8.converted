I have never eaten any kind of meat and as such am very particular when I shop for food items, making sure there isn't lard, chicken fat, or any other type of animal product in my food.  I grew up with my mother using McKay's and know of no other product that is as tasty a substitute for chicken or beef seasoning.  It is a difficult product to find locally in the store's where I live, even in the health food stores, so I'm glad I can find it on Amazon.
