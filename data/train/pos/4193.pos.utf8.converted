I was interest in this particular brand of juice because it is not from concentrate and I know won't being getting filtered tap water with frozen bits of fruit. Also because it's organic, I know I won't be drinking unneeded chemicals to prolong shelf life. I'm fairly certain all drinks (at least juices) need to be pasteurized if bottled. This is the next best thing to pressing the pomegranate juice in your own home. The taste was delicious and I still drank in the antioxidants and nutrients found in pomegranate. Because I do not have the time or instruments to press the pomegranate myself, this is convenient for me to just pour and go. Although it is a little pricey, I figure my well being is worth it.
