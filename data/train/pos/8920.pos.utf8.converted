We microwave our popcorn in plain paper bags with no oil.  We've tried many brands, but this is the best, by far.  It always tastes fresh, never stale, or soggy.  It holds up well to a bit of olive oil, and the flavor is great.  It also comes in vacuum sealed bags, that can be resealed.  I ordered 12, as the bags are small, which is a plus for freshness as well.  Also, being organic is important to us, as it's my understanding that popcorn which is not organic, provides some of the highest levels of toxins from pesticides.  Buy organic, buy this popcorn.  You won't be disappointed.
