This is great stuff. Since buying it two years ago it has become a necessary ingredient in so many dishes. Chiquilin brand has a refined flavor, smoky with no hint of being burnt. I noticed a bit of a burnt flavor in some other brands. It does not add heat like some pepper however. I use it in such things as sauteed vegies which I want to add a grilled flavor to, humus where it add a nice smokiness, and pan-frying tofu (I'm vegetarian). It can even add a grilled/outdoor flavor to your salads when used in a vinaigrette dressing.
