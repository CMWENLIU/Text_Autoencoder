I had bought pre-bottled drinks with chia seeds in them before, but didn't realize I could make them myself! If you soak these in water (or another liquid, we use milk) for about 15 minutes, they become somewhat gelatinous. They add a fantastic texture to any drink, from smoothies to coffee. They are even delicious in hot cocoa. In addition, they are healthy! I was looking for ways to up my fiber intake when I found these. In addition to adding fiber, they add a little protein, too.
