My daughter is 6 weeks old and we have had her on formula since day 3. She was very fussy when we tried Enfamil and Similac. We talked to my parents and they suggested using a soy formula since I had milk allergies as a baby. We tried the Enfamil soy and she was still really fussy. So, we decided to try Isomil Advance. She has been using it since and she is much less fussy. She is sleeping much more soundly now too! It is wonderful and even though it IS more expensive, it is totally worth it to be able to get a good night's sleep!
