I had a recipe for a pear-pomegranate pie which required this ingredient. I also used it in a blood orange, pomegranate, fennel, shallot, beet, feta cheese and toasted almond salad. I served both of these with a crown roast of pork with Cumberland sauce for Christmas dinner. This molasses is sour and sweet simultaneously and imparts an interesting taste but could, if used too lavishly, overhwhelm a dish.
