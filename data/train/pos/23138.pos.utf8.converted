I don't write many reviews, but I just received my shipment and opened up a can, as I am making peanut butter pork and needed some more coconut milk.  I had ordered the Natural Select brand before, which was okay.  But this is so good, that I am eating it out of the can. I have an Asian cookbook that rates this as the best coconut milk on the market, and I would have to agree.  Keep this one in stock and you'll have a loyal customer for life!!
