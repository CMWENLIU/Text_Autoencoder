I first learned to like Wasa crackers (or crispbreads, as they're called) from my old Finnish surrogate mother. But I never took them very seriously until a year ago when my doctor put the heat on me to lower my carbs and lose some weight. Actually, the doctor scared the hell out of me. So I got serious. Since then, I have essentially quit eating bread. But, I like sandwiches for lunch. What to do? Voila! Everything that I used to eat on bread, I now eat on a Wasa--and sesame is my favorite flavor. So with no real effort (other than switching to Splenda instead of sugar), I'm down 30 pounds in a year. I'm wearing clothes that I haven't worn in five years.
