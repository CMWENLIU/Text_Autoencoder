Love these chews.  My two Pomeranians have terrible breath and need dental care yearly which is extremely expensive. I've used these chews for nearly 2 years at the recomendation of my Vet and they do a great job between cleanings. I'm so happy to find them through Amazon since my other suppier was charging nearly twice as much per package.  One thing I especially like about these chews is that they are made from tiny pieces of rawhide so as they get moist they break up and greatly reduce the danger of choking on a large piece.
