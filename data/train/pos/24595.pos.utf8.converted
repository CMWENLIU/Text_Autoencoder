I just LOVE "Honest Earth All Natural Mashed Potaotes", ALL of them!  They are absolutly the BEST instant mash ever with nothing but potatoes in them.<br /><br />They are very difficult to locate and I have no idea why.  I used to find them at CostCo and Safeway, neither place carries them and now Amazon is out of them too!<br /><br />Hey Amazon, Bring back the BEST mashed potatoes ever!  PLEASE!
