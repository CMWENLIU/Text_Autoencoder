I've always equated cost and complexity with espresso - the more complicated and overpriced the machine, the better the taste. No longer. While the individual capsules aren't cheap (about .70 cents each), the machine is well priced at $400. We go through at least 3 cans a month. Each and every cup is perfect!!! The crema is rich and long lasting. No bitterness. Smooth, rich, and delicious...
