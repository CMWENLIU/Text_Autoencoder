This is the stuff hallucinogens bow before. The warning states that it's not for anyone with poor heart conditions, high blood pressure, or contemplating pregnancy, ever. And it means it.<br /><br />One drop of this sauce in anything will have your eyes watering and your stomach curdling. Why it's in a bottle this big I'll never know, but this stuff is the real deal. I was foolish enough to have three drops in a shot of vodka one fateful night many moons ago, and I still tremble at the memory.<br /><br />I can't rate it high enough, so five stars will have to do.
