Tinkyada Brown Rice gluten free products are simply some of the best imitations of wheat noodles. Our one child has gluten sensitivities so we're switched to some alternatives. Tinkyada is one of the best finds. The noodles cook over a reasonable length of time (around 15-17 minutes) and have a firm texture and a taste that is quite indistinguishable from regular noodles. We've enjoyed the noodles with spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, and casseroles. For texture and taste these cannot be beat for those needing something gluten free due to Celiac disease or other reasons. Everyone in the family is willing to eat these noodles. There is a slight taste difference when tried side by side with regular noodles but not pronounced at all unlike the yucky after taste of noodles made from bean flour.  We would highly recommend these to others and have given packages away as gifts to friends with gluten issues.
