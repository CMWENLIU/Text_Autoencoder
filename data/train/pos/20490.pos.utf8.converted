This is great tea, but you need to know how to brew it. There is a viedo on Youtube. Westerners let it steep for 3 minutes creating bitter taste at times. You should pluck some of the cake 2 teaspoons of dry leaves, put it in a cup, pour hot boiling water on it, let it soak for 10-20 seconds then discard the "first tea" prepare your serving cups, pour fresh boiling water over perviously steeped leaves let it steep for 20-30 seconds then strain tea into serving cups. make sure all the water is gone and none left in the leaves as this will oversteep the tea. You can re steep the leaves up to 8 times.<br />great health benefits, enjoy.
