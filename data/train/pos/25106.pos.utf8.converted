I was so skeptical of this product that I had to write a review for the rest of the skeptics. This is a fabulous way to get a european coffee experience at home. I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod. When I balance that against $1.00-$4.00 a cup to get anything remotely similar from a coffeehouse, it seems like the bargain of the century. And I don't have to change out of my pjs! If you are a coffee lover I highly recommend this wonderful, unique machine.
