Wow, I never thought that I'd actually be writing a review on confectionaries, but as soon as I did a successful search for Brown &amp; Haley in the Amazon Gourmet Food shop, I just couldn't wait. The fact is, Brown &amp; Haley, the makers of Almond Roca, beloved by millions of fellow sweet-toothers, is based right here in my hometown of Tacoma, Washington. That's right, the place of the infamous &quot;Tacoma aroma&quot; is also the home of the very sweet aroma of Almond Roca, and has been for over one hundred years!<p>Almond Roca is a bite-size combination of milk chocolate with crushed almond pieces surrounding a core of rich butterscotch almond brittle, so it's kind of soft-but-crunchy &amp; chocolatey on the outside, and hard &amp; crunchy &amp; almond-sweet on the inside. My mouth is watering just describing it! I've got to get some right now....luckily, I can drive just three miles down Pacific Avenue to get it wholesale right from the source!<p>My hometown should be proud of the rich tradition of Brown &amp; Haley; if you're located nowhere near Tacoma and you've *never* tasted Almond Roca before, then what are you waiting for? Order the 7-ounce tin today, and give yourself---or the one you love---a treat that you or they will never forget!<p>MOST RECOMMENDED
