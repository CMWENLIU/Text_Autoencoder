Because of cold weather, I have to bring my tropical hibiscus plants indoors during winter. Every year, they would get aphids and generally be a big mess. Until I discovered these Bayer pesticide/fertilizer spikes. No more aphids. The plant leaves stay green and healthy-looking. And a bonus -- right now, one of my plants has more than 20 flower buds. It's beautiful.
