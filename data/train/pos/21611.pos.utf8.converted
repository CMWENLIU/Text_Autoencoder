Nature's Path Maple Pecan Crunch is by far the tastiest cereal I've had in a very long time. You can feel good about supporting this company because they are committed to sustainable farming and Earth-friendlier business practices (according to the marketing on the box anyway). Even if you didn't care about that, you'll like the cereal. I'm eating it right now straight out of the box as I write this review. It's very hard to stop! The flax flakes and rolled oat clusters are very crunchy and satisfying. I can also clearly taste the maple syrup flavor.<br /><br />One box is 6 servings, with each serving providing 220 calories (60 from fat) and 20% of your daily dietary fiber intake (5g). If I had any complaints, it's that the box is a bit small. It is only 11.5 ounces compared to 13 or 14 for other Nature's Path cereal which contain 7 servings. Secondly, the sugar content could perhaps be toned down a bit to trim back some calories because it's very sweet. One serving is counted as 3/4 cup, compared to 1 cup for many other cereals. Because of the pecans, it packs more energy (calories) into a smaller volume than, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001V74HAU">Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereal</a>, which counts 1 cup as a serving, with 190 calories (15 from fat).<br /><br />At any rate, it's a very delicious cereal and one I'll be buying it again!
