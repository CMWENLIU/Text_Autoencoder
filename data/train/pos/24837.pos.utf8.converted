As much as I love all things peanut, the grand goober is taboo while I'm counting calories.  Looking for peanut flavoring or extract, I was shocked to find PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter, a product I'd never imagined.  Based on the glowing reviews,  I opted for the large size, which proved to be the right choice.  This stuff is FABULOUS.<br /><br />It's a very fine, dry powder with such an intense peanut flavor that very little goes a long way.  A 2-tablespoon (12 gram) serving has only 45 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, but reconstituted with 2 tablespoons of sugar-free grape jam (instead of water), that's enough to coat 2 slices of toast for a sinlessly delicious PB & J.  I've also used it successfully to make no-guilt Chinese cold peanut noodle, peanut sauce for chicken, and substituted PB2 everywhere I'd used peanut butter or peanuts in the past.  Low calorie, low fat, scrumptious and versatile -- what a concept.
