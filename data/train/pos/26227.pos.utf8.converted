My kids and I LOVE this drink!  It is relatively healthy and my 11 yr. old chooses it over a soft drink, which I think is great!  Will say this though - VERY disappointed with the shipping! I ordered 3 cases that came in 2 separate boxes. Opened the smaller box first and didn't open the 2nd one until today.  A bottle in each of the 2 cases had somehow leaked.  One bottle was completely empty in the first case, the other was about 1/3 empty (but won't use it because of this!).  Was a big mess too!  Needs to be packaged better - no packing peanuts or bubble wrap, just the 2 cases stacked on top of each other!!  Wish there was a way to let them know too!  Anyway, love the product, just hope it arrives better next shipment!
