This organic squeeze contains fragrant oil from the lemon peel, and, in my opinion, that is what gives it the fresh zing that is pasturized out of most bottled lemon juices. This one tastes more real than any bottled or squeezed lemon product, it is very close to fresh wedges. I squeeze it in soda, tea, on rice and veggies, even in cake icings. Rim cocktail glasses or just squirt a little in your water bottle. I like putting a pitcher of water out on the dinner table with a slice of lemon in it, but while it looks lovely, the peel can give the water a bitter taste after a few hours. A squirt of this does the trick without any bitterness! Pop in the fridge after breaking the seal.
