The box looks like one of those old-fashioned wooden fruit crates.  Can't really tell by the photo here, but it does.  It has all kinds of witty sayings written on it... "Kale yes!" and "Hugs and quiches" and so on.  The food products are nested in shredded brown paper.  Overall it's a very natural and quaint presentation.  The shredded paper left some dust on the spice bottle and at first I thought it was dirt since it was brown, but then I realized....<br /><br />I have often cooked with quinoa and lentils and mung beans and Bragg's Liquid Aminos, but the sprouted lentils and beans were a new experience for me, as was the spice shaker.  Oh my goodness those spices were so tasty.  My nine-year-old daughter selected one of the four recipes that were included.  I was like, "Meh, I've cooked all of this before... whatever..."  But the recipe we made-- Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes--was entirely new to me.  It was so good.  Like Thanksgiving all in one patty.  So there's these four recipes included, and they all use most of the ingredients in the box--just add fresh veggies.  The sprouted beans cook up in just five minutes, which is pretty amazing to me as a veteran bean cooker.  In my opinion, sprouted beans taste stronger than standard beans, and not very good on their own, but with the two Bragg's ingredients in the box, and the excellent recipes (well, I only tried one), the beans are perfectly balanced.  We had a delicious dinner.  My 6-year-old finished her plate of food and was going for more before we had even served up everyone's food and said the prayer.  Little rascal.  But anyway, if kids think it's good, you know it's good.<br /><br />All of the recipes are vegan and gluten-free, as are all the ingredients in the box.  All organic, too.  Also included in the box was a pamphlet about how to start on a healthy diet.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that the quinoa instructions should say that quinoa must be washed first.  I noticed that too, and it's true that quinoa should always be washed before cooking, so I looked for any such instruction, but then I noticed that the package says the quinoa is thoroughly washed.  Why isn't quinoa always sold that way?  I cooked it without washing it.  It was good, clean.<br /><br />I think this is a great combo pack, very simple and straightforward ingredients and recipes.  As soon as I opened it I was thinking of the many people I would like to see on a healthier diet, and I'm guessing that's what this box is intended for... those of us who do eat a whole foods diet and hope to win our friends over with a nifty gift.  Yeah.  Support the positive propaganda!
