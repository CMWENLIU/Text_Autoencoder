Char-Siu, also known as Chinese barbecue, is really a Cantonese delicacy.  Most non-Cantonese Chinese rarely consume it and certainly do not cook it.  Char-Siu is ever slightly crunchy outside and is moist and tender inside.  The sauce is sweet and tangy with a touch of saltiness to it.  It is different from the American Southern barbecue which is slow smoked for hours, nor it is like the Coastal barbecue which is grilled on direct flames for minutes.  It sits in between.  The cook time is about 1-2 hours.  The cooking temperature also sit in between the Southern and Coastal barbecue.  You can eat it by itself.  You can eat it as part of a meal.  Of course, it is THE essential ingredient of the infamous Char-Siu Bao (Chinese BBQ pork buns).  When you eat a real good Char Siu, you just want to run home and kiss your mom.<br /><br />I am born and raised in Hong Kong.  I have tasted countless authentic Char-Siu for decades.  I know how to make my own Char-Siu sauce from scratch, but it takes time.  I still encourage people to at least make their sauce once, just to appreciate the ingredients.  There is no absolute recipe for Char-Siu sauce, but it must contains sugar, vinegar, honey, salt and soy paste.  Some people make their Char-Siu sauce from Hosin sauce since they share many ingredients.<br /><br />This Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce is authentic -- not because I say so, but because its existence proves its authenticity.  Lee Kum Kee is a very famous Hong Kong brand which dedicates in making sauces.  Its trademark staple product is the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX1E">Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>.  Actually, that is an understatement.  Oyster sauce, in fact, is invented by Lee Kam Sheung, who then founded the company: Lee Kum Kee.  (Oyster sauce is another product mostly enjoyed by Cantonese Chinese).  This company made its sauces to satisfy Hong Kong residents who do not have time to make their own sauces.  These Lee Kum Kee sauces would have never survived if they are not authentic and accepted by the Hong Kong residents.<br /><br />I uploaded two pictures of my Char-Siu made with this sauce as customer images.  By no mean, my Char-Siu is perfected.  However, I hope to show that one can achieve good Char-Siu by using this sauce as the main ingredient.<br /><br />I have used this Char-Siu sauce for more than 15 years, and have also tried other brands in between.  I encourage others to try other brands as well.  Lee Kum Kee Char-Siu sauce is not the only good one out there, but it is definitely one of the best.
