I received a small box of Ahmad Tea Mango Black Tea in a gift basket. It's not something I would have thought I would like. When I tried it, however, I fell in love with it. I've hardly used the coffee pot lately because I keep wanting more of this tea.<br /><br />The tea retains it's black tea character but is made really special by the bright, but not too fruity, mango flavoring.<br /><br />If you like flavored black teas (particularly if you drink tea with milk, as opposed to lemon), you may just find this as surprising, delightful, and delicious as I did.
