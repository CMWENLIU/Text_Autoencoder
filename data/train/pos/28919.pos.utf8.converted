We recently stocked a new kind of cat food formulated especially for healthy skin and coat. We brought one can home to try out on our three-cat focus group.<br /><br />First impression by the human is that it's really a disgusting looking food. Lumps of seafood and peeled whole shrimp, in a "fragrant" gravy.<br /><br />It is, however, highly palatable to kitty kind. The fragrance is an added bonus for older cats since they often start to lose their sense of smell after a certain age. So a strong smell makes the food extremely appealing.<br /><br />We split the can amongst our three cats, and the vote was unanimous. All three ate the entire treat bowl, not just the gravy, but the meat as well.<br /><br />So while it's not exactly appetizing to humans, cats really love it.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Sardine, Fish Broth, Shrimp, Crab Meat, Sunflower Oil, Salt, Guar Gum, Carrageenan, Tricalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Methionine, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Iron Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Manganese Sulfate, Vitamin B1 Supplement, Vitamin B2 Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Folic Acid.
