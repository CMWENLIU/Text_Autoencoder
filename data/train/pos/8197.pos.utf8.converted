I've been currently taking the wildcrafted siberian chaga extract. The extract is more powerful compared to the tea, but the tea is more convenient to take as I travel a lot. I take both (extract/tea) everyday and my health improved tremendously! I've never gotten a flu or cold since I've taken it. I have more physical energy throughout the day!
