If you are a sugar addict...I warn you: do NOT buy these. They are DELICIOUS....and addictive. I loved the light and crumbly texture. They are buttery and sugary and sweet:<br /><br />I bought 5 lbs.<br /><br />I ate 5 lbs.<br /><br />I am visiting them on my hips.<br /><br />I just returned from the gym.
