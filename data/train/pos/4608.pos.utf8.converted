True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)
