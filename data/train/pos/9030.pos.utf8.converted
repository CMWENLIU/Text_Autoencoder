My favorite night time treat is a hot cup of homemade (not packaged instant) cocoa that is only slightly sweet.  One big problem:  it's always treated with alkaline which gives me migraines, and other organics I've tasted don't remotely resemble good chocolate.  Then along came Rapunzel--an ugly can (hey guys, you need to redesign) but terrific tasting organic cocoa that gives me NO MIGRAINES!<br /><br />I used to buy the 5 lb bag but can't get it anymore.  Do you sell it?<br /><br />SWT
