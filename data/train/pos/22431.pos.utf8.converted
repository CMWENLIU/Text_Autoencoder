I really like the Greens+ bars. They are a true nutrition bar, not a fancy shmancy energy bar (which is really a candy bar, made to look like a nutrition bar, but isn't).  Each bar can last me 2 hours, and it is great.  The Greens+ powders are just as good, and I use both religiously.  Being diabetic, and counting carbs, this is closest thing to real food that is easily portable.<br /><br />Now, if they can come up with a "savory" version - I do get tired of sweet nutrition bars.  Wish they would make one that is lightly salty, since salty will satisfy your food cravings better than sweet.
