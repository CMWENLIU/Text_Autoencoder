I have been researching the benefits of Maca root powder for months.  As a homeschooling mother of four (1, 4, 7 and 10) and multiple business owner, I finally came to the conclusion that I needed something to help me keep my energy during my early morning training sessions.  I wanted to avoid caffeine and artificial stimulants.  Additionally, I needed something that complemented my vegan diet.  The Navitas Maca Powder did the trick.  I added it to my hemp protein drink and I noticed a difference immediately.  I adjusted the serving size several times to give me just enough energy.  Now I find myself recommending it to all of my friends and associates.
