Got a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods market to try. It has a silky taste as it advertises and it is a great starting water for people -like me- who want to see if alkaline water can make a difference in how they feel and with stomach acidity. I liked it so much, I got a case from Amazon, delivered 2-days later with my Prime account (I love it!). I am slowly going through the case, one bottle every other day, sometimes everyday. I have to say that I have noticed a stamina related improvement but I will have to watch this for more days. I was away for 5 days not drinking it and my stamina was hampered so that is an experiment I can believe, but I need more proof. Tha page says bottles are BPA free but the label on the bottle has no such remark so I am not sure which is true. The price for the 12-case was just $20 when I bought them a few weeks ago, but now I see that Amazon has increased the pricing to $25. I will check with my local Whole Foods market and if price is lower for a case there, will not buy from Amazon the next time around -sorry Amazon.<br /><br />If you are now starting to get interested in an alkaline diet for improving your health, this is a great introduction along with several books on reducing the  acidity of food intake and stomach environment for all of us with GERD, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982708319">Dropping Acid: The Reflux Diet Cookbook & Cure</a> which I also purchased.
