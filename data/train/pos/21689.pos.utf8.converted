I have to say that without a doubt this is the very best food I have ever fed my dogs, both were adopted and didn't like any dog food that we gave them. The food would sit all day, and then we would throw it out give them a fresh set and it would sit until (I'm guessing) they were both so hungry they didn't have a choice but to eat it, and this always made me feel sooo bad. I went to the "natural dog food store" the owner of the store was amazing and gave me a few free samples of the taste of the wild line of dog food. I was skeptical but went home and fed it to Jasmine and Peanut, my MinPin and Pekinese mix, much to my surprise they licked the bowl clean and have been ever since, they enjoy dinner time now, they have more energy, their coats are so much softer, and they are going to the bathroom on a much more regular basis. I have nothing bad to say about this food, and if you love your babies as much as I love mine, TRY IT! you won't be disappointed.<br />Samantha
