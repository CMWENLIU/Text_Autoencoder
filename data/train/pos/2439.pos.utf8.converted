I ordered this because as a teenager I used to make cinnamon toothpicks. I have tried others and they were not the same, so I purchased this in hopes it would be different, and oh yes, my prayer answered. I used this oil with toothpicks to help me stop smoking, this is one great product. I have to slightly lick the toothpick befor placing the whole thing in my mouth or my mouth would be "on fire". After that it is just perfect, the oil takes the nicotine bleeding through my gums and it covers the taste so I can go about my business and not think about smoking. You are asking, has it worked? And my answer is "YES", it's working and going on 8 weeks now. Thanks to this oil it has helped ease the pain and cover up tasted I was hoping it would. As another poster stated, it is very potent so you may want to dilute this. Thanks for a 100% quality product.
