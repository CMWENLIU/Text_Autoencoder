Taste & quality before corporate productivity! Pomi produces some of the highest quality packaged tomato products with the added bonus of being GMO and BPA free.  And it's not just the fact that they are packed in Tetra-pack that makes them BPA free, it's also because they are not stored/transported in any BPA lined containers before final packaging.  As far as GMO's, it looks like we are going to have to source produce from European countries that require GMO ingredient labeling until the USA catches up.
