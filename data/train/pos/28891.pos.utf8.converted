A few friends of mine from work ordered a couple of pounds of Blue Horse Kona Coffee last year and we were all amazed at the exceptional flavor, no less the wonderful smell which filled the office as the coffee was brewing. We are now on our third order and we have five people from my office ordering, as they too have become addicted to this special coffee. We share the cost of 5 pound orders (free shipping from Blue Horse directly), with our most resent order intended as an after dinner Thanksgiving treat for our family and friends. Then if the coffee wasn't good enough, I must add that the service from the folks at Blue Horse is fantastic, every order arrived with in days of its placement and each time the coffee was a fresh as it gets or at least tastes and smells that way. To say the least, IF you are truly a coffee frantic like I am, please do yourself and/or your family a favor and order some, you will not be disappointed and you will experience some of the best tasting coffee in the world. Then even if you don't like coffee, this would make an exceptional gift for someone who does. The medium roast is what we've ordered on our two prior orders but this time we've order 5 pounds of the dark roast, so we can compare and say we've had the best of both worlds. Once I've brewed a few pots of the dark, I will come back and update my posting, so everyone will have a review of both but as an FYI, you can order a pound of each and you do get free shipping with multi-pound orders. They also have a website and you can order directly from them, saving a little money over the Amazon price, plus the pictures and stories/history of the coffee alone is worth the visit to their site.
