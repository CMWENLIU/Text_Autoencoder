When Hershey decided to change their Dutch Process cocoa powder around 2004, I was compelled to find a replacement that was as good.  I tried every cocoa powder out there and nothing was  as good.  About a year later, Cooks Illustrated did a taste test on cocoa powder and Callebaut came out on top (January 2005).  I found it online and decided to order it even though it came in a large quantity and it was a bit pricey.  I have never used any other cocoa powder since.  It is fantastic and worth it.  I get huge compliments on all of my chocolate recipes and I know it is the Callebaut cocoa.  Your brownies will never taste as good with any other cocoa powder.  Your homemade hot chocolate will be the envy of all the kids in the neighborhood.  I find ways to use the quantity within a year and no one complains!
