Not sweet like most cereals. 11 healthy ingredients including flaxseed. No junk whatsoever. Zero saturated fat and trans fat. Very filling, great for breakfast. I personally like to eat it everyday - may get bland after a while, so switch to another cereal for a couple of days and come back.<br /><br />Amazon's price is an added bonus.
