UPDATE APRIL 2012: Awhile back, some Amazon customers were having a problem with the product they received.  I believe that Amazon packaging sorted out the issue. Now when I receive these from Amazon, they are always fresh and in sealed packaging. Each box is individually sealed tightly in plastic wrap.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />These bars are very good, kind of like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They taste so good that they have taken their place as my new favorite protein bar by thinkThin. They taste like chocolate and peanut butter.<br /><br />However, I should clarify that the chocolate is sort of a diet tasting chocolate. The ingredients are natural, but it is diet. It is good for a diet protein bar. It may taste a little bit dry compared to some protein bars that are loaded with sugar. There are some brands of protein bars out there that, if you read the labels, contain a lot more sugar. If you want a bar like that, then this may not be the bar for you. It tastes pretty good for the type of bar that it is: very low sugar and low fat.<br /><br />They are less sweet than other brands of protein bars, because the bars by thinkThin contain lower amounts of sugar.  However, they are healthier, so for me, it is a good trade-off. Also, if you are used to other brands of protein bars, they may not taste as rich. If one looks at the ingredient label of the other brand versus this brand, one may see a lot more sugar in the other brand.<br /><br />Note for hypogylcemics: For hypoglycemics like me, at first glance this bar appears to have 0 gms of sugar, which would help to stabilize the blood sugar. Combine that with 20 grams of protein and it sounds like a great combination for hypoglycemics. If you are not a hypoglycemic, but just looking to lower your sugar, this would seem to be a healthy bar -- and compared to many high-sugar protein bars on the market, it is.<br /><br />However - taking a look at the nutritional information, it also states there are 11 gm of "sugar alcohol" in the bar, which from reading the label I see come from Maltitol. Maltitol has a relatively high glycemic index, which is not good news for hypoglycemics. Seventy-five percent of Maltitol calories and sugar are absorbed by the body. This does impact blood glucose levels. Estimates state that Maltitol is 75% to 90% as sweet as sugar, depending on the source. It can also cause intestinal discomfort. So if you are a hypoglycemic, don't be fooled into thinking you are eating a truly 0 gm sugar bar. You are absorbing some sugar. Just plan your menu accordingly.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts per bar:<br />240 calories<br />Fat calories: 80<br />Total fat: 8 gm<br />Saturated fat: 3 gm<br />Cholesterol: 5 gm<br />Sodium: 240 mg<br />Total Carb.: 24 gm<br />Dietary Fiber: 1 gm<br />Sugars: 0 gm<br />Sugar Alcohol: 11 gm<br />Other Carb.: 10 gm<br />Protein: 20 gm<br /><br />If you are used to other brands of bars with a lot of sugar in them, ThinkThin may take some getting used to, but if you are looking for a lower-sugar alternative, give these a try.<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> "I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.
