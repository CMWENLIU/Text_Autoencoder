I absolutely love Amazon and practically 'hang out' on Amazon like some people do on Facebook - LOL! That being said, I really enjoy reading the reviews and the comments of fellow Amazoners and learn so much by doing so. I really appreciate the information that other reviewers include and when I have found a particular reviewer that I recognize over and over again, I have clicked on their profile to read more about them and about what other items they have reviewed and BOY has that been fun!<br /><br />And that is precisely how I stumbled upon this Amazing Grass Green Superfood mix!<br />I was reading the profile of another reader and she raved about it. Well, any time I am out of my green powder, I order a different brand. This way, I am always using a different product and can try them all out and see which one I really do like the best and will stay with. As timing would have it, I was almost out of the one I was using, and saw this review, and ordered it!<br /><br />I signed up for the Auto-delivery (as you can cancel at any time) and it reduced the price as well as free shipping - yay! But, the real test was in the flavor, and it's blendability (new word?). It shakes up well (shake, not stir), and the taste is pretty good. I add it to smoothies, or drink plain in water or juice and like it either way. It seems to be economically doable for me, possibly lasting 60 days, so that is a better deal than most out there.<br /><br />I felt better immediately after drinking it - with more energy - probably due to the Maca. Maca is something you want to research before taking, and certainly before ever giving to children. I have some Maca in a bag, and when I have added only a tiny bit of it to a smoothie - I didn't like the way it made me feel at all, and it made my heart go a little crazy, so IMO, be cautious.<br />This, however, gave me a burst of good-feeling energy without the heart palpitations of other ill-effects, so I was happy.<br /><br />All in all, I think I have found my favorite green drink so I'm sticking with it and if I have any other opinions, I'll update my review.<br />I think you'll like it too!
