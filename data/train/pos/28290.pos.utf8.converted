Just got the flour today and I made the pizza immediately... it was pure heaven- crunchy, full of air bubbles and stretchy all at the same time. Honestly, I will never ever use any other flour again. I made it on a pizza stone (that is, I made it on a few unglazed terra cotta tiles I picked up at home depot for 4$). Shame the shipping cost is high as it is, but, I figure if I buy the 10 bag deal it's ok... I will certainly use it all... soon.
