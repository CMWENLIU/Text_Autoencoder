I'm a long time tea and lover and only rarely do I buy packaged teas, preferring loose leave teas instead. But I bought a bunch of these new pyramid tea bagged teas because they just looked so neat.<br /><br />This Lipton truffle one is the second one I'm trying.<br /><br />Packaging: I love the pyramid tea bags. I think they really work well, at a minimum they allow bigger tea leaves because there is more space inside the bag for the water to swirl the leaves around. The negative about this is that the bags are not individually wrapped (difficult to wrap a pyramid shape) so I try to use up all 20 bags as quickly as possible lest the flavor escapes.<br /><br />Flavor: Not usually a great fan of flavored teas because sometimes the flavor overwhelms the tea taste and you end up drinking flavored water with tea. This one is not bad. It's hard to mix all 3 flavors together and taste all 3. On smelling it, it smells strongly of caramel. On tasting it, the vanilla and caramel flavor is rather weak, the truffle flavor is stronger and you end up with a coffee-ish tasting tea, which isn't bad. After reading the other reviews, butterscotch, musty or even musky come to mind.<br /><br />In the end, all taste is subjective so you really have to try it yourself (and just buy 1 box first). In my humble opinion, I would summarize this as a coffee-ish tasting desert tea. I add sugar to my tea, so with the caramel or butterscotch and coffee taste this is definitely a desert tea. I wouldn't drink this everyday, but I would buy it again.<br /><br />N.B. Make sure you rinse your teapot or cup quickly after drinking this as the caramel flavor can remain quite a while.
