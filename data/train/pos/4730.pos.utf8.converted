There's only one way to describe DeLallo Soft Torrone, "That's amore!" As the product of a very Italian family, I grew up thinking torrone was the greatest food ever created. At every holiday, my grandfather would bring out the torrone, and all the cousins would gobble it down--not that you could ever get enough to satisfy us. DeLallo Soft Torrone lives up to all those memories--and it may very well be the greatest food known to mankind. Nougat, almonds, edible paper--who could ask for anything more?
