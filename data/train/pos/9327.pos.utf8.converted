When we found out my wife had a gluten intolerance, we thought food as we had known it was gone forever.  WRONG!  We now have superb bread daily from this mix.  I have messed up the recipe a few times (forgot to count on the cups of mix, had too much water, etc) and it always turns out great.  We use a Panasonic bread machine (bought here on Amazon).  I will admit this bread is best right out of the machine and gets dry after a couple days (we store it in the fridge).  We always toast it before making sandwiches and it's good to go.  We now subscribe to this mix every 2 months from Amazon and the price per loaf is awesome.  We started with the single loaf bags and then went to these big boys (save $$$).  One note that we learned from the little bags is to substitute a 1/2 cup of the water with milk.  We like the results.
