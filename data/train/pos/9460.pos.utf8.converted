I am a very healthy person. I eat organic foods, take good vitamins etc. I never thought I needed magnesium in my diet since I ate so well. I am currently 2 months pregnant and have had awful morning sickness lasting all day. My mother recommended this product to try. I called my Dr and she said it would be just fine during pregnancy, so three days ago I gave it a try. OMG 10 minutes after I drank it my morning sickness was gone! Been taking it for three days now and I feel great! I would highly recommended this for nausea and stomach issues, morning sickness, oh and constipation it really helps with the constipation!
