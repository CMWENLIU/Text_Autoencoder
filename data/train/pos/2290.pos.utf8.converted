Not being a  nutritionist, I can't compare the food values of different organic chia seeds.  These taste fine and I assume they contain the nutrients claimed on the label. I have been happily satisfied with everything I purchase from Nutiva. Furthermore, it is offered at the best price I've seen, and the free shipping makes it an even better buy.<br /><br />Recommended
