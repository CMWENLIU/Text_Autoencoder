There are many claims for best instant coffee, and I have tried many of the top priced brands.  The Mount Hagen brand, both decaf and caffeinated, is excellent.  Sometimes, I do not have the time to grind fresh beans, and I have sent a lot money trying various top end brands.  A little disheartened with The result, so many lack a good solid and smooth coffee taste, I actually bought a box of the 25 sachets rather than a jar.  And boy was I shocked to discover that both the decaf and caffeinated were excellent.  In fact, the decaffeinated had just the right strong and smooth flavor of excellent ground coffee beans: one would have thought you just ground them and it did not taste watery or weak.  I kid you not.  The amazon save and subscribe is a great price!  Thank you.
