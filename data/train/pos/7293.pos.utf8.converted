I am on a course of chemotherapy; and I am therefore not allowed to drink regular coffee because it has caffeine. I tried Nescafe Taster's Choice decaf coffee and I was very much in love!<br /><br />This coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker. The coffee is consistently tasteful.<br /><br />You probably should refrigerate the container after you open it; but I have left it outside on my kitchen countertop and the coffee I make with this still tastes fine. If you're lucky enough to catch a great sale on this terrific decaffeinated coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused containers in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.<br /><br />All in all, Nescafe Taster's Choice is an excellent decaffeinated coffee and it remains extremely popular. Buy some and try it today--you won't be disappointed!
