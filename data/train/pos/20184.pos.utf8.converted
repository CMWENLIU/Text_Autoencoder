Westerners are so silly blaming MSG for all the problems they have.  Just look at Japan, where this thing was discovered.  After all these years using Ajinomoto (MSG), the nation still maintains a healthier population, who lives longer, has less health problems, and are generally thinner.  All those westerners who blame ANYTHING for all their health problems, just stop eating too much of their own crap (pizza, McDonald's, etc., etc.).  Just like anything else, if used judiciously, this thing is totally okay.
