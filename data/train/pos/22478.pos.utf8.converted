Rooibos (Roy-boss) tea is surely an acquired taste but once you get use to it it's really quite good! This one brews up a very nice deep dark reddish color. The taste is not easy to describe, it is deep and earthy. This tea does not have caffeine so it is a great tea for those that can't have or don't like the feeling you get from caffeine. This is a very nice soothing tea I find myself reaching for more and more!
