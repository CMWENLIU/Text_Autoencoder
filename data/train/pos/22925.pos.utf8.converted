These 1/4 Grain tablets are much more convenient to use that those little pink packets you see everywhere. Each tablet equals the sweetness of one teaspoon of sugar so you always know how much to use to get the taste you like. Necta Sweet is hard to find in stores these days so I was happy to find it at Amazon.com.
