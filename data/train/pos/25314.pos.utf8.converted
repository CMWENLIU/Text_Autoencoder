I have 4 cats that are all 18 years old.  My vet continues to be amazed that they are as healthy and spry as they are, at their age.  They are all rescued animals who had very rough lives before coming to me.  I attribute their amazing health in no small part to their food.  I've always given them food with no by-products (Wellness and a few other brands) but when they hit 17, I started noticing a marked decline in their energy levels and appetite.  It wasn't until I tried Innova that the trend reversed itself completely.  They've always had incredibly soft and glossy coats, but the EVO has even improved that too.  My half Bengal's fur truly feels better than silk.  They've been eating the Innova for a year now and play like kittens again.  I couldn't be happier with the quality of the food or the results in my babies' quality of life.  You can't go wrong with Innova.
