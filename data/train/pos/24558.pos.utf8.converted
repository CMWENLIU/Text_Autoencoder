This is a great tea.  It helps with cardiovascular health and is also calming. No sweetener is needed since it has Stevia in it.<br /><br />I started drinking Hawthorn teas for my heart; specifically palpitations. Also, I am under a lot of stress right now because my 85-yr old father has recently been diagnosed with Dementia and he was sent to a skilled nursing facility from the local hospital after falling and breaking 5 ribs.  I am the oldest (and also disabled), and this was all left to me to deal with. My stress level has been extremely high, I have been having anxiety & panic attacks which include palpitations and a very unsettling,uneasy feeling. I had some Xanax that my Dr. had previously prescribed, but I ran out of it. Quite by accident, I found that this particular tea had a very calming effect. It is also really good tasting.  Bija teas carries another Hawthorn tea called Heart Health, but I have not tried it. When reordering I had to be careful to get this exact same one. Also, when looking it up online, most of the time it went to that other Bija Hawthorn Heart Health tea.
