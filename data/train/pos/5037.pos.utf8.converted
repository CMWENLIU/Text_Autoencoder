I like to add dried tomato bits to soups and stews and sauces, but I hate throwing away unused and rotten tomatoes. Solution: dried tomatoes. And these are good quality. They are just about the right size: too small and there would be little texture and too big and they probably wouldn't rehydrate well and would be chewy. These are just right and very convenient.
