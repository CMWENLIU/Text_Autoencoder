It is surreal how difficult it is to get rye flour in hawaii; that is to say impossible, until Amazon started delivering it.  I have made something of a project of sourdough this year and have starters going from white, wheat and mixtures; however the best sourdough comes from rye... well, at least it is the easiest to culture, and is a natural (has a lot of wild yeast in the flour).  Sadly I was unable to get a starter going until now.  Thanks to Amazon I now have a wild yeast pure rye, as well as one started with a pinch of my wheat starter,  It says something about the freshness and quality that the starter was foaming after one day!  I have already made rye bread using a culture started from this flour, and no yeast was necessary :)<br /><br />Beyond that, I like that it is packed in small bags, as I have to store it in the freezer to combat the tropical humidity and pests.  I also like that it is 100% rye, not a mixture like so many others.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon :)  Without this service I would have the trappings of western civilization largely off limits but for when I travel.  i really appreciate having access to the foods I grew up with, and ingredients I need to cook what I like.... which is pretty much the only way to get those things here.  It is nice having fresh rye bread again :) (ah, the little things we take for granted, until they are out of reach)
