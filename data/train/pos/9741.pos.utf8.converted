I was recently turned on to Starbucks Green Tea Frappichino. I found out what they used to make them and decided to try to make them myself.<br />This green tea tastes the same as Starbucks and now I make them at home all the time. I hope Vita Life Matcha will be around for a long time because I will keep ordering it for as long as I can!!!
