Silk may not be the healthiest soymilk, but it does taste really good.  These little 8 oz. tetrapacks are super convenient, with the little collapsible straw taped on the side of the box.  Great for work lunches or school snacks.  Too bad this is not available at Costco, they only have chocolate. I can only buy this in the winter months due to summer heat spoiling the product during shipping.
