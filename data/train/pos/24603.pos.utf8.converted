I just received this soup and I have to say it's really good.  I was a little concerned with the sodium content, but I found that if I added a bit more water to the soup it wasn't too salty.  I have a desk job and I am constantly eating through my lunch.  This instant soup provides a great lunch for me and it's only 35 calories!
