Got a package these sent to my father for his birthday.  He's the kinda guy who thinks meat as a gift is awesome.  Furthermore, when it's Omaha steaks, I don't think one can go wrong. He said the steaks were tender flavorful. The packaging they arrived in was secure and intact upon receipt. They were delivered within time for his birthday (I ordered about a week before the date). Will definitely order from here again. And anyone I know should feel free to send this to me as a gift! ^_^
