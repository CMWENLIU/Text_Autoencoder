These greens are delish. And they are low calorie and chocked full of cancer fighting vitamins. I have had bad experiences with canned greens being bland and metallic tasting. But when I saw that it was an "Allen's" product ( I love their Italian Green Beans.) I decided to give it a try. Perfect easy side dish to baked chicken. Add a few tomato slices and viola, dinner is served.
