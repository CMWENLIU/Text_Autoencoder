Me and my kids are loving the aerogarden.  They're constantly checking it for new growth and watching the roots.  They've even named the plants.  What's really nice is that they actually get excited about eating the salad with the aerogarden lettuce.  It's helping us eat a little healthier and is fun too - a great deal. Highly recommended.
