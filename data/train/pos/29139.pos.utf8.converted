I used to get these at Kroger grocery in Georgia and NC but sadly they disappeared. If anyone knows a source and would be willing to share that would be excellent. They are a unique taste that does not compare to any other I have tried. I agree that shipping is high but I have just placed my second order. A word of caution though, my first order was basically 6 jars of pickles in a box loosely bubble wrapped, needless to say the box was all wet and to my dismay a tragic scene of delicious Heinze pickles and glass were all over the inside of the box. I notified the company and they credited back the cost of the one broken jar to my credit card but still the trauma lives in my mind as I salivate thinking of what might have been.
