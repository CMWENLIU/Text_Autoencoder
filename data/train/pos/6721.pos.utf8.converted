I tried this product because of the features. I wanted to try something a little different and healthy. It turned out to be one of the best drinks that I have tasted. It has real aloe vera pulp which makes it very refreshing, has an amazing flavor and is unlike many other products. I have tried many different types of teas and many claim that they speeds up fat oxidation, improve insulin sensitivity, help with glucose tolerance, help with your skin, lower cholesterol levels, help control weight and many other benefits but this one you really  start feeling healthier after a short period . I tried two flavors the passion fruit and the natural flavor. I liked them both with a little inclination over the passion fruit one. If you are a healthy person or want to become one I really recommend this product.
