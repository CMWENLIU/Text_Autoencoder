I had been using the 'original' Chebe mix. Then from the Chebe website www.Chebe.com, I saw a recipe for sticky rolls using the Cinnamon version of this item. Wow....they got rave reviews from even the folks that didn't need to eat Gluten-free. GOOD STUFF! Easy to make. Certainly an item that will be used again and again at our house. You can use this mix to make several things, so it is a multipurpose mix. Again you can check out www.chebe.com to find ways to use it.
