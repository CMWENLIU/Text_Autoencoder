I LOVE THESE SOOOO MUCH!! IM ONLY 13 and my brother and I used to eat these things like crazy! This summer when I went to europe, I saw theme so I brought as many as could!! I miss them and I ordered some that my brother do not know about because when they cam, they were WAYYY SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT but I enjoyed them... And I don't even feel guilty.
