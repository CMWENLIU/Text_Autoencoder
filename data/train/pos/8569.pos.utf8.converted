I was skeptical when I first read that Popchips were not fried nor baked, but popped.  How many times have I ventured into the somewhat scary world of healthy snacks?  But I was very surprised when I tried them and immediately found myself becoming one of their biggest spokesperson.  I even sent a case to my family in Indiana.<br /><br />I haven't tried every variety, but of the ones I have, I crave the BBQ Popchips and the Salt/Vinegar Popchips!
