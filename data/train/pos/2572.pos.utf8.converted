This gum is old school.  It doesn't believe in all those fancy, new fangled sugar alternatives.  Ingredients are simple: cane sugar, glucose, gum base, rice syrup, beeswax, carnuba wax and flavors.  It also doesn't mess around with synthetic color agents (no Red #40 or Yellow #5 lurking in these boxes).  Bonus is that it tastes great.  No it doesn't stay flavorful for an extra, extra, extra long time, but its delicious for long enough to get a nice minty taste in my mouth and satisfy my desire to chew.<br /><br />I had discovered Glee Gum years ago and enjoyed it, but hadn't thought much about it again until I became pregnant last year and realized EVER gum at the corner store or gas station had either aspartame or saccharine in it.  Even the tried and true Juicy Fruit has turned to the dark side.  Thank you Glee Gum for offering this delicious, all natural alternative to the neuro-toxin laced sticks sold by your competitors.  I appreciate it and I will continue to buy your fine product for many years to come.
