I'd rather eat this canned tuna than any fresh fish that wasn't just pulled out of the water!  It's addictive...  And it makes regular grocery store brands of tuna taste like cat food.  Dry cat food.  This is well worth the price.  Try it tossed, oil and all, with hot pasta, a little lemon and some pepper for a super-quick and tasty meal.
