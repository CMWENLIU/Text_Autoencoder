I thought I'd try these packets since I really like the full size Barney Butter and wanted something handy for my kids' lunches, the car, etc.  The package came in today and these are the perfect quick and healthy snack.  It was very easy to open (there was a little notch, my 9 year old had no problem either) and it is the exact same smooth and creamy consistency that I love in the full size Barney Butter jars.  I am always looking for dense nutrition that my kids will actually eat.  They love Barney Butter and I am so grateful for such a high quality product.  I'll give my kids these packets for their lunch, on their way to soccer practice or if afternoon activities delay dinner.  That it is peanut free is great because some of my kids' friends have peanut allergies.  This is a great quality product.
