I've been feeding my three cats (age 1+ years) a variety of dry and canned food. In order to make my life simpler, I tried a variety of dried food; mostly expensive, healthy varieties. Chicken Soup For The Cat Lover's Soul is the ONLY food all three would eat. And my "runt", the really picky eater, has been acting very active, and all three cats look really good.
