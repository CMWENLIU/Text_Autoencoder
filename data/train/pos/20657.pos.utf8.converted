I love Indian food. Most of my friends have no stomach for it and therefore I rarely get to indulge myself. This is closest to a restaurant version that I have ever had. It must also be well liked by the general population, because my local supermarkets are always out of it. (And I live in white food county.) When they restock, I grab the entire quality they have. Believe it or not, I will drive to three or four supermarkets to find it in stock.<br /><br />I am also on a low carb, original Dr. Atkins Lifestyle. This stuff is perfect. It gives me the flavor that I desire in chicken with very few sugar carbs per serving (unlike many barbecue sauces and marinades).<br /><br />It is a bit salty. FYI so use unsalted butter.
