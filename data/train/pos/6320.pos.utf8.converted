I purchased this product at Dean & Deluca and have been very satistfied with it taste that compares as close to fresh truffles as possible.  The salt holds all the aromas and flavors of the truffle.  The finishing salt just adds that extra something to a dish that you can't describe without having used it before.  I highly recommend this product because it will last and continue to add that something special to anything from poached eggs to bread and butter. Worth the price.
