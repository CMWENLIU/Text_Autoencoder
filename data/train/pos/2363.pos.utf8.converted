I like trying different teas (primarily non-herbals), and after hearing about Pu-erh I was intriqued.  From what I've read so far, I believe this particular version is not aged like the very high-end, expensive, caked versions are, but it seemed like a good way to get a taste of this tea variety.  I am not disappointed at all.  Though it's not a drastic departure from other teas, it's not quite like any I've had before.  It's very mild and earthy, with a subtle sweetness -- VERY pleasant!<br /><br />Something else that sets it apart from other (non-herbal) teas: It doesn't get bitter after extended steeping!  Furthermore, as I've read elsewhere, just one serving goes a long way.  In fact, I never stop steeping it.  When my cup is almost empty, I just top it off again.  I get at least four flavorful cups with just one of the prewrapped nuggets.<br /><br />This instantly became one of my favorite teas.  I'm delighted I finally discovered it, and just may have to spend the $ to try one of the more expensive/exotic versions.  If it's even better than this, I would understand why folks are willing to pay such a premium $.
