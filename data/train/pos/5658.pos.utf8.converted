I first encountered this tea in a random bin of teas. The box looked cool, so I bought some. I enjoyed it. It made a good stout pot with one teabag. The flavor was smooth and bold. The company is socially and ecologically responsible.<br />Then I ran out. There was no more to be found locally. I went back to my old brand, but somehow... it wasn't the same. I tried other brands, but I pined for Yorkshire Tea.<br />Nothing else is quite as good.<br />Thank goodness Amazon carries it.
