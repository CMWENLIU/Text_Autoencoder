This cereal tastes great and is very nutritious - a really good alternative to bland Quaker Oats...<br /><br />A word of caution. If you are not familiar with eating oatmeal products and you decide to try this product out, please avoid the mistake I made described in this story:<br /><br />One morning, I was picking up my friend to carpool to work with. I decided to try his Muesli while waiting in his kitchen so I dumped a bunch of it into a bowl, not realizing how much it was going to be. Well, I finished the entire bowl and I felt great - nice and full. At around 1 pm, however, I felt this *tremendous* pressure in my lower abdomen. So I quickly left my desk for the bathroom while doing my best to hold in what I had know idea was about to come out. Let's just say I was lucky that no one else was in the bathroom. This continued for 6 hours...<br /><br />I argue for every 1 cup of Muesli expect 1 cubic meter of methane production - at sea level.
