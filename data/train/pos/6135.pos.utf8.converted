My husband and I have made homemade pasta sauce from Roma tomatoes we grow in our garden for the last 30 years. Last summer, due to weather conditions and blight on the plants, we didn't have enough tomatoes to make large batches of sauce.  I am Italian-American and have fairly high standards for pasta sauce.  I read online reviews and tried a few jarred sauces, only to be disappointed.  Since I frequently shop on Amazon, I searched for a pasta sauce with good reviews, and found this Eden sauce.  The ingredients were impressive and the price was very reasonable, so I decided to give it a try.  The flavor is very close to my homemade sauce, but the consistency is thicker, which makes it ideal for pizza.  I am very pleased with the quality and taste of this sauce.
