I've been a San Francisco Bay coffee fan for years, and was delighted to learn of their one-cups.  The flavor is great and the pods are eco-friendly.  I like my coffee strong and have found the French Roast to be just right.  Don't know what a reviewer meant by "weak and watery."  Not so!  I like the price too.
