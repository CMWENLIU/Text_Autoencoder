I bought this item to take apart and create several gifts with it.  In other words, with these 30 packets, I was able to create 5 great gift baskets by just adding a couple of coffee mugs in each one.  To buy this to use as a single gift is fine as well, but, you will need to figure out a different way to present it.  It comes in a sturdy, sectioned cardboard box (in the photo, it looks to be wooden, but it is not), and so the packaging isn't particularly pleasing to the eye.  However, the coffee packs themselves are lively and colorful, and they will make a fantastic gift in another type of a container (i.e. basket or something).<br /><br />I decided to keep 5 packs of the coffee for my own use, and I have to say that the 2 that I've tried thusfar were outstanding!  Very smooth, with strong, distinctive flavors.  Specifically, I tried the Amaretto and Mocha so far, and both were great.  This sampler pack is pretty inexpensive, and it's a great way to give a little something to your coworkers at Christmas.  When I purchased this item, I paid $24.00, but I see that it has increased in price since then.  I probably would be less inclined to buy it now, although the coffee really is outstanding.
