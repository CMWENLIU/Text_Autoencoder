I was pretty excited to try this flavor and was NOT disappointed!  It smells heavenly when brewing and tastes like a good cup of coffee with the perfect hint of a chocolate glazed donut aftertaste!  I could close my eyes and believe I was in a donut shop, drinking a great cup of joe.  I think, like most of the flavored K-Cups I've tried, the flavors are more of a delicious smell than taste but that is just perfect for me.  I think I'll go have a cup right now!
