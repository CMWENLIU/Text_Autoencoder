When my wife commented how she had always enjoyed Payday candy bars as a child, I thought to "pick some up" at the local supermarket. Imagine my surprise when I found NO payday candybars at any grocery, Dollar store, Drug store, or gas stations. On line, I found Payday was now part of Hershey Chocolate, yet I found no way to order on line from them. At this point I fell back on my 'default' solution and checked Amazon.com. I found our beloved Paydays available in several sizes,varieties even in yet to be released CHOCOLATE. I immediately ordered the snack size in amounts to last for months. My package arrived promptly and we are enjoying the freshest, tastiest Paydays ever!
