This flour is a very light cream color and smells like toasted coconut, it's a wonderful coconutty smell. I've had great results using this in recipes as part of my gluten free flour mixtures and I've even added it to meatloaf for added fiber! When I make a mixed grain loaf using it plus adding some coconut oil, the loaf comes out of the oven smelling of fragrant coconut... yum! I like the smell and taste of this flour so much that I haven't bothered to try any others!!  I did smell my daughter in law's Bob's Red Mill coconut flour and Swanson's coconut flour smells much more coconutty, so I'm sticking with it over any other brand. The texture of it is really nice too.
