This snack was an accidental find for us.  Now both my husband and I are as addicted to it as my three year old daughter is.  Most kids love gummy bears but they are filled with sugar, have no vitamins in them, and are made with gelatin, a no-no for a vegetarian.  This snack is a great substitute: low sugar, loaded with vitamin C (good for immunity), and no gelatin. And it tastes good!  When you want something different but you don't know exactly what you want, instead of going for something fatty, go for this snack and you (and your kids) will feel satisfied. We like the "tropical treat" flavor better than the red one (forgot what that flavor was called).  I highly recommend this product to families with kids.
