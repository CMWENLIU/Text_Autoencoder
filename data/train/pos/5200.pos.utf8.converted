My son has tons of play dates and is always eating (and he's only 2 1/2 years old) so I wanted something healthy for him that he would also eat and my mother-inlaw showed us these one day. He loved thim, so now I purchase them in bulk. Great healthy snack for children of all ages (including grown ups, my husband really likes them too)
