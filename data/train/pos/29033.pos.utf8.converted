I was in a liitle shop in the Tampa area specializing in hot sauces. I knew this sauce as "Aunt Lucies Hot Sauce" from Dennery St Lucia when I worked there in the late 80s. I used it on everthing especially any chicken dishes as well as adding to cheese and spaghetti sauces. This is one of the few hot sauces that have a distinct flavor and do not just burn the inside of your mouth.I took an chance on the made in St Lucia label and was not dissappointed. After nearly 30 years it is just as good as I remember!
