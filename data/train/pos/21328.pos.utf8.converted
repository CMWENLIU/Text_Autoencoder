My dog is over 14 years old, and has been on a prescription diet for years.  After she eats, her belly has always been bloated and she has acted uncomfortable.  She's had issues with diarrhea, so I finally decided to fore go my vet's opinion and try her on a high quality dog food.  I looked for something that had the lowest phosphorus level along with being easy on the digestive system.  My dog loves it!  She is excited about eating again, and she seems to be feeling more comfortable after she eats.  I don't know if she has a long time left to share with me, but at least I know she is enjoying the most important parts of her day.  Right now, I am mixing it with her prescription food at a ratio of 3 parts prescription kibble to one part Grandma Lucy's.  So far, I am really pleased with the results!
