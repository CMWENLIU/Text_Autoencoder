This stuff really works, and it's cheaper and better than Red Bull, Monster, or any of the other energy drinks.  It lasts longer, there's no crash, and no sugar.  I drink one every morning instead of coffee, and the best thing is, it actually tastes pretty good.  Highly recommended to start your day.
