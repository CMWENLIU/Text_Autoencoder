I love the taste--and especially the texture--of these bars. They're moist and chewy, but not at all sticky or gooey. The texture is almost like a brownie, dense and chewy. And filling! As good as they are, you're not tempted to eat two, because one is satisfying enough.<br /><br />The sweetness comes mainly from fruit sugars, but as I don't have a sweet tooth, it was slightly too much for me. However, I'm assuming that most people have a higher tolerance for sweetness than I do, so they'll probably find the level to be just right.<br /><br />Of all the "healthy" bars I've tried, I have to say this one has the healthiest ingredients. And at only 160 calories with no saturated fat, I feel good about eating it, because it's not just a candy bar in disguise like most bars. My niece is used to there only being "healthy" food at Auntie's house, but I think this time she won't mind!
