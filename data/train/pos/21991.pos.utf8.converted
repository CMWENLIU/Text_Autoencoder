This mix is delicious!  Works well with German chocolate/coconut frosting, cream cheese frosting or almost any frosting that isn't citrus flavored.  Rich flavor and nice find here on Amazon--it isn't carried in stores all the time.  I also recommend the Betty Crocker strawberry and cherry mixes, which are hard to find and are available here.
