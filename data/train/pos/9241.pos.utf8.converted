This sugar is out of this world. I will always have some on hand from now on. The wonderful maple flavor is so natural and aromatic. I just substitute it for part of regular or brown sugar in any recipe. It is also incredible for "dusting" the tops of pies, scones and cookies. This is a fabulous product, I highly recommend if you love baking or just want to be more conscious about using highest quality ingredients. You might as well buy two pounds straight away, it's that good.
