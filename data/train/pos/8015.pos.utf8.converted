I really wasn't sure that this would taste anything like coffee.  When I opened the package it smelled strongly of cinnamon, but nothing like coffee.  I brewed it double strength (2 bags in 8oz of water), added two sugar cubes, and a bit of almond milk.  It was VERY much like coffee.  I have abstained from any form of coffee for the past 4 years, but have missed it quite often.  This will definitely fill my coffee void!  I love it :)
