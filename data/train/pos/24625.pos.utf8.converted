When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended.
