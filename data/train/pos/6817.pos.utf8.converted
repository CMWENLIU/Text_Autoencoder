We have been feeding our cat mixed canned food and dry (but more of the wet food). She was with Core Wellness Chicken Grain-Free until she had her dental surgery (with tooth extraction and cleaning), and the vet suspected that the antibiotic prescribed caused her to itch all over after a week into recovery. She started to lick and pull her hair with her teeth, as well as excessively lick her legs, paws, back, belly and the scratching was constant. Our poor baby! The Core wellness was good but the vet told us we need rabbit meal or rabbit canned food for our cat to itch less and to rule out allergy from chicken or fish. We got this Nature's Variety dry food (still has chicken) to supplement the rabbit canned food, which is her main food now. She has to have the dry food to snack on otherwise she would not eat the wet food. And she is normally an active cat.<br /><br />It has been 3 days since we changed her diet and we can see remarkable improvements - less scratching, and she's more active and playing and much happier now! We observed that our cat has been drinking more with this food, which makes perfect sense from another person's review and from the package label. It says it has only 10% moisture. By the way, our cat is pretty much healthy prior to her dental procedure, no kidney problems, not diabetic, no hyperactive thyroidism thank goodness. And she has her complete blood profile done before and after the dental surgery. All other organs tested as well. We ruled out flea allergies since we have her on a flea prevention monthly maintenance(Revolution, update: changed to Advantage II) which we apply on her every month since we got her.<br /><br />So if your cat is scratching excessively with generalized itching on the body, and pulling hair (no vomiting, diarrhea etc. just the scratching,excessive licking and hair-pulling) like our cat, it may be skin allergy .. this cat food proved to be helpful to us. It's definitely a lifesaver for our precious cat. We wish to continue using this product as well as the canned rabbit food to keep our cat healthy and itch-free!
