For some reason this sea salt taste different than any sea salt I have ever tasted.  In am not a sea salt conasuer but I knew this salt was "the one" after my first taste.  I don't know if sea salt taste differently from region to region or what but I highly recommend this specific brand for its taste. As a side note about sea salt, I have suffered migrains all of my life and after getting rid of table salt and switching to sea salt 40 years of migrains vanished.  I must have needed some type of mineral that is in natural sea salt, I am guessing. Table salt is stripped of all minerals and has additives for its preservation while shipping which is something our bodies don't need anyway!
