I first encountered Balsamic Cream in England a few years ago. When I was in Italy March 2008, I bought Mazzetti Balsamico Cremoso at a grocery store, which was wonderful and reasonably priced. Earlier this year I bought a couple varieties on Amazon, and I just bought a few more for holiday gifts, not all of which are making the cut! Here are my personal views of the ones I bought:<br /><br />#1 Casa Rinaldi Crema di Balsamico Blanco (white). This is not the dark Balsamic Cream I have had before, but of all the ones I've now tasted, this is my favorite. It is the perfect balance of vinegar and sweet, the texture is thick, but the flavor is light. Wonderful! ($11.95 for 8 oz from [...])<br /><br />#2 De Negris Balsamico Glaze - also a great flavor, balancing vinegar and sweet, but much thinner texture. Fine for dipping bread etc. ($11/7.3 oz) ($10/13.5 oz on Amazon)<br /><br />#3 (this product) Da Magreta Acetaia Real Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena): second best flavor and thicker ($23/16.9 oz)<br /><br />#4 Modenaceti Balsamic Gkaze: thicker, good flavor, but more grapey than the others above. (3x13.5oz for $28)<br /><br />I also tasted Earthy Delights, which was thick and more tangy/vinegary than the others above. I'll use what I have, but probably not buy more. $14.50/500ml<br /><br />For my taste I would not again purchase Mussini Crema di Aceto Balsamico di Modeno (Glaze of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - sweet, grapey, caramel-y" and don't know what to do with Roland Balsamic Glaze (thick, but very, very vinegary - ugh).
