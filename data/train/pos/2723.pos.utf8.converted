This is really awesome chili. Preperation time is kinda long. But, of course, anything that turns out this great is worth waiting for. It's very important that you soak the beans overnight, occasionaly changing the water and removing any foreign materials (floaties). I alter the recipe slightly by adding some fresh sarrano peppers, sliced and sauted along with the onion and garlic. Also, I substitute two of the four cans of stewed tomatoes, using instead two cans of diced tomatoes, one w/green chilis, the other w/habeneros. And, I like my chili HOT so I shake-in a generous amount of "ASS KICKIN' Hot Sauce". Once all ingredients are mixed together, I find it best to allow the chili to simmer over low heat for at least 3 hours, usually 4 or 5. The longer the better. I've got family and friends that beg for me to make this chili. Somehow, after eating this stuff, you get this  feeling of elation and calm, peace. It really makes you feel good. However, those who don't LOVE hot spicy chili should not even try one bite as they WILL suffer.
