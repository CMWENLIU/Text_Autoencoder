i use this powder for beauty and not for cooking...yet. i mix it with yogurt and honey and put it everywhere! the benefits of turmeric are so extensive and since ive been using the masks, my eczema flare ups are short lived. shipping was quick and i think ill have enough for quite awhile. this was definitely a good buy!
