My Shih Tzu's love these! I didnt think they would eat them at first but as soon as I gave it to them it was gone =)They have allergies to most grains, we feed them a grain-free diet & these are perfect & wont make them itch like crazy. I will definitely purchase these agian & would recommend them to anyone!<br /><br />The shihpping was VERY fast, I ordered them on Friday night (06/18/2010) & got them today (Monday 06/21/2010).
