I've been drinking Stash brand Decaf Earl Grey Tea for years now. Very few stores in my area carry this brand, so I decided to order it from Amazon. I think this is the best decaf earl grey out there. It has just the right amount of bergamot oil, and is more flavorful than most other brands of decaf earl grey I've tried.
