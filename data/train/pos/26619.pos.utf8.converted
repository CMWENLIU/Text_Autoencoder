A big thumb's up! Coincidentally, after I purchased this item, the people in my social circle started calling me "Chocolate Factory."<br /><br />With this, inventing decadent new techniques is easier than tossing salad! Just about anything is better when it's dunked in chocolate - even nuts! Once word got out that I was experimenting, people were leaving skid-marks behind as they rushed over to my house.<br /><br />One of my closest pals even tried dipping his fist, but that resulted in a trip to the emergency room.<br /><br />It's not quite the same thing as making fudge - which I used to pack and ship off to friends (and even strangers) - but variety is the spice of life!
