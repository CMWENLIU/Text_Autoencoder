I have used this Manuka Honey for various types of degree burns. Burns heal, faster, cleanly and leave less scarring. I also used it on a really bad laceration and crushed finger tip that was almost cut off from a door. The price might be a little expensive, but its well worth the price for the healing properties this awesome medical grade honey has. Look for either the MGO 400 or its equivalent UMF 20+. This type of honey is not like table honey, it a powerful honey that is only found and created in New Zealand and has great antimicrobial, anti-fungus, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and antiseptic properties. It can also be used for acne, skin disorders, and is safe for use in infections in the eye socket, nasal cavity, and ear cavity. It may be taken orally to provide great health for your digestive system and overall health. Do your own research and be patient, and you will see its great healing benefits. I highly recommend this product!
