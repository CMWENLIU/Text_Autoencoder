Reiterating previous reviews of this product- Fee Brothers Old Fashion Bitters are an excellent alternative to the angostura brand. I find the aroma stronger, more pleasing, and the flavor more intense. This allows me to put less of the product in my cocktails and still reap great results. I wish it came in a larger bottle!
