I purchased this product for my husband who has hydration issues.  He really likes Propel zero and all I could find was the bottles.  I hated seeing a plastic bottle go to waste (recycled but still waste) everyday.  I found these packets and we are now both very happy.  He has his hydration and I don't feel guilty loading ladnfills.
