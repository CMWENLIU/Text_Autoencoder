I love these truffles! I usually buy the bags at the grocery store but it's a total crapshoot as to how they've been stored so they sometimes haven't been kept cool enough and it ruins the outside shell so i thought I'd try buying them from Amazon. They came in two days with regular shipping (nice!) and were packed really well with chill bags. They were perfect! I will definitely order them again.
