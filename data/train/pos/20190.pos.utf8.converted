This is a tea bowl. I doubt the Japanese eat "cereal" (American fake-breakfast sugary junk food swimming in cow's fat). Many cultures, such as say, Japan (and even France) drink tea from bowls. It is black, not brown. I love it--it's beautiful, and elsewhere handcrafted Japanese tea bowls cost about $60.
