I've had a lot of store-bought hummus over the years, and nothing compares to this stuff. I  had it by chance on an airplane ride recently and fell in love. It reminded me of the hummus made fresh daily at my favorite hole-in-the-wall Greek restaurant! I will DEFINITELY be seeking this stuff out and stocking up on it. I can't wait to have it again!!
