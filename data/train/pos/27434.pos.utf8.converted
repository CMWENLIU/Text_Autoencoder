I purchased this box mix at an outlet originally.  I only purchased one box to test it out.  It was fabulous.  I can bake it plain or add nuts, cranberries, chocolate chips or whatever.  You can't imagine how easy and quick it is to put together.  Everyone I serve it to.....raves!!!!!  This brand has many other choices in their box mixes and they are all wonderful.....but this is my favorite.  After I could not find it at the outlet anymore I got desperate and went on Amazon.  It was out-of-stock and I went on the waiting list and they notified me.  Then I ordered 6!!!!!  A must try.
