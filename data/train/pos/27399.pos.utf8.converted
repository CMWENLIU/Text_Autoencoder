We adopted 2 shelter kittens this past June & switched them both over to Felidae Grain-Free kibble. I did a lot of research & going grain and gluten-free is important to us. My kittens have soft, silky coats with a wonderful sheen - most likely due to this food.<br /><br />While it's frustrating not to be able to purchase this at PetSmart or Petco when buying litter and canned food, I'm thrilled that Amazon is selling this & offers free shipping (I buy 2 at a time). So free shipping and delivered to my door is a no-brainer!<br /><br />Our 8 yr old formerly feral cat doesn't care for this dry food, but that's because he was eating a grocery store bought dry food that was full of all the bad stuff that tastes yummy. (Purina Naturals) We've gone grain-free so this poor guy has to suck it up & eat Felidae when he wants to munch on something crunchy, otherwise he just eats his canned food.<br /><br />I believe in offering both canned and dry food to cats.<br /><br />BTW- if you want grain-free canned, you might be surprised to learn that all "Classic" Fancy Feast flavors are grain-free (& most are gluten-free too). Cats don't eat fruits and vegetables in the wild, so I'm not falling for the Wellness Grain-free hype & switched back to Fancy Feast when I found out the pate-type Classic is grain-free/gluten-free & also approved for diabetic kitties! (don't have that problem however) Fancy Feast does use meat by-products, but the company assured me (& followed up in writing!) that their by-products are clean & only contain organ meats. And the by-products are not the first few ingredients which is also important to check when purchasing cat food.<br /><br />UPDATE OCT 5 2011: There is a brand new totally toxin-free, grain-free cat kibble on the market: It's called "CATWELL" and can be purchased online at RedMoon. They make other formulas, but the CATWELL is a new formula, developed by an expert in cat nutrition. It also has no fruits and vegetables both of which harm a cat's kidney and liver & cause crystals/stones! My cats enjoying this switch.
