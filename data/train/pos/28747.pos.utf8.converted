I LOVE wild Tibetan Goji berries. They are so tasty and make my body rejoice when I eat them. They help me with diabetic symptoms, especially when taken before bed. My 4-year-old daughter loves them too.<br /><br />I used to pay $22/pound for this exact brand, so this price is truly unbeatable. Did I mention that I'm excited about this find??
