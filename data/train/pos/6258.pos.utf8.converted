I was very impressed with this product.<br />It says to use a 4/1 with water, here's what I did<br />1 part reduction paste (container)<br />1 container of red wine<br />2 containers juice from meat you are cooking (If you can collect that much)<br />or<br />2 containers of water<br /><br />a healthy dash of onion & Garlic powders<br />a dash of black pepper<br />and very important....... a teaspoon of UNSALTED Butter<br />(this will smooth out the flavors)<br /><br />All I can say is OMG!!<br />I drizzled this sauce over the plate, added garlic mashed potatoes in the center<br />of the plate, added the Beef Tendloin on top of the potatoes, topped the beef with<br />steamed green beans and then Frenches onion rings (pieces) on top of the beans...<br />My dinner guests said that they thought they were at a high end resturant!<br />Experiement & Enjoy!<br />(I'm buying more!)<br /> I even had left over sauce and used it over hamburgers... OMGx2 !!
