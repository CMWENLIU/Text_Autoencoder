It's so nice that it's not filled with things that should just NOT be in formula.<br />No ingredients are purchased from China.<br />Contains no palm oil.<br /><br />I also am impressed that they don't use corn syrup to sweeten their formulas. It's brown rice syrup which is a better carbohydrate than most use.<br /><br />In response to no added DHA/ARA this is found on their website so it is not lacking.. and who wants DHA/ARA made by martex which is derived from laboratory-grown fermented algae and fungus and processed utilizing a toxic chemical, hexane anyway?<br /><br />Baby's Only Organic
