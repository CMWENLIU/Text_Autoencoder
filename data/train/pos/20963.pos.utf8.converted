Don't let the name fool you. This is not related to wheat at all.<br />You must try this if you have digestive problems of any sort.<br />It does not have the taste of regular buckwheat. It is delicious.<br />I can't eat corn and try to avoid 'enriched' foods but I loved grits. This is just as good and is a great replacement for grits. It goes great with eggs.<br />It is also a great help if you rotate foods for allergy reasons. It is easy to digest and so is a food for anybody of any age. It even makes a great baby food.<br /><br />Deb Drake, ND<br />[...] - Natural Health TIPS
