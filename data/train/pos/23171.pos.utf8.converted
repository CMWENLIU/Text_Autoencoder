My family has used this oil for many years.  We used to buy it in Brooklyn from the Asaro family store in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.  They would put it in the cans while you waited.  It is the only oil my mother used for her salads.  She would say, "Get the good oil", and she meant the Partanna.<br />After we moved to New Jersey, we would go back to Brooklyn periodically just to get this oil.
