This is the first time I've ever done one of these reviews. I bought my aerogarden back in February and I absolutely love it! It's easy to set up and maintain and I have more herbs than I know what to do with. Before I got it, it would just kill me to make a dish calling, for example, 2 tbls. of fresh basil, parsley and cilantro. That would mean having to buy about $10 worth of herbs and then only using a small fraction of them. This product will pay for itself many times over!
