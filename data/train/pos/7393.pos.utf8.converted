Being a 4th generation vegetarian, I'm always looking for new things to try.<br /><br />As an opened minded WASP, I'm willing to embrace the best of all cultures.<br /><br />As a busy guy, I like the rip it open, nuke and eat methodology.<br /><br />I've tried many of the Kitchens of India products.  Everyone I tried was really good, but this is by far my favorite.  It is also a complete quick meal by itself; many of the others are a curry of some sort and goes best with the rice you supply.<br /><br />I like the shelf life, and no refrigeration of this series of products.<br /><br />The taste is rather complex, and goes through a series of changes while you savor each bite.  I'm not good with words; you'll need to try it to understand. The effect is very pleasent, though.<br /><br />It's about 518 calories per package.  I use it as a main meal ( again as a veggie I've been accused of only eating side dishes...)<br /><br />Finally, being basically cheap, Amazon's 1/2 off sale makes it a compelling deal.
