This product is marketed as a dinner or soup, and I can see how some people would be put off by it when consumed this way. Instead, I use it as a sauce for baked chicken. Simply lay out some drumsticks in a casserole dish, pour Kitchens of India Ready To Eat Mirch Ka Salan over the chicken (one package for every 6 drumsticks), cover and bake at 350 degrees for about an hour. Everyone who has tried it wants the recipe. They are always amazed at how simple this is to make.
