Buying 6 pounds of a grain you've never had can seem risky... what will you do with it all? But I took the risk and it paid off! Teff is great. I followed the porridge cooking instructions on the back, but made it savory instead of sweet. I let the tiny teff grains heat up/dry roast for a few minutes in the pot. I could hear them popping like crazy (sounds like electricity) and then I added water, organic chicken broth, ghee and black pepper. I let it cook longer than they say and then mixed a serving of it with chopped broccoli and chopped turkey, and then topped it with a drizzle of flax oil. My toddler said "yum, yum, yum" about 100 times. That's pretty cool.<br />We can now confidently add teff to our rotation of amaranth, quinoa, brown rice, millet, oatmeal, and spelt flakes.<br />We have a high protein, high fiber, vitamin packed winner!
