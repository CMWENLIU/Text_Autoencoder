I stopped purchasing other canned soups after trying various Amy's soups.  Other brand soups taste too processed or salty for my liking. I usually make my soup fresh, but when I'm sick or just lazy, I'm glad I can enjoy an Amy's soup as much as my own homemade soup.  Amy's Minestrone soup is my absolute favorite.  The Minestrone tastes more like a homemade soup than any other canned soup I've tried - even within the Amy's product line.
