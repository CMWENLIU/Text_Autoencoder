This is a fantastic meal in a can.  Not too spicy but not bland at all, it can be eaten alone, just heat it up. You can also add some tomato sauce and vegetarian protein crumbles (I use Yves brand) and it's a terrific chili that tastes great in whole wheat pita bread or a tortilla wrap. Low salt, low fat, it's a perfect fast food dinner when you're tired.  I ordered a case because the local supply is inconsistent.  Too bad that there are many shelves of sodium- and fat-based products, and so little room for simple, organic good food.  I will enjoy this for many meals this summer.
