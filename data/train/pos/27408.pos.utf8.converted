I love this tuna.  It's unlike any other tuna I've tasted.  I usually don't like canned tuna, but this is an exception.  I eat it for lunch right out of the can. It needs nothing else (no salt, pepper, mayonnaise) and doesn't have that canned tuna taste like others do!  Makes a great snack, too.  I like spicy, and the Thai Chili tuna is spicy  with a slight sweet flavor. It's my favorite.  Lots of flavor! Makes a wonderful light lunch with some zest.
