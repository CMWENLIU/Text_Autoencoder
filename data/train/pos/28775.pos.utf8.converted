I found this at Whole Foods with tamari and all the other gluten free and alternate sauces.  This is absolutely delicious - like dark, rich soya sauce that's been brewed for years.  We use it in cooking as well as for sushi.  I think it has a more substantial, less salty flavor than Tamari and is less sweet than bragg's.
