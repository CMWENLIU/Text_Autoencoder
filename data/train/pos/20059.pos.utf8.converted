This is the real thing. Tea, cardamom, and nothing else. If you're used to getting chai in the northeast of India, this is the next best thing to making it from scratch. Tea India also makes a good masala chai, which is found throughout India. If you prefer a stronger brew, just use more than one bag per cup. The nice thing about this brand is that the tea doesn't get bitter when you steep it for longer periods - it only gets stronger.<br /><br />Add some fresh ginger to this tea and you've got something really special! I drink this tea every day. Cardamom is great for your health - it's considered a weight loss tonic in Ayurveda, and is also good for various internal organs.
