I am allergic to wheat and thought i would die, Italian food was my favortie. All rice pastas are mushy and taste much like health food. This one is far better than all of the rest. The first time I had it, I actually had to check the package to make sure it was Rice and not Wheat. My husband even ate it(without knowing) and didn't notice anything. I would recommend to anyone. It is also half the price on amazon with no shipping so it pays to buy it online. Also, make sure to follow the cooking instructions and rinse very well to get all of the starch off.
