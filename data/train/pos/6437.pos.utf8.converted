What a gorgeous and delicious sauce that also doesn't have too many calories for its type (180 for the whole container).  Bought it on a whim yesterday to go with pan sauteed chicken breasts.  Wow was it delicious!!<br /><br />I pan seared the chicken in a little olive oil, deglazed with dry white wine,then added the Veloute sauce and simmered.  I really couldn't believe how delicious it made my simple dish.  Just bought a six pack of this stuff and will use in a pinch for company and when I just want to eat delicious chicken with my family.  My husband couldn't believe how good it was.  Adding mushrooms would send this over the top.  It took me 15 minutes to do!
