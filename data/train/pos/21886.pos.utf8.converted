I haven't used this for cooking (I am ordering another jar for that purpose) but I love this product as a skin and hair moisturizer!  The smell is amazing, like fresh coconut, but is light and not overpowering.  It makes my skin so soft and helps keep my curls shiny and healthy looking.  The oil is solid out of the jar but easily melts when I rub my hands together.  It makes a wonderful massage oil too.  I am sold on this stuff, I can't imagine going back to regular body lotion.
