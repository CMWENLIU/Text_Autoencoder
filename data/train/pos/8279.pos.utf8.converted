After reading several reviews with the pros and cons on this product I decided to take the plunge and give it a try. I was expecting a fishy smell as was described  in some reviews. It had almost no smell at all. I would describe it more like a whiff of rain or a fresh water lake---definitely not a turn off and the rinsing completely took care of any scent. The consistency was pretty much as the other reviewers described---somewhat chewy but not like rubber bands. I prepared it per package instructions which was very easy---just rinsed and parboiled. I used a tomato sauce and grated cheese and I do plan to try it again with olive oils and other sauces. It doesn't taste like pasta. I tried it without sauce first and there was no taste.
