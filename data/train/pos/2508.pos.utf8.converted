I was reading about house keeping and baking soda. I thought it will be really great. Because It has a lot of uses, cheap, not bad for you, and good for the earth.<br />This is how I use baking soda.<br />1. I use only 2/3 of laundry detergent and use 1/2 cup of baking soda. It makes clothes really clean and good for the world.<br />2. I use 1/2 spoon to wash my hair. My hair feels dried when it's wet. But later when my hair is dried, it feels really soft.<br />3.I exfoliate my face with baking soda like it says on the box. My skin looks clear and soft. I was using St.Ives scrub stuff. But I like baking soda more than that. Because its particles are really fine. So I just think it will be better for my skin.<br />4. I use this to take a shower. Put 1 spoon of it on shower clothes with body shower stuff. My skin feels dried but cleaner and later it gets not dried without lotion.<br />5. I use this to brush my teeth, too. I love it. It has salty taste.. You will may not like this. But after brushing, breath smells good, cleaner, and it is supposed to make teeth whiter.<br />I just love using baking soda now. I found 75 ways using baking soda by searching Google. I am expecting baby and I will use baking soda to clean my babies diapers, clothes later.<br />It has uses information on the back of the box. And You can give friends as a little gift. I ordered 3 boxes and gave 1 box to my friend and told him how to use them. And He loved it. Great thing to share i think..<br />I hope this is helpful for you.
