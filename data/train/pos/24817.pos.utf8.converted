This is the second pitcher plant that I have owned but the first that I have bought from Hirt's. It came in two days in a box that was so carefully packed that if felt like I was opening a gift. There was a small heat pack to keep the plant safe and each of the pitchers were carefully wrapped to protect them - I was blown away!  The plant is so healthy and absolutely beautiful; I will be ordering more soon!! No one does plants this way and this is the way it should be done.<br /><br />Hirt's sets the standard!
