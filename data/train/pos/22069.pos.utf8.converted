I have drank Community Coffee for many years but recently became concerned about the effects of caffeine. Not being a fan of decaf, I decided to try this one. I am very pleased that it has most of the same flavor as the full caffeine version that I have had daily for about 25 years. My only beef is...why can't you get it in 1 lb. bags??<br />**Update** I have just received my second order of this coffee, and I do have a major problem with it. All of the coffee appears to be stale. Anyone that drinks coffee knows that the quality is greatly dependent on how fresh it is. The bags I buy in the stores have a "sell by" date four months or more away. These bags are within a month of their "sell by" date, which is a deal breaker for me. I will go back to buying it in the store. I guess in this case you do get what you pay for.
