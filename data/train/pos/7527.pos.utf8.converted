I use this to line the compost collection can I keep under the sink or I use one when I am doing a big cooking project to gather compostable items.  If I let things set in the bag more than 5 days the bags start to leak as they start to break down.  And breaking down is what I want them to do as I put them into my compost bin.  Even in winter I notice that they start breaking down rather quickly.  I am sure by spring when I am ready to use my compost these bags will be fully intergrated into my compost.
