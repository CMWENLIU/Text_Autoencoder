Here in California, we have an ongoing threat with natural disasters, and I'm thinking specifically of earthquakes. All electricity, natural gas, most communications and transportation could be out of order for unspecified times and It is advised that the populace ought to be prepared for such an event. Foodstuffs, water, batteries, temporary lighting and a variety of other provisions ought to be in supply to last at least a week. Well, no one can ever be totally prepared for a natural disaster, but I try to at least keep the food and drinkable water cabinet full. Fruits and veggies are real easy in canned or dried forms. Nuts, dried foods of other kinds and crackers are a snap. Good sources of protein are another matter and a little more difficult. Here I've gone with a number of canned items and one such item is Kirkland Signature Roast Beef in Beef Broth which comes in four-can packets and which I get at my local Costco warehouse store. It's fairly economical and easy to use. It's rather tasty for a canned meat product and can be eaton as is or cooked into a variety of meals. It's vary low in fat and consists of chunks of top and bottom round. It's fully cooked, but might be heated if you like. Now and then, in non-emergency times, I use a can so that there is a gradual turnover. Plus, I like to take a can or two along  when I go on camping trips. It suits these purposes well and I'm very satisfied with this product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
