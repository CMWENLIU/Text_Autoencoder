My 9 month old kitten has had trouble with diarrhea since we got him and it doesn't seem to have a medical cause, he either has a food allergy or just a sensitive stomach. We gradually switched him to this food about 3 weeks ago and have had good success with it. The diarrhea has stopped and he really seems to like this food. I did a slow switch, adding small amounts to the dry food he had been eating and eventually feeding him 100% Natural Balance. We're very happy with how well this food has worked for our cat and plan to keep him on it. The nutrition content is excellent and for a premium food, the price is quite reasonable. I'd rather pay for a quality food like this and have a healthy cat than buy a poor quality cheap food and end up spending more in vet bills. My kitten's coat is very shiny and soft, his weight is perfect and even my other cat, a very picky eater, likes this food. I like the limited ingredients in this formula which is great for cats that might have allergies or be sensitive to the ingredients in other foods. Overall, I'm thrilled I found this food and my kitty is too!
