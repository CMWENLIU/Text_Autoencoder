One of my friend recommend this product and I found it on Amazon for much less price.<br />Actually it is cheaper to buy on Amazon than the manufacturer.<br />I am taking this with fresh apple juice. Cut an apple, put it in juicer, add some water and blend it.<br />I use Blendtec but any blender should work.<br />Add one spoon of powder, mix it. Add a little honey if you want. Drink. That's it.<br /><br />I like the taste. I heard that it tastes like grass. But, it tastes good.<br />It doesn't look good :-)) You have to overcome that feeling and drink slowly.
