This is one of my favorite Dr. McDougall products.  I love that the soup is loaded with noodles, has a mild flavor and is a breeze to make for lunch.  Like most of this line, the soup cup's contents are dry and the user must add water and the flavor packet and pop the cup in the microwave for several minutes.  I generally think the company suggests too much water for the products and that is no exception for the miso soup.  I always place less water than recommended in the soup cup in order to produce a slightly thicker broth that is more concentrated in flavor.  The miso soup may have too much sodium for some but calorie wise, this cannot be beat.  With a little garden salad on the side, the user gets a very satisfying lunch.  One annoying aspect of McDougall products is that all the "big cups" are two servings.  The contents, however, really seem equivalent to one serving. Just be sure to double the calories if you keep a calorie log or are trying to keep an accurate picture of your sodium intake.<br />'
