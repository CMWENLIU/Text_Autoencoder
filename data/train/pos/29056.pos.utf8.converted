First off, I want to share the nutrition information that ought to be listed in the product information. These numbers are from the bag.<br /><br />Crude protein: 40% min; Crude fat: 18% min; Crude fiber: 3.5% max; Moisture: 10% max; Calorie content: 391 kcal/cup.<br /><br />We're trying to help all four of our cats lose weight; two of them are significantly overweight and two of them just a little bit. I tried Wellness Core but the none of the cats loved it, and one of them wouldn't touch it. Core does have a better nutrition profile--it's 50% protein which I understand is ideal. The 40% that is in this product is barely better than the Purina One I had been feeding the cats. But the ingredients are much better and the carb/fat ratio is more desirable too.<br /><br />I'd like to have them on a wet/raw diet but one of the cats won't touch anything but dry food. This is the best food I've found for meeting everyone's needs.
