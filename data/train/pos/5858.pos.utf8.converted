This stuff is awesome and has helped me do wonders to shift my PH. I've found that 4-5 cubes of ice, a banana, bout 1/4 cup of apple sauce, a scoop of this stuff and a shot of sugar free chocolate syrup and you don't even know it's in there. On it's own though this stuff tastes like grass clippings.<br /><br />If you want something with less sugar juice 1 cucumber, about a pound of carrots, an apple or a pear and 1 scoop of this stuff. Tastes great over ice. I do the shake in the morning and the juice after dinner like clockwork.
