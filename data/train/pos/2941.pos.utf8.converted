The 4-pack of dried milk is a great way for a very small family to use powdered milk without worrying about it losing quality before it is all used up (once packets are opened, they begin to "age").  And this is organic!<br /><br />I add several tablespoons to the milk in yogurt making, to thicken the yogurt, use it as creamer in my coffee while traveling, and enjoy drinking the rehydrated milk if I run out of milk before my next trip to the grocery store.  It doesn't all dissolve instantly, and that is normal and healthy (if it did, it would not be the real thing).  But it dissolves quickly enough when I use a spoon to stir it and press any lumps against the side of the container.  A blender might work, but I don't use one.<br /><br />Ordering was easy, the shipment arrived in good condition before I expected it.
