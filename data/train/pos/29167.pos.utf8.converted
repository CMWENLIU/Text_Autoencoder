Alright, I'll preface by saying that I have not had the pricing or expiration (not that I would notice) issues that some of the other reviewers have faced.  The humanity.  I get them every 3 months and the price has always been between 6.50 and 8.50.  This is a tremendous bargain.  One of these boxes at Duane Reade costs $4.99+.  I would probably get it delivered more than once every 3 months if I ate breakfast more.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite cereal, and while I may sound like a child, I'm 27.  Since you're curious, the other members of the Cereal Rushmore are:<br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch<br />Frosted Flakes<br />Corn Pops<br />Honorable Mention: Lucky Charms<br /><br />Boom, done.<br /><br />Update 9/20/12: Now that they got rid of the 3pack, and replaced it with the 4pack, they also jacked the price.  S+S is $18 currently ($4.25 per box).  While I will still buy them, the savings is noticeably less.  Maybe the other reviewers were right all along.
