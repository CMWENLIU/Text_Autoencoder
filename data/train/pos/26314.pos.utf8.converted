As everyone else has already said, this is the best hot sauce on the planet!  We always called it "rooster sauce"...and my first exposure to it was this little bar/restaurant that was local to the college I was attending at the time (quite some time ago...lol).  Anyway, I used to put this sauce on EVERYTHING - pizza, burgers, french fries, marinara-based pastas....even omelettes/scrambled eggs.  But once I graduated and moved, I didn't run across Sriracha chili sauce (the original Huy Fong version, that is) for years.  I stumbled across it recently on an Asian food website and promptly ordered 4 bottles.  I just ordered 6 more today!  And just so you know, the Amazon price for the 6-pack beats anything I've come across thus far (especially considering that it's eligible for free shipping if you spend $25 or more).<br /><br />While I love anything spicy, I suppose that some folks might find this to be a bit much (so if you don't like spicy food, stear clear).  But for those of you who enjoy "spicy", this is the ultimate condiment!  I disagree with the reviewer who stated that they don't taste much of a difference between this and Tabasco.  This sauce tastes like chili peppers and garlic.  I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar taste to it.  Plus, Sriracha sauce is THICK - which I like much better, as it stays on food like pizza or french fries.  Tabasco is watery...and isn't as hot as Sriracha.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great deal - so stock up!  You won't be disappointed!
