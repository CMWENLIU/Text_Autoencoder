this is the best cocoa i've had. way better than anything you can find at the supermarket, and even better than the other highly rated cocoas i tried from amazon.. also dissolves in water really easily and makes amazing hot chocolate (you can find recipes online - once you start making it from scratch you'll never buy the pre-mixed stuff again).
