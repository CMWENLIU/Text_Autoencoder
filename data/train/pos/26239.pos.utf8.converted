i purchased this set as a gift for someone with little sushi making experience. i did read the product description but was still surprised by how many items came in the package. it came with everything you need minus the fresh fish and veggies. it was put to use at our superbowl party and there was plenty sushi to go around. i was very impressed and the recipient loved it. i would recommend it and would buy it again. sushi chef is awesome.
