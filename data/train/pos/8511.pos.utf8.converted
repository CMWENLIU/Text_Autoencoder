When I ordered the porcini mushrooms I had no real expectations.  It was a good deal price wise.  I grew up with my dad cooking on all the holidays and he always used dry porcini mushrooms in his sauce for raviolas and spaghetti.  But when I received the two little jars of mushrooms I was so pleased.  I kept one and gave the other to my sister as a gift.  When I opened the jar I was flooded with good memories.  Thanks for the special treat.
