I have seen a few commercials with Snooki and Deena of the Jersey Shore advertising these biscuits and I didn't want to buy anything associated with Snooki, but I eventually caved in and gave it a try. These breakfast biscuits are surprisingly delicious. I eat a pack with some Greek yogurt and it keeps me full until lunch time. Also, instead of eating a doughnut or cookie with my morning coffee, I'll reach for these biscuits and it actually goes very well with coffee.
