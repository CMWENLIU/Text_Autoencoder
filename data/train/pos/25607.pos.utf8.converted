Tender Bits are my absolute favorite food in the world, and I'm not even vegetarian. Coat them in a mixture of flour, brewer's yeast, and whatever else you want; fry them up in olive oil; and enjoy! Do whatever my grandmother does to them and you'll know why they're my favorite. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!<br /><br />I am SO HAPPY to see them on Amazon. It's hard to get my hands on these little buggers living overseas with the military.
