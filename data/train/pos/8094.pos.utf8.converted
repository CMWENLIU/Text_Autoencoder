I first had this sauce on honeymoon with my wife in Belize. There, it's on the table of every every restaurant, and with good reason, it's great! It's a little sour/salty, with just enough heat (and, as far as I can tell, not even a hint of bus station). I like it on eggs, and it goes well with beans and rice. No one shares the same taste, but this really is the authentic flavor of Belize. If you like Caribbean food, do yourself a favor, and check this out.
