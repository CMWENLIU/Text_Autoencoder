I am the mom of a recently diagnosed celiac kid.  This was my first time baking anything gluten free and I have to say this is fabulous! I made Ghirardelli chocolate chip cookies following the directions on the package, just substituting Namaste flour for the regular and they came out great! My husband cannot believe they are gluten free!  I am so happy to find this product and I will be using it in all my recipes that call for regular flour.  I threw out my bag of gold medal flour and am now confident I can bake gluten free! I can't wait to try other products from this maker.
