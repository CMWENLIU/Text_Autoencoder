When we visited New York on our many drives to the colleges our kids go to, we needed to make a pit stop to one of the local mini marts.(We needed something to travel with and spotted a bag of dirty chips.) This was the beginning of a beautiful and indulgent relationship with this mouth watering and flavorful chip! This started out as a birthday joke for my son but now, after eating many bags of this chip this relationship has grown! This chip comes in many flavors each one unique to the other, you don't know which flavors you'll be getting in the box until you open it! This brand of chip surpasses the store-brand ones.
