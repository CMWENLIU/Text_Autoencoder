Egyptian Licorice tea is my new favorite tea. It taste great, is mildly sweet with just a hint of cinammon. Also, it seems to really soothe my acid reflux which is a big plus. This tea is can be found in most health food stores and is a *must* for fans of herbal teas and those looking for a pleasant unusual tea.
