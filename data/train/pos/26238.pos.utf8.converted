Got this just a week ago so I could send hubby with better lunches for work. I love the kit. Everything in it is delicious.<br /><br />I have only one gripe. The method for making sushi rice with a pan. Skip it. Just bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to medium low and watch it. I am looking for brown rice to use for this(I know its supposed to be a no-no but they had to use something like it when they first started making sushi- white rice being a recent thing) but can't find any fat rice.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy. it takes a little getting used to and yes.. buy more Nori sheets. It runs out quick.
