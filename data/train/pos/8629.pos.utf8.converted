Great soup, seems to be hard to find over the Garden Vegetable.<br /><br />I like the Country Vegetable better, because it has a more red intense flavored broth.<br /><br />I put fresh ground pepper and a spoonful of Kraft grated Parmesan cheese into the soup BEFORE heating.  Really makes it YUMMY!!
