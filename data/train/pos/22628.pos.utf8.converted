The French cheese assortment is amazing. A selection of cheeses of a quality you cannot easily come by unless you have a great specialty gourmet store nearby. The Saint Andre is not my favorite type of cheese, but it is good on a nice loaf of crusty bread. The other cheeses in the selection are outstanding and I have received rave reviews from everyone I have served them to. Only negative is that they came extremely hot (even though they were in a cooler-type box with an ice pack that I assume had at one time been cold) and the softer cheeses were really melted. They still tasted great, but weren't as nice for presentation.
