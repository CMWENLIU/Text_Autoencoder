The name "beef chunks" didn't paint a very appetizing picture but I decided to try it anyway.  To my utter delight, I found chunks of shredded pot roast in its own juices.  I did have to skim the fat off the top which was very easy.  I made stroganoff with it and the flavor of the beef is just wonderful!! It's like home made pot roast! I took half and froze the rest but, if you are feeding a family of 4, there won't be any leftovers.  I would like to find a smaller can to feed 2.  I am trying this out for my emergency supplies and it is worthy of a place in the pantry!
