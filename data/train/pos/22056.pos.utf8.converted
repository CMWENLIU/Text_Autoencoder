This is really a great blend, very very smooth.  The Breakast Blend is considered light to medium, I would call it medium, not light for sure, but about as rich and robust as you can get in a medium.  I typically go for darks but am very pleased with this one.  Great blend, robust flavor, zero bitterness, again best word I can use is smooooth.
