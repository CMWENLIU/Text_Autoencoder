I ordered this pack after reading reviews of many other products as well and happy to say I wasn't disappointed at all. I love white chocolate so naturally I loved that flavor the best. Although I don't like dark chocolate, that too was not bad! I mean I would drink it and like it even. I wish we could customize what we wanna have in the pack though. If so I would order most of it (if not all) to be white, being the white choc fan I am. But in no way that means other flavors are bad.<br />It is sweet and true to the label (no need to add anything else other than water).
