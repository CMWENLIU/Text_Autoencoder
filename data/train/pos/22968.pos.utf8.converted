I love this!  I ordered it despite the fact that it's constantly back ordered and it didn't take long to get it.  Less than a week waiting, so don't worry about the 1-2 months wait time it says.  The price can't be beat and the quality is outstanding and very fresh (no separation at all.)  It's so tasty without any bitterness at all.  You can eat it with a spoon if you so desire, it's that tasty.  Nutty and very delicious.  I have used it in quite a few dishes and plan to make some hummus soon!
