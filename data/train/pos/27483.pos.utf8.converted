When I went on a weight-loss diet a year ago I cast about for things to eat that wouldn't break the bank calorie-wise. It turns out that the Special K protein meal bar is one of the best for that. A bar contains 180 calories, 10 grams of protein, 5 grams of dietary fiber, no cholesterol, 6 grams total fat with no trans fat. It also contains 20% of your daily requirement for calcium and for iron (based on a 2000 calorie daily diet). Plus it tastes sinfully good. I like this flavor best, but I also like the honey almond protein bar.<br /><br />This is not the only protein meal bar I eat, but it is probably the one I use most often.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
