Don't make the mistake of thinking I meant that my girlfriend eats this as well... LOL<br />The way the food is designed to help keep it in his mouth instead of all over the floor is just great. She just loves the fact that she does not have to clean up after Blaze tears through a bowl of it!<br /><br />As for flatulence... Sometimes this dog farts so loud people turn and look at me like I have some sort of problem! I stopped trying to explain that it's the breed since they usually don't stick around very long due to the horrid aroma that exudes from his anus... After switching to Royal Canin, I noticed him put on a few extra pounds of lean weight. His coat also picked up a great shine to it.<br /><br />All in all I will say the price is a little high, but you know the old saying "you get what you pay for". If you decide that a bulldog is the dog for you then at least do him a favor and get him this food!<br /><br />My dog weighs 55lbs. & is 4 yrs old<br />#30lbs usually lasts about 1 1/2 months
