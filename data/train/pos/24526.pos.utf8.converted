I've been weight training for about 6 years and in that time have used just about every major brand of protein supplement and meal supplement - EAS (Myoplex, Whey), NitroTech, Optimum Whey, MET-Rx, Designer, GNC, etc. Labrada's V60 continues to be my favorite.<br /><br />As far as flavor, the vanilla tastes as good or better than the other protein powders I've had. The chocolate is mediocre, not quite as good as Myoplex. The banana flavor...well, you might want to pass on that one. My personal recommendation would be to get the vanilla and add a small amount of chocolate or strawberry syrup, bananas or peanut butter if the flavor becomes boring.<br /><br />It mixes easily so it can be put in a shaker cup or tossed on a bowl of cereal for breakfast.<br /><br />It's not a meal replacement, and doesn't contain additional vitamins and minerals like Myoplex or ProPlete, so I wouldn't recommend it as a complete meal replacement - at very least take a multivite with it. The plus side is that this keeps the carbs and calories relatively low for consuming 60g protein (most other brands deliver around 40g protein for the same calories/carbs).<br /><br />Now whether the body can actually use 60g of protein in one dose is still up for debate. Since this is a relatively high dose of protein (assuming you're consuming 4-6 30g scoops per day), I would strongly recommend consuming a half gallon of water each day to minimize the strain this puts on the kidneys.
