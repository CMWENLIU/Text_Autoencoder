<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035A11OQ">Blue Buffalo Canned Dog Food, Beef Sirloin</a> is good stuff! We mix in a quarter of the can with some dry dog food (Blue Buffalo Adult Dog Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag and our dog loves it. Because we get four meals out of a can, this is a pretty good value. The chicken flavored wet food is pretty good too.
