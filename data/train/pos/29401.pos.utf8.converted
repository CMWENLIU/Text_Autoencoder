This yellow curry paste is FABULOUS -- vegetarian, and wonderful!  I made a SIMPLE chicken curry -- all I did was cut up a large onion, a large yam, a tablespoon of the yellow curry, and add a can of coconut milk and half a cup of water and put it on high heat, and it was ready in 30 minutes!!  WOW!!!!
