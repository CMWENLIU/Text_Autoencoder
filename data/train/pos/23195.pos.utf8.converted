This is my favorite coffee with it's charming fragrance and delicious rich smooth flavor. I use less of the coffee beans compared with my previous coffee blend (previous favorite) since this coffee is much richer and fuller bodied and smooth than any coffee I drank before. I ordered four pounds for this month already. I usually make real Espresso (pump) coffee with my Gaggia machine; but I have been using the drip method (burr grinder) since I wanted to try it out first. It is wonderful tasting just plain without milk or anything added. I did try it with milk too and it tasted good; but I prefer to drink it plain so I can taste the flavors.
