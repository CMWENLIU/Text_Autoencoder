I'm crazy about these cherries and have been for many years. Now they are<br />not available in my local stores so I have to order them here.  I sometimes just eat them by themselves, icy cold from the fridge, and I also make<br />a fantastic fruit salad with pineapple and mandarin oranges, miniature marshmallows, mayonnaise and orange flavored yogurt. They come as close as possible to the wonderful fresh Rainier cherries that are only available about one month of the year at about $8 a pound.  And Oregon Fruit, produced in the USA, is as good as it gets!
