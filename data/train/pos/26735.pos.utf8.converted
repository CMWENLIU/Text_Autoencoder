When Science Diet changed their recipe to 'natural' my cat (a chocolate point siamese) started throwing up a lot - like twice a week.<br /><br />I ended up switching to Royal Canin special 33 (about 2yrs ago) and he hasn't had any issues.<br /><br />worth the extra money to not have to clean catpuke all the time.
