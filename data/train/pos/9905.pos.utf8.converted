As one of many Americans trying to make healthier life choices in my food, Nana's cookies have been a wonderful treat without the guilt and bad effects of sugar, and gluten.  The cookies are moist and almost cake-like and sweetened with fruit juice, though the rich and vibrant flaver does not give this away.  The ginger and lemon cookies will fool even the most sophisticated cookie palate.  Give them a try and treat yourself to a healthy dessert you can enjoy without feeding your body excess sugar, carbs, and processed chemicals.  It is all natural ingredients, with a wonderfully sinful flavor.<br /><br />Kristin, mother of 3, Arizona
