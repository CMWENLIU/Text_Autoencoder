One of the things mothers are really good at is oatmean (or cream of wheat).  It was so much the salvation of my misspent pre-adolescence that I still often experience spontaneous regression when eating it - with raisins, brown sugar, and milk thank you!  It was only much later that I discovered that there was an expensive, gourmet version of my cheap old breakfast.  Expensive here, I mean.  If you are across the ocean they only get this kind of money in posh hotels.<br /><br />Even though that be the case, steel cut, old fashioned oatmeal really has a taste and texture of its own one worth pursuing if you want to have your comfort food and luxuriate in it at the same time.  You can make darned good cookies out of it too.  I'm not addicted to this, but it adds a little variety and comes with all the innate healthiness that oats seem to have.
