I have 2 labs and one is extremely allergic; these dog cookies are rated well with the Whole Dog Journal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DUD6WE">The Whole Dog Journal's Guide to Optimum Dog Care: Good Eats</a> - they have a monthly newsletter as well - the ingredients are whole and healthy and there is no chicken, which is really hard to find - my dog is allergic to chicken, eggs, beef, peanuts ... and he's on a grain-free diet - these cookies have oatmeal which is fine for him - so it's very hard to find a healthy dog cookie that works with his allergies and both dogs love them.
