I recently switched from Splenda to Stevia.  I purchased Sweetleaf sugar packets with fiber, which are great, and now decided to try a flavored drop.  This one is very good!  Nice orange flavor, almost like a mandarin rather than an orange, and again, just like the packet, no aftertaste.  Very good, makes me want to try other flavors.  I only put 2-3 drops per 16oz, no more.  With Sweetleaf stevia, seems less is more, otherwise, you may get bitter taste.  Why did I switch from Splenda?  Turns out Splenda's glycemic index, a measure of the effects of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels, is higher than sugar!
