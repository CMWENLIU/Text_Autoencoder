I ordered four ONE POUND bags of this product and was extremely impressed by the way it was packaged. Very tightly packaged with very thick plastic. None of it had spilled or leaked during shipping. Furthermore, the product worked great for my project (tanning some animal skins). The price was right too. Barry Farms does a terrific job. I will certainly continue to order this and other products of theirs in the future. This was my first order with them, and I certainly will recommend them to others.
