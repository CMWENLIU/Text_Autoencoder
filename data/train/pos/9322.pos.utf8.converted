This mix IS amazing.  I was interested in lowering the calories a bit, so I substituted plain, non-fat yogurt in place of the oil and used the regular oven method.  It worked perfectly.  I like to use English Muffin rings and make 12 buns at a time.  Each bun turns out to be about 120 calories.  Perfect!
