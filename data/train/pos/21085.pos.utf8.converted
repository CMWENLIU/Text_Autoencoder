Reading the other reviews of this product is fascinating.  Bugs?  Dust?  Gooey messes?  Allergic reactions? My experience with Swheat Scoop has been, happily, quite different.  Heretofore, I've used clumping clay-based litters, most recently Arm & Hammer brand.  With all of them, though, I've observed that they are very dusty when being poured into the litter box, that they cake onto the cats' feet and are tracked through the house, and that they do little to mask the odor of urine or feces.  By contrast, Swheat Scoop has none of these drawbacks.<br /><br />After using a 15-pound box for the first time with two cats, I have observed that:<br /><br />- There is minimal tracking out of the litter box, and what there is is easily swept up, unlike clay litter which, when wet, sticks to the tile floor.<br /><br />- There is only a pleasant, natural odor which completely absorbs all urine and feces odors, making the litter box room much more pleasant.<br /><br />- There is no evidence of any dust whatsoever, even when pouring from the container into the litter box.<br /><br />- Clumping is satisfactory.  Sheat Scoop does not clump as tightly as clumping clay litters but is still easily scooped out of the litter box with a scoop designed for that purpose.  It does not adhere to the sides or the bottom of the litter box as clay litter does, and the box has stayed much, much cleaner than when it was filled with clay litter.  I realize that this directly contradicts some other reviewers' comments, but it is what I have observed.<br /><br />- Again in contradiction to several other reviewers' observations, no weevils or any other insect life form infested the box of Swheat Scoop.  It was perfectly lifeless!<br /><br />- Although the instructions advise acclimating cats to the new litter by putting a layer of the old litter to which they are accustomed on top, I switched the litter completely and suddenly, and both cats took to the Swheat Scoop immediately.  They had no adjustment problems whatsoever.<br /><br />- The instructions also advise that some household pets may look upon the wheat content as food and try to consume the litter.  However, my omnivorous canine, who would eat himself into oblivion if opportunity permitted, has never once attempted to nibble on the litter.<br /><br />In short, this is the cleanest, best-smelling, and most effective cat litter I have ever come across, and both cats took to it immediately.  I am thoroughly pleased with its appearance, odor, cleanliness, and performance. (And I can't believe that I'm actually writing a review of kitty litter, but this product is worth it!)  I'm not discounting the negative experiences which some other reviewers have reported, but I cannot explain them unless there are environmental conditions at work.  My first box of Swheat Scoop was purchased and used in semi-arid states low in humidity and with pretty low winter temperatures.  Were I in a wetter, warmer southern state, perhaps my experience and satisfaction with Swheat Scoop would have been different.
