We have visited one Christkindlmarkt after another in Germany, Austria and Prague, savoring the incomparable experience of sipping Gluhwein in the bitter cold. This package is the closest we have come to duplicating the authentic taste in the simplest fashion: just adding water, sugar and wine to this amazing spice bag. Unless you really wish to hunt up all the ingredients and try to get the balance right on your own, buy this wonderful ready-made packet.
