I was told to minimize my gluten intake, so I bought this cookie mix but with very low expectations for how they would taste.  They are YUMMY though!  The mix calls for margarine, but I used butter.  The next time I make them I might add in some more mini chips, but they really are delicious as is.  I think they were even better the day after I made them -- they have a rich texture which was almost like a peanut butter cookie.  I think even people who don't restrict their wheat/gluten intake would really like these.
