Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.
