I received this Bamboo Gift Set from my daughter-in-law for Christmas.  When I had my first cup of tea and saw the flower open I was amazed.  How did they do that?  There is an interesting web site that explains it all.  I would highly recommend this for anyone.  I have ordered one for my daughter for Valentine's Day.  I am sure she will love it also.
