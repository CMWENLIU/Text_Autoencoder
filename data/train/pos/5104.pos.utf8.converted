Okay I bought this because I was craving some fish curry like my Mum used to make. I have to tell you it came close. For the less culinarily (is that a real word??) gifted like me, it is god-sent. Cook the fish, add water and paste and viola you have fish curry.<br /><br />For those of you who swear by making their own curry paste from scratch, please contact me so I can come over :)
