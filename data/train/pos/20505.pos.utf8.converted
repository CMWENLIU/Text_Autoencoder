This product is extremely good, using vanilla beans instead of vanilla extract in your desserts makes a big difference, I love this pods, they have a very nice aroma. The size of the pods is pretty decent most of them are between 7-8 inches and I got 112 pods in my bag. I separated them in groups of 5, vacuum seal them and storage them in a dark and dry place, they keep fresh as the first day in that way.<br />After you used the seeds for a pastry cream or any other preparation you can wash the pods and let them dry on top of your refri when they are dry you can pulverize them and use it to flavor sponge cakes or genoise.
