I love Cheerwine.  I don't drink sodas very often, but I make an exception to enjoy Cheerwine whenever I find it.  It's got a great cherry taste and very refreshing.  Note this, however:  the formula they use in the plastic bottles contains high fructose corn syrup, whereas the formula for the glass bottles uses real sugar.  I prefer the glass bottles (b/c of the real sugar and b/c glass bottles preserve carbonation longer than plastic bottles).  That's it!
