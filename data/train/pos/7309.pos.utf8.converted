I love to cook wholesome, homemade foods for my family so it made perfect sense when I decided to make my son's first foods rather than purchasing them ready-made. This task wasn't the easiest; having to steam in a pot, then swapping the (hot, mind you) fruits or veggies into the blender or food processor creating way too many dishes. An endeavor with the best intentions turned into several all-day affairs - not that it wasn't worth it.<br /><br />When it was my daughter's turn a few years later to start her first foods, I did my research into other options. I still wanted to make her foods from scratch as much as possible, but needed a better system than the multiple appliances I used the last time. Enter the Baby Brezza. i was remarkably impressed by the 5-star reviews as well as the introduction videos. I compared it to the Beaba Babycook machine and the Baby Brezza came out on top every time. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and I am in LOVE with this machine. Easy prep, hearty steaming, smooth purees and easy clean up. Best of all, it allows me a lot more free time while still feeding my baby the best foods possible. Best part of all, it's under $100!<br /><br />Between this and any other system, I would choose this a million times over.
