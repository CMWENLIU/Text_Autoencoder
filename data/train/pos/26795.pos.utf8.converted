Thanks Kong!  Now my cat is a nip addict!  Normally, my fat, lazy, orange tabby wants three things out of life:  something to eat, a warm place to sleep, and someone to rub his sweet face and fat belly.  I can't believe how he goes NUTS for this stuff!  I've never seen him so playful!  This must be some seriously psychedelic stuff from a feline perspective.
