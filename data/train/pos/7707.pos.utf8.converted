If you are looking for cayenne pepper that really packs a punch, this is it.  I have been taking cayenne to try and improve blood circulation to my hands and feet.  I have Type 1 diabetes and am concerned about the long term effects of this disease.  Honestly I hate taking this stuff, but I definitely feel the benefits I am looking for, not sure if it is improved blood circulation or the anti-inflammatory properties of cayenne....or if these 2 properties go hand in hand, but my hands, feet and overall body condition feels consistently better (except for the discomfort of the first 20 minutes) when I take my daily morning dose.<br /><br />Here is what I do.  I put about an inch of warm water in a glass, add about a teaspoon of honey, then I add about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, then add about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (90K SHU), stir and....gulp!<br /><br />I only use a little bit of water so that I can gulp it down.  The honey and the lemon juice mask some of the power of the pepper.  I have heard that you build up a tolerance to this stuff...I have been taking this for about a month now, daily, and I have not been able to move beyond a 1/4 teaspoon without painful consequences.<br /><br />Good luck in your pursuit of health!
