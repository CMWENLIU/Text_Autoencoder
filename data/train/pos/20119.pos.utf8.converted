La Tortilla Factory products offer a great healthy way to enjoy your Mexican favorites. You can buy these locally in many supermarkets. They make several different types, both large and small.<br /><br />Unlike other lower calorie tortillas, these have great taste, and are soft and flexible.  They make great breakfast burritos using Soyrizo and 2% cheese. A large wrap with Eggbeaters, .5 oz of 2% cheese and 1 oz of Soy Chorizo comes in at about 270 calories. Some large wraps alone are about 200 calories.<br /><br />The great thing about these wraps, is that even the family members who are not concerned with the nutrition think that they taste great.
