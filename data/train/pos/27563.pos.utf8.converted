I just received these as a birthday gift from my sister.  The strawberries were perfectly fresh, juicy, and sweet.  They were dipped perfectly and completely coated in delicious chocolate.  I was SO impressed!  She ordered them yesterday and I received them today.  They came nicely wrapped with birthday ribbon and packaged with a "freezer" or cold pak.  Again, I would highly recommend these as a delicious treat.  They are expensive, but well worth the SPECIAL treat for someone!
