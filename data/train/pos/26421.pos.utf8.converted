Very delicious Tuna.  I choose the LIGHT variety as it contains less mercury than the ALBACORE or WHITE.  It is very delicious and the fact that it is sustainably caught makes it so worth the extra cost.  With subscribe and save, the cost actually isn't much more than brands found at most grocery stores - but the quality is so much better!!!
