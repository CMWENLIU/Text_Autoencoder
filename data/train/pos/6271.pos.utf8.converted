I ordered this soup from an online low carb retailer, and I love it. Its the best soup I think I've ever had. It doesn't taste low carb or diet at all. If you like cheese,and you like Mexican, you will love this soup. I've been eating it everyday and I never tire of it. It is smooth, creamy, delicious.
