To mark the 70th anniversary of our favorite family movie, the PEZ candy folks have created a really keen collectible: a pack of eight OZ-related Pez dispensers, including all the '39 film's major characters, plus Toto, Glinda and the giant green head of "the great and powerful Wizard of Oz!"<br /><br />I saw this curio yesterday afternoon in my local WINN DIXIE grocery store, was intrigued by the fine reproductions and ALMOST bought it, but sadly it took years for me to beat that Pez addiction and the --last-- thing I need right now is cravings for brick-shaped, artificially flavored and colored pieces of sugar. Plus, how would it look for this old woman to reach shakily into her handbag and indiscreetly administer a sucrose fix from the mouth of the Wicked Witch of the West?<br /><br />All joking aside, this well-made, attractive collectible is an item that's sure to increase in value, is one that Classic Movie fans should own, and for all OZ devotees, why it's, shall we say... indispensible?  (wink)
