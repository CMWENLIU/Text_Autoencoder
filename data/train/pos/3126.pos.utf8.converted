These are fabulous for kids' and husband lunches!  They're fast for the kids to heat and have a hot meal, but if you're packing them for your husband, you might toss in two of these or include a sandwich.  They're not huge, about 3/4 cup in size, so that's not that much for a manly appetite.  They're really good too, surprisingly enough, and the value for the money is nice.  Not too salty either, like soup has been lately.  And honestly, with the cost of soup these days, this stuff fills you up more and costs the same. Recommend!
