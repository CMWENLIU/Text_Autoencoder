I have been a fan of Zevia since they first came out a few years ago and before they could market themselves as a food product due to stevia's status at the time. Now that stevia is approved by the FDA as a food additive, many more things are coming out with it. I refuse to eat foods with chemical sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and ace K that all of the major diet sodas use. I applaud Zevia for being ahead of the curve on choosing natural stevia instead. Dr. Zevia is my favorite flavor--I want caffeine in my soda, but don't like the flavor of the cola as much as Dr. Zevia, so I was extremely happy when they came out with this flavor. Truly a no-guilt treat!
