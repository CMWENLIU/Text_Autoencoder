This honey WORKS!<br />More than taste...<br />It is really hard to find honey that truly has all the good "raw honey benefits".<br />Many, many beekeepers feed bees sugar water.<br />I contacted Stakich.....they do not feed their bees sugar water.<br />What matters for me most is how it works for me.<br />I have nearly comsumed my first 5 lb. jar.<br />I don't take it every day.  I am on a medication for arthritis that suppresses my immune system.<br />I have found that when I have a sore throat...or what feels like a cold or a "starting to get sick" feeling..that I can take a big spoon of this honey....maybe through out the day a total of 2 or 3 big spoons...and then perhaps some the second day.....and I am feeling good again...<br />I woke up in the night with a "fluey" feeling, and my stomach somewhat in a turmoil....I took a heaping soupspoon of Stakich honey, and it seemed to instantly soothe my stomach. That was last night, and I am feeling pretty good today....just going about the day as usual!  But my honey supply was getting low, so I just ordered another 5 lb. jar...I really don't want to be without it...IT WORKS, and that is what is important to me!
