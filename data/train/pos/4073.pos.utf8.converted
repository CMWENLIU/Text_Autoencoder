Since being diagnosed with Celiac's disease I have had a hard time adjusting to the gluten free lifestyle.  This pasta really helps.  In fact, I like it better than "regular" pasta!  And that is high praise as I have not been able to say that I like any gluten free products more than their gluten-filled counter parts (but I haven't tried all the products yet!) This pasta has a creamy, smooth texture. It is wonderful!
