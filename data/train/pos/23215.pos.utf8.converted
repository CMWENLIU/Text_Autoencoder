I love hemp. I am a vegan college student and find it really difficut to eat enough while taking six classes and wasting my life away doing homework. Having such an accessable form of protein, minerals, and essential fatty acids is nice (3 tbsp. = 22% protein DRI!!) No other food can claim that while being super-digestable. Flax seeds go right through, hemp is easily digested. It has an interesting taste, somewhere between sunflower, almond, and pine nuts. It is good.
