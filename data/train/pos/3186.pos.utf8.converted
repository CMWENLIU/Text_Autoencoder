This tea is just like you will find at the Thai restaurant. I find it best to brew in the coffee maker, making it very strong and adding water to it later. I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day!
