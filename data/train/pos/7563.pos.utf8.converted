I was hesitant to order halvah long-distance instead of buying locally. So many times in my experience, I find that the product can be old and seriously dried out (it probably doesn't move very quickly here in the Midwest). But when I received this order from parthenonfoods.com, and immediately opened it, I was absolutely delighted at the product's FRESHNESS and deliciousness! I'll be ordering again soon from these folks. It's a pleasure to have found a vendor whose product quality I can trust. These folks deserve your attention!
