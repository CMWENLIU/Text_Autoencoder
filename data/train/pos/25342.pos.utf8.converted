I much prefer the taste of skinless sardines to tuna fish - they are milder and meatier and less "fishy".  Plus they lack the mercury content of tuna.  This has always been the brand I purchased at my Whole Foods store (for $2.79 per can), so I thought all sardines were pretty much the same.  My husband recently picked up two cans at the local Stop and Shop (King Oscar) and what a shock to my system.  For one, they still had the skin and TAILS on.  Two, the taste was more tinny than fish and the texture gritty.  I won't even open the other can.  Crown Prince quality and taste is far superior, and Amazon has them at a better price.
