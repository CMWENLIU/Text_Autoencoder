This lard is the BEST lard that you could EVER... wait... hold on a second... you can write up a review for lard?  Wow.  Really?  Isn't that kind of weird?  I mean... it's lard.  Internet lard.  What else do you really want to know?  Okay, fine, how about... probably you should avoid eating it directly from the package.  There.  Review for lard completed.  Have a nice day.
