If you don't want to have to buy a 50 pounfd box of Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon from questionable soruces on Ebay, then this is the next best thing.  Makara is just their branded name.  Korintje Cinnamon is a strong and aromatic cinnamon that comes very close to the Cinnabon's Makara brand.  There are many types of "cinnamon" and they all come from the bark of trees in the same basic family.  The strongest cinnamon you can buy is Vietnamese extra strength but that's more in the red hots flavor range.  if you are looking for a good strong cinnamon to m akes sweet pastires with - this is your best bet.  Pampered Chef uses this type and so do a number of other gorumet sources.  Try it!  At least you won't have 49.99 pounds of Makara cinnamon sitting on your shelf when you are done!
