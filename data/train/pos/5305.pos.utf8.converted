I used to drink Vita Coco like a coffee drinker drinks a daily cup because I do lots of hot yoga. I need the potassium. I've also tried Zuco and Blue Monkey.<br /><br />Then I was traveling on vacation in Chicago and spotted this in the organic aisle because they don't sell this in my area. I was hooked. Best on the market hands down. I have had with pulp and without. I prefer with the pulp. More bang for the buck.<br /><br />And when they say "Happiness Inside" it's true. I was thinking this not knowing it said it on the can. I started to laugh when I discovered it was labeled on the top of the can. I'm sure the integrity of the taste is kept more pure because it's a can. Boxed juice taste different.<br /><br />And I can say this is my first amazon subscription to ANY product. I never commit to a monthly reorder system. This stuff is so good. But don't take my word for it. Try it out. I think you'll be hooked.
