EDITED TO ADD 3/18/2012: Still using this wonderful litter. My 7-month-old kitten uses it, my two-year-old Siamese and my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair. We have two of the special sifting litter boxes made by the third-party company which makes them for Feline Pine. That is the only way to use Feline Pine, in my opinion, because it is so easy to use that way. Love this litter!<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD 2/10/2010: This is my new favorite cat litter. It does not track. It smells of fresh, natural, wood scent - no added scents, nothing artificial. It has a special litter box made by a third party for Feline Pine that you can buy to sift and separate the fresh granules from the used sawdust. Call the company, Feline Pine, and ask them for details on how to buy their litter box and they will tell you how to order one. I was concerned because my vet said cats have trouble digging in it. In reality, they don't dig at all to urinate, or they dig very little and they defecate on top of it, which is easily removed.<br /><br />Get the sifting litter box, made by a company specifically for this litter, and tilt the box back and forth, sifting the litter once or twice a day to remove any "sawdust" from the top level--this will shift the sawdust to the bottom level of the two-level box. Use the box as directed for best results.<br /><br />I have never been so happy with a litter system in my life. It has made life very easy. No more dusty litter everywhere. No more small clay granules tracking all over the house. (Note: the litterbox is denoted as "self cleaning" but it really is not; however, it is so easy! All you do is tilt it side to side and sift.)<br /><br />I have found my litter. I am 100% happy with this litter, COMBINED with their litter box.<br /><br />How to switch your cats to this litter: Put one inch of this litter on top of your current litter. Let your cats dig into it and mix it up as they use both litters in the same box. Gradually increase the quantity of this litter used and lessen the quantity of your old brand. I switched an 18-year-old cat to this litter!<br /><br />A NOTE ABOUT PINE OIL:  There is no toxic pine oil in Feline Pine cat litter. Many people think of pine oil in products like Pine Sol, which contains phenol, which *is* highly toxic to cats. I contacted the company prior to using this product. I received this assurance:<br /><br />"The production of our Feline Pine products incorporates both kiln-drying at 380 degrees (bakes out oils, phenols, and hydrocarbons) and pressurization (10,000 foot-pounds squeezes out further compounds) before the product reaches its packaging."<br /><br />"Our litters are completely natural and contain zero chemicals or artificial fragrances."<br /><br />My vet, who has a cats-only vet clinic, and who has treated my 18-year-old cat since he was a kitten, highly recommends this litter.<br /><br />~~~~~<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I initially tried this out with a litter of four rescued three-week-old kittens and their mother. It doesn't track and is big enough that the kittens don't try to eat it.  If the kittens sample it, it won't hurt their digestive tracts like clay clumping litter could. Downside: It is hard for kittens to dig in as the granules are so big.<br /><br />After the granules are broken down, they are easier for your cat to dig, as they turn into sawdust.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Low to zero tracking<br />* Produces zero dust<br />* No odor - excellent odor control<br />* Safe for kittens and cats of all ages<br />* Flushable<br />* Turns into sawdust after it is urinated on; and then it is easy for cats to dig in<br />* NOTE: Feline Pine now makes a clumping form of this litter; it is a separate product<br />* Lasts a really long time before you need to change it<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Large granules make digging harder for cats (the vet said this but I didn't find it to be a problem)<br />* Doesn't cover poop well when it is in granule form. (However, I scoop poop up quickly)<br />(However, if you leave your Feline Pine in the box to turn to sawdust, it *will* cover poop.)<br />* Is not a clumping litter (but Feline Pine now makes a clumping version of this litter!) This is the granules version; see the clumping version if you prefer that kind.<br /><br />NOTE: This Feline Pine "granules" is not a clumping litter.  (But they now make a clumping litter version of this product if you want to try it.)  For the granules version, once those large granules of wood are urinated on, it turns into dry sawdust.  It doesn't clump and is hard to scoop because the dry sawdust mixes with the granules.  It will stay dry for quite awhile -- a few days or a week or two -- depending on how many cats you have.  The best way to clean this litter is to remove all of it and put in new litter.<br /><br />The great thing about the granules is, zero tracking. And it really covers the urine smell.  If you want to scoop, try Feline Pine's clumping litter. I prefer this to Feline Pine's clumping litter, as the clumping litter doesn't clump very well and it still tracks.<br /><br />To get your cats accustomed to this litter, read and follow the instructions on the bag.  It is very important to put a layer of at least one inch of your old litter on top of this new litter, or your cat will probably not accept this litter. Please be patient with your cat during the transition.<br /><br />The litter granules are made of Southern Pine. Tree farmers periodically have to thin some of the smaller trees to let in sunlight, which makes the forest healthier.  Those smaller pine trees are used in these types of renewable products. This is an eco-friendly choice in cat litter.<br /><br />My vet said cats find it hard to dig in.  I agree, but once the granules are broken down by urination, cats find it easier to dig.  Swheat Scoop ... I plan to give that one a try next time. UPDATE: Actually, I did, but I think I prefer Feline Pine, plus now Feline Pine has come out with a scoopable version. I plan on mixing the two: the Feline Pine granules with the Feline Pine scoopable, as I'd like to scoop but also like the no-tracking granules.
