This thick, rich chocolate syrup is so delicious and satisfying.  I have been dieting for a month and have lost 21 pounds.  I am basically following a low glycemic diet and having this chocolate treat has been wonderful!  Just a spoonfull right out of the jar is such a treat.  It is also very good drizzled over strawberries or other fruit and I also mix it into my 8 year old son's milk for a wonderfully healthy chocolate milk.  It takes longer to stir into cold milk than the other syrups made for cold milk, but it does slowly dissolve and my son loves that some sticks to the spoon and he gets to lick the spoon after he drinks his milk!  Haven't tried it in warm milk yet, but I know it will make amazing hot chocolate as well.  Can't say enough good about this Chocagave!
