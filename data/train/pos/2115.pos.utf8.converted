I make these whole grain brownies even healthier by substituting non-fat Greek yogurt for the butter and substituting prune juice for the water called for on the box.  I also add an extra egg and chopped pecans to the mix.  When I make them this way, my husband--who usually hates anything whole grain--loves them.
