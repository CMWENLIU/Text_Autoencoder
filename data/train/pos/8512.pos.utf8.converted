These mushrooms are SO full of flavor!  Just add a handful to about a cup of very hot water and cover for about 20  minutes.  The broth they create after rehydrating is so rich.  It doesn't take alot of these to enhance anything you're cooking, from stews, to soups to sauces.  The jars are also great for storing them until they're gone.  NOTE:  Be sure to swish any dried mushrooms well, in the liquid, because there can be grit in dried mushrooms.  Let it settle to the bottom after you've rehydrated them and leave it behind when you pour off the broth.
