I first had President Butter in France; but when the one grocer in the Kansas City area I knew of stopped carrying the butter, I was disappointed.  On a lark I searched Amazon, found and ordered several packages.  With shipping, it was a little pricey but the butter arrived still frozen and I am delighted to know I can still get President butter - once you try it, nothing else will do.
