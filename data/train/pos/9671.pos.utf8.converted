Of the two that I have already made, this was difinatly the best.  Has great color and very nice flavor.  You get everything in this kit.  This and the other wine I ordered made me decide to try two other ones that I am putting together as we speak.  I dont think you can go wrong with this wine if you like Reds especially.
