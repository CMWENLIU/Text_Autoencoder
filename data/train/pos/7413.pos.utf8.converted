After trying Chimes in the smaller store bought bags, I found a new treat I love.<br /><br />The Mango pairs nicely with the Ginger in these chewy little candies. The sweetness smooths the spicy side of the ginger leaving me with a happy mouth. (And nice breath as an added bonus). I usually enjoy one or two a day as I tend to suck on them not chew them, thus they last quite a while. The 5 pound box drops the price in half, making the price for 5 oz about $1.80. (Fortunately for easier storage, the chews come in one larger bag not individual 5 oz bags.)<br /><br />I have found if I have one when I get 'hungry' after dinner, it fills the dessert void and helps keep me out of the fridge and pantry. I just tuck in the side of my mouth and the flavor keeps my mind and mouth busy enough to keep my no eating after 8pm rule in check. At 4 carbs, Zero fat and 16 calories, I can keep myself on track.
