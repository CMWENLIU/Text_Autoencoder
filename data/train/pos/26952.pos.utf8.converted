I've had some good crystalized ginger and some bad. This might be the best ever!<br />Uniform size pieces, no stringy un-chewable pieces thrown in to ad weight. I stored them in an airtight container and they never seemed to dry out, though they didn't really have to long to wait till they were eaten. I"m making my second purchase now and plan to make another when I run out again.
