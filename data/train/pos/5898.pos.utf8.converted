My wife and I love these glasses. We have a large selection of Riedel products and these Single Malt glasses are of the same quality. I briefly considered the 'Sommelier' edition of the same glasses and while I'm sure they are fantastic I do not find that the Vinum series is lacking anything.<br /><br />As long as your buying scotch at $50+/bottle why not drink it out of a nice glass?
