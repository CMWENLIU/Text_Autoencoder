I am passionate about good coffee, and I've traveled around the world and been fortunate to taste the coffees of many lands. There are great coffees in Italy, Kenya, Ethiopia, Colombia, and many other countries, but in the USA there is no finer coffee than French Market Coffee & Chicory. I've been drinking this for over 40 years and it is a staple in my home. It never disappoints, and I always get unsolicited rave reviews from guests about the coffee I brew.<br /><br />There are a couple of things you should know. Even though this is a blend of coffee & chicory, it makes a robust pot of coffee. Pay attention to the advice that's printed on the lid of every can: "Use 1/3 to 1/2 as much coffee as you would normally use to brew a pot." My standard recipe these days is 2 level scoops per 8 cups of water for an automatic drip brewer, but if your coffee maker will take 10 or 12 cups of water, I'd still recommend using just 2 level scoops; then adjust to your own taste.<br /><br />You get great value from a can of French Market coffee. The can is 16 oz., not 12 oz. like many other cans on your grocer's shelf. And by using only 2 level scoops per pot, that can will last for weeks.<br /><br />The company that makes French Market coffee was acquired by another New Orleans-based company, but I trust that they will respect the heritage and tradition of this great New Orleans brand. Try French Market coffee and see if you agree with me that it's simply the best.
