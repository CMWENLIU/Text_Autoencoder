This is my favorite wheat-free bread mix. It bakes into a semi-dense, *very* tasty loaf with a toasty color. The crust is light and chewy! My wheat-eating friends and family love this bread even compared to the wheaty varieties out there.<br /><br />It's a tad expensive and you have to get your own yeast for the 4-pound size. I bake a loaf in a bread machine once or twice a week with 10 minutes of kneading, 70 minutes of rising followed immediately by an hour of baking, and although the results vary a bit on humid or dry days, the fresh bread is always delicious.
