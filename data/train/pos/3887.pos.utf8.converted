Whether or not it's right for you is up to you and your pediatrician to decide. We began adding it to our son's formula at 2 months because of health related issues. We currently use 1 scoop (scoop from Gerber formula can) of rice to 2 scoops of formula, and 4-5 oz of water. It mixes exceptionally well and is not "goopy" nor does it leave "rice-sludge" at the bottom of the bottle after feeding.<br />We love this, and buy it over the box cereal every time now. Even our daycare has commented on how much they like this over the traditional flakes of rice cereal. The can fits better in the pantry than the box, and is much cleaner since it isn't leaking flakes from the corners and the fold down spout. The cans stack easily, and are the same size and shape as Gerber's formula cans.<br />We initially purchased this from my wife's work, and when they ran out we switched back to box rice. It's cheaper from Amazon than it is at the local grocery stores. We're switching back to the can.<br /><br />Pros<br />-It contains DHA to boost development.<br />-Dissolves better; its more of a powder than the flakes you get in the box of Gerber rice cereal.<br />-Because it dissolves better it is easier for the infant to drink, and easier to clean the bottle after feeding (large undissolved flakes don't clog the bottle).<br />-Packaging is much cleaner than the boxes of rice cereal available from Gerber.<br /><br />Cons<br />-It's not Vegan (if you care, I don't, but some other posters obviously do).<br />-It does not come with a scoop. This is only a very minor inconvenience, as we, like the other poster, used the scoop from the can of Gerber formula that we use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
