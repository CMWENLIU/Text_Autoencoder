If you enjoy a very fiull  bodied coffee without the "burntness" of espresso, try this.  Shared it with my sister the coffee/ Bustelo fan and she really fell for the non- bitter, strong brew from my drip pot.  Makes great ice coffee too. This coffee was a great break from the Starbucks and 8 o'Clock I had been drinking. Price is $2/ per package cheaper than my local market on Amazon
