I bought these cacao nibs to make chocolate. I actually considered buying already roasted nibs but this product's price is way better so i just ordered this product and roasted it myself (it is easy). This product makes great chocolate. Like another reviewer said 1 serving of of these nibs contains 314% of our daily need of iron, however as far as I am aware of, according to FDA there is no health concerns associated with iron consumption. In short this is a great product for anyone who wants to make their own chocolate. One small problem is the amount of bean shells, I needed to pick them by hand (to make smoother chocolate), if it was possible to put them in water most of those shells would float on surface I believe, however I wasn't sure if it was okay to wash nibs before roasting so I just handpicked...
