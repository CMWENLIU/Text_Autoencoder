I've purchased this product several times in the past and the taste is excellent.  I have used many brands and this is my favorite.  It has none of the sting and aftertaste of some of the other extra virgin olive oils.  The price is excellent.  It has a rich buttery flavor which I find very agreeable.  It must be refrigerated if stored for any period of time due to the fact that olive oil will turn rancid due to heat.  I use a dark green bottle to dispense what I plan to use in a short time to avoid light which affects taste.  It is an excellent product for medicinal purposes as well.  I've found that extra virgin olive oil is particularly useful for the treatment of diabetes.  The anti-oxidents in it allow the body's cells to absorb insulin much easier which lowers blood sugar.  Mixed with fresh garlic this effect is increased even more.  This brand can be consumed by itself much easier due to its very mild taste.  Some of the other brands tend to leave a nasty after-bite that is very uncomfortable.  I will not mention the other brands as this would not be fair to them.  I'm sure each brand of olive oil has it's own following due to the taste preferences of the person who is using it.  I highly recommend this brand but I wish the price had not increased by such a large amount.  It is still a good value though.
