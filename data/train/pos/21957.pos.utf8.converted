I have been a tea drinker all my life (loose tea, not teabags), and this to me is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted. I have bought this Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey for years and despite occasionally trying a different brand, a different supplier, I am always coming back to this one.<br /><br />The best I can describe it is: It is balanced. Not too strong a bergamot taste, but not too much plain tea taste either. I would also describe it as elegant and delicate. I find Earl Greys that do not strike this fine balance to be either bland/flat or overpowering, in any case one-dimensional. To my taste buds, this one is perfect and has just the right amount of both key ingredients.<br /><br />Here are my tips to enjoy this tea to the fullest. I apologize if some of this seems self-evident, but I have encountered so many people who just did not know enough about tea, and then blamed it on the product that I want to make sure I am mentioning the key points:<br /><br />1. Storage<br />I keep my tea in the bag that it originally came in inside the box, and also clip it shut to preserve the aroma. When it comes to tea, it is critical to keep it away from light and to keep the storage container tightly shut. Also try to use up your tea in a reasonable amount of time or it will eventually go flat and old.<br /><br />2. Brewing<br />Use about 1 teaspoon per cup, and if you can, use filtered water (such as Brita-filtered, etc.). Then brew your tea with boiling water! And I mean boiling, not almost boiling.<br /><br />If you want to do it perfectly, give the tea leaves plenty of space - tea eggs are not the best choice to get the most flavorful taste. Ideally you will want to let the leaves float freely in the pot and then, after steeping, pour the tea through a strainer. But large tea filters also work.
