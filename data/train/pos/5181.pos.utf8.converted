My daughter visited Ireland a couple of years ago. She loved everything about the country, including the food. I ordered this in November for her as a Christmas gift, not thinking that the items would all be fresh in order to be the best. My fault for not looking closer. I've bought Hickory Farms for years and their stuff is processed to last forever...fresh is better, but when you spend this much for one meal you should be aware that it is not something you can save fresh for a special occasion.<br /><br />They might want to put a line in the description letting people know the shelf life is not that long. It has to be eaten within a short period after you get it or frozen. Don't order too far in advance for a gift.<br /><br />Very fast shipping. Everything is as shown. The food arrives fresh, packed in ice. We're having our traditional Irish breakfast on Saturday before Thanksgiving instead of Christmas morning. Everything looks great. I'm sure it will be wonderful.
