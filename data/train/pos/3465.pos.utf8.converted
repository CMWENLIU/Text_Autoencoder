Both of our cats love this!<br /><br />I have paid special attention to the ingredients list and have been pleased to find that it does not include corn products or byproducts.  Sadly, most cat foods on the market have corn as their first, second, or third ingredient.  Sometimes it is both the second AND third ingredient (corn meal and another corn byproduct, etc.).  I wish I had known this fact a long time ago.  I have recently been looking for a healthier choice for my two cats and even the ones that state that they are a healthy alternative tend to contain ingredients that I would question and in amounts that are alarming.  This is the ONLY cat food at my market that does not contain corn as a main ingredient and it seems the healthiest alternative.  I have tried (through Amazon) other alternatives that are just as healthy, but sadly my cats did not like the taste.  This one they adore.<br /><br />Healthy and tasty.  I couldn't ask for more.
