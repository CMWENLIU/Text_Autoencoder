This is my third child andd I have been concerned about milk production since about day one, due to him not seeming satisfied for very long after a nursing session. I was pumping about 2-3 ounces at a time, but if he took a bottle of expressed milk, he would end up eating 4-5 ounces. After the first day of drinking this tea 3 times, I was able to pump at least 5 ounces, if not 6. I am returning to work in a month and will continue to drink this in order to assure my supply is adequate when we are separated. And I am not one to rely upon herbal remedies, or even really think they work in most cases, but this really did!
