NongShim Neoguri Spicy Seafood Udon Type Noodle is my third Nongshim noodle that I've tried and love (I have tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQORDE">Nong Shim Shin Noodle Ramyun, Gourmet Spicy Picante, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQJT5K">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Ramyun, 4.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 20)</a>).<br /><br />The taste of this noodle is spicy and seafood-y, and I personally like the dried vegetables that are included with this noodle; I think there are dried seaweed and kelp, and also some chopped green onions. At first, I was a little bit disappointed due to the 'fishy' smell of the soup base (just like one of the reviewers here mentioned, the smell did remind me of fish food); however, after the noodle was done cooking, I was happy to find that the smell was significantly reduced. Also, because this is supposed to be an udon noodle, the texture, which I like, is thick and chewy.<br /><br />Although this noodle is tasty, there is a downside. I found that all the instant ramen noodles that I have eaten so far are guilty for their notoriously high sodium content, including this one. The whole package of soup base powder cost us 86% of our daily sodium intake allowance, which is worrying to me (note that on the package, it says that the sodium content is 43% of the daily allowance; but it's only for half serving).<br /><br />What I do to deal with this: I use only half of the soup base powder and use less water so that the soup won't be too bland (I can always adjust the amount of water later on). I also add a splash of sesame oil before turning off the heat, and maybe some chopped fresh green onions when I'm not too lazy to do the chopping. Sometimes I also add imitation crab meat or eggs. Doing these really make the noodles more flavorful without having to use all of the soup base powder. If you're still worried about the sodium, do what I sometimes do: eat the solids only, and maybe several sips of the soup and dump the rest of it.<br /><br />All in all, this noodle is tasty and can potentially be healthier if we avoid using all of the soup base powder. I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.
