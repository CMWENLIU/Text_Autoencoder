Don't have a clue what the negative reviews are about...it's a food product and there will always be natural variations in consistency. I haven't experienced any with this product. Even though I received a 1kg bag with a broken seal, it was still excellent (it's a sin to waste it, LOL!). [...]. As far as the "light" color goes, oily black beans clog super-auto machine's grinders so they're usually not recommended. FWIW, the Illy (see below) is black as night and it's pre-ground so I don't have to worry about clogging as I can manually bypass dose the machine. You can do the same with any espresso you buy pre-ground or grind in an external grinder.<br /><br />Personally, I love the stuff! I was introduced to it by friends who bought a Saeco Incanto Sirius super-auto (HIGHLY Recommended) and use Super Crema and Illy Decaf pre-ground (fantastic, but you need a mortgage to buy the stuff) and I loved them so much I bought my own Sirius and tons of Lavazza (as well as the Illy decaf). I've had the Saeco from Memorial Day to Labor Day this summer and have brewed circa 800(!) shots, going through SIX (6) kilos (13.5#) of Super Crema in the process and have yet to brew a bad shot. It does fine in cappucino and cafe crema as well. I bring 12 shots into work on fridays (bagel day) and everyone loves the stuff...I haven't met one person who didn't enjoy my Super Crema espresso and that's served from a thermos!<br /><br />Buy a bag and see for yourself....for LESS THAN the price of Starbucks garbage, you can get the real deal here. I just bought six more bags of the stuff...I'm keeping most of it and giving one or two away as gifts to family/friends. Remember the old caveat: there truly is no accounting for taste, LOL!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE (4/8/09): After approx. 4,000+ shots, I haven't changed my opinion. If anything, I love this stuff even more now! I am completely addicted to Super Crema to the point that I can't stomach anything else. I still haven't had a bad shot with the stuff. If you find better, let me know, please! You'll have to go some to beat Super Crema in my book, especially at the under $[...]/lb. price point!
