These were priced right so to be frank, my expectations were a bit low. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when a delightfully packed box (appropriate for gift giving) was delivered with six different varieties of dried mushrooms, presentation stuffing, recipe ideas etc...the overall effect is quite nice and makes a wonderful gift idea.<br /><br />The first we tried were the morels - although you can certainly find much more expensive ones, I was very pleasantly surprised how good these were especially given the price of the entire box. Frankly, they tasted much better than expected. Next were the shiitake which are one of my favorite mushrooms and I tend to be very picky about them...most of the time I purchase them fresh but always keep some dried on hand for those "cooking emergencies" (I use a lot of shrooms when cooking). In fact, I had just ordered a pound of dried shiitake from another vendor...these were FAR surperior (unfortunately, I'm stuck with a pound of not so good ones...USA organic made at that!). Each has been equally pleasant and far in excess of my (admittedly modest) expectations. Frankly, these would easily pass for double the cost I paid...in fact, I liked this set so much, I hesitated to give it such a good rating because I was afraid they would jump the price up!<br /><br />As soon as I work through my present selection from the other inferior company, I intend to purchase more dried and fresh mushrooms from this Earthy. VERY impressed!
