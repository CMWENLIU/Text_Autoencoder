Thanks to another user's review, I tried these because I could not get organic dates in my local grocery store. What a treat! I don't have to leave my home and these consistently fabulous dates arrive on my doorstep! They do have pits, but completely worth the picking it out to have the soft, sweet, and healthy snack. I have never gotten a bad batch, so the quality control seems to be superb! I love them, and you will too! By the way....these are a much better deal $$$ than what you will pay in the stores for less in the bag!
