This is a great product for those who need gluten, dairy & casein free foods. We use both these individual packets and the boxes with the GF noodles - both are handy and great.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste like REAL macaroni and cheese! Geez - do you really think you can get fake cheese or non-cheese to taste like the real thing?!? If you're looking for something to replicate real cheese or annies GF mac and cheese (which DOES contain dairy) then you will search in vain. You cannot get real cheese flavor from non-cheese products.<br /><br />However, if you're realistic and are aware that non cheese stuff won't actually taste like cheese yet you want something similar to mac & cheese then this is a great option! We really like this mix and the other roads end products. It has a unique flavorful taste. We tend to alternate this stuff <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXG8W">Namaste Foods, Gluten Free Say Cheez Pasta Dish, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> The Road's end is closer to cheese than the Namaste but again, those who want a real cheese flavor/consistency will be sorely disappointed. However, for those of us who cannot have real cheese this stuff is great.<br /><br />We mix in veggies with ours (you know the ones that are little squares of carrots, peas, corn, etc.) and I use hemp milk when mixing for a bit more substance and flavor. Also if you add a bit of trocomare <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBSO">A. Vogel Trocomare, 3.2 Ounce Units (Pack of 4)</a> it makes a huge difference in flavor (actually trocomare makes a huge difference in the flavor of everything! We love it and use it on just about everything.<br /><br />So - for those who expect a real cheese flavor - don't even bother and stick with real cheese or change your expectations.<br /><br />For those who realize it won't taste like real cheese but who want something different and unique (and gluten, dairy, casein free) - buy this, it's great!!!
