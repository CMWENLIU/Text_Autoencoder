These Tuna filets packed in Olive Oil are extremely fresh and obviously high qulity. Tonnino has always exceeded our expectations and you will be surprised on the taste difference between over the counter Tuna and the Tonnino filets. Try their canned Tuna as well and you will never goback to store bought!
