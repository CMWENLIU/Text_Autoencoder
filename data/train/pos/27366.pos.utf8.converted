Prior to finding this formula for my first child (for supplementation, horrible milk supply after working with many professionals) I tried Parent's Choice organic formula (horrible BMs) and used Similac Organic. Similac wasn't too bad, but I still didn't like the ingredients or methods of processing. Once we tried Enfamil and my daughter threw, not spit, threw that nasty stuff up everywhere. After searching for a better alternative, I came across Baby's Only for even a lot cheaper through my co-op. She took to it right away, even spitting it up much less than breastmilk. We used it from a few months old until she was 18 months. My sister then used it for her son to supplement as well, with great results.<br /><br />I went to order it again for our second arriving in a few weeks, when I saw all this hype about arsenic (btw, if you haven't purchased a product, you should not submit a review on it! That's abuse). I immediately freaked out a little at what my alternative would be? Then after reading all of the information out there that I could get my hands on, I decided that this is still the best choice for us. If there is no regulation on something, you cannot just pick out one or two items, test them and scare the nation. You need to see what is in everything else as well and test comparable brands for safety in their ingredients too! Personally I feel a lot safer giving this formula to my child, a company that has not had any incident reports (that I know of) since they have been around, then give my baby a formula that children have gotten sick on and one recently died from. Be it contamination or ingredients.<br /><br />For me there isn't a good alternative. I feel good about Nature's One as a company who strives to do the best for it's customers. They have worked so hard at trying to offer the best formula they can. Even removing as much BPA from packaging as they can, and giving options to parents to choose what to give their babies.<br /><br />I hope this formula will continue to be available and that this issue can be rectified quickly through more testing.<br /><br />Update: I just checked their website and they have further testing that has been done, stating that this formula is safe and levels are far below standards for rice for babies (no standards have been set for formula). Very possible false positives in the Dartsmouth study.<br />[...]
