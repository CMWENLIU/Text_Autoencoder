I've had a subscription to Peet's for years. I find Starbuck's dark roast tastes burnt. I saw this coffee in the Gold Box and decided to try it based on the reviews.  It is absolutely delicious; the best coffee I've ever had.  I enjoy it in my morning latte.  It has a strong, robust smell, but blends smoothly in my latte's and mocha's.  Even better, it is ORGANIC and FREE TRADE.  How good can it get with the low price per pound and free shipping with Amazon Prime.  Closed my subscription from Peets and buying Dark Horse from Amazon from now on.  I LOVE IT!!!
