First, let me say that I do NOT like regular Pop-Tarts. I've tried them, and they tasted like overly-sweetened cardboard with a definite strange aftertaste. I'd only eat one again if there was absolutely nothing else in the house.<br /><br />I tried Nature's Path Organic Frosted Strawberry Toaster Pasteries simply because "he" threw it into the shopping cart, insisting it had to be good. Oh, well... whatever. At least, it's organic and actually has some real fruit in it.<br /><br />OK, I weakened during a mid-morning slump and I needed something to go along with my mega-cup of coffee. To my absolute astonishment, it was not just good, but VERY, VERY GOOD!<br /><br />This product tasted to me like something from a bakery. The crust was flaky, soft yet a bit crispy. There is absolutely no chemical after-taste. And, there is fruit inside. Yes, I was astonished. It was not like a slab of stale jello, but real, tasty strawberry with a nice, natural taste. Furthermore, it was not overly sweet.<br /><br />Not only was I amazed, I will purchase this product over and over again.<br />Once you try it, you will as well!<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
