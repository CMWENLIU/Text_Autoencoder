This risotto mix produces an excellent risotto with a wonderful, rich saffron flavor. It is easy to make because you don't have to stand over the pot stirring constantly like homemade, and it still comes out with a creamy texture and properly al dente rice. I have purchased this risotto mix at least four different times. My family likes it so well we go through the box pretty fast. This mix is a definite winner.
