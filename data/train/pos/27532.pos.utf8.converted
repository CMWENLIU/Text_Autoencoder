I buy most of my groceries from a discount-outlet store.  I can always find some good and cheap jam/jellies there.<br /><br />But this is a step up.  The blueberries in here are real.  It takes me back 40 years to when I ate wild blueberries off the bushes in Maine.<br />The mixture is sweet, but the blueberry taste comes through.  Its not like flavored sugar.<br /><br />There is no better review I can give than to say I'm willing to pay the price for these preserves.  There are rather few products I can say that about.<br /><br />As another reviewer of a related product says, this and some natural peanut butter make for a great sandwich.<br /><br />As an experienced giant warehouse store shopper, I'm buying more while they have it.  The product I bought 6/08 is "good" until 3/10, but being preserves would last even longer -- but it's not long for this world anyways, since it's so good.
