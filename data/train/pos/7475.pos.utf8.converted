I saw this recommended on Dr Oz for energy and stabilizing blood sugar and energy instead of the highs and lows that occur with sweets.  It arrived very fast, it was sold out in my local health food store, probably because of the show.<br /><br />What is it like? If you have ever had Starbucks Chocolate Covered Coffee beans, think of no chocolate covering and crush the bean into small, no tiny bits.  I was expecting something the size and uniformity of a mini-chocolate chip. But these are little tiny irregular shaped pieces of what looks like crushed or milled cocoa beans.<br /><br />Mouth feel and crunch, very crunchy which is satisfying, takes a lot of chewing and it has a natural slight oiliness, reminds me of nuts in that way.<br /><br />I like it and I am not a chocolate person. it seems to help with my cravings and full of antioxidants.  Give it a try. just by one bag first though. I suspect you'll either love it or ..... not love it!  LOL
