I first tried Madhava Agave Nectar about 5 years ago when I was on vacation and toured Celestial Seasonings where they had it available as a sweetener in their tasting room.  I've been hooked since that day and am loyal to the brand.  I use it for nearly everthing I want to sweeten and even though I'm not diabetic, I feel good knowing it has a lower glycemic load than other sweeteners.  It not only tastes great, but it really dissolves in cold drinks and I love to drizzle it over  cereal and fresh berries for a little lift.  It doesn't crystalize like honey does and from everything I've read, it is a completely natural and organic product.  While there are products that don't live up to their claim, this is not one of them.  I personally endorse this product and have convinced several friends to start using it too!  I have zero affiliation and have not received any compensation from Madhava; their products are just wonderful and I am happy to give them the praise they deserve.<br /><br />I have found it can be expensive to purchage agave nectar at grocery or health food stores and have found Amazon the best source to stock up at a great price and have yet to have a bottle go bad or change before I've used it.<br /><br />I also recommend trying the amber agave nectar and use it as a syrup replacement for my pancakes.
