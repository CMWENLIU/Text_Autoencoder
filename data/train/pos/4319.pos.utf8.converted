Despite the fact that Izze Sparkling Pomegranate juice beverage has 19g of sugar, it is not too sweet. In fact, it has a very refreshing fruity taste, which is enhanced by the light carbonation.<br /><br />It's made from concentrates of juices, including apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. The rest of the mix is comprised of sparkling water, fruit & vegetable coloring, and added vitamins like C & B6 (very small amounts).<br />Even though it contains lemon and cranberrry juice concentrates, it isn't too tart.<br /><br />All in all, it's a nice alternative to soda. And here's a little extra something I experimented with: mixed with a little wine (I used Sangria) it made a great wine cooler! ;)<br /><br />It's also low sodium and has just 80 calories per 8.4 fl. oz. All this and the fact that the Izze company does philanthropic/educational work for needy kids, and you've got a winning product.
