I don't like mayonnaise--or I thought I didn't. Other than a mere dab on a hardboiled egg, I have no use for the white, fluffy, oily stuff. I couldn't even bring myself to use it as a hair-repair pack on the recommendation of my hair stylist (you put it on like conditioner, wait an hour and wash it off. Avoid picnics, boiled potatoes, eggs and tomato sandwiches in the meantime.)<br /><br />But it turns out I actually really like mayonnaise as long as it's Dukes. This mayo is made from (they say) the same recipe as Mrs. Eugenia Duke created in 1917. This mayo has eggs, oil and vinegar but...no sugar. If you look at classical mayonnaise recipes, there is never sugar. Sugar is not a great addition to mayonnaise. Curry powder, paprika, mustard, tarragon are good additions. Sugar is not. When I took a test spoon of this mayo, having run out of my squeeze bottle of a national brand, I was amazed. First, this is what mayo tasted like when I was a kid, and second, this was actually so good I could eat it alone, which is damn dangerous as I don't need to be scooping mayo up with a teaspoon as an addition to my diet.<br /><br />The taste is tangy and somewhat perhaps more sour than you are used to. It works well on tomato sandwiches, deviled eggs, potato salad and anything requiring mayonnaise. I happen to like it as a small dab on a hardboiled egg, then sprinkled with curry for a quick breakfast.<br /><br />The squeeze bottle is nice until you get to the end, then it's a bit hard to get all of it to squirt out, so a knife is needed to get the rest. If this bothers you, use the plastic jars. But watch out for dipping in those dangerous spoons for a taste. This is a recipe for diet disaster.
