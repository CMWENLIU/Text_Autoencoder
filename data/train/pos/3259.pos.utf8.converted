I really enjoyed growing the wheat grass using this package. It was simple, clean, and the grass grew really well!  I was pleasantly surprised at how lush and green the grass was. Though my dog doesn't eat it off the stems, I just cut them into smaller pieces over his food. Definitely recommended for the experience, whether your pet will eat it is a different stories, as we all know, the little ones can be picky. =)
