Searching for a moist, true fudge brownie?  Look no further!  My own personal quest in the search for the ultimate brownie brought me to countless recipes on the internet which I tried, then promptly threw away.  Nothing worse than having a dry cake brownie when you want a decadent, deep rich, moist fudge brownie!  Having spied the Ghirardelli brownie box in the grocery store, I thought why not?  After all Ghirardelli does make chocolate.  By the way, the box says ultimate fudge and for good reason, it's a true statement!  These are so sinful, so delicious that I will never be trying another recipe for homemade.  Forget that when Ghirardelli makes it so easy.  The packet of fudge topping makes it all the more better.  Honestly if you desire a rich, sinful moist fudge brownie, this is it.  Hands down it's the winner and I would rate it at 10 stars if I could.
