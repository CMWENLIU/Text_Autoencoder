I discovered Black Treacle on a visit to the UK.  It tastes like molasses, with a hint of black licorices and rum flavor.  I add it to my Oatmeal Raisin cookies to make them a bit chewier and a bit better.  It is messy to work with, but fun at the same time.  It's really really thick, like cold honey.
