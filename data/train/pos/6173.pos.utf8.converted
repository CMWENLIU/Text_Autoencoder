I, myself, think chestnuts taste like dust and am not sure just what the allure is.  I ordered these for my mom, who has been a chestnut lover for a good portion of her 84 years on this planet, and she liked them very much, so I guess they must be okay.  Last year I purchased a different brand and these measured up.  So for you chestnut afficionados, it's a thumbs up.
