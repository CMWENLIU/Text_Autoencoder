One of my two cats prefers to eat dry cat food, and so many of the foods on the market have a ton of fillers. I'd grown increasingly worried that she wasn't getting enough of what she needed in her diet, especially now as a senior cat. I switched to this food several months ago. She loves it, and her health has noticeably improved! Her coat has thickened up, she doesn't have itchy skin like she used to. Her arthritis isn't bothering her as much either. I'm very glad I switched to this dry cat food.
