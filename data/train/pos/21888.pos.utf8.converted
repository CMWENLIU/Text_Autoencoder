I was introduced to this product by a friend. I know its wonderful for cooking, but is even better on the skin. I've used every type of lotion on the planet. My skin is extremely dry but sensitive. This product has gotten rid of the dryness and I have no adverse reactions to it. Loved it so much I'm having it shipped every six months.
