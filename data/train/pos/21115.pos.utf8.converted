Every type of rice cooks perfectly in my rice cooker, which makes reviewing taste irrelevant.<br />I choose sprouted brown rice because it's easier to digest. People with weak digestion, Crohn's disease or colitis who<br /> have to stick with white rice only, can tolerate this one, and it adds more nutrition values to their food.
