Was just served these as a snack on an Air France flight -- and they are the antithesis of "airplane food"! I could not believe the quality. They taste like a shortbread cookie but I like them better than Walker's and the like. The butter flavor is very strong. Made sure to pick some up in a grocery store before returning home. Had no idea that I could order them on Amazon. :-)
