The only way I can think of not thinking this tastes like root beer is if you like the taste of diet root beer.  Put this in either flat or sparking water and you have a zero cal. natural taste treat.  I find it takes more than a drop or two to get the flavor for me, but be careful not to over do it too, since stevia will start to taste bitter if there's too much of it used.  Enjoy!
