I can't argue with my kitties. They would eat only this type of food if I would let them. Kibbles are a must, but they share one can twice daily. They look forward to this early AM and late evening treat.<br />They are not partial to any flavor but texture and gravy count. They let me kow by how much they leave in their bowls.  For the "Grilled" food there are no leftovers, but "Classic" is not as good.<br /><br />I am just the messenger for "Grateful Pampered"  kitties.
