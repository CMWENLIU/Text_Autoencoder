Once my doctor told me to try Stevia instead of the Splenda, I was very cautious and skeptical.  First of all, it tastes a little different right out of the package, but mixed in with my tea I couldn't taste any of the bitterness the other reviewer is referring to.  It gives my tea a nice sweet, but not too sweet, flavor with one packet.  And, the ingredients couldn't be more clear: NO MALTODEXTRIN in sight! I highly recommend this one.
