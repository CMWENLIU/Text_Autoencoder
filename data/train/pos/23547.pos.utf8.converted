Manuka has a strong, deep, rich flavor, suggesting essences of fig, tannin, and molasses. This is honey to be savored. Try a bit atop an excellent stilton for a symphony of tastes. Because of its intensity, children might not like it (give them ordinary supermarket clover honey and keep this for yourself!)<br /><br />A teaspoonful of manuka will assert itself in the strongest of assam teas. The same spoonful will make one's morning oatmeal a culinary experience.<br /><br />As for the medical claims, honey in general and manuka in particular have been touted for antibacterial qualities. To me, because I like strong flavors, manuka makes a wonderful sore throat soother. A professional singer that I know uses a spoonful before every performance as a preventive.<br /><br />Yes, it is expensive (although I suppose those fortunate enough to live in New Zealand pay far less), but it is as worthwhile as a fine French Burgundy, fresh Chincoteague oysters, aged prime filet, and king salmon are for gourmets. I certainly hope the bees of New Zealand are not affected by the viruses and parasites that are killing off their North American counterparts.
