I bought one of these at a local grocery store and was very impressed with it's lightness, flakiness and how well it "held together" when mixing and rolling out. I tried finding more but was told it was a "seasonal item" (meaning they only carried it at Thanksgiving and Christmas I guess). I couldn't find it anywhere else but the store suggested I check Amazon and sure enough, they had it! Now I had to buy a box of 12 but that's okay as it keeps well plus my mom wanted 6 of them. MUCH superior to Pillsbury box mixes or any ready-made I've found in the US. It's very similar to the British "short crust pastry" I used to buy when we lived in London. HIGHLY recommended!
