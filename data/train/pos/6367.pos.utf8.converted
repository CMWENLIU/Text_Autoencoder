WOW!!!!!<br /><br />Fabulous, amazingly good tahini - what everybody else said:<br />The taste, texture, creaminess/consistency, did I mention<br />the taste? Just perfect!<br /><br />I ran out of my usual Aleppo brand tahini and it wasn't available<br />from my usual source, and I needed some tahini right away. So, it<br />was off to Amazon and after much searching, I decided on this one:<br />a bit more expensive than Aleppo, but very definitely comparable<br />in overall excellence.<br /><br />I am vegan, but I missed having creamy dressing for my salads ...<br />I used to buy felafels on MacDougal St. in the Village (NYC)<br />and I remembered the creamy tahini sauce they came smothered in.<br /><br />So, I bought some tahini and mixed it in with extra-virgin olive<br />oil, some (optional) balsamic vinegar, sea salt and oregano, and<br />voila! a delicious vegan "creamy" salad dressing. Also great as<br />a bread dip. And by the spoonful, right out of the jar, of course. ;)<br /><br />***** VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND *****
