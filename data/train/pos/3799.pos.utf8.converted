This popcorn has a great flavor, and as suggested by others we sprayed a little olive oil on it and lightly salted it.  Very good corn from the hot air popper.<br /><br />Some folks have expressed concerns over how this popcorn does not turn out as "big and fluffy" as the store brands or other national brands.  This IS true.  Keep in mind that those other brands have been bred to be big and fluffy, but not necessarily tasty.  I prefer the good taste of this corn over the big and fluffy "cardboard corn" any day!
