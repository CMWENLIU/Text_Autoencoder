I've used this litter for at least six months now.  My cats (all between 7 and 12 pounds), who were used to a very soft wheat-based litter, accepted this very easily and it actually does last a long time, although maybe not 100% as long as they claim.  I do have one cat who gets SQ fluids for kidney problems, so she probably does urinate more often than normal cats; therefore I don't feel confident arguing about the manufacturer's claims for longevity.<br /><br />The thing that surprised me the most is that even as the litter gets really old, the litter box still does not smell like cat urine.  It's not until the litter is completely saturated at the end of its life that you start to smell urine.  I have a friend who uses another brand of silica litter, and it gets the stench of urine almost immediately, so I think Litter Pearls are worth the premium for odor control.  You can still smell the cat poop a little, of course.<br /><br />One of my cats has asthma, and the vet recommended using this to lower the dust exposure for him.  This is not 100% dust free, but compared to most litters it is much closer to reaching that claim, and we love that because there was a pervasive coat of dust all over the house with the wheat-based litter.  This litter still tracks, but the cats don't emerge from the boxes with dust-covered feet so we don't have to look at dusty paw prints all over the house any more.  As for the round crystals being difficult to vacuum, there is some truth to that, especially with hardwood floors; however, I really haven't found the vacuuming issue to be terribly inconvenient, and since my cats are accustomed to soft litters, I've stuck with the round crystals.
