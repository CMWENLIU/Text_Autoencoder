Let me start out by saying that this is my 1st review, I have depended on other reviewers here on Amazon to help me with many purchases. I have rarely been let down. Thank you all.<br />My husband has congestive heart failure and is on a very low sodium diet (1000 mg. max. daily). We thought that he would never eat soup again until we tried this prouduct. It's really hard to make soup that tastes good without adding salt. It was easy and very tasty to accomplish this feat with Bob's Red Mill soup mix. I sauteed some onions in a tad of butter, chopped some carrots and added the left overs from a (low sodium seasoned) roast beef that I had frozen. I threw this in the pot with the soup mix and added a packet of Herb-ox sodium free beef bouillon per cup of water. My husband had soup tonight for the first time since he had heart surgery and he loved it. I enjoyed it myself but did add a sprinkle of sea salt for myself. It was so good that I just had to thank everyone for recommending it.
