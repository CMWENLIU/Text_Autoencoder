These taste amazing and are easier to digest than flax and has the perfect ratio of omega fatty acids for us. Also they are packed with protein I am transitioning to raw vegan and needed a  good protein source for all my workouts. These are delicious and don't bother my tummy like other nuts and seeds. I will be ordering more once I fish these. Even my 3 year old daughter loves these.
