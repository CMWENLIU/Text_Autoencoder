These were a great base for Tiramisu. I just used the recipe on the back and it was out of this world. Be sure to use Mascarpone cheese, because that makes all the difference despite the cost. This was a big package of Ladyfingers, so there were plenty for the Tiramisu and some extras to eat. They were firm enough that they really held together after dipping them in the Espresso and they soaked up the flavors just great. I would order these again since Ladyfingers are difficult to find in my area.
