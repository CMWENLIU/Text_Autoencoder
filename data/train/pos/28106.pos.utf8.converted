There is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with Splenda. After couple tries I found excellent Splenda recipes and even guests could not tell Splenda cookies from sugar ones. If you still feel Splenda cookies are not the same, add a teasp. of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same!
