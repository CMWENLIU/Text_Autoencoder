I stopped eating peanut butter for several years when all I could find had cottonseed oil in it.I am deathly allergic to cottonseed oil .It is put in peanut butter to keep it from separating .I kept reading labels & after about 3 years I found some from Bama .I ate that for several years .But it was discontinued .Oh no ,no peanut butter again .Shortly thereafter I found the Smuckers which I buy at WalMart Supercenter because it's cheaper .I saw the price here & freaked a bit .I buy 6 jars at a time ,some crunchy & some creamy & seem to eat most of it right out of the jar while watching TV .<br />I Love the stuff . Smuckers sells a Lid with a stirrer in it for about $12 . A heavy table knife works just fine & flipping the jars helps too .The oil is also great for chapped lips .
