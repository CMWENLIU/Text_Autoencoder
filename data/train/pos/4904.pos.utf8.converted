It IS good for what it is. Someone had told me about this product, and as he did, he was licking his lips. That was a pretty hearty endorsement for something that you drop into water for flavoring. He was speaking of another flavor, but when he said there was Root Beer flavor available, I jumped at it. I love Root Beer soda, and was drinking more than I should be, so I figured what did I have to lose? You use 1 drop per each 2 oz of water, so the bottle should last a while. You can also use it to flavor yogurt, and other things as well. Its uses are only limited by your imagination. One other thing I will say is be careful not to overdo it. Using too much could have a bitter result. It also recommends that you refrigerate it after opening so that it lasts longer. I like the "taste" of water, but it's so much better with these drops, and definitely better than the soda (although it certainly doesn't match soda's rich flavor).
