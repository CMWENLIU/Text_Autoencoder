The zip lock packaging makes it easy and convenient to use and store without spillage. The Chia is fresh and adds no taste. I use it to make Chia Fresca.  It's very hydrating and supplies me with sustained energy for hours. In a large blender carafe I blend for 30 seconds on low speed; 4 heaping tablespoons of chia, with 4 cups of distilled water, 1 peeled and seeded lemon, 10 drops vanilla stevia, and a few sprigs of fresh mint. After blending for 1 minute I let the mixture sit for 15 to 30 minutes and absorb the water and turn into a gel. I then blend the gel at high speed until it's smooth.  It tastes great and is good for you. Chia absorbs 10 times it's volume in water and can be dehydrating if you don't consume it with enough water.
