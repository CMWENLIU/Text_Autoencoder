Milk Kefir Grains arrived in a timely manner in great condition. I am a first-time user of Kefir and until recently had never even heard of it. In a quest to achieve optimal health, I came across information about the benefits of cultured milk products, like kefir, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967089735">Nourishing Traditions:  The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats</a> by Sally Fallon. I was a bit nervous to use this product without actually "seeing" how it was done, so I went to the "Cultures for Health" website to watch the video. It was exactly the support I needed to have the confidence to start something that seemed so foreign!<br /><br />The first day I began to hydrate my grains, I mixed a cup of whole raw milk and the kefir grains in a canning jar with a coffee filter fixed to the top with a rubber band. The weather outside was very cold and subsequently it was pretty chilly on the inside of the house too, so I turned my oven light on and place the jar as far away from the light as possible and closed the door. I repeated this process the 2nd and 3rd day, but by the 4th day decided to leave it on the counter since the milk was separating to curds and whey by the end of the 24 hr period. I had kefir by day 5! It tasted clean and a little like buttermilk, yummy! I'm still learning, but feel confident that I'm off to a great start, thanks to Cultures for Health <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2">Milk Kefir Grains</a>!<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have this product! I save money by not having to buy powders, and my homemade kefir is better for my family than the pasteurized, sugar-filled, store-bought (expensive) version!
