After ordering these, I was shocked that I had paid so much for so few servings (about $2.33 per bowl).  Once I got these, again, I had to shake my head at my own indulgence.  Then I tasted them!  OH... MY... GOSH!!!!  These were, without a doubt, the BEST oriental noodles I've ever tasted.  To say that they didn't skimp on the mushrooms is an understatement!  There were mushrooms in every bite.  And not just little bits of mushrooms.  They were whole, and the texture and taste was wonderful.  Another wonderful surprise was that the noodles never got mushy or stuck together -- even when I forgot I had them soaking, and left them for more than 20 minutes.  Another nice surprise was learning that these wonderful noodles have four grams of fiber in each bowl.  Even though these are very filling (probably because of the fiber), they only contain 190 calories, and 1 gram of fat.  One bowl is perfect for any entire meal.  And the flavor is perfect...  not too spicy, not too bland, but just right.<br /><br />Added to all the above is that they're incredibly easy to prepare.  Open the flavor/mushroom/egg pack, put it atop noodles, pour boiling water over everything, replace cover and wait three minutes.  There are two things I do different when preparing these (but just because of my preferences, not because the instructions are faulty -- they're not).  I add less water than the instructions suggest -- I prefer these more noodle-y and less soup-ey, and 1-1/2 cups of boiling water is the perfect amount for my preference.  I also let it set for five minutes, giving the noodles a chance to soak up more of the water.<br /><br />Are these mushrooms pricey?  Yes, they are.  Are they overpriced?  Not at all!  I will definitely buy these tasty and nutritious noodles again!
