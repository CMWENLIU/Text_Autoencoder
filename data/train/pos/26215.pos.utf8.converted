How long have I been confounded by the polarization of peanut butter spreads!<br /><br />For most of my life, I have had to settle for either highly processed conventional conveyor belt variety peanut butter or the dreaded settler variety of old fashioned peanut butter where the oil seperates from the nutmeat leaving a crusty and dry hunk of unspreadable peanut matter.<br /><br />No longer! This spread has it all. Great taste, spreadibity and, can you believe this, better for you! It was high time, and the great minds at Skippy have made this possible.<br /><br />Mankind, rejoice!
