Many years ago a friend in Eugene, Oregon, told me that if I ever drank Yorkshire Gold, I would never want anything else, and she was right. Today,when a shipment comes into a store, word of mouth makes the boxes disappear fast.  Once, when I asked a cashier where I could find Yorkshire Gold, he went to a back room in the store and came back out, holding the boxes of tea as if it were contraband, looking both ways before he took it to the check stand.  When Yorkshire Gold comes in to a store, there is a run on it, and you can look down the shelf where it was stacked and see a blank spot.  I have heard it is going to be difficult to get this tea in the US, although the tea drinkers in the US are responsible for its great success.
