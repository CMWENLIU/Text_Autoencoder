I'm drinking it warm because my new order just arrived and there wasn't time to chill it.  I think I'm becoming an addict.  What else can I say, just please see my review of the Pink Grapefruit flavor.  Ditto on all of that except it doesn't taste like the last precious drops of a pink grapefruit.  That would just be wrong.  But love it for what it is in all its orange-mango-y goodness with zero calories.  I'd love it even if it were fattening but I'd drink it maybe once a year.
