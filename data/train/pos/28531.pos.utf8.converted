Odd that the less processed the salt the more expensive it is.  I'm sure there must be a logical reason.  This is a damp, slightly coarse product.  You will need to use it from a salt cellar because it won't pour through the holes in a shaker.  I drink distilled water exclusively and there are some health advisers out there who say that trace minerals should be taken to make up for the lack of them in distilled water.  Some even claim that the water can actually remove trace minerals from your system and that is one big reason I use a quality sea salt, to hopefully replace trace minerals if indeed they are being depleted by drinking distilled water.  This salt is very tasty but it is not very much salt for the price.  Still, I plan to buy another bag.
