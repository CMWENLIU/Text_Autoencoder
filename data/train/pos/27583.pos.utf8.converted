Delicious.  What more can one say?  The preparation directions are confusing since they are written in German.  But a call to a German friend cleared it up.  She said the  prep ingredients call for 3 TBS of water and 3 TBS of oil blended with the powder and then poured over the veggies - in my case cucumbers.  No vinegar needed although I add a tsp because I love vinegar.  One package easily prepares one large cucumber sliced paper thin.  To me, it contains vinegar powder, salt, powdered sugar and dill weed.
