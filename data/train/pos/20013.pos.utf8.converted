After making my own bubble tea for the first time with the regular 30mins-1hr boba, I decided to try the minute pearls.  I was quite skeptical about whether the "minute" pearls could be even close to being thoroughly cooked in anything under less than an hour b/c the regular bubbles took that long and there was still raw, dry starch in the center, which was quite annoying even after following the direction strictly.  But with the minute pearls, I pured them into hot boiling water and by the time I turned around they were completely cooked to the center and chewy.  I was ecstatic cos it was just like the kind in my local boba tea shop.  Now i can save my money and make all kinds of tea at home for myself, my husband, friends, family!
