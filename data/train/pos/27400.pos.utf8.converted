While adopting my new Ragdoll cat, I found out about the benefits of grain-free formulas.  The foster home I picked my cat up from was using Felidae Grain-Free so I decided to continue using the brand and see how things went.  I am very pleased with the results so far, as my cat's coat is very silky and I have not detected any odors from the urine or feces (which I did from other premium brands I fed to my past cats).<br /><br />The best part is getting the food delivered to my doorstep for less than the cost of purchasing from (and driving to) a local merchant!
