Contrary to some of the reviews here, I find 'Earthly Choice' brand very good tasting and price-wi$e, it beats out the price I pay at either the fruit market or 'cost-club' ($5.49/14 oz.) Organic foods can be expensive. I used to have a Whole Foods store near me, but it closed, so this is the next best value.<br /><br />Here's some clues about quinoa:<br />- Quinoa is surrounded by an outer shell. If you don't wash it, the end result could be a bitter taste, which makes many dislike the taste of quinoa. Another good idea is to, after washing, combine it with another food.<br /><br />- Cooking ratio (for small serving): 2/3 cup quinoa to 1 cup water. Fifteen minutes will do it.<br /><br />- Quinoa is good for the body, providing all 8 amino acids, which no other food can provide. (Amino acids are good for muscle & bone structure. If you work out at the gym, this helps repair muscle you 'tear up'!)<br /><br />- I eat quinoa everyday, at different times, (because I eat 6 small-portioned meals). It is gr8 for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or night-time snack.<br /><br />- Cereal recipe: 2/3 cup organic steel cut 'Irish-type' oats, 2/3 cup washed quinoa, 4 cups organic fat-free milk, 2 tablespoons vanilla extract. First simmer up the milk and vanilla. Add oats and cook for 15 minutes. Add quinoa and cook another 17 minutes, (because it takes 22 min to thoroughly cook oats, I find). Pour into 7 individual serving containers. (I use glass ramekins with plastic lids). Refrigerate and you have a breakfast meal for each day of the week. (For breakfast, I add Ellie Krieger's 'Nutty Topping', recipe found on the Food Network website, 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt, ground flaxseed meal, wheat germ, vegetable yeast, 1/2 scoop whey protein powder.) Good for sports and pre-gym, because steel oats stick with you longer than other breakfast foods - tip from my cycling trainer!<br /><br />- Add quinoa to anything else, soups, salads, rice & bean dishes, even desserts - great in cookies, especially chocolate chip, oatmeal and homemade nature bars.
