If your green tea isn't green, it's overly oxidized and probably doesn't taste great but also lacks the majority of the antioxidants the tea is known for.  Try cutting open one of your tea bags...more like brown tea.<br /><br />The Rishi Super Green is my favorite tea and reasonably priced.  I've tried a handful of premium green teas imported from Japan on a very small scale.  These were all very good, but also quite expensive.  I am far from a tea expert, but after drinking the super green I can't even drink the tsao, lipton or bigelow teas any more.  Give this stuff a try, it won't disappoint.
