I am a great connoisseur of natural peanut butter. I gave up fake PB like Skippy, Jif, etc. over a decade ago. I have always been partial to a peanut butter that is made of nothing but ground, roasted peanuts. And when this pack of Peanut Butter & Co. Crunch Time PB arrived, I was bummed to see that in addition to ground peanuts, it had cane juice, palm oil, and salt. But then I took a bite and WOW!! It was smooth with the right amount of crunchiness, just the right balance of sweet & salty, and super tasty. I was in PB heaven! These guys figured out a great recipe of natural ingredients to make the perfect peanut butter. In fact, I have some pure peanut PB left and it isn't as appealing.<br /><br />I make dark chocolate peanut butter cups and this PB will be delish in my homemade treats! I highly recommend it!
