This product makes the best yogurt.  I have a Salton yogurt maker and use a wide mouth quart jar instead of the plastic insert.  I warm up the Salton,  fill the jar about 3/4ths full with the hottest water that comes out of the tap.  Add a cup of this Nido whole milk and stir it up.  Pour a little back out in a cup and mix in 1/4 cup of commercial plain yogurt and pour it back into the jar.  Put jar lid on and cover the Salton.  4 hours later I have a quart of delicious thick yogurt.  Just pop that jar in the frig.  I like not having to heat milk on the stove.
