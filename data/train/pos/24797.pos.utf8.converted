All thee of my dogs love these things, which is a pretty good endorsement as to likeability as all three are rather spoiled and rather picky.  It is a good thing to throw veggies into a dogs diet but at times it is rather difficult to get them to eat (much like children, I dare say).  I use these as special treats and always have some packed in my vest pocket for when we go on walks.  As a side note, I had some setting on the cabinet not long ago, out of the jar when my not overly bright sister came over for one of her unannounced "inspection" visits.  She popped on in her mouth and commented "yummy."  Never did tell her the truth.  Wonder if I could use it to house break her?  The only qualms I have about these things is that they apparently made in China.  I have some real fears about that.
