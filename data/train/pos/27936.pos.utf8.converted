I have a super-picky older dog and two cats who LOVE the freeze-dried raw treats!  They are really worth every penny since they never go to waste and they are the only treat I've purchased in YEARS that they all LOVE.  Seriously...my picky dog, who is still finicky about her dinner, can barely contain herself when she knows she's getting these goodies.  These will probably be the only treats I purchase for them in the future since they're consistenly a hit.  I feel good about feeding them a high-quality natural food that isn't filled with byproducts and grain fillers.
