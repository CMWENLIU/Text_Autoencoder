Delicious and very good for you. This is a chewy cereal that is very satisfying. Even your kids will love it. Multi, whole grain with almonds, hazel nuts and raisins for natural sweetness. I encourage you to try this cereal, you will not go back to the overly sweet, non nutient, American grocery store type of cereal
