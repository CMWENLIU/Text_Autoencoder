At first I had a hard time removing these lids from small cans such as Fancy Feast.  The solution is to just add hot water to a bowl and set the can in the bowl.  This takes the chill off the cat food and also makes the lid easier to remove.  (The cats don't like cold food and they don't like the microwave method!!)
