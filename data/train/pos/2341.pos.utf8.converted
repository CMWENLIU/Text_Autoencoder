I've tried a lot of macadamias and these are, by far, the freshest and best-tasting of them all.  It'll cost you a little more, but it's worth it. The downside is the fact that they're always running out of stock.  I've read many posts outside of Amazon referencing these nuts and they're quality, so it's not like the market isn't there.  That being said, if you're not addicted to mac nuts it won't drive you crazy; just pick them up when you see them.  Maybe it's a marketing ploy, like the whole "tickle-me elmo" fiasco a while back, but that's a conspiracy for another day.
