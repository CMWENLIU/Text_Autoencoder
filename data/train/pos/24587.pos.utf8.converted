This is the third Terro product we've tried this year.  The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJBKMQ">Terro 300 Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits, 6-Pack</a>, proved successful in enticing carpenter ants to eat its tasty poison. You can see inside the 6-pack bait, and can tell instantly if the ants have been eating it. All 6 of ours were emptied within a day or two of the ants discovering its goodness.  So, we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RNEVGY">Terro 1800 3-Ounce Outdoor Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Baits, 3-Pack</a> and were a bit dismayed that we couldn't see inside; however, we're confident our carpenter ants like it too.  But, every day, my hubby would say, "I don't like all these carpenter ants coming into the garage."  So we ordered Terro ant-killer in powder form. It works a bit differently than the liquid baits. The powder bait kills on contact, is waterproof and lasts for 8 months. Once the ants know how bad it is, they stay away from it. We have no more carpenter ants coming into the garage. We then put it around our home's foundation, and sprinkled some onto/into our railroad ties that the ants had taken up residence in...well, at least that's how it looked to us. The only problem we have is trying to remember to step over the poison, otherwise we track it into the garage...then into our home.  yikes! We must remember to clean our shoes off!  If you have pets or young children, well, any kids that play around the house, you might want to be careful where you put this powder.<br /><br />I like Terro ant killer enough to cheer about it!
