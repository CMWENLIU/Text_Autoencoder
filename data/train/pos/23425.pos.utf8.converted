I found this Ceylon Cinnamon is a jar/spice section of the Whole Foods market in Calif. The name is Frontier Ceylon Cinnamon for, I think for something like $5.99. They had the cassia type-not real cinnamon-in the bulk spice section from Vietnam. The cassia type has coumarin and can be toxic. I wanted the Ceylon type for health reasons-good to lower blood pressure/cholesterol-1/2 tsp a day on toast, cereal, breads etc. can be beneficial says some articles on the internet.
