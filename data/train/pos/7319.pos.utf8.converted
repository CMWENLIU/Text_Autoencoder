We lived in the Middle East for several years, while my children were toddlers/milkdrinkers. Our milk choices were canned, reconstituted, dry nonfat, and several with indecipherable labels. Then we tried Nido (Europe). I had to experiment a little but finally came up with the best-tasting method. Mix it up in the blender - I think aerating it helps it taste fresher. Next, refrigerate it overnight before use. It becomes delicious! The family liked drinking milk again, and my tea stopped tasting strange.
