This blend is one of Starbucks' gentler blends, but you have to like the taste of Starbucks to appreciate it.  Often described as having a burnt taste, Starbucks beans are known for their strongly roasted taste.  Maxwell House afficionados should steer clear.<p>Before you invest in Starbucks coffee, make sure you like the flavor by tasting the brew at a local franchise.  If you don't have one near you, make sure you like a strong coffee flavor.  Although I enjoy Starbucks coffee myself, I am leery of recommending it to the uninitiated.  If you like the taste, stock up now.  The coffee stores well for months in the freezer.
