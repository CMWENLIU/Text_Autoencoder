These are great tasting beans and can be subsituted in any recipe that calls for black beans or kidney beans. Soy beans are the lowest carbohydrate beans that exist so they are a great choice for people who are following a low carb or low glycemic lifestyle. I use them in chili and all kinds of mexican recipes.
