Loved Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken Base - however, needed to use the low sodium version and it is sometimes hard to locate in local stores - so I purchased on line.  I started using the regular version several years ago and with high sodium content I was glad to find the reduced sodium version.  It is an excellent base for anything needing chicken bouillon - especially any type of chicken soup including chicken & noodles.  Highly recommend.
