I was deployed to Iraq last year with the US Marine Corps. My wife sent me some of these which I put into the mini fridge that my hut had. After a 12 hour combat resupply mission, coming back to the hut and having one of these made me feel almost human again. I actually started saving them for the hottest/longest days. The taste is a little different, if you are used to gatorade or coke, but it is nice. Drink it cold.
