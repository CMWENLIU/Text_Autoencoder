This cinnamon is so much better than the kind I've always bought in the supermarket.  The taste is delicate, not too sweet, and the fine texture mixes well.  For those who supplement with cinnamon, this variety is better than the more common cassia variety, which has a blood thinning quality when taken in large doses.  The cost for this product is a great deal and the company shipped very quickly.  Will buy again.  5 stars!
