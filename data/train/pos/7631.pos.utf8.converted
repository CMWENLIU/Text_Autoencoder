I started using this product a few months ago when I read about giving coconut oil to my black shih tzu Pucci as a dietary supplement. He liked it immediately and his coat is glossy and his skin unblemished. I have also smooshed some into his hair before his bath as a conditioner with great success. I started eating it myself - it has a very pleasant, mild taste - and I apply it to my hair and skin before a shower which makes even my hard feet smooth and soft without being greasy. It absorbs into the skin nicely. I thought the claims of a miracle product were merely the swoons of hippie health nuts but this product has enhanced my life and the life of my dog. I like Nutiva products in general so that is why I chose it for the coconut oil and it seems wonderful in all aspects. It is part of my routine now. This size jar also seems to be an excellent value for a quality product.
