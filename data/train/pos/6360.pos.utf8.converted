This truly gourmet product is gluten-free, corn-free and soy-free (try finding that combination anywhere else!). It is rich in flavor, yet low in sodium. A little goes a long way, so I find that the 16 oz. container is actually quite economical. And once opened, it stays fresh in the refrigerator, unlike the liquid broth sold in cartons. I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.
