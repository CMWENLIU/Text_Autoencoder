I had to start eating more healthy and after years of eating poorly, it's just not easy to change. I had to learn to add more protein and fiber into my diet but watch the calories and fat. So bacon and sausage for protein at breakfast was totally off the table. Finding a GOOD tasting cereal that gave a significant amount of protein wasn't easy. Then add to that one with good fiber content too! And lets not forget the most important fact....I had to like it! Eating healthy is NOT easy! You need to do your research! I finally found Kashi Go Lean, Honey Almond after 6 months. At the store near me, they don't keep it in the cereal section so I just happened to see it off in the corner one day and gave it a look. I thought I was going to HATE it so it sat in the cabinet for a couple of weeks.....but was I surprised when I finally had some! It has the right amount of sweet and a one cup portion is so filling! I'm fulfilling my protein and fiber requirements and it doesn't even have to hurt! It also makes an awesome snack too....and its good for me!<br /><br />I'm currently trying to get my grandchildren to eat more healthy too before its too late. (2 yr old and 4 yr old boys) This cereal is awesome mixed with some oatmeal and they love it. They also love snacking on it. I also see a big difference after taking them off those sugar charged breakfast cereals they used to eat.<br /><br />Honestly, Kashi Go Lean saved my life. With it's help I've lost 80 pounds and am near my goal weight. It helps my sweet tooth and the fiber helps in ways we all know! Thank you Kashi!
