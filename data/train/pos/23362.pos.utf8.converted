I adopted a Tabby Point Siamese some time ago and started feeding this brand after doing research on the breed. I learned that because of the breed's facial bone structure they tend to consume their food rapidly (much like a vacuum cleaner). The Siamese formula kibble is shaped like a Cheerio and requires more chewing before swallowing. This formula helped my pet to consume smaller amounts per feeding. Another benefit is the high protein content; more per serving than other brands. Also contains L-lysine for immunity.<br />A great price too; at least $3 less than at most pet food super centers and free shipping with orders over $25!
