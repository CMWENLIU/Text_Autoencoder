I've tried lots of more expensive flavored teas but all of them seem to suffer from either the fruit flavor being so weak that you can barely taste it, or else so strong that it entirely overpowers the flavor of the tea.  This one seems to do a good job of falling in the middle.  The mango flavor is definitely noticeable but (at least to me) not overpowering.  Adds a nice smell to the whole room as well.  Highly recommended.
