I used to eat another brand similar to this natural flavor, but it disappeared from shelves, so I tried the O.R. brand and liked it better.  Now I'll need to order it from amazon because this has also been disappearing from my grocery store. I cannot understand everyone's fascination with the chemicals that go into 'butter flavor' microwave popcorn!  This has just oil and salt, and I've found that pouring it into a large bowl reduces the saltiness that others have mentioned here. Keeping it in the bag to eat from seems to keep that salty flavor more concentrated. But I don't think it's really that salty anyway. Obviously this is quite the matter of taste.
