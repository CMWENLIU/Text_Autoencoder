I use this as a marinade and basting sauce when grilling satay, steak, pork, salmon, and chicken.  Make an easy satay marinade by combining Mae Ploy brand Yellow Curry Paste ( high in lemon grass ), lime juice, creamy peanut butter, some sambal olek (or substitute red chili flakes), and a little canned coconut milk ( optional ).<br /><br />Friends that have tried it love it. I tell them I do not really think of it as a condiment, however, I sometimes pour in a small drizzle on rice or use as a dipping sauce.  It is a molasses-like combination of palm sugar and soy sauce. I always try to keep some in stock in my kitchen.
