I have been suffering from hormonal issues since coming off the birth control pill. I started taking Navitas maca powder and in a week I noticed the difference, my complexion was all clean again. I also agree with the fact that it diminishes appetite. Every morning, the first thing I do is to drink the following mixture: 8oz water + 2tsp Bragg organic raw-unfiltered apple cider vinegar + 2tsp Navitas organic raw maca powder + 2tsp honey. I don't even have any breakfast till 1pm. I would recommend this to anybody, it's a very nice, enjoyable drink. I have to admit that I hate any type of vinegar, but I take it to help my body to balance its ph. Moderate bitterness of maca makes this mixture really nice. I am going to try other Navitas products too. And also, Amazon offers a good deal, this is cheaper than Whole Foods price.
