This is so far the BEST food I have had my dogs on.  I have one english bulldog and one french bulldog--both breeds predispositioned for food allergies.  The english bulldog was on another brand of salmon and sweet potato.  His hair started falling out in patches--and we had been struggling for about a year.  In less than one month of this food, his hair stopped falling out AND has started to grow back!!  Also, noticed his little stinky face folds are WAY less stinky and less tear stains.<br /><br />Garbage in, Garbage out!  Cheap food is no good for your dogs in the long run.  I'm a true believer of this food.  Tapioca as the starch limits the chances for allergies.  FANTASTIC food and dogs love the flavor.
