It is impossible to buy unfrosted blueberry Pop Tarts in Austin, TX. I know this because Kellogg's Web site basically told me so! Therefore, because I didn't want to drive three hours to Dallas to get my favorite quick breakfast fix, I decided to buy a case of my favorite Pop Tarts.<br /><br />The Pop Tarts arrived quickly and undamaged. I'm not on my fourth box and none of the pastries have been broken... and all taste great! Plus, the price was comparable to what I would pay in the grocery store anyway. I feel like I have found a great deal, and I plan to order another case within the next few months.
