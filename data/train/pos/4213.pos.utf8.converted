I've been trying several different types of raw honey over the past few months, and this one is now my favorite. I love that although it is raw and unfiltered - it still has the consistency of regular honey, so it is very versatile. There is also a hint of a spice flavor like cinnamon that makes it even yummier. It is the one I keep going back to for almost everything.<br />Susan
