I'm a Chai guy, though not big on coffee, which is ironic for an Army guy.<br /><br />I was buying the 9oz tins, until Publix and walmart stopped carrying them, for $5 and they lasted maybe 7-8 days.  I did the math and realized I was getting a huge savings $.57/oz vs $.21/oz AND don't have to scrounge Atlanta for "who has it?".<br /><br />Cheap, yes, tastes the same, and my wife appreciates the effort.<br /><br />CK
