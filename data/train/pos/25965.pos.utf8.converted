So good...<br /><br />Smooth and creamy.  You'll have to stir in the oil before you can use this peanut butter but the little effort is worth it.  Here's a hint: push a butter knife into the middle of the new jar of peanut butter all the way to the bottom of the jar.  Then, just move the knife a little to allow some of that surface oil to move down to the bottom of the jar.  Repeat this a couple of times and you're well on your way to having all the oil mixed in. You won't have to stir again.<br /><br />Contains no hydrogenated oils and that's a health plus.  The stuff that requires NO stirring has these unhealthful oils.<br /><br />I keep Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter in the refrigerator.  It is a little "liquidy" if kept out.  Refrigeration helps it set up a little better.<br /><br />Easy to measure: if this important to you, then this is the peanut butter for you.<br /><br />Taste is very nice and nutty.  I prefer a tiny bit of salt in my peanut butter and Smuckers does have some salt.  It does NOT taste salty at all, though.
