The 5 lb. bag of Good & Plenty was shipped and received in just 3 days. I have ordered the candy from<br />other sources, and never had it arrive in such good condition, nor as fresh. Other sources are slower in<br />shipping, and often the candy arrived either stuck together or very dried up. Three cheers for Amazon.<br />Keep up the great work. R Read, Vista, CA
