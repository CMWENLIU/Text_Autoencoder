I have been desperately trying to find something to replace the "non-dairy" creamers which I had grown accustomed to in my morning cup of coffee.  I just can't drink coffee without some added sweetening.<br /><br />Then I came across this product!  I can put one tablespoon (and a dash of cinnamon) in my coffee, and I'm good to go.  Easily 60 or more calories less per cup than I was previously drinking.
