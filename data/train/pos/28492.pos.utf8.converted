Yorkshire Gold is simply the best. Not only is the tea good quality, but they pack more into each bag to produce a full-bodied, yet balanced, cup of black tea. Stop searching for the perfect cup of English breakfast tea, this is it. Once you have switched to Yorkshire Gold, everything else pales by comparison. The stuff is made to be enjoyed with milk & sugar so if that's not your bag, you may find it too strong.
