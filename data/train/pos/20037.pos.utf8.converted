On Salad, fish, poultry, beef, soup or steamed veggies, Zatarain's Creole Seasoning enhances virtually any culinary creation. It has a lot of flavor and a nice little "zip" but not what one would describe as "hot" like Tobasco Sauce or Jalapenos. Dinner guests always want to know what that wonderful seasoning is in my food, most of the time it's the Zatarain's.
