GOLDEN flax seed meal is never bitter or gritty, and Bobs Red Mill is the finest quality! We add it to ALL baking and everyone loves it. Example: We use this meal INSTEAD OF FAT in muffins and they are moist and delicious! For instance, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil, we substitute 1/2 cup of golden flax seed meal. Its that simple. The muffins (regardless of the type) turn out tasty and stay fresh for days! This is a MUCH better fatty fiber than any other you could add to baking. Plus, golden flax seed meal SATISFIES! You will require less food when you eat it. PLEASE NOTE - something seldom mentioned about FLAX - it is a laxative! - so add it to your diet slowly, or you may regret it. Flax calms your appetite, aids digestion, fills you up, regulates your bowels, gives STAMINA, and is a great source of Omega III fatty acids, among other things. It adds more value to your diet, naturally, than anything else you've ever tried! Your health will improve SO much after a few weeks of using this meal, you will never stop using it!
