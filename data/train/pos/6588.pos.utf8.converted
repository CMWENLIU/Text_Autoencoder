I buy this for our work and it is only $12.99 per 2 lb bag at Costco and is available and every Costco I have ever been at! I've tried to buy other coffees that could be delivered (instead of me having to go to Costco every week to buy 6 bags)but these coffee fiends insist on the San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast! Guess I will keep going to Costco.
