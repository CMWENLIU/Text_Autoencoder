I first found this product when I lived in Hawaii 20 years ago.  While I can make a stir fry sauce from scratch this product is not only fast but delicious. I purchase the already pre-cut broccolli, cauliflower and carrot mix at the local grocery store.  Then I only need to cut up two large chicken breasts and cook it all up. I can create this dish in under 20 minutes and it is better than what they offer at the local take out establishment.
