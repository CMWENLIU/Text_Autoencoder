I'm a David Pogue fan and enjoy reading Pogue's Posts. I was a bit surprised to see this on his exploration list. I really enjoy Uncle Eddie's cookies (I buy them locally); They have the texture and taste of some of the best home made ones. As a good vegan, I don't eat them with Tuscan Milk (I prefer Westsoy Unsweetened Soy Milk).<br />Jokes aside, these are wonderful cookies...
