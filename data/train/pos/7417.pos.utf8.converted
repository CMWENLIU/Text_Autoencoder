Love this tea. First bought it when I was in England. The disappointing thing about my purchase is the expiration date on the tea box expired last year. When you pay that amount for "imported tea" I expect it to be fresh. It still taste ok but you never know, it was great when I first got it in England. Doesn't quite taste the same..Will not buy from this supplier again. Will have my daughter's friend ship it to me first!
