If you like filberts (AKA hazelnuts) this stuff is scrumptious. The only ingredient is ground roasted hazelnuts. They're not completely pulverized like creamy peanut butter; tiny pieces (fewer and smaller than crunchy peanut butter) liven up the texture. I imagine it would be great as a spread, but it's ambrosia right out of the container with a spoon. Plus, if you add a little liquid sucralose and a touch of cocoa powder, you've got low-carb Nutella. Mmmmm.
