I always hated the diet peanut butters in the store.  You either got high fat and no sweetness, or all sweetness and totally unsatisfying because of the missing fat.  This one is totally nails the taste of real peanut butter so that you arn't missing out on anything.  The chocolate one is just heavenly.  Not too sweet like Nutella, but just right.  Best of all, you can add as much or as little water as you want to get exactly the consistency you like.  You can even add your own peanut pieces, if you want chunky.  You also can make it up in just the quantity you want, so it isn't sitting around as a constant temptation.  Probably has a pretty long shelf life as well, being a powder.
