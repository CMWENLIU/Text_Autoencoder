This product is fantastic. Basically, it's just zero calorie, flavored seltzer, so for those who love the carbonation of seltzer, but none of the nasty high fructose corn syrup, this is what you want and probably already buy at the supermarket.<br /><br />But what makes this so great is the handy 16.9 oz bottle size to bring with you everywhere (as opposed to 2L seltzer bottles), the four-flavor variety pack and the fact that Amazon, at least when I bought this, is selling it cheaply, at about fifty cents a bottle. I'll definitely keep buying this as long as Amazon keeps stocking it and keeps the price reasonable.<br /><br />Flavors included are: Lemon-line, berry, tangerine and natural (unflavored).
