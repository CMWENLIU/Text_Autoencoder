I am a heart patient with Type 2 Diabetes intent on living forever and keeping all my extremities.  I attempt to eat a diet that is both salt and sugar free.  I have prepared my homemade jellies and jams for at least thirty years.  After being diagnosed with diabetes I initially gave up my homemade for tasteless 'sugar free' diabetic jellies and jams from the supermarket.  The jellies I created with Gelatin reminded me of the WWII surplus 'Jello' fed in Army mess-halls in the 1950's.<br />It took me but two tries to get it right with Pomona's Universal Pectin.  I like my jellies a bit tart with very strong flavor.<br />My recipe for "Pomegranate & Cranberry" jelly is:<br />1-  12 ounce can of frozen Old Orchard Pomegranate Cranberry Juice.<br />2-  24 ounces of water.<br />3-  1/3 cup of Real Lemon.<br />4-  1 1/2 cup of granulated Splenda.<br />5-  5 tsp. calcium water.<br />6-  5 tsp. Pomona's Universal Pectin Powder.<br />7-  1 tsp. butter or margarine.<br /><br />Prepare calcium water per package instructions.<br />Prepare three pint jars per package instructions.<br />Dilute one 12 ounce can of frozen Old Orchard Pomegranate Cranberry with 24 ounces of water.<br />Add 1/3 cup of real lemon to the base.<br />Begin heating the prepared juice base, real lemon and calcium water in a 4 quart Teflon sauce pan.<br />Use a hand blender like the Toastmaster 1740 2-Speed Hand Blender to stir the liquid.<br />Add the Splenda, margarine and Pectin powder to the mixture while continuing to blend.<br />Bring the mixture to a rolling boil for one minute.<br />Remove the pan from the heat, skim off any foam with a metal spoon and pour the liquid into the prepared jars.<br /><br />Works for me, and my wife says, "It tastes like real jelly".
