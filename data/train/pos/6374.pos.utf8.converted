I have used this for years for making jams. I have always disliked the overly sweet jams sold in supermarkets, and I don't like the sugar-free variety either-the flavor is artifical. Pomona's gives me the choice of how much sugar I want to use...if so desired, I can use it with no sugar whatsoever! Wonderful product. I would recommend it to anyone.
