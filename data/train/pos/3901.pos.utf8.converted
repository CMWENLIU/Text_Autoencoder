I had my dog on Nutro <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348XG">Nutro Natural Choice Lamb Meal & Rice Formula Small Bites Dog Food- net wt. 40 lbs.</a>but after trying Kevin Trudeau's diet for myself I figured having a food that stopped her from pooping so much maybe wasn't a good idea for her. It gives her the same benefits as her previous diet, but without ruining her future health. She loves the dry and canned food and often has to protect it from the finicky cat.
