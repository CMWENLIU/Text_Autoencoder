This is one of the gluten free flours I have a hard time finding locally. For the price, you can't beat just buying it on Amazon!  It is fresh and consistent, as all Bob's Red Mill products are.  Sweet White Rice flour is NOT the same as White Rice flour, and you can mess up a recipe by not using the right one.  Sweet White Rice flour is from short grain rice, which is much more "glutinous" (sticky), so it will definitely respond differently in a recipe than White Rice flour, which is from less sticky long grain rice.
