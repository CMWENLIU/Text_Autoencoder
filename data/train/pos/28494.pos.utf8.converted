Experienced drinkers of black tea usually discover those from the British Isles. After tasting them, American brand teas seem second rate. There is a similarity in taste and aroma of British teas, yet there are subtle differences, much like red wine.<br /><br />I've made it a point to try as many British tea brands as are available in specialty shops or on line. In my opinion, Taylor's of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold is a cut above the rest. Yorkshire has a red label as well that is more common and less expensive, much like PG Tips. Yorkshire Gold, however, brews a consistently fine cup of tea, cup after cup, exciting the taste buds with its masterful blend. A splash of milk is advised to make the tea more mellow. Just the thought of it makes my mouth water.<br /><br />How about you?
