This is one of the best products in the array of "greens" out on the market.  The taste is most definitely one of the best.  Green Superfood is a great addition to a balanced alkaline/acid diet.  When my body is overly acidic (which is obvious when my stomach or body is sluggish or feeling like I'm coming down with something), I make a shake and it helps to balance it out.  I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.  Or maybe try adding some Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and present it to the kids (sans the liquor, of course).  There is a kids version of this product, also.  Both an adult version and the kids version come in chocolate, but I like making that decision for myself, so I buy the plain.  This is a great way to get your vits/minerals in a powdered, raw food product.  It's gluten free, vegan, and no soy fillers.  Also, 70% organic.  You would have to eat a truck load of raw foods to get the same level of nutrients that you receive in one scoop of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood.  And no, I do not work for the company.
