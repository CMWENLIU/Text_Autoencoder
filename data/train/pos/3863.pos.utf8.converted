The SHU strength of this cayenne is listed as being about one-third less than  the capsules I was using (90,000)but it tastes just as HOT! You can tell it is also very fresh.<br /><br />Some advice: Try to use whatever amount you take either sprinkled on food or, like I do, about an eight to one-quarter teaspoon mixed with about 8 oz of liquid. If you take the capsule form straight (which you can open up), it will shock your system when it explodes in your stomach, possibly doing harm.
