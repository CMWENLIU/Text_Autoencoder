I have a French Bulldog that has developed food allergies and is also a very picky eater. In our quest to find him a food that was good for him and he actually liked eating I stumbled on Taste of the Wild at a local specialty dog food store. I decided to give TotW a chance after trying Canidae and realizing that the protein content was too high for my Frenchie.<br /><br />After switching to Taste of the Wild I immediately noticed an improvement in my pups stool - nice and firm and only 2-3 movements per day. Vice 5+ movements on Nutro and Canidae. My Frenchie's notorious gas was also cut way down. I supplement his dog food with all-natural unflavored yogurt too and this helps cut down on the gas greatly. After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.<br /><br />Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.<br /><br />For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild. Not only are their formulas grain free, but they also use unique sources of protein. For example duck instead of the more readily available chicken as a major protein source.
