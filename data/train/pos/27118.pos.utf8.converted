We bought this for a trip to the BVI - which has tons of mosquitoes, day and night.  It worked pretty well.  We still got a few bites, but not nearly as many as the night we went out without it.<br /><br />There is another review saying this is not DEET.  That is 100% incorrect.  This is 23% DEET, which is a high as you will find in most normal bug sprays.  It is good idea to wash it off after you come back inside or some people might have a reaction to the high DEET content.  Not for little kids.<br /><br />The spray bottle works very well.
