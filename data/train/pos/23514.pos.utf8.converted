We get Coffee People Oranic X-bold through subscribe and save.  Imagine my frustration when our last order contained a box of Jet Fuel.  I'm pretty picky about my coffee.  I don't like weak coffee, nor does my husband.  I decided to try a cup of the Jet Fuel, hoping it was at least tolerable so I didn't have to go through the trouble of returning it.<br /><br />We loved it.  We were bummed when we ran out, and we're now going to switch our subscribe and save to Jet Fuel.
