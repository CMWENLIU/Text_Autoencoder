- UPDATE - 10/28/2011<br />It's been several weeks of using it and there is still a ton of licking left, definitely getting my moneys worth out of this treat.<br />Another thing that has been nice is the ability to keep this in my pocket without making a mess. So going for a walk with it has been nice (and a great way to keep his attention when there are other not well behaved dogs around).<br />- UPDATE -<br /><br />Well the puppy dog has spoken... he loves Lickety Stik!<br /><br />When we first presented it to him he was a bit unsure and tried to bite the stick which was kind of cute but he quickly realized he had to lick it.<br />Now every time the Lickety Stik comes out as a reward or to teach him something, he just can't wait to lick the bejesus out of it.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love it and responds really well to it, it's made in the USA!<br /><br />This is a very unique, clean, easy to use, easy to carry, and fun treat for your dog. I would highly recommend this to most anyone. Way to go PetSafe!
