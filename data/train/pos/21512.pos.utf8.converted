I spent a tiny bit of time in Turkey in the last year and hot apple tea was served. I really enjoyed it and tried to find something comparable when I returned home.  I love this tea in these tins.  The tea comes packaged in plastic inside the tins so it stays fresh.  Since it is loose you can make the tea, hot or cold, to taste.  The apple flavor is strong enough to taste but mild enough that you don't feel you have hit the cider range.
