I have been drinking coffee for well over twenty years and I have finally found a bean that suits my taste buds.  I grind my own coffee so I have only tried the whole bean dark roast and it is the best I have had in years.  If you are a Kona coffee lover than this is the end of the road for you.  I have also made it the coffee standard in our office.
