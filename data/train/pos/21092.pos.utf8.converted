I use Red Star yeast in a bio-reactor for a densely planted aquarium. It works great for that purpose. The bio-reactor produces carbon-dioxide, which is tubed into the aquarium to help the aquatic plants grow. Bakers yeast (which you can buy in any grocery store) works too quickly.  This Red Star yeast consumes sugar at a slower rate than baker's yeast, which is what you want for an aquarium CO-2 bio-reactor. One packet will last a few months, because you only need to use about 1/5th of one packet for each refill of the bio-reactor.
