I have nothing but great things to say about Blue Buffalo's products. I recently tried out the Wilderness brand (duck flavor). My black lab-mix loves it! As he's recently paralyzed, he sometimes has accidents in the house. Since his stool is solid and easy to pick up, clean up is a breeze. He even rolled over the pile in his wheelchair and none of it was ground into the carpet...just flattened a bit. Who knew stool could be so exciting?<br /><br />I definitely recommend Blue Buffalo's Wilderness brands.
