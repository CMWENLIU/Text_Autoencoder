This is another THK food that our Siberian Huskies love.  They started out on premium quality commercial foods, then went to holistic brands, then we found this...The Honest Kitchen has remained a winner for their nutritional needs and taste buds.  It's become a winner to us humans for the quality, whole food ingredients, only food that truly is human grade (with passing USDA guidelines)and the ease of preparing for our sibes.<br /><br />We do also homecook their meals, and they don't exclusively eat THK.  Yet, this is the only "dog food" they will eat, along with whole foods.  We add this into our homecooked recipes for them, serve it on the side or use it as a mix in with other whole foods.
