I am a Hairstylist in Saratoga Springs, NY and a customer turned me on to this product. I love the fact that it has no calories and no after taste that you would associated with a flavored water/ energy drink. It tastes like regular refreshing water and it helps me get through the afternoon slump! I highly recommend this product to replace your afternoon soda or iced tea. Love It!!
