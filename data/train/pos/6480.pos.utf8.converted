I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.
