I stopped eating pop-tarts because of all the junk that was in them (hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, etc).<br /><br />I tried these and - wow!  They are actually better tasting than pop-tarts.  They still have the rich buttery crust, but their filling is actual fruit, and tastes incredible.<br /><br />These look exactly the same as pop-tarts, right down to the foil wrapper and little grooves on the back of the pastry.  They have organic ingredients though, and no hydrogenated oils, white flour, or artificial colors.<br /><br />This doesn't make them completely "healthy" (these are still over 1/3 sugar by weight), but for an occasional snack they are awesome.
