Upon arrival, I read the nutrition info myself on the cereal box and was pleasantly surprised to find they were better than Amazon's listing. They have 6 grams of fiber (balanced soluble and insoluble fiber) in a 1 ounce (28 gram=3/4 cup) serving and only 5 grams of sugars, all for only 100 calories. All this isn't worth much though, if they don't taste good, right? Well, they are good, very yummy, even out of the box. They are rather like "Life" cereal, regular flavor, just a bit less stripped of the good stuff in taste. The whole grains really shine through and they tend to stay crispy in milk much longer. I enjoyed a bowl of them topped with just a fine bit of honey so that the flax seeds I topped them with would stick and not sink to the bottom, a bowl plain with milk, and also a bowl made into a "Muddy Buddies" healthy version. I bought these initially to make the recipe "Muddy Buddies/Puppy Chow" recipe healthier (using alternatively sweetened chocolate, freshly ground almond or peanut butters and some date sugar to toss in after coating. These would also be a great alternative choice for other "Chex" cereal recipes. I like them so much, I will give up my usual choices in cereal that provide the same, or less, amount of fiber for TWICE the calories and that also soak up too much milk in the bowl. Give these a try, they won't replace some of the worst offending sugar laden "kid's" cereals with no one noticing, but these are really a good choice and tasty, and are always handy for those "chex mix" recipes with a healthier spin. If a sugar addict really needs more sweetening, just let them top these with a better choice in sweetener of your own choice, not a giant company's choice in what makes them the most profit. Best of all, we can have something affordable we like the taste of without supporting these huge companies that are ruining our health and economy , as well as putting the family farmers out of business. I can't think of any reasons why I wouldn't recommend these.
