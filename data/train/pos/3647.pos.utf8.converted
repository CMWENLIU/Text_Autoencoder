This is the ONLY canned renal food my kitty will eat (and we've tried ALL of them). Not only does she have kidney disease, but she is also FeLV+ (at the tender age of 18 months), so I really need to stay on top of her health issues. She won't eat pate/minced-style cat food, so these morsels are perfect. She comes running when I open this - like it wasn't even prescription! I can also mix in her various supplements (phos binder, potassium, vitamins) without her noticing. So while we know our baby won't live a long life, she will at least be happy and properly fed.
