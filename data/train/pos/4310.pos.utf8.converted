i'd been making iced sugar-free vanilla lattes at home with my espresso machine and some torani SF vanilla syrup, and noticed a certain "funk" in every one of my drinks... frustrated with how much better coffee bean's lattes tasted, i caved in and bought some of their no sugar added vanilla powder at their location nearest to me, and now i'm hooked.  the funk is gone.  and for the record, to those of you for whom this makes a difference, the powder isn't sugar-free.  i'm okay with this -- despite having type 1 diabetes, i'm willing to make the concession for 10g carbs for it to taste leaps and bounds better.<br /><br />my only complaint is that the can is deceptively large -- once you open it, it's only about half full.  i'll be sure to buy a 3-pack soon, as the in-store retail is $11.95.  another helpful tidbit -- add the powder only to the hot liquid, if you're making an iced drink.  first time around i ended up with unsightly clumps...
