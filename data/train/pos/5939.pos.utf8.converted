This is simply exquisite chocolate - better than Vahlrona and better than any other I have had the pleasure of tasting. Single origin chocolate is definitely a different, better breed and anything in this line - all unique and all very distinctive, flavorful and positively gorgeous - are good choices. Also, remember that any recipe that calls for 70% could use even the 65% Santander too - Get into the 55% Santander and it's more of a semi-sweet use, but let me tell you, it's the most muscular semi I've ever tasted. These are all wonderful eating or cooking chocolates - truly the earmark of a good chocolate product. If you cannot stomach eating it, but it taste "adequate" in recipes, pass it by.<br /><br />This is truly amazing chocolate.
