I bought this pancake mix a few days ago, and more than anything was a little hesitant because the last review was done 8 months ago. Obviously, I was concerned about the production date, because this product contains egg. The expiration date gave me ample time (received 07-05-2010- expiration date 3-11-11).<br /><br />I took a chance, and am glad I did because these waffles/pancakes are DELICIOUS! I USED to use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029K15LC">Bisquick Pancake And Baking Mix Shake And Pour, 10.6-Ounce Containers (Pack of 8)</a>, and was overall satisfied with the taste. I was hoping that these tasted better, and they are. I also use these in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TYBWIG">Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker</a>. The mix has to be more on the thicker side, and makes delicious waffles without ANY sticking. So far, I've made about 8 waffles trying to incorporate them into breakfast, lunch and dinner. The waffles/pancakes are all that, and a bag of chips.<br /><br />The main reason I switched from the Bisquick mix is because multigrain seems healthier. So far, I'm very satisfied with the mix. The pancakes and waffles come out perfect, and taste very fresh. Overall,I enjoy supporting American small/medium sized businesses, and from what I see, this company isn't a huge corporate farm, because of the natural ingredients used. Thanks Heartland. Keep up the great work, in providing a quality product.
