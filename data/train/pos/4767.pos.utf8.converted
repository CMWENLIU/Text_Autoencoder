I was hesitant to order 6 boxes of this item, as we had never tried it, but I was really happy with my purchase. This is a hearty and delicious meal that is super fast to prepare. It has a creamy but slightly chewy texture, and a really nice tang to it. We add onion and chopped veggie crumbles to it for a very filling meal. We liked it so much, that I plan to buy more, and to try other offerings by the same brand.
