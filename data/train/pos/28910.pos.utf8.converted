I have a job with a 3:30am start time.  Getting 8 hours of sleep is a rare thing and the job requires lots of focus and quick reactions.  I thought nothing was more powerful than a caffeine pill at 200mg per pill.  I've been known to break a pill in half thinking 100mg was enough in many cases.<br /><br />After finally trying 5 Hour Energy, I'm shocked at how it seemed to exceed the boost I got from one 200mg caffeine pill AND had the unexpected bonus of feeling an instant pickup with the very first couple of sips from the bottle! I drank it on a empty stomach with no problems. There was a very gradual let down of energy after 3.5 hours for me but not the infamous quick crash associated with caffeine. With a caffeine pill, I start losing the boost after about 4.5 hours.<br /><br />The problem is a bottle caffeine pills is 80% cheaper than 5 Hour so I don't think I will switch completely over to it but rather use it on occasion.<br /><br />NOTE: These supplements are no substitute for a full night's sleep for long-term health. That's also how the immune system is boosted.
