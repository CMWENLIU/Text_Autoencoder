Having grown up eating lots of canned processed crap (Campbell's soups, boxed mac & cheese, Chef-Boy-R-Dee pasta, etc.), I sometimes still find myself hankering for the "delights" of youth--even though I'm now an organic gardening, veggie loving, fresh-and-healthy eating gal. This is where a product like Annie's P'sghetti Loops comes in!<br /><br />Obviously by the name, this is intended for kids. (And I'm sure kids would love them.) But I've happily eaten this for years as an adult, and I always purchase them by the case to save money when I can. Sure, the noodles are soft and somewhat bland--they ARE canned, after all!--but those little soy meatballs have an appealing, slightly chewy-crumbly texture, and the tomato sauce has that touch of sweetness that is reminiscent of those mainstream brands...all of which adds up to make me a happy camper indeed!<br /><br />What I like even better is that this product is natural and organic--no fields of wheat were sprayed with petroleum-based chemicals to make it, which means the beneficial insects are still alive and the groundwater isn't contaminated. ("Conventional" agriculture dumps 3.5 pounds of pesticides PER PERSON on U.S. land; 20% of these approved pesticides are listed as carcinogens by the EPA. Not very appetizing, huh?)<br /><br />Annie's has been promoting organic foods for years, unlike so many newcomers to the "green" trend. (Although better late than never, I suppose.) While I'm not a fan of ALL of her products (the boxed mac & cheese has never won me over), there are others, like these P'sghetti Loops with "meat"balls, that are satisfying to both my palate and my conscience.<br /><br />Sure, it'd be even better if I made homemade pasta (and I often do), but for those times when I want something quick and convenient, this totally fills the bill. :-)
