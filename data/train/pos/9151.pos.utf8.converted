I LOVE this tea-- at first I thought it was just for cold fall/winter days but I find myself fixing a cup all year long.  My husband has me buy it in a case now, since the stores only carry it for a limited time in the fall...  Thank you Amazon for making it available all year. And ginger is good for you!
