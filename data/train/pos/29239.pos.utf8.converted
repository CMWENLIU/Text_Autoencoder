We have been using an air popper for quite awhile, and have found it hard to find popcorn that doesn't just fall into the bowl without first popping.  This popcorn never fails to pop, and you get a very large bowl of it (we used to only get a few handfuls with the store bought brands).  If you love popcorn without all the calories, this is the stuff to get!
