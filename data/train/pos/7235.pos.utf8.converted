I've had dogs before but they were family dogs so were fed the usual Purina or typical grocery store dog foods.  I recently started fostering a pit bull and was given Science Diet for sensitive stomach formula since she had stomach issues.  I used that and her stool was firm but I decided to put her on this food because price isn't as important as her health right?  In a few weeks her fur is amazingly soft!  Anywhere there is short fur it's like stroking a bunny and in the longer areas it's mostly soft and I can tell the rougher stuff is almost all finally gone.  Even in recent pictures I noticed later how shiny her coat is as well.<br /><br />She loves it, her stomach is doing well, and her fur is amazing.  I can't say much about her attitude though since she's as friendly and happy as usual but pits are like that even coming from the worst situations anyway.  Oh yeah, I adopted her last week so she'll be eating Blue Buffalo for a long time to come.  Thank you, Amazon, for having it Prime eligible so it shows up right away.
