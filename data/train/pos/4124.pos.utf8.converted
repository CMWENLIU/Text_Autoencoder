This matcha is simply wonderful!<br /><br />Bright green color and excellent taste. I have been using this matcha for over 6 months now and while it is a little more expensive than most, it is the best that I have tried. The best thing is that it is the best way to get your green tea and is extremely healthy for you. Give DoMatcha a try, I think you will love it too!<br /><br />Don't forget to get a Chasen (bamboo whisk), Chashaku (bamboo scoop) and a Chawan (matcha bowl) to complete the experience.
