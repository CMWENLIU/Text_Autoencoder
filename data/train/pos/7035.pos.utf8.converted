I really enjoy this coffee. I use it at home and work.<br /><br />At work, I use it in my office. With some filtered water and my Black & Decker Cup-at-a-Time coffee maker, I make a cup of hot (just right) water. I put the Folgers coffee bag in the coffee mug first and let the hot water drip onto it while it's making. When the coffee maker (or in my case, hot water maker) is finished, i dunk my coffee bag for about 10 seconds. I then let it sit for about 30 seconds. Voila' ! A wonderful cup of coffee. Another definite plus is the aroma experienced while brewing! It smells so good! Also, I don't have to walk from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor where there may or may not be fresh coffee made.<br /><br />At home, I sometimes like a cup of coffee on the weekend. I use the microwave. These bags have no metal on them, so you can put the bag in the cold water in your mug and then microwave. I microwave for about 1 minute and 45 seconds. (With my microwave, this just brings the water to a boil when the microwave cuts off.) I let the bag sit or a minute or two and I have a great cup of coffee. Others like to heat the water by itself and pour it over the bag in the mug.<br /><br />This coffee taste great, is very smooth and very convenient. The price is very reasonable for what you get. It's also one of the very few coffees I have found that doesn't give me heartburn! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
