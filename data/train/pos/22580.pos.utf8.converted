This has GOT to be the most AMAZING product ever conceived.  Who would have thought we could live in a time where that much water could be stored in such a small space!!  I am flabbergasted and intrigued why no one had thought of this before!  This is the ultimate in 2012-preparations and I will be purchasing another case of these with my next paycheck!  I'm dying to know what these geniuses will think of next!  Now, I need to go buy more aluminum foil for my BOB.  Wonder if they sell that too?  =-o
