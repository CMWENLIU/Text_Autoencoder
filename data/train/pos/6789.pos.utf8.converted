Let's face it, the finger-brush & beef-flavored toothpaste is a nightmare.  My sweet, gentle dog, who seems ok with just about anything that comes her way, drew the line at the fingertip toothbrush.<br /><br />She loves these chews though.  I know because when I give her a treat that she's not crazy about, she'll eat it and stand there looking at me like she's waiting for something better.  If I give her a treat that she likes, she'll trot off happily to the other room to enjoy it. When I give her these chews, she takes off like a bat out of Hades, and she stays occupied longer than with most other chews we've tried.<br /><br />Plus, they really do help keep her teeth healthy & clean, and the vet even mentioned her healthy teeth during her last visit.  Great product.
