title says it all. I am a fiend for this cereal. I just bought it and i can't wait to get it. I love it so much. If it was between this cereal box falling off of a cliff on one side and my significant other on the other side....well you know which one I would choose. If i was an alien i would invade this planet only to eat this cereal.
