My boyfriend got me an Aerogarden for Christmas.  I was VERY excited.  I love gardening but living in an apartment in LA makes it impossible.  Even when I would plant herbs in pots they would end up dying during the summer when temps reach over 100.<br /><br />So the Aerogarden it was.  First I made lettuce which just turned out to be incredible.  Tender, wonderful, and I knew who had touched it from start to finish....ME.<br /><br />Then I used the international herbs.  I made a video of making pesto from the basil that can be seen here http://stage6.divx.com/user/SuperFreak/video/1208084/Making-Pesto---Subtitled<br /><br />It was a ton of fun, I made pesto, home made sphaghetti sauce and mojitos with the herbs I grew.<br /><br />Now I'm on to tomatoes!  I highly suggest buying an aerogarden if you love to garden but can't or don't have the time.
