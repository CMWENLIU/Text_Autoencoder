This is a tasty product, unlike some of the gluten-free foods that I have tried.  It is very crunchy with lots of fruit and nuts.  It has plenty of calories, but I use it as a topping for other, less-tasty cereals, e.g. bran flakes or some of the high-fiber cereals that remind me of twigs and leaves.  I will definitely be ordering more in the future.
