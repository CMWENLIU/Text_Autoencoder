This is a product I won't hesitate to endorse. It has everything I am looking for in a low glycemic index energy bar. It's packed with vitamins and nutrients, is low in calories and tastes great. I give them to my son who has special needs and they help to keep his appetite in check. He loves the peanut butter and chocolate bars. I tend to have dips in my blood sugar between meals and these bars are great as a "hold over" snack until I can eat a meal. The only problem I have is I wish they were sold in more stores.<br />Lois Scian, RN, MA, CHES
