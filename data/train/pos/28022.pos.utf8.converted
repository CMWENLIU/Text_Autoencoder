Be sure to read the reply AFTER the 1-star review. I laughed and laughed. Apparently someone sent this poor person a "mock-up" of the basket that was for testing and photographing. Being in advertising, and creating mock-ups such as these (though not this one) I know the horrible sinking feeling when the "fake" product turns up missing. I hope she liked the real one they sent to correct the problem.<br /><br />Anyway, just thought I'd chime in here so people looking for a cool gift basket won't pass this one by. Me, I'm waiting for the Cyber Monday deal to come around (about 2 hours from now) and then I'll order it.
