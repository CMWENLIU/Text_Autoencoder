Not terribly long ago, I found some really delicious Sunsweet Dried and Pitted Plums on a small bag (about 6 ounces). They were excellent, some of the best dried plums I've ever had. Of course, I wrote them up for Amazon an Amazon review and gave them a 5-star rating. You can probably find my report, if you like.<br /><br />Well, today I visited my local Costco warehouse store and found those same dried plums relabeled under the Kirkland Signature/Sunsweet brand and in a much larger 56-ounce bag. I was delighted and picked up a bag, although this is a lot of dried plums. Anyway, they're an excellent product and much cheaper by the ounce in such a economy large bag. They're good tasting and have a lot of vitamins and fiber and they're not overly high on calories. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />As you may know, plums (or prunes) can be an excellent natural laxative for bowel regulation and I use them on that basis frequently. You might take care with these. They're so delicious that you can easily overindulge and may pay the consequences. Not too long ago, I greatly overate and about a couple hours later I was able to excrete through the eye of a needle. Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, for a little touch of humor, but take care.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
