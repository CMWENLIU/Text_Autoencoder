I bought this tea based on a recommendation an online nutritionist who said it was an excellent tea to promote optimal health and longevity. I have been suffering from adrenal gland fatigue and therefore am not supposed to drink caffeinated beverages. I've substituted this tea for my morning chai and it makes me feel great. It contains gynostemma (http://www.gynostemma.org/) an herb that contains more healthy saponins than any other available. This tea is consumed throughout China and is believed to be responsible, in part, for the longevity of those who drink it. While I can't speak to that, I certainly can say that I feel good when I drink it. And I sleep very soundly even if I drink it in the afternoon. The taste is quite nice, naturally sweet, so you don't need to add any sweetener, which is nice.
