This tea taste is good.Sometimes I add agave to it however not a neccessity.I drink it cold and hot.I find that I really don't want my coffee if I drink it in the morning.I am not sure if it is doing what Dr.Oz said it was good for which was to eat fat cells, I do know that I feel pretty good after drinking it. Good tea, especially if you are wanting off the fifty cup coffee thing a day. Also the seller sent a box of white tea with it, I guess some type of sell, I did not pay extra for it,but they sure have gain themselves a customer with their white tea also, which i believe is suppose to block fat cell(can't remember for sure).It taste good though.
