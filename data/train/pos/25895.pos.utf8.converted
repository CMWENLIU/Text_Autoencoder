I bought this one a little while ago and it is great. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have more space now since I no longer need one of the Keurig cup trees sitting next to my machine, all I need is to slide the draw out from underneath my machine and I have a ton of choices. Thank you. My only regret is that I bought the plastic one and it doesn't look nearly as nice as the glass one does, but maybe that will be my christmas present to myself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This is great!
