I ordered these quail eggs to make the Japanese "bird's nest salad" that is one of our favorites.  Then I found if you use the ginger dressing from that salad to marinate the drained eggs with diced or julienned beets you wind up with something that's even BETTER!<br /><br />These canned quail eggs are just a bit rubbery/chewy on the outside which you expect from an egg which has been cooked twice.  The centers are so creamy they remind you of a really great deviled egg.<br /><br />I'm glad I found these eggs on Amazon because they sure aren't available in any grocery store within reasonable distance of where we live!  Thanks, Amazon!
