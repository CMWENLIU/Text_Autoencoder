I am new to the Superfood concept, and this is one of the first products I've tried.  It is excellent!  It mixes well with anything I happen to dream up, and I found it easy to substute entire meals with my gree smoothies.  I usually start with some organic tea, add ice cubes, Superfood,  then my "special" juices.  I vary between Acai, Mangosteen, and Noni.  And then I also add protiem powder, because I've found that my energy level takes a big dip if I don't suppliment all the green stuff with some protien.  Sometimes I put in a bit of plain yogurt and honey to smoothe it out a bit, but it's not necessary.  I find that I'm sipping on my "green shakes" all day long.  Great stuff!
