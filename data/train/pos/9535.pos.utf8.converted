Read so many reviews about this product that I just had to try it.  So far, I have used it in place of oil and butter, on toast, mixed in oatmeal, and on pancakes/waffles.  I sneak it into anything I can for my kids. It is great on my face, not greasy like I expected, it absorbs and really makes my skin glow.  I put it on my daughter's forehead where she was beginning to get little bumps, and they were gone in 2 days.  Let's see, what else?  I am happy to find a natural product that has so many uses.  I wish I had know about this last year when I had to go through Chemotherapy for breast cancer.  I have read all kinds of studies where coconut oil has been used to help patients after chemo.  I had terrible memory loss and "chemo fog".  Will definitely re-order, and send some to my Dad who has always worried about the possibility of getting Alzheimers.  (Google has great information about this.)  Hope this helps!
