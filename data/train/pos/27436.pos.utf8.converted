I've been making my own pasta now for 2 years and thought I'd give this semolina a try. While I was a bit skeptical going in, I was hugely impressed with the results. My 12 year old daughter who 'lives by pasta' says it's the best...and actually, so do I. I'm disappointed to find it's no longer available on Amazon but I wish you'd reconsider and bring it back!
