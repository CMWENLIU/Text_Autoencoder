This formula is the best out there. Don't be a media-hype sucker. The media are well paid to produce unnecessary hysteria by big business like Hain Celestial Group who happen to produce EVERY organic baby formula including the store brands, except Nature's Only. A little convenient no? Look, EVERY piece of produce you eat, organic or not, and anything produced from that produce has arsenic along with many other heavy metals in it, from past pesticide abuse. Your tap water, well water, even the bottled spring water and juices you drink have more arsenic in them in some cases than this formula. The Dartmouth Doctor who did the testing has admitted as much plus stated the testing they used has an inaccuracy of up to 40%! They did not use the government standard. To boot the other formulas use corn syrup which was recently found to have high levels of mercury and that stupid Life's DHA which is derived from algae using horrible chemicals like hexane. You are telling me that's safer?<br />My daughter has thrived on this formula. I have never had to switch her from anything. Once I stopped breastfeeding, I went right to this and have never had issues. My older son on the other hand, I had to switch the big brand formulas like five time to finally have one that didn't make him sick with digestive issues and colic plus eczema! By that point he was almost off of formula. I swore I would not make the same mistake again and I fully trust and believe in this formula.<br /> I am so tired of this world's misinformation for financial gain at the cost of our health. Please do some research about EVERYTHING you put in your and your children's mouths before you put it in you. The reality is that this one news story has possibly permanently damaged a reputable small business trying to feed our kids right.
