Not everyone can appreciate that quality of water makes a difference. But pure mountain spring water is clearly preferred over tap water. I compare these two kinds of water by the amount of LIFE FORCE still remaining in the water. Since I am way too busy to travel to clean remote places to get high life force water, I have found that I feel better overall, when I can drink a regular  supply of Trivedi water to keep my busy pace of life at maximum speed forward. I have noticed that I have been having a preference for  Trivedi water, at least one bottle a day, sometimes more. My energy is steady, and my temperament is pretty even. I put myself in stressful situations and I can handle them with focused determination and faith that all will work itself out with grace. There just might be some energetic magic in these bottles of Trivedi water, if you can believe and receive. If its a placebo, and life gets better as a result, it could be worth it!<br /><br />My little 7 yr. old niece put it simply, by saying that this water tastes "smart". She could taste the difference between filtered tap water and this energy infused Trivedi water. It became a preference for her to drink it above regular water. I also noticed how she behaved more calm the rest of the day, after she drank it. She seemed more focused after having had experienced the Trivedi effect while she was witnessing the process of infusing the water. I'll be interested in any other significant changes with her well-being in the future. It could be just a coincidence whether she becomes more confident and centered, when before she seemed more insecure, even unsure of herself.<br /><br /> I am so grateful that I discovered this gift that Mr. Trivedi offers seekers of a higher vibration, healthier option in life. He is a renegade, and will definitely shake up a bunch of naysayers, but that's ok with me. Those that remain on this journey, who I meet along the way  have been awesome!!!!!  I love to hear their stories of transformation.  It's just fun to me!<br /><br />Those who can tell the difference between tap water and Trivedi water are pretty evolved human beings in my humble opinion! I think you can observe the health and temperament of those who are sensitive to the difference vs those who can't tell. Who's healthier in general?  I look forward to more products Mr. Trivedi will introduce!  I just heard he's launching energy infused wine. That could be a blast!
