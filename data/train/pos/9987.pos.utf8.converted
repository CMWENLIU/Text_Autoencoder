Best lollipops I've ever tasted, you can tell from the list of ingredients that these aren't going to taste fake/artificial.  Perfect when you're craving something sweet, great when you're feeling nauseous.  I don't have any kids, I bought these for myself and have given packs away to friends who were very happy to receive them.  A big plus for being organic and for not leaving a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  All the flavors included in these packs - Mango Tango, Pomegranate Pucker, Tooberry Blueberry and Wet-Face Watermelon, were equally tasty.  Some reviewers criticized the fact that these are made in Mexico - what's up with that?  Nothing.  These are simply the best lollipops out there!!!
