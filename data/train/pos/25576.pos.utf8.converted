We (three Sicilians) ate the bottarga straight from the package last night. It is delicious. If you don't know what bottarga is, it is made from tuna eggs, salted and dried. It can be used to make a delicious pasta: saute garlic, parsley and hot pepper in olive oil, have some grated bottarga ready, add to oil mixture and toss pasta (linguini or spaghetti are fine) in olive oil mixture and serve with some grated bottarga as garnish. Couldn't be simpler. Remove the skin from the bottarga before using. This bottarga came from Sardenia but it tastes exactly like the bottarga from Sicily.
