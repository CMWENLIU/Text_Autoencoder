These are the only pig ears I'd buy for my dog. Just like the Cadet's I used to buy in the bags.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002SA9AQ">Pig Ears (25 piece)</a>. No skimping out. All pig ears come in one large box and were quite large in size. For the price and quality of the product I wouldn't buy anything else.
