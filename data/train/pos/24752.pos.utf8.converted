After reading the review about the change of ingredients, I contacted Holistic Select to double check the information and they clearly state that there are no pork products in this food. The only change they made was to add canola oil as a secondary fat source. Here is the list of ingredients that they sent to me:<br /><br />Anchovy, Sardine & Salmon Meal, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Canola Oil (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Dried Beet Pulp, Menhaden Fish Oil, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus ni  ger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TSQ6G">Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Anchovy, Sardine, and Salmon Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a>
