The water taste just like I would expect it to...pure clean water!! The fact that it has caffine and theanine is definately a bonus. I actually prefer Element over coffee first thing in the morning. I wake up fairly early each morning to work out and a bottle before and during my hourly routine really hits the spot. The caffine isn't too strong with each bottle - its just the right amount and a few bottles each morning gives me the additional energy needed for my cardio training. Great product..when will it be available in Central NJ??
