I bought 2 cases of these plum tomatoes and have been making fantastic pasta sauces ever since.  I had never seen plum Muir Glen tomatoes in my supermarket and didn't know they existed until I saw them on Amazon. I had bought Muir Glen tomatoes which were good but the plum variety is superior. I recommend them and hope I can re-order them when I run out.
