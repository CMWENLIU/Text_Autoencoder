I am very impressed with the quality of this product!  The raisins are on the small size, but are the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  The price is outstanding...about 1/3 of what I have been paying at my local health food store for a similar product.<br /><br />Note:  If you can only buy a few organics, place grape and berry product at the top of your list.  These products are very highly sprayed in conventional farming operations and will contain large amounts of pesticides!
