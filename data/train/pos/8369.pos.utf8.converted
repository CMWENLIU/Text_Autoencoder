Amazon Grocery has so many different types of sardines available that I decided to try different varieties. The ones from the Mediterranean and southern Atlantic, places like Morrocco and Spain get large in size and they taste OK but for my money I prefer the sardines that come from colder waters. These are from Norway and they are smaller but they have such a wonderful flavor. They are less fatty. They must be healthier?? I think that they are wonderful!
