How about a wide variety of crackers to go with our cheeses? Specialty Crackers even provides a chart for pairing crackers and cheeses. Here's what they say:<br /><br />Chili crackers for mature cheese--We'll try them with the Lancashire<br />Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Sea Salt Crackers for Parmesan and Pecorino<br />Fennel Crackers for pungent cheese--that will be our Stilton<br />Rosemary Crackers for soft cheese<br />Basil Biscuits for Sheep's cheese<br />Mustard and Pepper Biscuits for Cheddar Cheese--we'll try them with our mild, white cheddar<br />Celery Crackers for bleu cheese--again our Stilton<br /><br />I look forward to this adventure! Do you?
