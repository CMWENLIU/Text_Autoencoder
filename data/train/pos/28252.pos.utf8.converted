Here is a drink that I will definitely buy again.  I generally do not drink sodas and my drink of choice is generally water or green tea, but the idea of a natural juice drink with sparkling water peaked my interest.  The can is 8.4 fluid oz. and is 70% pure juice and sparkling water, fortified with vitamins. The juice contains no caffeine, no preservatives and no refined sugars and supplies 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 & Niacin.  Very low in sodium at 1% and sugars, for those who watch that is 21g.<br /><br />As a weight watcher I rarely will spend a lot of calories on drinks but at 90 calories for the can, I feel like I can treat myself to something refreshing and different.  I liked the flavor a lot because it was not sweet like a sparkling cider, it was more crisp, like a green apple (think jolly rancher apple).  I would definitely purchase this flavor again and would love to try some of the other flavors available.
