Really like this sauce.  Great taste, very fresh with just the right amount of seasoning.  Great product to keep in the pantry for a quick meal.  Used the whole jar to make manicotti stuffed with a basil ricotta mixture, and everyone loved it!  I did not have any problems with the jars arriving damaged.  They came in a nicely packaged box, no seals were broken.  The jars are very nice but there is a sticky residue left on the plastic container after soaking of the label that I can't get off, so although I'd like  to reuse the jars, I probably won't because of the sticky residue.  Anyone have any luck getting it off?
