Okay -- so 6 months ago I gave up red meat and poultry for both health and environmental reasons.  Then 3 months ago I upped my % of fresh foods daily to about 75%.  And I'm buying organic dairy and veg/fruit.  And baking my own hi-fiber bread with organic flour.  And I've lost about 27lbs -- without much pain and suffering.<br /><br />But I gotta tell you -- these little tiny dishes (which are NOT biodegradable, though the comparable cornstarch dishes are available...) which amount to about 6 small bites and still contain ingredients Betty Crocker should be ashamed to market to an already allergic, asthmatic, obese, and energy guzzling population --<br /><br />well, they're actually good.  Easy.  Fast.  Limited serving size.  Better if you add about 1/2t of real cocoa powder (emphasize REAL -- like Dagoba organic which you can get online from World Wide Chocolate....)<br /><br />If I were Queen, I'd just have Dagoba make these, use the cornstarch environmentally friendly bowls, and no nasty little preservatives and less than healthy fats.<br /><br />Try these at your own peril.  Betty Crocker should be shot.
