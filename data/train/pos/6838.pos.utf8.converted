I'm surprised at the review for this product prior to mine. We are Gluten and Casein Free in our house and this is the BEST bread mix we have found yet. We use Smart Balance Vegan butter (made with olive oil) and this recipe tastes perfect. I'm VERY picky about the bread I eat and so are my kids, this tastes soft and isn't $8 a box. We get them from KA direct and its only $5.75 or so a box. Worth every penny for those looking for a good GF bread.
