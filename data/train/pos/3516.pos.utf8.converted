I received a box of the Nature Valley Roasted Almond Crunch bars and a box of the Nature Valley Peanut Crunch bars to try and write a review on.  They are both delicious but I admit the Nature Valley Peanut Crunch bars is my favorite!  My husband preferred the Nature Valley Almond Crunch bars but he also likes almonds more than I do.  These bars were not at all what I initially expected.  They are almost like a brittle.  They are sweet and crunchy.  The Almond Crunch bars contain almonds, sunflower seeds and peanuts.  The Peanut Crunch contain peanuts, sunflower seeds and almond flour.<br /><br />I have always liked granola and protein bars because they are easy to take with you and give you a quick pick me.  Low and behold, I have found a replacement!  I'm definitely hooked on the Peanut Crunch bars and I keep one in my purse at all times.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try these tasty bars at least once.  You can't go wrong with either of these YUMMY crunch bars and you won't be disappointed!
