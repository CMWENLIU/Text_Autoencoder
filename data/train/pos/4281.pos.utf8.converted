Grocery stores are usually around 20 cents per package; however, the selection is less than stellar for Nissin and Maruchan. Amazon's price is sometimes a little higher, but considering there's a better selection of Maruchan than I can find elsewhere, it is definitely well worth it. I can't even find the Maruchan Chili [Pepper] in grocery stores (though I can sometimes find the Nissin of the chili pepper flavor in stores). I got these Chili Pepper noodles on Amazon for around 25 cents each.<br /><br />The Maruchan chili is a bit more spicy and tastes different than the Nissin chili noodles. I'd say I like both equally well. No matter which flavor, they're a bit too salty. I sometimes will use one seasoning packet with one noodle package, because it tastes so good, but once in awhile I'll use half of the seasoning packet for one noodle package. I usually eat two noodle packages, so I just put in one seasoning packet. I put in about half of the suggested water in the frying pan to cook the noodles and all the water simmers away with no water leftover. I add the seasoning packet at the very end of cooking, so the flavor of the seasoning is still prominent, even with half the suggested seasoning.<br /><br />I like the noodles in various ways. I sometimes will add one or two eggs while cooking the noodles. Other times, I'll mix in a half cup of mixed frozen vegetables while it cooks.
