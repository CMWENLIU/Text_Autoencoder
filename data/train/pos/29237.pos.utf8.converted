We love this popcorn! We eat popcorn 3 to 5 nights a week, so we always look for an excellent product that's not overpriced. It is everything I hoped it would be: organic, flavorful, few hulls, and pops with few unpopped kernels. We're putting this on auto-ship so we never run out. Thanks, Arrowhead Mills! Once again you have produced a product we can trust. And thanks, Amazon for carrying a name I trust.
