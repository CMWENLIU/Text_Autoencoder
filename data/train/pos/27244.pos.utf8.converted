Like other reviewers, I loves me some Tijuana Mamas. But I just recently discovered these, and I like them even better.<br /><br />The ingredients are similar, but these are beefier and, I think, just a tad hotter. (I'm reviewing Screamin' Demons here. Hot Heads are almost as hot, but not as fat as Demons.)<br /><br />They're made of a soft more-or-less-meatlike substance rather than proper sausage, but if you've had Tijuana Mamas before, you'll know what to expect. These are a bit harder than TMs but with a similar texture.<br /><br />Great snack -- and if you like spicy flavors the way I do, you'll also have a good time sucking out the leftover hot vinegar after eating the sausage.<br /><br />Nutritious? Hell, you've got your pork hearts, your vinegar, your pepper extract -- that's three of the basic food groups right there. The only one missing is alcohol, and I understand it's possible to get that from supplements. ;-)
