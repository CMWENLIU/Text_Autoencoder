I ordered this because of the price and when it arrived and the box said "fits MANY keurig brewers" I was a bit worried.  But the pod fit perfectly in my B70 and the coffee that it made was outstanding.  I understand the concern about it not being "airtight" but storing it in an airtight container works and I like that it is a little less plastic being put into the trash.  This, and my Ekobrew refillable k-cup, are my favorite things for my Keurig.
