This stuff is great, my kids love it!  No artificial colors, flavors, no sugar, and no harmful chemicals like the blue stuff, pink stuff, or yellow stuff.<br /><br />You have to know how to do it right though!<br /><br />First off, use about half of what they suggest.  You can always add more later if you want more, but with Stevia if you use too much it will taste bitter.  Some flavors require more than 1/2 strength.  With orange for example I use their recommended amounts, but the other flavors are anywhere from 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended amounts.  Always start with less and add more until it tasts right for you.<br /><br />Secondly, it takes a long time for it to dissolve.  Mix it in and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before trying any, and really it is best after sitting in the fridge overnight.  If you just dump some in the top and take a drink you will be VERY disappointed as it will clump and just sit there.<br /><br />We use a dispensing refrigerator container so the kids can serve themselves.  I make 5L at a time, one of each flavor and it is always a hit.
