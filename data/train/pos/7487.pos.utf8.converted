I love to cook and bake, and I experiment with a lot of kinds of flours. This is my standard though whenever I'm working on a new recipe.<br />It's very finely ground and works gorgeously in everything I've tried it with so far. In yeast breads it creates a nice fine textured bread. In baking powder/baking soda recipes like biscuits or cakes it's perfect. It's so light that it rises very well.<br />Last time I made dumplings using this flour, they got so light and fluffy they nearly came out of my pot. I use a combination of baking powder and baking soda in my dumplings with just a touch of vinegar in the wet ingredients for the baking powder and baking soda to work with, that technique combined with this light flour made them rise very well.<br />The flavor is nice if you like whole wheat.
