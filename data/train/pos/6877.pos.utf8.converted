This is a very portable bottle. I have a pretty knowledgeable background in the way of spices and sauces, being an avid cook and also the child of restaurant owners.  Maggi Seasoning is one of the better soy sauces with very few really being better. You can definitely use it as a substitute for any recipe calling for regular soy sauce.  (Note: Dark Soy is a different product. This isn't bitter/thick enough to be a sub for dark soy).<br /><br />You get really good salt/soy taste, without the bitterness that sometimes happens with crap brands like Kikoman or Dynasty.  Lee Kim Kee is also good and easy to find, but I personally till prefer Maggi.  There are a few hard to find brands that aren't bad.
