My husband uses all of these favors in his coffee drinks; it is hard to pick a favorite because they all taste so rich and flavorful. They are in plastic bottles, wrapped up nice and sent quickly. My husband scoffed when I originally bought this pack, but once it arrived (the next day, love amazon!) He thought I was a genius! With two vanillas (regular and French) hazelnut, peppermint, caramel, and raspberry it's a great selection for a great price. Highly recommended.
