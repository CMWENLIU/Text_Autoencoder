We like this because it is simple to make, use it at home and camping.  Low calorie and fat, decent fiber and protein.  Cant find it locally, so we order from Amazon.<br /><br />It can get dry and stick to your hands when forming the patties- oiling your hands with olive oil when forming the patties makes it much easier.  We also add a little oil to the mix.  Fry slowly in a little olive oil in skillet or on an electric griddle type grill.  Add more oil to mix if the patties end up too dry.
