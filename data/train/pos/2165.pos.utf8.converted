Since there's no pic of these dog bones, I wasn't sure what I'd be getting, but (in case you want to know) they look like all the other dog chew bones -- big white knotted pieces of rawhide. They come in a flimsy bag that popped open but since they're also in a shipping box, it didn't really matter to me. The thing that matters most to me is that I get the MOST rawhide for my dollar because my 3 dogs chew through this stuff pretty fast.<br /><br />At first my dogs weren't too excited -- I guess because these are not flavored like some of the smaller brown or yellow bones, so I just set them on the floor and walked away. It only took a few minutes before they picked them up and began chewing away on them. Now, when I hand them out, they don't hesitate to happily run off to their corners and chew.<br /><br />Now, price-wise, it works out to $0.24 an ounce for these long-lasting bones. When I compare that to even the "cheapy" bones from the 99 Cent Store, it's HALF the price. So I'm pretty satisfied and my dogs are BUSY.
