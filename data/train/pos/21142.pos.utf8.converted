What an outstanding spice blend!!!  It will allow you to create a most unusual and delicious dish -- a wonderful blend of spicy, sweet and tangy flavors accenting the chicken.  Adding dates, sesame seed, cilantro, honey and lemon to the exotic blend of spices, you will create a dish that is quite unlike anything you've ever eaten. Great for holiday parties, too, since it can be made in advance.  You and your guests will find this Moroccan chicken is absolutely delicious!!!!!!
