I ran upon this in the grocery store and it looked like it would be good. I love spicy sauces.<br /><br />I thought it would be good but this is WOW! It isn't just a hot sauce, it has flavor. It is so good. It's good on chicken and eggs. It is out of this world on cottage cheese, sounds like a strange combo but I haven't tried anything that it tasted so good on, the cool of the cottage cheese, the heat of the chili sauce, yum!<br /><br />It does have a good bit of heat to it. I have to have something close by to drink because it does burn the tongue a little.<br /><br />I'm addicted now and will be a lifelong lover of this chili sauce. I find myself looking through the refrigerator just looking for something to put my chili sauce on.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good.
