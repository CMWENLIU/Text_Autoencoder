I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.
