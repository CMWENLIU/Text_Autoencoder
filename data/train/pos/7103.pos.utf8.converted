My daughter cannot have milk or dark chocolate.  A few Halloweens ago, we found some white chocolate KitKat bars that had been tinted orange.  She was ecstatic, as KitKats were always her favorite candy bar.  I bought up all they had.  We haven't gotten them back in our area for several years, so she has gone candy bar-less for quite some time.  I found these online and purchased them.  I got them very quickly.  I can't wait for her to open them on Christmas morning!
