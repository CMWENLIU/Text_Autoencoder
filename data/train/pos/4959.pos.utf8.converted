Acana is manufactured by a canadian company that is also a maker or orijen, but its designated for dogs who dont do well on high protein, which was a case with my dog, hes moderately active 3 year old weim, but was putting on weight on orijen, so this was a great addition to his diet. He loves the taste just the same and I've had no issues with it, glossy coat, lots of energy, no ear or eye infections. Plus I like that fact thats they use free range chickens which appeals to my ethical side, since I only buy organic and free range myself.
