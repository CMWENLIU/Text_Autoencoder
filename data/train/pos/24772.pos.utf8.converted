My two sons have both been brought up on Nestle Good Start with DHA & ARA.  After the first three types of formula made my first son throw up all the time (Similac, Enfamil, and Similac Lactose-free), our doctor suggested Good Start and we've had much better luck.  There must be something to that whole "Comfort Proteins" label on the can.<br /><br />As for people complaining about the price, I don't know how they do their math.  We've bought cans of this stuff from Wal-Mart and Target, and Amazon is cheaper by dollars, not cents.  Here are my tips:<br /><br />1: You love Amazon, so sign up for Amazon Prime.  You'll get the formula in two days without paying shipping.  This eliminates people's claims that shipping makes it more expensive than Wal Mart and people's complaints that it takes four months (which is a problem with Amazon Grocery early in its genesis, not a problem with the formula itself).<br /><br />2: Use the Grocery3 or other $10 off promo code while you can.  This, combined with Amazon Prime's free two-day shipping, makes the cost of each can of formula less than $22 with no sales tax.  Maybe if you live in Oregon and don't have sales tax and your local Target or Wal Mart for a goof drops the price to lower than $22 and you happen to live next door to Wal Mart and don't have to drive there, wait in line, and drive home, you can beat the price.<br /><br />In summary, this is good formula that lives up to its claim about being easier on babies' stomachs, and if you work the system, it's cheaper to have it delivered to your doorstep than to go fight the crowds at your local superstore.
