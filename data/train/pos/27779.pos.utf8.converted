I have two large dogs, one a yellow lab, and the other a lab/dalmation mix.  Both of these were on prescription foods(not the same, so quite costly), one had been treated for bladder stones, the other had pancreatitis. I tried Wellness and they have both never looked so good,and been so healthy. No recurring health problems which were a constant worry, and the best part they know can eat the same mix.<br /><br />Terri W.(Augie&Dusty's mom)
