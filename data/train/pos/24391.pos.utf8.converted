When I was a kid (and dinosaurs roamed the Earth), I used to get a bag of Gummi Bears just like these, and a bar of Milka<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024G8WI">World's Best Milka Chocolate - Alpine Milk, 10 Bars</a> from my Oma and Opa in Germany.  As I devoured the sweets, I used to think that I was the luckiest kid in the world.<br /><br />Unlike so many things from my childhood, these haven't changed a bit.  They still come in five colors with amazingly fresh fruit flavors. These little packets each contain about nine little bears, and are just the right size to stick in a pocket or purse for a surprise pick-me-up. I keep them in the house to comfort a boo-boos reward an unexpected high test score, or to celebrate a sunny afternoon.  This large package contains 75 little packets in a sturdy plastic box that the Haribo people encourage you to reuse.<br /><br />If these treats were a part of your childhood, you can buy these without the fear that they've changed - they haven't.  If you haven't experienced the bears that started the current craze of all things gummi, they're well worth trying.  But please, save the white ones for me!
