Go ahead and google it. Oily fish like herring and mackerel keep you well down there. They're chock-full of omega-3 fats. Just as important, these little lifesavers--unlike tuna--are at the bottom of the fishy food chain, meaning that they have much lower mercury levels than well, tuna. I've been eating herring for years and Bar Harbor's taste like they just came out of the sea. Okay, that's not true but they do taste much better than every other canned fish I've tried.
