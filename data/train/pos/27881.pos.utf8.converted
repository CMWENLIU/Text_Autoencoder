Sugarfree Red Bull is by far better than its sugar filled brother. With only 10 calories per can, it tastes lighter and crisper than that "other" Red Bull. It can't replace the morning coffee, but after a workout, it can make you feel significantly better until you can replenish with food.<br /><br />However, the prices on Amazon are NOT a good deal. The only way it is a good deal is if you simply can't find the product anywhere. You can regularly find a 12 pack at any Wal-Mart or grocery store for $20. If you really need 24, then go buy two 12 packs for just over $40. Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 more? But gas you say? Please, if you spend $10 in gas to get to the store, then by all means buy your Red Bull here. Anyway, to reiterate, great product-horrible Amazon prices.
