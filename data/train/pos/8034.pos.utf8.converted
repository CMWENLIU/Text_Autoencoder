This is the salt that started the whole fancy salt craze, go to any fancy gourmet store this days and you will find 20+ varieties of exotic salts from Hawaii to Tibet (yes Tibet...go figure!) with every color shade from grey to pink. If you ask me, that's the only Salt you need in your pantry, this is the real thing! Harvested by hand in Guerande, France and dried under the sun, a little crystal on your tongue is like breathing the fresh marine air of Brittany. Use it on cooked scallops, fish and even meat and it will take your food to another level. Highly recommended by a Private Chef and many many Celebrity chefs out there.
