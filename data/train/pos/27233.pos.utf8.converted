Start out with 1/4 cup of Nutlettes. I began with one-half cup. They swelled up with the milk and seem to grow in the mug as I ate frantically to finish them. I fell behind as they inched their way up my coffee mug. I'm diabetic and Weight Watchers so I was thrilled to get any cereal at all. Now I'll approach Nutlettes cautiously, but happily.
