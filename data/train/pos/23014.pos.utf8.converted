eden brand is the only canned brand i use because they are the only company that does not include BPA in the can lining and they use steel and not aluminum cans. these beans are yummy, perfect texture and very versatile. use in chili with the can juice or rinse and put in salads or with rice. i puree them with lots of starchy veg to make veggie burgers-amazing!<br />and great price for a whole bunch, much less than at the healthfood store.
