My son has multiple food allergies (soy, corn, wheat, walnuts, peanuts, dairy and sesame)  and the awesome things is that he can have these. It's so hard to find snacks for him and we went to a birthday party where somebody packed these in the goody bags.  We were surprised when we looked at the ingredients and found out he can actually eat them and doesn't have to feel left out while the other kids eat it.  The hardest ingredient to get away from in these type of snacks is high fructose corn syrup which this product doesn't contain.
