Errrr, I hate to tell you folks this, but this is made from the whole leaf, LOL. Check out the Sweetleaf website. This one is made more for topical applications. It won't hurt to drink it because it doesn't have anything harmful in it but it's more for skin irritations and such, that may be why you guys didn't like it in beverages.<br /><br />This dark concentrate is renowned for its ability to soften skin and help to smooth out wrinkles. Just apply, and after 30 to 60 minutes wash it away. It's worth trying on any skin problem. You'll be amazed!<br /><br /> Unrefined whole leaf concentrate made with water<br />- Helps pancreas<br />- May help regulate blood sugar levels<br />- Can be used as a topical agent for blemishes<br /><br />It's still sweet and you could use it that way, but since it's made from the whole leaf all those great plant phenols and stuff are flavoring the coffee;)<br /><br />It's a very easy mistake to make with Stevia.<br /><br />Having said that, I'll say this. Sweetleaf is the only company I've run across so far that doesn't add fillers and other sugars to their Stevia. I love Sweetleaf Stevia.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is a processed hydrolyzed starch used as a filler by a lot of companies. My question is why?<br /><br />There are a couple of other sugars they like to add too. Stevia is great all by itself. It seems as though they're determined to muck up a very healthy thing, sigh.
