Pepsi had stopped making Sobe No Fear.  Recently a company called ShadowBev.com picked up the No Fear brand and is making it again.<br /><br />We have started to see No Fear come back on the shelves in Seattle area.  Had a can and it still tastes great.<br /><br />Nice to see it is available on Amazon too.
