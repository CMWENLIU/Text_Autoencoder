I wasn't sure whether to get my niece (age 2) a stuffed shark or a stuffed banana. Fortunately, I didn't have to choose. Sharkbanana can be anything I want, as long as what I want is a shark, a banana, or both. Still, there's something to be said for a multitasker like that.<br /><br />Niece loves it. Dog loves it too. It has a handy carrying loop, as well as a secret stash pocket in its tummy.
