Don't think of this as tasting like hamburger.  Just think of it as tasting good.  We love this product - and this is really a very good price considering that it ships for free.  One can is approximately the same quantity as 1 lb. of ground beef.<br /><br />Some examples of what we do with this product:<br /><br />hash:<br /><br />saute small cubes of potato & chopped onions, add burger, break up lumps, & brown all together; add a couple of shakes of (optional) Angostura Worcestershire sauce [no anchovies in that brand], & serve with eggs for breakfast or veggies for dinner; even buttermilk ranch dressing is good on this.<br /><br />stir fry:<br /><br />brown burger & set aside, stir-fry onions, celery, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bean sprouts, mushrooms, radish slices, and/or water chestnuts (or whatever combination of veggies you like) as you would for any stir fry; add burger to reheat & serve with Ramen noodles or other pasta, on bread, or just as is, with soy sauce or Angustura Worcestershire sauce.  Buttermilk ranch dressing is good here, too.<br /><br />burgers:<br /><br />to each can of burger, add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 rib of finely chopped celery, 1/4 C. chopped green pepper (optional), 2 eggs, 1/2 C. cracker crumbs, 1/2 C. oatmeal; form into patties & brown over moderate heat [onions & celery must be done & raw eggs thoroughly cooked]; when crispy on both sides & done inside (about 7 min. per side), serve on buns, rolls, bread, or plate with mayo, ketchup, onions, pickles, tomato, sprouts, or other burger fixin's.<br /><br />casseroles:<br /><br />1 can burger browned with onions & celery, 1 tsp. sage, 1 can mushroom soup, 1/2 soup can milk, 6-8 oz. noodles (cooked),  16 oz. shredded cheddar cheese, 8 oz. Jack cheese; reserve half of the cheddar, mix all other ingredients together & put in greased casserole, top with remaining cheddar, bake covered at 350 F. for 1 hour, remove cover & bake 15 minutes more<br /><br />quick burger:<br /><br />open both ends of the can, push contents out a bit, slice carefully, & brown in skillet until very crispy on both sides (turn carefully) for a quick sandwich filling.  You can sprinkle on a bit of onion and/or garlic powder or other seasoning before turning the slices.<br /><br />Bon appetite!
