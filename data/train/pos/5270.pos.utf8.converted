Having grown up in France and eaten more than my fair share of couscous, I can tell you that this is the real stuff from North Africa - right down to the brand names.  Le Cabanon, DEA, and BEA are the original brands and all are great.  Anything outside of these brands tend to be hybrids from the Middle-East (as opposed to North Africa), and are much saltier.
