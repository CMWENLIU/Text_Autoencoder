To anyone looking for a natural remedie,this is the greatest!I have used other brands,believe me,in price and quality I find this one the best option.Wheatgrass and a healthy lifestyle is all you need to be in the best shape,of course with exercise,drinking water,etc.I have reflux disease and was taking Nexium for several months until I noticed that the wheatgrass was helping me,so I dumped the Nexium!The reflux is better,my digestion is much better and it's even helping me loose weight!That's because it makes your metabolism faster.You can use wheatgrass for any disease(there's information that even for cancer!)Of course if you're on medication Do Not drop it unless your doctor says so.Wheatgrass will not harm you.It can only do you good.I'm not completely cured of the reflux disease yet,but maybe that's because I have to put more raw food in my diet,specially alkaline foods.Wheatgrass is probably the food with the highest alkaline content available.By the way,when you mix it with water with a spoon,have some patience until it completely dissolves,mix it like maybe for 3 minutes.The most expensive brand I've<br />seen on Amazon reacts like this too and the NOW brand has a much better price and same quality,also certified organic!To me,this product regulates your body functions so it works as it should.If you grow and juice wheatgrass<br />in your home,it's more potent,but if you don't have the time,this is a great option.Take it three times a day to see faster results!To your health!!
