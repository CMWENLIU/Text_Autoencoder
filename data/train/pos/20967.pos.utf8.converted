I would love to have gotten what I ordered but I was sent the regular bragg seasioning and I dont know why- however I like both of these they are the very best- even though I wanted the sea kelp delight flavour I did not want to complain about getting the wrong one but I think you need to check your orders better because someone my not be as nice about it as I am . so Im writing this review to let everyone know that both bragg seasionings are the best of the best and you got to know its the truth  if Im willing to spend 10.70 for a bottle of spice , receive the wrong flavour and am still a very happy customer LOL
