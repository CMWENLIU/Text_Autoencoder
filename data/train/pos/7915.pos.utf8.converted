Certain brands of Lady Fingers are inappropriate for tiramisu because they remain crisp, even after being dipped in espresso.  These Bellino Savoiardi Lady Fingers soften very well and are excellent for making tiramisu.  They are also good on their own, with a cup of coffee for breakfast or with fruit for a light lunch.
