I found these chocolates at Cosco, and they were selling for $10. So I bought a jar of them to hand out to a class of kids. When I got home, I tried one, and my tastebuds were instantly lavished with a sense of luxuriance. As I indulged on all nine of the assortment's palatial flavors, I languished over the thought that such delights would only be ingested lackadaisically by the likes of children, who would care not for the intricacies of their opulent sapor; so I ate them all myself.
