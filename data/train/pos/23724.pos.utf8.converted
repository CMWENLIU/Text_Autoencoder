This is a great GF flour, use it in place of white flour.  Only thing I noticed is sometimes you need to add more than a 1:1 ratio in recipes calling for wheat flour to get the stiffness you need.  Also the addition of Xanthan gum makes for better consistency using this flour.  The back of the packet of flour tells you how much to use depending on the type of finished product you're making.  A bag of Xanthan gum is pricey, but the amounts you need (ie 1/4 tsp for each cup of flour for cookies) is minimal, so it will last for oodles of bags of this flour.  I use the Bob's red mill Xanthan gum too.
