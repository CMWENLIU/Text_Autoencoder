I am a black american female, and this oil loves my hair. I mix the oil with Alma Powder and it works wonderful.<br /><br />I also add the oil to my hair after I wash and place a plastic bag on my hair for about 1 hour. and my hair feels so<br /><br />soft. and by the way the smell does not bother me. I will continue to buy this product.
