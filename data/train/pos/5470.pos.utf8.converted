*****<br />This is a peanut butter you can feel truly good about eating AND about giving to your children. Look up "palm fruit oil" on the Internet...google it...it is extremely healthy...the base of this peanut butter. Note that there IS added sugar, but it is relatively little.<br /><br />I normally eat unsweetened peanut butter as well as other nut butters and find this lightly sweetened peanut butter a fantastic treat. Put a little of this on a whole grain cracker and you'll be in heaven! In my case, it satisfies my sweet tooth and I don't want more--say a rich dessert--and so I am thrilled to tolerate the slight amount of sugar for the huge amount of benefit.<br /><br />No matter if you are a commercial peanut butter consumer or a purist who loves unsweetened raw nut butters--you will find much to love here--ESPECIALLY after you research all of the benefits of palm fruit oil. My husband is a junk food and fast food man and he also loves this...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
