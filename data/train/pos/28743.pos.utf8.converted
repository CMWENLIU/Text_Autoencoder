I've been eating Claxton Fruitcake since I was a kid and trust me, I'm no longer a kid!  The fruitcake everyone jokes about is awful, it has some fruit and generally dried out cake holding it together. This fruitcake is amazing to behold.  It's a relatively small loaf and it's quite firm.  There is "cake" but you have to look for it.  The fruit and nuts are fresh and fantastic.<br />It wouldn't be Christmas without a Claxton Fruitcake!  By the way, I've found it in the past at my local Fry's (Phoenix, AZ). Fry's is owned by Kroger so look around before you pay for shipping.
