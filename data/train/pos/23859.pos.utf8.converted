I bought some of this tuna on clearance from my local Food Lion for about a dollar a can.  I had never had tuna like this before.  It is like eating a filet of tuna.  I pair it with Glutino crackers and it is divine.  If you can afford the price, it is well worth it.  I feel better about eating tuna that is randomly tested for mercury and PCB's and I like that it is caught responsibly and that some proceeds will go to help sea turtle preservation.  This is the kind of company I like to support if I can afford it!
