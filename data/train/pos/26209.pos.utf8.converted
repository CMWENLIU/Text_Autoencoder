I've had all flavors of Skippy and one jar of every other brand I could find, including the old fashioned ones that separate, and this one was the best for my needs.<br /><br />It tastes as good or better than regular skippy.  The taste is very much like Skippy's regular product.<br /><br />On the topic of texture, it is like a more spreadable version of Skippy or JIF.  If regular peanut butter was thick enough to tear bread if you spread it too quickly, this one is not.  It goes on smooth, as if it was whipped.<br /><br />This peanut butter doesn't stick to the mouth as much.  There is still some of that beloved sticking action, but only half that of normal PB.  The mouth-feel of this peanut butter is differemt than any I've had, so you may like it or dislike it.  Personally, I think it's a lot better.<br /><br />A response to some criticism I've read about this peanut butter that made no sense to me, for the sake of explaining why these criticisms should make no sense to you as well:<br /><br />Is this product dishonest for saying "All Natural" without containing only peanut oil?  No.<br />The bad reviews this received focused on how it has palm oil, and those reviewers seem to think that means it is a dishonest product, since it says "All natural".  I could go on a rant about how crude oil is natural and turpentine is organic, but it would make more sense to explain that "All Natural" peanut butter doesn't have to be the type that separates.  The stuff that separates is typically "Old Fashioned" or "Home Made" peanut butter.  If your Peanut butter is separating and it says "All Natural" you need to be aware that they are following only one possible "All Natural" formulation for peanut butter and that the kid that you are looking for is more reliably found with an "Old Fashioned" written somewhere on the jar.<br /><br />Another thing I've heard is that it contains sugar and salt, and that any "All Natural" product shouldn't have those.  To that I ask, "Do you know what the definition of 'Peanut butter' is?".  Peanut butter is not a spread made of peanut flour and oil, and never has been.  Since day one it was flavored with oil and/or salt.  Being put off by the salt and sugar content is like being upset that lemon-aid contains sugar or water instead of lemons alone.  If you are in the market for a diabetic friendly peanut butter, this is not for you,  Stay away.  If you are looking for something low in salt, because of your high blood pressure, stay away from this product.  It is only as low in salt as the average "Peanut Butter" in the same isle of the store.  If you are trying to eat healthily and want to avoid sugar or salt, find one that doesn't have those ingredients, but don't blame Skippy for making a bad product when the definition of peanut butter nearly always calls for sugar and salt, historically.<br /><br />Is peanut oil more healthy than palm oil peanut butter?  Depends on your beliefs.<br />I like coconut oil, and coconut oil comes from the coconut palm.  Palm oil isn't exactly canola, but it has one great property that you aren't going to get in peanut oil.  It leaves the peanut butter thick and creamy, without the separation.  There are almost no people who believe saturated trans fat is healthier for you than palm oil, so from that perspective this is a huge gain in healthiness over regular Skippy that I've been eating all these years as my favorite peanut butter.  Peanut oil might be healthier than palm, to some people, but it is solely omega-6, so if that someone is in the US, they are probably consuming too much omega-6 already.  If you're looking for an oil soup with some peanut plaster at the bottom, definitely buy "Old Fashioned" peanut butter, but for people like me, who value texture, this product is the ultimate blend of healthy and enjoyable.  You can't have everything ideal in life, and if you could there wouldn't be any peanut oil in this product at all... it would be omega-3 based algal oil.  No oil is perfect and I like my peanut butter creamy and without needing a long mixing process that ends in a product that is different on the bottom of the jar than the top.
