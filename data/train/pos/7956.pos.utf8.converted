Eaten by themselves, Yacon slices are pretty bland. The taste and texture is somewhat akin to dried apples.<br /><br />I mostly use Yacon in the blender, as a raw chocolate smoothie sweetener, supplementing the goji berries, cacao nibs and some frozen fruit, like blueberries, and maybe some kale. It makes a sweet counterpoint to the bitter stuff like the chocolate and the veggies. Yum.<br /><br />Supposedly, there are also a lot of health benefits to Yacon, and is a diabetic-friendly sweetener. And since it bypasses the GI tract and instead gets processed in the colon, Yacon helps balance the gut flora and aids in digestion.
