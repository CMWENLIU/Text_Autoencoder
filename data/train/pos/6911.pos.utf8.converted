I used this cake as a base for a charity sale right after the Christmas holidays.  I cored the center making the cake into a large bowl.  I filled the center with a zaballione custard.  We sliced the cake into 24 pieces.  It was a beautiful thing.  Even with all the hundreds of other items available. all this cake was sold in about 10 minutes.  The cake was fresh, well-packed, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this item.
