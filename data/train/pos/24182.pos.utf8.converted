This is my second purchase from Arizona Vanilla and I am very pleased with the vanilla beans that I have ordered from them.  The beans are very fresh & fragrant, and make the best vanilla extract-I'm on my second batch because I just had to share with my friends-and the shipping speed is incredible!  I shop exclusively at Arizona Vanilla now, and I've passed along their website addy to all my friends who are interested.  Arizona Vanilla is truly the best in the West!!!
