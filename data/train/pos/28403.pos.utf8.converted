This stuff is absolutely amazing. Like everything else I've tried from Artisana, the coconut butter is really something different, in a whole other league from other brands. I eat this right out of the jar. It's great mixed with raw cacao, raw agave nectar and a little sea salt; makes unbelievable raw chocolate fudge (melt coconut butter in a double boiler at 105 degrees, mix all ingredients, spread on wax paper and cool)!
