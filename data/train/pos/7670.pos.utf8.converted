It's a bit strong to be taken alone, but mixed with a smoothie/oatmeal/etc. it's a good addition. Apparently quite healthful, and the flavor also complements raw cacao well.<br /><br />FYI - I've read varying accounts about maca and it's health benefits. There seems to be a lot of support for the claim that maca is somewhat toxic in its raw form, and is more appropriately consumed in the cooked/gelatinized form? In addition, in the raw form it can have hormonal side-effects and is best taken 1) in the cooked form 2) with some other kind of additive to modulate that side effect. Apologies if any of this information is inaccurate, I know it IS second-hand. I just figure it's important to research the subject thoroughly on your own before you dive right out on a limb.<br /><br />And FWIW I have experienced no adverse side effects thus far from taking maca raw. No gastric distress, nausea, etc. and nothing weird or PMS-y, so maybe it affects different people differently.<br /><br />Good luck whatever you choose! :)
