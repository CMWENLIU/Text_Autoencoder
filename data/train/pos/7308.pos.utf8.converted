I really debated whether or not I needed a baby food maker.  This is baby #4 and don't know that we'll have another & it seemed like a lot of money if I only use it for one baby for a few months.  BUT the manual grinders suck!  And a blender is too big for a small job & my electric mini chopper just doesn't do the job (and it's also a little big).  AND the Baby Brezza had a great product video vs. the much cheaper KidCo one.  I couldn't even find a YouTube for that one!  And I'm a total sucker for advertising.  Marketers dream of people like me.  Anyway-<br /><br />I'm so glad that I spent the money on the Baby Brezza!  My primary reason for buying a baby food maker was so that I could process our own dinner (when it's healthy enough) & feed it to my baby.  The Baby Brezza definitely delivers!  The first time I used it I was processing some soup with chicken in it.  There were a few small chicken chunks left in the rest of the puree.  So the next time I processed a meal with chicken, I cut the chicken into smaller dices & I added a little more water to the Baby Brezza & also blended it longer.  That did the trick.  It was so easy to use that I decided to try a banana.  Fork mashing the banana kept it too thick for my picky baby, but in the Brezza she was happy with the texture.  Then I got an avocado.  And then a mango.  And zucchini.  Things that I'd never even considered feeding my babies at this age because you can't buy baby food avocado (although I realize you can get mango blends).<br /><br />My picky baby would have nothing to do with store bought baby food vegetables, unless I bought the expensive organic (and more creative) blends in the pouches.  But with the Baby Brezza she's happy to have freshly pureed veggies!  And this is how easy it is to use: I dice up a few carrots (as I am chopping some up for our own dinner prep), put them in the Brezza cup, look at their little included cookbook for the amt of time to steam carrots, hit the Steam + Blend button, and leave it alone while I work more on the rest of the family's dinner.  After the carrots are finished steaming the Brezza purees them without me having to do a thing & it beeps when it's finished.  How cool is that?!  Sometimes there are still a couple/few tiny chunks of whatever I've pureed.  Big deal - I'd be surprised if anything made for a home kitchen would be any different.  Oh, as a side note the included "cook book" was a let down.  The Baeba one seemed better, but not $50 better!<br /><br />So I was a little worried that my husband would give me a hard time when I told him how much the Baby Brezza cost, but as I made my first blend he joked about how it was already saving us one dollar.  He'll ask me at the end of the day if I've made any baby food & when I tell him what I've blended he'll say "that's --more dollars saved!"  The Baby Brezza will eventually pay for itself.<br /><br />One more thing to note is that I am not in any way a person who has been concerned about making my own baby food in the past.  I see nothing wrong with store bought baby food.  BUT it's awesome to know that my baby is getting fresh, nutrient-rich food when I make it myself.  Also as I was feeding my baby some baby food from a jar I noticed it had that gross metallic smell (like when you open a can of Spaghetti-O's!), and guess what?- it tasted like that too!  Yuck!  So of course you won't get that when you make it yourself.  I find myself thinking of what I can blend up next for my baby.  I even ordered a baby food book just so I could have good combo ideas.  I seriously haven't had this much fun with an appliance since I got my KitchenAid at the beginning of my marriage 10 years ago!<br /><br />Buy the Baby Brezza - you'll love it!
