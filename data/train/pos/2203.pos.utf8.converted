The wisdom in the old saying, "compare apples to apples...oranges to oranges," etc. applies here. If you compare Skinner's Raisin Bran to other raisin brans, you are comparing apples to oranges, so to speak. Skinner's is made by an entirely different process than any other raisin brans. While I have had to use Post Raisin Bran and some of the organic products when I was unable to find Skinner's, the difference in taste is dramatic. The difference is in the way each is made. Skinner's is made by steaming the whole wheat kernels, rolling them flat and baking them. The common brands of raisin brans are made from wheat flour and other ingredients, and the flour is most commonly "bleached and enriched", having been refined by separating the components of the wheat berry and bleaching the endosperm,the major ingredient in bleached wheat flour. Therefore, cereals made with bleached wheat flour lack the bran and most certainly the wheat germ. Those two nutritionally essential components of the wheat berry (the bran and the germ) not only provide the strong flavor, but also all the healthy ingredients provided by "whole wheat". Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that only whole grains can be completely metabolized by the body; refined grains less so and tend to be stored rather than fully metabolized.<br /><br />Therefore, for those cereal eaters who are accustomed to raisin bran or other cereals made from wheat flour with flavor enhancers, the Skinner's at first taste may seem strong, mainly because whole wheat has a strong flavor, which could be interpreted as "bad" because it is so different from those made with refined flour. Also, because they are made from the whole wheat berry, the Skinner's flakes have a much firmer texture, the advantage of which is that they do not get soggy in milk before you eat the whole serving. My children and grandchildren all prefer Skinner's, either as a breakfast cereal or as muffins or cookies. I am so thankful to be able to get this product from Amazon since it is scarce in the markets in my region. Remember, apples to apples, oranges to oranges....
