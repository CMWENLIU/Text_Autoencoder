First discovered Typhoo teabags in an English shop on the West Coast of FL. Have since seen them in my local grocery in Eastern NC. I'll never go back to American teabags! This is a strong, dark tea & I absolutely love it! I drink mine w/ an artificial sweetener, no milk. Heavenly! Now for a good book...
