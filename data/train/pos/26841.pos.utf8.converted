I have just switched over from having a glass of wine a day to having 3 to 4 glasses of oolong tea instead(reason..less calores)!! This tea tastes GREAT!!! I will be buying this again!! It is sooo much better tasting then green tea! I have influenced my family and friends to try this tea too!! Thats how much I like it!! I havent been on it long enough to know if it works with weight loss....however if it does..that's just a bonus!!
