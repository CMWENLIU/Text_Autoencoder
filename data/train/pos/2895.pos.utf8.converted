I bought this block of marzipan to make roses for my daughter's wedding cake in September. Came out beautifully!! I kept the rest for my sisters and I to wrap our traditional English Christmas fruitcakes. Well....not quite enough of the marzipan made it to the Thanksgiving weekend when the cakes were made. Instead,we decided to eat the rest with a spoon (actually, I was digging chunks out with a butter knife between September and Thanksgiving!) This is the real deal and you won't find a better price.
