I was happy to find pine nuts that were domestically grown. Most places that sell pine uts in volume buy them from China. In today's world I am not comfortable with that.  Diamond is  a well known brand with excellent results. These pine nuts are clean and packaged individually in 12.5 ounce packages. I made a wonderful pesto and froze it for winter use. I will know that the pesto is grown with local basil and local pine nuts . You  have to be very particular today and have safe standards.
