Great treat and keeps your dog's teeth tartar free! I have a four year old shih tzu and a three year old shih tzu. This breed is born with bad teeth. Their teeth are very cramped and they are more prone to having tartar build up. I give my dog's a veggiedent daily and they have not needed a teeth clening yet. Their vet has been amazed at how healthy their teeth are. Most small breed dogs need a teeth cleaning by the time they are one years old. I prefer theese over the regular C.E.T. treats, my dog's have an easier eating the veggiedents and they seem to like these better. I have worked as a vet tech for seven years now and have not seen a better treat that keeps your dog's teeth healthy.
