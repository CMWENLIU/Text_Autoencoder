For Over 15 years, Ive been using the Tahini that comes in a can. Always trying to scrape the hard stuff off the bottom, and mix in the oils from the top... This Tahini is SO Delicious. Super creamy and fresh tasting without being bitter at all. Made a batch of Hummus with this today, and its better than any hummus Ive ever made, even though Ive been using the same recipe my entire life. This Tahini comes in a plastic jar, and when I received it, The outer jar seemed a little bit oily. Its all sealed up, so I just washed it off with  little soap and water, and was good to go!
