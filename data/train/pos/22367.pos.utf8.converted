My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this miso paste as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the amazing taste and overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids love my Miso soup as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Morinu firm silken tofu and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu, 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 Tbs white miso paste (this stuff), 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is... We live in Northern California with some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world, but this recipe blows away (or at least equals) what you can get from any restaurant. I have also made an amazing miso salad dressing from this miso paste as well! But I digress... I highly recommend this miso paste!
