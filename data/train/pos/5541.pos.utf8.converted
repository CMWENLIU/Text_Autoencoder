I have a lot of diabetics in my family - and when we are getting together it is hard to find products that don't have sugar in them that everyone loves.<br /><br />You can add your own Splenda or sweetener to this tea if you prefer too. Most of whom I've served this tea too prefer not to add any sweetener to it at all.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong with Celestial Seasonings teas - they are made with such great quality and I've never come across anything made by Celestial Seasonings that was bad or of poor quality.<br /><br />This tea is really great! The flavor is amazing, and for this price it won't hurt to try it out!
