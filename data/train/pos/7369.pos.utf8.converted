I don't know why anyone would ever use those little liquid food colors again after trying these pastes. The colors are more intense, and you can easily blend lovely shades for your icings. <p>Martha Stewart shows wonderful seasonal cookies from time to time on her TV show. A simple eggwhite-sugar icing on cookies in exciting colors makes such a wonderful table decoration as well as great dessert for parties, teas and other events. These paste colors are a must if you like to make frosted cookies or party cakes. <p>And these are especially fun if you have kids. A cookie-icing contest is a fun event for a birthday party, Christmas party or just a rainy afternoon.
