I have tried several Bakery On Main Gluten Free Granola cereals and this is my favorite (and my daughter's).  The other flavors are very good (4 stars) and this one is excellent (5 stars).  I'll be reordering this one soon!  It's too bad they don't sell a variety pack (one of each flavor) so you can find your favorite and then buy a larger package.
