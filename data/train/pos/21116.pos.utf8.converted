My cat is a rescued feral who has some gum and intestinal issues left over from his humble beginnings.  He loves the taste of these treats.  Unlike many kinds of cat food and treats, the Greenies do not give him gas or diarrhea.  And his mouth and coat (he is is a meticulous groomer) smell less like a dumpster.  Good for him.  Good for us.
