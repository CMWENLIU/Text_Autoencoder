This corn pops beautifully in our air popper, and it has a wonderful taste.  There are very few unpopped kernels left when I turn off the popper.  Although the kernels are multi-colored, they're a creamy white after they pop.  The taste is faintly nutty and good enough that we don't have to add other flavorings or salt, just a little olive oil spray.  A 1/2 cup serving of kernels pops up into a large bowlful of corn, great for 2 people to snack on.
