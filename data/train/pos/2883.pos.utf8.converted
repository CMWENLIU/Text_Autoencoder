After trying a few different brands of grain-free food for my dogs, I gave up and settled on Canidae as my Doberman couldn't seem to handle the other premium foods.  Recently, however, I decided to give Taste of the Wild High Prairie formula a try.  I mixed it with the Canidae for about a week and then converted him over completely to Taste of the Wild.  He never had any digestive issues and within a couple of weeks his coat looked brighter.  Strangely, after all of the gastrointestinal problems he had in previous attempts to convert to grain-free, his "bathroom" activity actually improved.  I couldn't be happier with the product.  Oh, by the way, both of my dogs love the food as well.
