I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular "brisk lipton" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the "Lipton Yellow Label" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of "Pure Ceylon," a box of "Coarse Black Tea" packed in Mumbai, and another "new bright & rich" Mumbai variety which is a blend of "Assam teas." These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour.
