Chances are, if you're not European, you will not like this. It is a very thick, sour milk (lapte batut in Romanian). :o)<br /><br />Growing up on it, I was very happy to find it here in the states.<br />You can usually find it at Whole Foods, Wild Oats or in the gourmet section at Safeway/Vons.<br /><br />The regular tastes much better than the low fat, but it's still very thick and sour. They also make it in Vanilla and berries, Blueberry I think.<br /><br />My husband, who is American, says it tastes like milk that's gone bad. I happen to disagree.  :o)
