I'm a distance runner and had a lot of trouble finding a gel product (or any product, for that matter) that I could hold down.  GU, Cliff, Hammer, etc., EVERYTHING came back up or made me extremely bloated.  I finally resorted to using the KFC honey packs on a recommendation from a friend - and they worked.  I found Honey Stingers a years back before they were readily available and ordered them off of their website, as they were much more substantial than the KFC version.  I can keep these down, they don't upset my stomach at all, and they are the perfect pick-me-up during a run.  As an extra, they taste good and are easy to suck down, After a little research I found that honey is pre-digested by bees, so I guess that's why it works better for me.  If the "mainstream" gels upset your stomach or leave a little something to be desired, try these.  You can't go wrong.
