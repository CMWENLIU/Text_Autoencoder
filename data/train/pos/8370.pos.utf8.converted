These were great -- I went through them quickly. They're little yummy buddies. I love the "serving suggestions" offered by the other reviewers and will have to try their ideas next time. I just ate these plain from the tin,  with fork or chopsticks, and drank the remaining olive oil delite. Boggles my mind that one reviewer complained about not being able to get all the sardine goodness out of the tin -- get a rubber spatula for goodness' sake ;) But what do I know, there's probably ergonomics to sardine tins just like everything else.<br /><br />This was a good match for that je ne sais quoi I've been tasting for in my sardines... I'm going to try a different brand next for the sheer adventure of it, but am glad to know I have a standby here on Amazon. The quest continues!
