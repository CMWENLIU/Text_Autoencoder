<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BFE">Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix 33-Ounce Units (Pack of 3)</a><br />For years I had used another pancake style mix to make my waffles, always longing for a little more malt flavor and a crisper texture that did not get tough. I saw this mix and decided to try it. WOW! The first hint that you are in for a good waffle is the smell of malt and hint of vanilla that comes out of the can when you open it. Following the easy directions, you are going to be in for a real treat. These waffles come out crisp, yet fully tender. They seem to hold their crispness under syrup longer and the flavor bings you back to a time when quality meant something. I highly recommend this product. I also bought the original mix and it works equally well.
