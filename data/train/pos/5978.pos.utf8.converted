I bought this oil as a way to get a real effective dose of omega fatty acids into my diet as opposed to taking 1 or 2 grams of fish oil per day which did nothing.  I have come realize that our bodies create about 11 different kinds of omega 3 fatty acid which will not be created if you take fish oil which contains only 2.  There are only 2 essential fatty acids alpha linolenic acid(omega 3), and linoleic acid(omega 6) your body makes what it needs from these if you get enough in your diet.  After about a week of taking this I noticed that my mood that has been fairly depressive for years had improved to the point of wanting to go workout again, this coupled with a significant decrease in overall body pain has allowed me to stake claim to a better life.
