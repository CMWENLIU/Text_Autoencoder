I was born in Serbia, so I grew up eating Milka chocolates. I guess I have become spoiled by their creamy consistency that I would rate them as one of the best chocolates (above godiva, even.) If anyone has the store World Market close to them, they carry Milka bars. Milk chocolate with WHOLE hazelnuts are my favorite of the MIlka variety!! I highly recommened browsing online and finding a retailer that sells them. YUM!!
