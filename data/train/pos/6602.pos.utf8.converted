Ghee is the shortening and frying oil of Indian cooking, butter that has been 'clarified' of its proteins and salts. It looks like and feels like soft lard, semi-liquid at room temperature. In comparison to butter, it scorches at a much higher frying-pan heat; thus instead of flavoring food with the typical French "brown butter" taste, it is relatively neutral but allows the essences of spices and seeds to be accentuated. A typical Indian recipe for lentils, for instance, will call for cooking the lentils in one pan and then lacing them with aromatic spices - fenugreek, cardamon, caraway, etc. - fried quickly in ghee.<br /><br />Chefs in big cities like Minneapolis, Seattle, or Sunnyvale will have ghee available in their neighborhood bazaars, along with rose-petal ice cream and fresh naan, but it's gratifying to find that ghee also is marketed on the internet. After all, so many of the computer geeks who keep America fed, informed, and entertained are immigrants from India.<br /><br />If you plan to substitute for ghee in your down-home Indian chow, DON'T use salted butter, olive oil, or soya oil. Canola oil is probably your best hope. Ghee has other uses that might appeal to Americans, by the way: skin-softening; skin scraping in lieu washing with soap, which is what the ancient Romans did; gun-stock polishing (if the British Raj had known the difference between ghee and tallow, they might have averted the Sepoy Mutiny); and, of particular value to Missourians, as a preservative top-layer for 'confit du vautour' and/or Geierp
