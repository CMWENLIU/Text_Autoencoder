We have 2 Shih Tzu, one of which has food allergies.  Switching to Royal Canin has minimized the allergies and improved his skin condition.  It's also apparently delicious, because both of our dogs LOVE when it's meal time - and that wasn't always the case with other foods.<br /><br />We also use pieces of dog food as treats now and they're perfectly happy with that as well.
