My husband and I just looked at each other after eating one of the lemon wafer cookies and sighed.  The flavor is pure deep natural lemon, tart and bright, with a sweet creamy finish--nothing like any other lemon-flavored cookie I've ever bought.  Honestly, these are just terrific little cookies.<br /><br />And when we thought it couldn't get better, we tried the chocolate.  Natural, dense, delicious, dark chocolate taste.<br /><br />We plowed through both bags just going back and forth: lemon, chocolate, lemon, chocolate....<br /><br />No gross artificial taste.  No waxy texture to the cream.  No meek, bland flavors.  Just all-natural goodness that will blow your socks off.<br /><br />Time for another bag.
