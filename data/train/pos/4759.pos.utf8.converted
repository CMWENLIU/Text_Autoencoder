I absolutely love Jiffy Pop.  Reminds me of being a kid by the campfire.  I bought this product for my children to use with our backyard firepit.  The package says that it is meant to be used on a burner, not an open fire, but I did it when I was a kid and it still works great!!  Fun product-tastes even better than I remember!!!
