I have been eating this stuff for a decade and a half, ever since I worked in a teriyaki restaurant slinging yakisoba and udon soup bowls at the tender age of 18.  There are lots of good reviews on this product already and I agree with all of them... this stuff is HOT but also TASTY.  I ALWAYS have a bottle of this on hand.  My latest favorite thing to do with this sauce is to mix it with an equal part of Frank's Red Hot and a splash of vinegar and use it to drown a plateful of pelmehni (Russian dumplings).  That mixture, by the way, is also fantastic on wings.  On it's own, Rooster sauce is a MUST for me in ANY curry... it adds heat and complements the flavor perfectly and I also love to drizzle a bit (just a bit) into my chicken soup (not weird....I used to dump truckloads of Rooster into my Udon noodle soup!).  Really, the uses for the Rooster are endless.... but if you regularly cook things like stir fry or curry (any style) and you like a bit of kick.. this is a MUST HAVE pantry staple.  Plus, it's fun to dare people to eat spoonfuls of it.  :)<br /><br />I'm hungry.
