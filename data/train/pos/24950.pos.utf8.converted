"Mr & Mrs T's Bloody Mary Mix" is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.<br /><br />We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesn't need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.<br /><br />The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
