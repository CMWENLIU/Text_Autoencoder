There is no price too high to pay for such a miracle of taste and science. Get this. It is a cake IN A BOX.  Like is your mind blown? You just add water, shove it in the oven and CAKE. I'm not making it up. Powder. Water. Cake. Just like that. Like those sea monkeys, only less crunchy. And good? Man,I picked up a piece, took a bite and next thing I knew, I ate  my own hand.  That's real cake, I'm telling you, moist and rich. Okay, some of it was the hand, but even so. Go get some. You'll see. Only when you eat it, use a fork.
