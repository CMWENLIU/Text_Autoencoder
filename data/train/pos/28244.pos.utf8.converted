I am writing this review because I feel that the only other review here is not justified. It says on the packaging that it is whole milk powder and it should be assumed that it will be just that. I have been interested in purchasing this product for some time and recently found it at a grocery store. I have not had good luck finding a quality powdered milk and this product has satisfied my desire for a quality powdered milk. It has a good flavor and does not taste stale or like cardboard. Of the brands of powdered milk I have tried, many taste so bad I cannot even consume it when I backpack. This is bad because, when backpacking, I need to eat all I can and often will eat all I can and have. Bringing powdered milk I won't drink is a waste of weight I carry and calories I'll never get. I have seriously eaten grape nuts with water because my powdered milk was so stale. This product has a nice rich and creamy flavor that the non-fat milk powders don't have. I prepared this product and drank the result immediately, without any refrigeration and it was already excellent. I think the only other milk powder that I have drank that was good was the carnation non-fat milk. Also, I have used vanilla carnation breakfast drink in place of powdered milk because it works as a milk substitute on the trail. I enjoy this Nido whole milk powder because it is loaded with calories and also because it can be very useful in preparing a number of different normal every day dishes or possibly ethnic at home, such as ice cream, kulfi, or when you want to thicken dairy based foods. I also drink whole milk on a normal basis and prefer to have the fat anyway. However, if I didn't prefer the fat, I would choose this over a bad tasting stale milk powder any day.
