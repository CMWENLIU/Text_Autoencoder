Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!
