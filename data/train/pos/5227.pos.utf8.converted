I've looked around a lot for a decent introduction to this style of tea. Teas Etc's video about how to brew it and flavor description was encouraging and helpful. I felt like I knew what to expect taking that first sip, and it was perfect. Light, mellow, smooth and woody. This is a great tea and now one of my favorites. One 3g tou-cha is perfect for my 32oz teapot. So the entire 3oz bag will last me approximately 28 pots of tea. I am very happy.
