I agree with the reviewer who gave these a stellar rating. We've tried a variety of pasta and noodle alternatives (spaghetti squash etc) and the results ranged from interesting to...terrible. The spaghetti squash was the best alternative but it certainly didn't taste like regular pasta. But regular pasta plays havoc with our blood sugar and whole wheat pasta wasn't to our liking...so we continued our search.<br /><br />These Tofu Shirataki Fettucini are the absolute alternative to pasta which we've found and they are very tasty. I noticed that one person here said they were "tough" and "inedible". NOT TRUE. Also, they have only 40 calories per package and one package was certainly enough to be a generous serving for me (it might take two packages for someone with a hefty appetite). I tested my blood sugar before and after eating these, both within an hour of eating them and several hours later. My blood sugar stayed nice and level, so there was that benefit as well.<br /><br /> As far as texture goes, they ARE closer to an "al dente" (a bit chewy) pasta than an overcooked, mushy pasta but we'd always preferred our pasta a bit on the "al dente" side. If you don't like "chewy" you might not like the Tofu Pasta. That didn't bother us one bit.<br /><br />True, the taste is not identical to pasta but we both felt that (like most tofu) it picked up the taste of whatever we put on it and any remaining taste was subtle, in our opinion.<br /><br /> The first time we ate it we put on homemade tomato sauce, fresh Parmesan and oregano and basil (fresh basil) It was yummy! The second time we made spaghetti (canned sauce and ground beef and freshly chopped spices) and it was also delicious. I then experimented with various sauces, from those with a sour cream base to creamed cottage cheese and a bit of butter and green onions. Every time, the result was delicious - and what a calorie savings over regular pasta.<br /><br />  We have not eaten them plain or buttered, like regular noodles or pasta. I have a feeling the texture might be more noticable then and there might be a subtle taste that would be different from pasta.<br /><br />  This is as detailed and clear as I can be. We were absolutely DELIGHTED to discover and use these and found them to be the best substitute by far for our favorite pasta (although we're certainly open to suggestions for others).<br /><br />PS: Since writing my original review, I wanted to note that I adapted a sweet noodle kugel recipe using these as the "noodles". It was delicious. For anyone who might be interested in doing the same, I did NOT bake the kugel like you do a traditional one. I simply used Light Sour cream, cinnamon and Splenda to make a kugel that would work for diabetics or those on a diet. I did heat the noodles in the microwave after draining them because they do tend to leak liquid even when they are heated up without any. I added the other ingredients to the hot noodles and heated gently on the stovetop. Leftovers were eaten cold.
