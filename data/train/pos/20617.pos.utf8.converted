Building muscle while burning fat became paramount to me while on the Body For Life program several years ago.  After being on the program for 9 months, I developed muscle for the first time in my life in addition to losing lots of fat.  I attribute a great deal of my success to fueling my body with the right foods...including meal replacement drinks twice a day to keep my metabolism revving.<br /><br />Finding the right meal replacement powder (MRP) for those two meals a day became almost an obsession.<br /><br />I had four main criteria:<br />1.  Low sugar content (very important to me as the more sugar I have, the more I crave it)<br />2.  High amounts of vitamins and minerals<br />3. Good tasting without the Aspartame (I have a sensitivity to it)<br />4. Easy to mix--especially on the run<br /><br />I did a lot of research and a lot of testing. My quest for the best took me through chalky tasting ones, chemical tasting ones, downright nasty tasting ones, and difficult-to-mix ones.<br /><br />Finally, I got around to Labrada's Lean Body for Her shakes. I originally tried them because of their low sugar content but ended up loving how much energy they gave me and the great taste. I mainly used vanilla because I could mix nut butters and fruit to mix up the flavors. Loved them!<br /><br />Due to health issues, I went off program for the last two years, but I recently recommitted myself. Because of my previous success with Labrada Lean Body for Her, I went back to using it for two of my six meals each day. Right away I noticed there are a few things different with tLabrada's current MRP.<br /><br />I don't know how they did it, but they made the vanilla even better! I got the "Soft Vanilla" flavor and it taste just like ice cream! It is also even easier to mix. It seems like the powder itself is ground finer, which is probably why.<br /><br />The nutritional information is:<br />Calories 190<br />Calories From Fat 30<br />Total Fat 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat 1g<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 20mg<br />Sodium 300mg<br />Potassium 360mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 9g<br />Dietary Fiber 3g<br />Sugars 1g<br />Protein 30g<br /><br />Lastly, while this may not be important to others, I truly love the fact that the tear strip on the envelopes actually work and are easy to open. A small detail perhaps but just the right added benefit to top off an already great product.<br /><br />As on most things, the amazon.com price is great...and I save even more money by using the Subscribe & Save. I'm not sure who controls shipping speed on the S&S, amazon.com or the seller themselves, but they certainly ship fast!
