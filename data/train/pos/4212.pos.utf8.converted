This Ambrosia honey has a mild spicy sweet taste that reminds me of cinnamon sugar.  I've tried it with hot biscuits and butter and think it would be great in oatmeal or with french toast.  A perfect compliment to the breakfast table and the price is incredible (cheaper than the local honey's available) along with being an American made product.
