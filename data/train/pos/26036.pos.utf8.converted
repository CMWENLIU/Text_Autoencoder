It has been difficult to find this in the midwest and it's a treat for me! The balance is good and color is dark. The grind is fine and works great in drip brewers. For really full flavor, I recommend fine mesh filters rather than paper. I go full throttle and use a french press - the grind works okay and way better than Starbucks House Blend. The flavor is perfect for me - vive Seattle! Other faves are Seattle's Best Henry's Blend and Post Alley Blend.
