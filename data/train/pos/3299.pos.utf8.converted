I'd been told this stuff tasted like Spam, but I found it to be much more mild and "ham-like." All-in-all, a very good "emergency meat" product with a good flavor and unique texture (sort of like wood particle board if it were made from ham).<br /><br />The pull-tab can is a little hard to open, so I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone with arthritis or grip strength issues. You'll find a bit of gelatinous goo inside, but not a lot.<br /><br />I wanted to slice it longways to fry and it was a little tricky to slice this way due to its elliptical shape. I browned the slices in a non-stick pan with no oil and it was very tasty.<br /><br />All things considered, this is one of the best canned meat products I've ever eaten. Given its long, multi-year shelf life, I can't think of any reason not to keep a few cans in the cupboard at all times.<br /><br />Ingredients are listed as ham cured with water, salt, sugar, sodium phosphates, carrageenan, sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite.<br /><br />Nutrition info for a 2 oz. serving (8 per container) is as follows: 100 calories (60 from fat), 7g total fat (10% of daily value based on a 2,000 calorie diet), 2g saturated fat (11% DV), 0g trans fat, 40mg cholesterol (13% DV), 620mg sodium (26% DV at time of canning), less than 1g carbohydrates, less than 1g sugars and 9g of protein.
