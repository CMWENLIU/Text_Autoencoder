Citrusmint is probably the best Orbit flavor, and I've tried them all. This is the first gum that I actually chew like it's a real food product, and not just some chewy mint. I make it through about a pack a day, it's that good. Citrusmint is somewhat of a misnomer, as there is really no mint flavor to it, just a burst of refreshing orange. The texture of the gum also seems softer than most of the other Orbit flavors, making it even more appetizing. This is truly a world-class gum and it's good for your teeth as well. On the downside, as with all the Orbit varieties, the package is poorly designed and  sometimes it can be difficult to remove the individual pieces of gum. However, this inconvenience is a small price to pay to experience such a magnificent gum.
