Another top brand began tasting funky long before oil spills, so I've used only Bumble Bee for years. With the best reputation, they dont even seem to advertise-best tasting tuna that can be used for salad or in any recipe requiring tuna fish. Amazon's case sale price made this a no brainer purchase. Thanks Amazon!!
