This mix, is a blend of leaves that are really fine, we made it in the coffee maker. I did purchase the cloth strainer, but that should be used for large amounts of tea. The coffee maker did just fine, make sure you don't use too much mix though, it's concentrated stronger than coffee is, so please take note of the instructions when it comes to measurement.<br /><br />It tastes delicious, just like I like it. I did not have condensed milk though, so I had to use regular milk. I will admit you definitely need the condensed milk if you want it to be like the restaurant's style. But it had the same flavors, the regular milk tended to water it down a bit.<br />I sweetened it with normal sugar, everything was fine.<br /><br />This is a nice size bag, you should have enough for awhile with this one. I recommend this if you love Thai Tea like I do..
