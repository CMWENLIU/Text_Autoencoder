One of my three cats has suffered from loose bowels her entire life, but no other detectable health problems. (Yes, a vet was consulted.) More recently, however, she started putting on a lot of weight and began vomiting horrifically and frequently. We began trying other foods, without success. After more and more research, I decided to try eliminating grain from her diet. We really could not afford a canned-only diet of quality food, and had heard that other cat owners had had success with rabbit-based food for cats.<br /><br />It has been three weeks now with no vomiting, solid stools, and our calico is starting to lose weight. She seems happier and is definitely more active than she had been six weeks ago. Another fringe benefit-- our male cat, who has suffered from nearly chronic tartar build-up (despite two cleanings and "tartar-control" treats), is showing me a cleaner set of teeth and better breath. Thrilled would be understating how happy we are with this product.
