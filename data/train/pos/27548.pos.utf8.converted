This was my third time ordering this product.  I really enjoyed the first 2 cases of the cookies last year, but this batch was not as flavorful and had a dryer, harder texture.  At first, I thought my memory of how good they were was just faulty, but my daughter told me she felt the others had been much better, too.  I contacted Pamela's Products about the problem, and after some discussion, they sent me replacement cookies.  These cookies made me fall in love with this product all over again - they had an enjoyable texture and those lovely little taste treats of crystallized ginger pieces that leave the mouth tingling for awhile after the cookie is gone.  I am glad I persevered, as these are exceptional for "store-bought" cookies!
