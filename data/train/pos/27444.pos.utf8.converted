smooth,great mouth feel, taste, easy to prepare, works well in cornmeal muffins and other baking. Best polenta I've ever had. If you like polenta you should really try this because this is not just another polenta.<br /><br />  This is made with long cycle corn which takes longer to grow, is not genetically modified, has less starch, and makes a better polenta.<br /><br />  Long cycle corn is closer to what original corn used to be before it was bred to grow quick. This corn is only able to grow in a few parts of the world. This particular corn is grown in Argentina in view of the Andes Mountains.<br /><br />thank you for making this product available Amazon.
