I recently adopted a kitten from a local shelter and shortly after bringing her home she devoloped a respiratory infection, which I'm told is common in shelter cats.  When the vet examined her, her weight was low as she had not been eating well with all the stress and sickness.  After doing some research online for a good quality food to give her a boost, I tried the Innova Evo cat & kitten food.  I have both the dry and canned and she begs and can't wait for me to put the bowl down with the canned food in it.  After a week of new food and medicine she had gained almost a pound and is doing much better.  Her coat is soft and she is very active.  I would recommend this food to anyone with cats or kittens at home.  I have never seen a cat eat (or beg) like she does with this food.
