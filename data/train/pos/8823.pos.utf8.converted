This oil serves a variety of purposes.  I have used it to drizzle over finished foods with great success. My most recent endeavor was an herbed potato puree.  It's also wonderful over seared scallops and roasted chicken.  This is that ingredient that will add depth to a dish and have your guests wondering what's in it.  I use it quite sparingly, as I enjoy the delicate flavor of the truffles.  The gourmet flavor is well worth the price.
