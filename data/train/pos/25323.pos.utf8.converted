My cat is extremely picky when it comes to food - I had to get a new brand of cat food each month or two, and he would only eat wet food that's sliced or cubbed in gravy. After the poisonous wheat glutten incident I had to stop feeding him those cuts and gravy style foods because all of them contain wheat glutten. Even if they are not contaminated I still feel uneasy about it. So I research all of the web and found this unique food. It's not available in regular stores so you have to go to their website to find specialty stores that carry them. Anyway, I was so happy to see that my cat loves this food, both the dried and the mushy canned version. I now feed him 1 can of EVO wet food and some dried EVO kibbles plus low-sodium chicken stock (he won't drink plain water) each day. It's been 3 months since I switched his food and he still seems to love it. In fact, he's getting FAT on this diet because I over fed him (he asks for food whenever I go to the kitchen, and he gives me that sad look so I feel guilty if I don't feed him). I am starting to cut down on his ration and minimize my trip to the kitchen. I also hope the cooler weather will encourage him to go out more and burn off those extra calories.<br />I read a lot about benefits of this food but honestly only my cat knows. His fur is very soft but not really shiny (don't remember if it was ever shiny). Don't know about litter box odor because he goes outside. Energy-wise, well, he's a lazy cat and sleeps a lot and nothing can make him run a marathon.
