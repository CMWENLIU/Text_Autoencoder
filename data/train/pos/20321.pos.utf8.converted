My mom is an avid green tea drinker. I have bought her just about every brand of green tea available including Lipton, Twinings, Celestial Seasonings, Bigelow and probably a dozen others, including some of the fanciest and most expensive. Her favorite of all green teas is Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea. She will drink others if she has to, but she doesn't enjoy any other tea half as much as this one. I have made it a habit to buy the 4-pack of 100s from Amazon to keep her in stock as she drinks 4-6 cups of this stuff every day. For taste, nothing compares to Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea. And the price here at Amazon is really good too! Give it a try. I think you will be glad you did.
