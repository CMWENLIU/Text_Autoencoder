I've tried them all. I've sampled each kind. I know that taste is subjective, but if bold is your thing, and delicious true coffee flavor is what you seek, give this a try. I don't buy mine, by the way, anywhere but at Target, where they're $9.95 for a box of 18. I usually buy 5-6 boxes at a time (they sell out quickly). For the decaf equivalent of this, the French Roast (also Green Mountain's brand) is equally as bold and flavorful. Happy Holidays!
