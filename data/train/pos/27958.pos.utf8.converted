We are almost running out of our second bag of this delicious flour and are subscribed to get a fresh package every other month. Quality is awesome to bake all kinds of cookies, pound cakes, brownies, pancakes, pies and we even made pizza from it. It's soft and easy to manage.<br /><br />But the best part is that it comes packaged without plastic (palstic-free)!!! I was so impressed with that - it's packaged in brown paper bag and "sealed" or threaded with thick cotton thread (the way they did cloth sacks with grains in olde days).<br /><br />So even if there is a cheaper organic pastry flour, I will stick to this one just because of awesome environmental packaging!
