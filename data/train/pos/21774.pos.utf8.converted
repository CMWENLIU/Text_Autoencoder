Yes, there are six containers to the order, but you might be surprised that you'll use these up b/4 too long if you like to try new recipes with tamarind. If you enter the Foodnetwork site, and word search "tamarind paste" or "tamarind concentrate" you will find a plethora of recipes using this.  I have two I use often...one is for baking fish fillets with a Bali-style sauce that's easy to whip up, another recipe for glazing pork ribs on the BBQ with a tasty sauce. The list of recipes is endless.  If you are a foodie and enjoy exploration of foods that are out of the ordinary, this will fit the bill.  It looks and pours like dark molasses, but b/c the individual containers are 8 oz size, they don't take up room in the fridge and won't sit there for years while you try to finish one jar. The price is so reasonable for six containers, you can afford to gift one or two away.
