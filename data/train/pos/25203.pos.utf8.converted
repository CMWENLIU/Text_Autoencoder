I started using Manuka honey when my Yorkies began experiencing stomach problems.  Just a little bit on a small piece of bread a few times per week and alls well.  There's several studies on this product and all have been favorable.  I was hesitant to gives it to my dogs but they had severe problems once a month and I hated seeing them in pain not eating for days at a time.  The Manuka has been a miracle and well worth the price for it's intended use.  If you want a sweetner in your tea, buy the cheap stuff.  If you want to cure a nasty stomach problem for you or your pets, try Manuka.  Get at least a +16.
