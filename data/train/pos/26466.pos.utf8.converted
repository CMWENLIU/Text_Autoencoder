Sweet basil is a basic in my cooking.  I ordered this product and was amazed at the huge quantity I received (being used to smaller containers).  It is as fresh as drying your own home-grown basil.  Perhaps this is a life-time supply, haha.  It adds so much to fish, soups, just about anything if you are a sweet basil lover.  I give this product more than 5 stars; it is well packaged and promptly delivered.
