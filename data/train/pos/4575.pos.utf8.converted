The price on Amazon for these ready to use cans (16 8-ounce cans) fluctuates from 25 to 29 cents per ounce, which is a little more than double what you would pay for the most economical container of powder Enfamil formula (approximately 11 to 13 cents per reconstituted ounce).  Sometimes the convenience is worth the extra money.  Every other evening I mix about 40 ounces of formula at a time for our infant son, but these cans come in handy if I forget to do it or if we are on the road.  These cans are now an essential part of my diaper bag, because when you need formula immediately, waiting for someone to bring you a cup of water can be a challenge!
