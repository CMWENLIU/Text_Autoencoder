I use this when I run out of milk for my coffee and tea, as well as adding to gravy or some baked goods. It dissolves rapidly and doesn't make lumps (Organic Valley nonfat PM requires whipping or shaking vigorously). I like that it is made in Holland as I think the EU has healthier rules regarding animal husbandry and resultant quality. Also this is the ONLY full cream powdered product brand I have found. Yes, it's a bit pricey and yes I wish it were organic, but for my needs this is the best one out there. I'll be glad when Amazon carries the larger more cost effective cans.
