I have been very happy with this product!  I have tried almost all the  flavors, but the Valencia Orange is my favorite.  I feel it is the most versatile of the flavors available.  I have been using this for over a year now and enjoy it on a daily basis in my water bottle and also add it to my tea, iced or hot.  A little goes a long way.  It is not too sweet but very light and refreshing.  Highly recommended!
