I got two kittens back in Oct 2006. Unfortunately the smaller one was always throwing up and had watery stools. After trying several other brands over several months with little improvement, I tried Wellness Core brand in Jan 2007 due to the natural ingredients that seemed to be more like what a cat would naturally eat. Both of my cats loved it and the smaller one stopped having stomach problems all together. I noticed that after they had been on the diet a while that their coats got very shiny. They've now been eating this food for over two years and are both active and healthy, with shiny coats and friendly dispositions.
