I love these fruit punch packets.  I have a sweet tooth, and I also love to cram food in my mouth in the evening when I sit down to read a book.  I seem to have a need to read while I'm eating, and also a need to eat when I'm reading, even if I'm not hungry.  Since I *love* to read, reading can put me in danger of destroying my waistline.  So, I mix a packet of fruit punch into a tall glass of cold water, stir well, then add ice and a sipping straw.  Very sweet and satisfying, and I don't notice an artificial sweetener taste at all.  I'll easily drink 3 of these a night, and it keeps me from eating junk food while I read.
