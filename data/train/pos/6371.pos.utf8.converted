This is my favorite green tea to share with friends.  The aroma when adding the hot water and while the ta is brewing is delightful, and just a prelude to the wonderful flavor of this tea.  Not to mention the health benefits of a cup of green tea to start the day!  I love watching the pearls unfurl in my brewer.  There is no bitter aftertaste -- and I can get two brewings from the same pearls.
