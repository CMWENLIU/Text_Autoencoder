This is THE perfect sugar-substitute!  In fact, in the book, HOW THE RICH STAY THIN, the author, (a New York City Park Avenue MD), states the following little rhyme:<br /><br />  "First we were pink<br />  Then we were blue.....<br />  Now we're yellow, through and through!"<br /><br />Splenda is that rare item made BETTER by a bit of (semi) genetic engineering.  Don't be afraid though - no other product is combined with sugar to make Splenda Granulated.  As mentioned in "How Splenda Is Made", above, hydrogen atoms are removed from the sugar molecule, and replced by<br />Chloride atoms.  This process takes away 99% (or is that 100%?) of the caloric value of the sugar!  :  )  And what they say is TRUE:  It's made from Sugar, so it TASTES like sugar!<br /><br />Although it is msore expensive to buy SPLENDA Granulated, (in bags), it may well be worth it, if you have diabetes.  I have noticed that the carry-with-you PACKET version of SPLENDA, contains DEXTROSE.....another form of sugar.  That, (I believe), is why SPLENDA in packets is a "free food" for diabetics, for up to four packets......only.  (Any food ingredient ending in "...ose" is a<br />sugar.)  "Sucralose" is the name given to "SPLENDA'S" semi-genetically-engineered sugar.....so of course it is one of the ingredients, in both forms of SPLENDA -- ending, of course, in -OSE.  But DEXTROSE appears as an ingredient ONLY in the packet form of SPLENDA.  It's NOT in the bag form!<br /><br />When I mentioned all this to a SPLENDA represntative, she said it was definitely OK to use the bagged form for sweetening drinks, as well as for baking.  But that the bagged form will FIZZ, slightly, when put into drinks.  This is normal....but somewhat of a shock if you're not prepared for it.  So -- be prepared!<br /><br />As it is so much more expensive to use the bagged , (baking) SPLENDA granuals for sweetening drinks, than the "carry-with you" packets, (and since I was somehow able to lose 40 pounds -- due in no small part to my use of SPLENDA! --and so (horray!), lose my incipient, "Type 3" diabetes), I find I can use both kinds of SPLENDA, with no ill-effects.  I find I buy one 700 packet SPLENDA, to every 3 or 4 large packages of granulated, bagged SPLENDA, that I buy.<br /><br />Recently, (in the 400 PACKET container), the people at SPLENDA have come up with some cute, clever little sayings that uplift the mood, and often bring a smile to one's lips.  Examples:  "It's better to have sprinkled and lost than never to have sprinkled at all". "Have A Sprinkle And A Smile."  "One small yellow packet for man, one giant smile for mankind."  "Let Your Creative Sprinkles Flow",<br /><br />The people who make SPLENDA are both genuises, (finding a way to replace hydrogen atoms with chloride atoms), and creative, (see clever sayings, above.)  Maybe not the same people -- but they all work for the same company.  My mounth curves up, (in a smile!) to them!  : )
