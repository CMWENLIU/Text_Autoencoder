I first stumbled upon chinotto at a Italian  food distributor.  We decided to purchase this particular product because the cashier said that it was by far her favorite, although an acquired taste.  I now know why.  My first sip was.....interesting to say the least.  The flavor journey passes through sweet, sour, and unknown tastes.  Initially my favorite element of the sip was the middle, the beginning too sweet, the end too bitter.  After many tries, I can now appreciate every aspect of this unusual but tantalizing beverage.  I encourage anyone who wants to venture beyond the traditional and insipid American drinks to buy a 6 pack, your opinion will change.
