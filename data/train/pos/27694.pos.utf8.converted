First my background as a dog owner. I have raised seven dogs. I have tended to more. The breeds include Labrador, Poodle, Schnoodle, Labradoodle, Akita, English Bulldog, Staffordshire Terrier, and Irish Setter. I have used Iams, Sams Club's Premium brand, Science Diet, Blue Mountain or whatever, lots of foods.<br /><br />This is a very good dog food. The dogs love it, the ingredients are top notch, and it's highly digestible which means less poop and hardly any of those soft diarrhea mounds that make my stomach roil when I have to attempt to scoop them up so my two year old doesn't get poop all over her feet.<br /><br />I would recommend this dog food over any other that I have tried. Excellent product.
