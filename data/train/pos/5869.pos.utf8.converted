I probably sound like a late night infomercial, but I've honestly had amazing results with this SuperFood and I love it!<br /><br />I already live a fairly healthy lifestyle to begin with, but found myself dragging physically and mentally and didn't have that second or third gear that I used to. My acupuncturist recommended taking wheat grass powder to increase my alkalinity and I bought this SuperFood by accident. I decided to use it anyway and I'm extremely happy that I did. After the first scoop I could feel an immediate change in my energy levels. It's not like a caffeine rush, but more like a sustained level of energy and alertness. It's most noticeable for me at the gym as I have a lot more strength and stamina when I'm working out. Another plus is that I have a much more consistent appetite than before. That's a good thing for me and I definitely feel the urge to eat more than I used to...maybe the cleansing effect of all of the extra fiber? I also sleep better too even with the extra energy.<br /><br />I do two scoops with 25oz of water in the morning and two scoops with dinner. The packaging recommends 1-3 per day. You can mix it with shakes, juice, etc, but I don't mind the Earthy flavor. The powder doesn't dissolve entirely so I suggest getting a Blender Bottle so you constantly mix it. It's also convenient for when you're on the go...throw in scoop or two, add water and you're out the door.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this product enough, but please don't think that this is some cure-all if you plan to eat junk food, smoke, drink a lot, etc. However, if you're trying to live healthy and want to improve your energy levels then this is definitely worth giving a try.
