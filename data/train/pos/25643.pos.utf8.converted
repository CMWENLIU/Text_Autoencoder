I live in central Georgia, and Claxton fruitcakes have been a Christmas tradition.  When my daughter was young, they were always "Jesus' birthday cake," eaten for breakfast on Christmas morning.  She is now living in San Jose, CA, and she called me this morning to ask that I bring one with me when I fly out next week.<br /><br />Claxton fruitcakes really are GOOD.  They don't have the icky citron pieces... just the good cherries and pineapple bits, along with nuts and dense, sweet cake.  The flavor and texture is a perfect blend.  And the best part is, they sell for $2.99 at the local grocery stores.  If you know anyone in the southeast, ask them to mail you a couple of these instead of paying these high online prices.
