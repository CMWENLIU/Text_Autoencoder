I have an older cat (5yrs old now) who was constantly getting crystals and urinary blockage. Expensive trips to the vet it was. 3 years ago I adopted 2 kittens. The vet said the kittens had to eat something other than what my older cat was (she was on prescription science diet-like that's not expensive). As all cat owners know, it's nearly impossible to separate them and eat their "own food". I did lots of reasearch and found Orijen. All three cats have been eating this food for 3 years. Guess what? No medical issues...At All! I've been so pleased with this food and how healthy and happy my cats are. I will never purchase anything else for my cats. You might think it may be a little expensive, but not having to take my cats to the vet is worth every penny saved.
