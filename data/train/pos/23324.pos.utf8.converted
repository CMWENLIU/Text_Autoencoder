I'm no tea expert, but I had to write a review because this is my favorite.  I can't find it in local stores anymore, so I recently bought directly through Celstial Seasonings, but now I know Amazon has it for such a great price, so this is where I'll be getting it from.  It has a great taste, I love the Vanilla flavor.
