Product came well packaged. The container is resealable, and has a gasket around the lid, so it makes a good seal.<br /><br />The wheat was very clean, without any trash or pebbles. I was able to put the wheat right in the grinder.<br /><br />If you are interested in grinding your own wheat, and making 100% whole wheat bread, this wheat is an excellent option. I was able to get big fluffy loafs without the need for added gluten. It is less bitter than hard red wheat.<br /><br />Overall, I could not be more pleased. Clean, makes great flour, and delicious bread.
