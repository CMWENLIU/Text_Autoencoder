*****<br /><br />Ok, I love lavender, so I'm biased. Still, this Traditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea is just spectacular. I've never tasted an herbal tea so good. I'm not sure if I just love the tea or if it truly has "digestive and nervous system sedating properties" but I feel relaxed when I drink it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinals' Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea are: organic chamomile flower 1,200 mg., proprietary blend: organic English lavender flower, organic lemon balm leaf . The tea tastes like chamomile with a strong, delicious lavender taste. It is a very fresh taste because there are no flavorings and everything is organic. The smell is yummy, too, even before brewing, as the lavender smell stands out; you could put the tea bags in your drawers to use as sachet fresheners!<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a very responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes on the box: "The combination of chamomile and lavender with lemon balm has digestive and nervous system sedating properties useful for nervous stomach and restlessness associated with upset stomach. The use of these herbs alone and in combinations for nervous stomach has been approved by European health authorities and is supported by clinical data. Organic Chamomile with Lavender has a pleasantly aromatic and balanced taste.".<br /><br />Also note the following caution from the box: "Contraindications: Do not use if your have known allergies to plants of the Asteraceae family (daisy) such as blessed thistle, calendula, chamomile, echinacea, safflower or yarrow."<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****
