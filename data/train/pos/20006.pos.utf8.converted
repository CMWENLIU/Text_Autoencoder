Sun Maid California Golden Raisins, 15-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) These precious little raisins are some of the best food being sold today.  The price on Amazon is less than the ones in the supermarkets, too.<br /><br />We love these raisins straight out of the box, on our cereals, or in our recipes.  We have used them in some of our recipes in The Collard Patch. We buy these often and keep them handy. As grocery prices continue to grow, we are careful to give ourselves little treats like these raisins, which we consider a gourmet product -- actually fit for royalty -- to keep us content with our frugal way of life.<br /><br />Nutritionally they are an excellent source of dietary fiber, energy, and potassium.<br /><br />In 2007, we bought a box of Sun Maid California Golden Raisins that did not measure up to our standards.  Although the raisins were tasty, the box had about 20% dark raisins.  We wrote the Sun Maid Company and expressed our disappointment.  Evidently this occurrence was something they did not expect or accept.  They told us that there is no way to avoid having a few dark raisins in the box but that this box was not representative of their fine product.  And here is the wonderful part of the story:  They sent us coupons for three free boxes of raisins to make things right!  Where could you find a better deal than that?  The Sun Maid people stand behind their product.
