I bought this matcha at a health food store. It cost me $29. At first I hated myself for spending so much on such a tiny tin. Then I tried it in a matcha frappucino and I am hooked. It all started with a green tea frappucino at starbucks....It was ok but not great...I knew I could make it better. After some research I found out that this brand is indeed the finest quality matcha around. I will be purchasing the 2nd harvest matcha next time as i only want to make lattes with it and its cheaper because the quality is not as high with the 2nd harvest. my recipe is this: in a blender add one cup milk ( I have also used almond milk and thats good) 1/2 cup ice, 1 tsp matcha, and one tablespoon torani vanilla syrup. These are honest guesses since i only eyeball things, if it doesnt taste right add more or less of something. I top it with whipped cream sometimes.
