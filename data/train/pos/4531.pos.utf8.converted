I have 2 poodle mixes and they had soft poop lately, so I tried giving them probiotics.  It didn't help.  So I tried giving them 1 tablespoon of this with each meal and now they are SUPER regular in their bowel movements and their poop has firmed up.  I don't even have to walk them for them to poop anymore!  They just go in the backyard.  Trust me these two rarely pooped in the backyard before I started giving them the pumpkin.  I do have a plastic dog can lid which I like to use to keep the fresher (at least I like to think so!).  None of my cans were dented.<br /><br />**TIP** I decided to give my dogs 1/2 tbpn since they are 15-20 lbs.  Since I can't use the whole can up in 3 days as recommended by the can, I used the 1/2 tablespoon to scoop little mounds onto a small cookie sheet, froze them in the freezer and then put the frozen scoops into a freezer zip lock bag for storage in the freezer.<br /><br />**UPDATE 4/25/12** My dog with the sensitive stomach, his poop got soft again even though I was giving him the pumpkin every meal.  So, now I added 2 tbspns of rice, and that's hardened up his poop.  I'll keep testing with different ratios of rice and pumpkin mixed with his canned dog food till I find the perfect output. Hahaha.
