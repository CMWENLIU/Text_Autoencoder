I ordered Lifetime Kefir's Kombucha starter and it arrived in just a few days. I followed their included instructions, and the starter mother grew quickly. I just drank my first batch of kombucha! It was definitely much more flavorful than anything you can buy at the store. It was richer and more complex. I highly recommend Lifetime Kefir's Kombucha starter. How rewarding!
