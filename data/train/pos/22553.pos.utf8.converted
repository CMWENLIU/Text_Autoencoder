First off, the bottles DO NOT contain BPA. The lids are coated in an epoxy that does, but there is another layer over that to help protect the BPA from getting to the formula. I actually called Similac's parent company to verify this.<br /><br />Yes they are expensive, but I get coupons all the time from Similac and use those to buy these bottles. They are wonderful for camping, fishing, or any other time sanitation may be an issue. All you have to do is attach your own nipple and ring. Much less to wash.<br /><br />Though they are really not made to do it, you can punch out the center from the ring and put in a standard nipple. It seems like it will leak, but it doesn't. Then you can just throw the whole thing away.
