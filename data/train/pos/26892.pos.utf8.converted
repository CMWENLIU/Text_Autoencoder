I was first given this treat on a trip through England when the B&B owner offered me some for my breakfast.  She had a sly grin on her face, and now I know she was expecting me to react like most Yanks do, but she and I were both surprised.  A tiny dab of this stuff on the corner of a piece of toast was sheer heaven to me.  I felt a sense of wellbeing spreading from my mouth throughout my body.  I know that sounds a bit extreme, but that's really how it felt!<br /><br />All my life I've craved savory flavors and have been drawn to foods such as red meat (preferably scorched on the outside), tomatoes, mushrooms, and dark green vegetables - I'll take one saltine cracker over a  handful of cookies any day of the week.  Well, come to find out, Marmite is high in the "fifth flavor" umami, and that's what I'm always trying to find in my food.  It's "that flavor I'm looking for" distilled down into a little brown jar.  Mind you, it's strong stuff; a little dab will satisfy all your red meat cravings (though it contains not one spec of any animal product) but more than a dab is really just 'way too strong, even for a savory-food-lover like me.  Spread it THIN!  It's great spread nearly transparently over toast or crackers, and a couple of drops will make any insipid canned broth lot more hearty.<br /><br />Caution: if you own a cat, make sure to wash your hands after eating Marmite.  Apparently they go for it, too, and will try very enthusiastically to remove your fingers and run away with them if any trace is remaining on your hands!
