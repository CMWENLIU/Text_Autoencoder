My little sister cats are very finicky, and they absolutely LOVE every flavor of Greenies.  The ingredients are all natural, and the extra vitamin B-1 helps as a flea and tick repellent...REALLY!  B-1, or thiamin, builds up with everyday consumption, and it causes an unpleasant odor to emit from the skin that is only detectable by biting insects.  It works on humans as well as animals.  GOOOOD STUFF!!
