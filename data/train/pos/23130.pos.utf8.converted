I now have more vanilla beans than I know what to do with for the price I'd pay locally for maybe 4-6 of them. These are all very nice, though I'm not a super high-end gourmand so if you are you might have specific needs that I'm unaware of like only getting a specific variety or brand. For this price, though, I now have 112 long, lovely vanilla beans. It's nice that they are in 4 separate vacuum packs, though it would make a bit more sense to have them packed in 8 different packs because it's the rare consumer that needs so many beans at once. They keep nicely though if you wrap them in wax paper then put them in ziplock and keep them somewhere dry and dark like your pantry. They are so cheap that I don't feel bad about using a bunch of them for air fresheners, even. I put a couple in my white sugar and I've been enjoying vanilla sugar in all sorts of things. Anyway, if you're looking for a great deal on a ridiculous number of vanilla beans, don't be afraid you're getting something sub-par for this price because they're better than any I've bought in those little glass tubes.<br /><br />-Edit Dec 2010-<br />These are now double what I paid for them. They are still a good deal at that price, but not nearly the steal that they were at thirty bucks. I don't know if they fluctuate in price based on some sort of seasonal harvest or availability, but buyers should be aware that the price can go up or down dramatically.
