This is hands down the best quality Guayusa you can buy anywhere today. Rich, fresh, consistent, and not too dry or too dusty.<br />The tea has a slight nutty flavor somewhat reminiscent of Darjeeling tea, and is very tasty and grounding. It has quite a bit of caffeine, but compared to coffee it is much gentler on the body.<br />The quality of the tea is very consistent between orders - I have received 5 orders in the last 4 months and they all were very similar and consistently excellent.
