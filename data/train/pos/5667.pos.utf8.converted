I used this gluten substitute to make the best sugar cookies my kids have had since they were diagnosed.  You only use 1 part of the gluten substitute to 5 parts of gluten free flour.  My first batch I used the same amount as for xantham gum and they did not come out right, then I did the math - 20 grams substitute: 100 grams flour and realized - DUH!!! 1 part to 5 parts and tried again.  OUTSTANDING RESULTS.<br /><br />Naysayers - read the directions, do the math - and try again - you won't be disappointed.
