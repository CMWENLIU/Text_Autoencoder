I was out grocery shopping yesterday and for the first time I saw this sauce. I usually don't try new things but since it was only a little under $3 where I was shopping I decided to pick it up and I am so glad I did. It is by far hands down the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted in my 25 years of existence. My husband also says this is the best he has ever tasted and thought it was made in the south because of the flavor. For a non-homemade sauce this is the best there is. Honestly it's hard to tell that it is even factory made. The creators who from what I read are a couple of Chicago natives definitely know what they are doing, and I am interested to try other products from them now as well.
