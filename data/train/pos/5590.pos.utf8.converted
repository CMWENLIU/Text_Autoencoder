This soup is DELICIOUS!  I have tried "bagged/boxed" soups and they usually aren't very good.<br />Plus they usually have maltodextrin and yeast or other things in them I want to avoid.<br />This soup is VERY simple, tasty and healthy. The ingredients are:dehydrated black beans, corn, red and green peppers, onions, garlic, epazote, and chili spices.  It seems that they got the balance of spices and veggies just right.  I find that difficult to do on my own.  Also since it packaged up nicely you don't have to go "scavenging" in your spice cabinet for all the spices.  I use my own chicken broth I make after roasting a chicken and it's a very healthy meal. (There is no added salt so if you are restricting salt you decide how much to add and what type of salsa you use.)So hurry up Amazon and get this in! :0)
