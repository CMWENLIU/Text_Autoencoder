Horray! There is no Alfa-Alfa in this food!!!! That's good for them!<br />Whomever makes guinea pig food with Alfa-Alfa is not very knowledgeable about the piggie diet. Alfa-Alfa has calcium in it. Eventually the calcium builds up in their bladder and gives them bladder stones (which tend to be painful to pass), and "sludge" in their urine (also uncomfortable if there is too much of it).
