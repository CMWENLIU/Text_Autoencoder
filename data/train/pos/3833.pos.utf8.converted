These are amazing! Sweet, crunchy and satisfying. It may seem like alot to buy, but they go fast! *********WARNING: The best place to store this product is in the bag it comes in! The bag must be specially designed to keep out moisture. I kept some in a ziplock bag and the rest in the bag they came in (just clipped it closed with a binder clip) and the ones in the ziplock bag got soft pretty quickly, but the ones in the bag that they came in stayed crunchy and are still crunchy.
