After 60-some years, I qualify myself to attest to the nature of peanut butter. I love peanut butter. Smooth or crunchy?  ... either is fine. I've made my own peanut butter in the blender. I've sampled peanut butters from Africa, Europe, Australia and Asia. They are all interesting and every country seems to have its national favorite. I picked up a hankering for peanut butter sauced spaghetti in China. The g-kids love it, the wife and kids ... not so much ... it's the concept of peanut butter that I appreciate.<br /><br />In the US we have the giants of peanut butter ...  Jif, Skippy and Peter Pan (JSPP). Some stores carry a designer peanut butter brand at a premium price. In the end, the consistently barely discernible difference among JSPP is marginally irrelevant. Does anyone say `I hate Jif but love Skippy?'  No. JSPP at the lowest price delivers the commodity equivalently. I would doubt that a blind taste test could discriminate among JSPP.<br /><br />In the US market dominated by JSPP, Planters just seems to appear as a butter out of peanut land. I don't think I have ever seen Mr. Peanut on a peanut butter jar before (or, I could just not remember). Was this new? Was it `different? Well, here's what the Planters web site says:<br /><br />"Peanut butter had some growing up to do. And as the reigning peanut experts, who better to make it happen than Planters? After all, isn't it about time for a more sophisticated peanut butter?"<br /><br />Taste test result:<br />1. Planters is smoother. It rolls of the butter knife without tearing a hole in the bread.<br />2. I taste and smell more concentrated peanut flavor.<br />3. Planters doesn't tend to clump and hang off the uvula requiring milk to resolve (although milk is certainly my recommended choice for beverage pairing).<br />4. In my 'blind taste test', Planters wins. It is a noticeably better taste and less mouth desiccating.<br /><br />Decision:<br />Planters has something different to add to the grocery landscape of JSPP. 5-star good peanut butter and my new first choice (if the price is right).<br /><br />p.s. My wife, out of the blue, said "Hey, that peanut butter you got is the best peanut butter I've ever tasted!" ... that's a "wow!" vote.
