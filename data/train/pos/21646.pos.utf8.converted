This product is great...but...for all of you that have praised its "great flavor" and "smooth texture", all I can say is, you MUST be some kind of hard-core health food junkies!!!  I gag every time I drink this stuff.  I have tried mixing it with OJ, apple juice, flavored yogurts, etc and I STILL can't get used to the taste and texture.  Now, mind you, I usually only eat my greens with bacon & hot sauce so that may be the culprit as to why I have trouble with this.  All that being said, for those of us that are trying to live a healthier lifestyle, this product is really amazing.  I have loads more energy and I just plain feel better every day.  I just HAD to comment in case any other heath food newbies or light-weights out there were feeling the same.  Please Note: do not let this discourage you from purchasing this, you might gag like me but it is TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!
