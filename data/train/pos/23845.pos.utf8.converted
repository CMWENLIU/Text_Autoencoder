I have used this product for several years and it makes wonderful yogurt and has some of the most useful bacteria in it.  I make a batch then take a sample out and put it in the freezer to use for the next batch.  That way the box of starter packets last quite awhile.  I keep them in the freezer.  I only use a new packet if for some reason my sample becomes messed up and starts developing an off taste.  This rarely happens, but it has happened and then I have something to start over with.  Great product!  Healthy solution!
