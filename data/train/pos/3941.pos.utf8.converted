Vita Coco's packing was a fitted box with extra cardboard and probably not enough on it's own. Amazon's added heavy duty bubble wrap that had very little give (different to what I usually see for other items) and box was packed well and I got my Vita Coco in quick time and in perfect condition. No leaks, no dents, all 6 boxes tasted good! Will now consider the monthly subscription. I was hesitant based on the poor reviews I saw about packing...but I think Amazon seems to have fixed that. Also I got from the other reviews that there was a bad batch that got shipped out which affected a lot of people. It also seemed that most people got replacements which I would be fine with. Will buy again.
