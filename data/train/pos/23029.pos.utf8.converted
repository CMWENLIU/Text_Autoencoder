I've been buying my sprouting seeds from this company for quite a while. I love how high-quality they are, and that they have a high-yield and are organic. Most people who have never sprouted before may not realize that you can't use regular seeds from the garden center of a store to sprout. It takes specialty seeds. I have a huge pantry and am well-stocked-up on most everything we use on a regular basis. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily planning for Armageddon, but having food and water storage makes a lot of sense to our family. When my husband lost his job years ago, we had plenty to eat and used cash resources to survive til he got another job. Sprouts are a great way of providing optimum nutrition for your family, take almost no space, are always grown and eaten fresh and can be grown on a countertop or dresser or anyplace warm enough for you to be...no special equipment is needed--you can use a jelly jar if you want to. I have EasySprout sprouters, which make it easy because you can also use the container and snap the lid on it to refrigerate after the seeds have sprouted. They sell these sprouters here on amazon for about $12 and they are a great deal. This particular blend of seeds are very high in protein...so if you are wanting to go vegetarian or just cut down on your meat consumption, this blend is a great choice. I also sprout other things, like seeds and grains and put them into favorite family recipes. Very cheap, nutritious, green/earth-friendly and tasty. The added benefit for me personally is that my 6 yr old sprouts in her own sprouter and she is excited to eat what she grows!!  This is a child who used to refuse to eat most vegetables, so we're stoked about it.
