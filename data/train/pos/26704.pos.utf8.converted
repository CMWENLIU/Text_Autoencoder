I recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn. I was surprised this was so tasty! It has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor, that's not too overpowering. This makes it easty to create a flavorful, savory snack without the extra calories. (As compared to potato chips or cheese crackers, for instance.) I hope to try the other flavors really soon.
