My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Sliced Chicken Hearts & Liver Feast; eight more cans of Sliced Turkey Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sliced Beef Feast. They also come with gravy flavoring--very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too.
