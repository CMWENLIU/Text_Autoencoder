I lived in Europe for a year and a half and drank this coffee almost daily.  I would drink Lavazza and Illy almost exclusively.  Since moving back to the US in January 2008 I have been drinking sub-par American coffee.  The usual suspects, Green Mountain, Starbucks, Newman's Own, Seattle's Best, etc.  I didn't remember what quality coffee tasted like and so I continued to drink these coffees pretending they were good.  It was not until I ordered Lavazza and brewed it in my French Press that I remembered what real coffee was supposed to taste like.<br /><br />This espresso roast is nearly perfect.  It is strong, but not bitter.  It tastes of dark chocolate and smokey wood.  And the best thing of all is the price on Amazon.  There's simply no reason to drink crappy American coffee.  Do yourself a favor and order this today.  If you like good, strong, European coffee, you'll love this.  Illy is probably a little bit better, but at $13 for 8.8 ounces it is just too expensive for what you get.  This is nearly as good, for a third of the price.
