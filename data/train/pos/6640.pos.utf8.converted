I was SO disapointed that the order only was one box of bread mix for $26.00!!!  I buy the four bread mix at Costco in the fall for only $8.00 a box and had expected my order to have four boxes of four bread mixes....was I ever shocked to find only one box!  Could this possibly be correct????  That makes each bread over $8.00, the bread mix is great but what a rip off.  I have emailed Amazon to make sure that the order was properly filled, but have not heard back from them.  Again the bread mix is great, we use it all the time, but the order if filled properly was outrageously expensive and NOT what I thought.
