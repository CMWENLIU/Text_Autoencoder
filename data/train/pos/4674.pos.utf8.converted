These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!
