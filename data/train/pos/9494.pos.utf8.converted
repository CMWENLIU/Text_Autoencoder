I am sipping on my first cup of Oothu green tea from Davidson's right now.  My first impressions are that Oothu green is a very clean tasting green tea.  I like to brew my tea very strong, and I don't detect any harsh or overwhelming grassy flavors. Visually, the tea looks of high quality, with very few stems.  The loose leaf tea has a slightly spiced aroma.  Overall, this seems to be a tremendous value.  16 oz is a lot of loose leaf tea!<br /><br />UPDATE 06.08.10<br />I just re-ordered the tea, and I wanted to note that Davidson's improved the packaging.  Rather than the packaging that is pictured, the product now comes in a resealable ziplock-type, foil-lined paper bag.  This type of packaging is ideal for tea and undoubtedly improves the freshness of the product.  I increased my rating by a star.  In my mind, this is the best deal in loose-leaf organic green tea!
