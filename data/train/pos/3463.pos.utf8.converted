This is excellent bullion at a bargain price.  Since its a powder you can much more easily make an accurate measurement of how much you want to add to your stock. And as a powder, it contains slightly less sodium than the familiar cubed bullion. A little of this powder goes a long ways for it is so rich.  So this 8 oz. package ends up being a bargain for it will last most of us through several winters. I highly recommend it.  It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States.
