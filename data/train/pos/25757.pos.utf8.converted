I'm a celiac and getting tasty treats is not as easy a it sounds. Pao de queijo (cheese bread) is easy to make and delicious. Thank you to Amazon for carrying it.<br />When you make them, mix the daylights out of them, they'll rise better.  One note of caution: do not make the bread-balls too big.  They will raise OK in the oven but not bake all they way through.<br />BTW.: They are magnificent stuffed with tuna salad or any other stuffing you can think of.
