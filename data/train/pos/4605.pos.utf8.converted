After spending more on allergen-free food from my vet than I spend on groceries for myself, I looked for a reasonable option for my special-needs kitty who is apparently allergic to something in regular cat food.<br /><br />This food is way cheaper than specialty food from the vet, and my cat's allergic reactions slowly went away after we switched. It smells like death, but it works.
