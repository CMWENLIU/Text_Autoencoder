I have fought mealie bugs on my adenium and hoya for years. One application and wow...no more mealies.<br />My Adenium look the best they ever have! My troubled Hoya is putting out new sprouts. The best thing<br />about this systemic is 'no mess'. The liquids and granuals always worried me.<br />Just came here to purchase some more.
