It consistently delivers. This is a product I simply cannot live without. I work full-time and go to school-full time. Also? I have cats, so every little bit of energy helps.<br /><br />Some people say this energy drink has a slight aftertaste, but I think it tastes light and citrusy, not harsh.<br /><br />This product has 10 calories, versus the "sugar-full" version, which, I believe has 150.
