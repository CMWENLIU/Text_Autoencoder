Everyone in my family tasted these with a bit of fear in their eyes - but everyone ended up loving them and we ate 2 bags the first evening!  They are small bags, but worth every penny.  Healthy and tasty, a cross between a wheat cracker and a tortilla chip with the added sweetness of the carrots, but with salt - sounds strange, but it REALLY is good!
