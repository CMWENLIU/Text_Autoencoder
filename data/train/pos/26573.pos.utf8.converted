We've tried many brands of unsalted peanuts and these are by far the best we've found! In fact, I've quit searching for better. These peanuts are extra large, roasted perfectly so that they're crunchy on the outside, yet tender and flavorful on the inside. You won't miss the salt at all, they are SO delicious just as they are!
