My wife and I give each other massages, it cuts down on the expense of going to a massage therapist and allows us some quality time.  We have tried a combination of cremes, oils and lubes on our quest to find one that:<br /><br />-is nice and slick<br />-doesn't dry out<br />-has a pleasant aroma and taste<br />-doesn't irritate the skin (i must have sensitive skin b/c several of the commercial ones gave me slight rashes)<br />-can wind up internally (sometimes one thing leads to another ;-)<br />-something that can be left on the nightstand<br /><br />I was shocked and surprised when I saw some comments on Coconut oil.  We have been using it for over a month now and really enjoying it.  It works well on skin and hair, tastes really good, and has a very pleasant aroma.  You can leave it un-refrigerated on the nightstand.  Best of all it is pretty inexpensive.
