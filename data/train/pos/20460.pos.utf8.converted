I needed to buy organic ceylon cinnamon, because it is the only kind of cinnamon that has less than 1% of coumarin, and this turned out to be perfect. It is a lot of cinnamon and will take forever to go through, but that's Amazon is known for, right? This was my first time tasting this kind of cinnamon and it was different at first, but now I love it! It is much softer, finer and has a beautiful citrus scent/taste. I highly recommend this product.
