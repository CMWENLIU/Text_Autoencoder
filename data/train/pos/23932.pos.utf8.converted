Put about 6 lbs. of chicken breast or pork roast in a crockpot, add about 2 tbl of Walkerswood, and slow cook for 8 hours.  Drain the liquid off THROUGH A STRAINER and set liquid aside.  Dump the strainer contents back into the meat.  Use two forks and shred meat barbeque style.  Add about 1-3 tbls of Walkerswood (depending on your personal heat index) and mix well, adding enough liquid back to keep it very moist.  Put in an airtight container and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Serve it, reheated, on buns, add a bit of cole slaw if you like, and it will disappear much quicker than you want it to.<br />Also, try a tablespoon in homemade chile and spaghetti sauce!
