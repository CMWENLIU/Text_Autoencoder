Perhaps the previous reviewer is starting out with polluted water, because if anything, Revolution Teas have a very clean and simple taste.  Their Golden Flowers version is no exception.  Probably one of the best Chamomile blends that I've ever had, it has a very natural and un-adulterated flavor.  It's not one of the most expensive teas on the market, yet manages to be steps above the crushed leaf standard teas that most people are used to.  This is a very soothing tea, perfect for a post-dinner experience.
