Love this tea... drink probably 3-4 cups per day with sugar and milk (or half n half).  This somehow managed to replace coffee for me, which if you would have asked me a year ago if I could stop drinking coffee in favor of tea, I would have thought it impossible.<br /><br />If you love tea (or even if you don't!), you've got to give this a try.  Very smooth; very tasty. :-)
