Like many others, I can't say enough good things about Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili sauce. There are other brands (some of which blatantly copy the bottle design) but stick with the original.<br />If you've never tried this you probably want to know what all the fuss is about. To summarise, Sriracha adds a kick to just about everything - it's a tasty slightly sweet/somewhat salty chili heat, with a gradual burn that gets better the more you consume. There are hotter hot sauces but often you want to enhance what you're eating - for this Sriracha is great. I find it's especially good with Chinese takeout or anything fried. Pizza, noodles, even a Salad benefits from Sriracha.<br />The only slight disadvantage is that sometimes the chili heat is a bit inconsistent from bottle to bottle. There have been bottles I've tried that aren't all that hot to others that were hotter than normal (and no, for me that isn't a bad thing!)<br />Anyway, I am pretty much addicted to this sauce. You may also want to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SKCVI">Huy Fong Vietnamese Chili Garlic Sauce, 8 Oz.</a> which is better suited for cooking with but you can use it as a condiment.<br />UPDATE: Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NRMHEE">Huy Fong Sriracha Chili Sauce, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> for the 12 pack instead of the 6 pack, it's a better value. Hope this saves you money!
