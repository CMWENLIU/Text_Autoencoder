I cannot believe they are getting $18.25 per jar. With shipping it's almost $30. This is a very good product but not worth that much.  I'm assuming that if people are actually paying this price that it is not available in any store in their area.  I live in Wisconsin and it is available year-round for $6-8 in most grocery stores.  Walmart has it only Nov.-Dec.  Each year right after Christmas it goes on clearance - I actually go there and stock up (I have about 12 jars right now).  I have never paid more that $3 per jar.  With a coupon I have actually gotten it for under $2. I get to enjoy Mincemeat pie year-round.  Before purchasing on Amazon please check around your town!
