I've been planning on trying Starbucks instant coffee for some time now. I'm a firm believer in trying something before committing. But the $3300 price tag on this was going to be a pretty big financial hit, especially after having been laid off from my job as a product tester at the chloroform plant. As you can probably imagine, I get into a lot of car accidents, and my old Pinto was once again in serious need of repairs.<br /><br />So I was stuck. Do I take out a loan to buy a new fender and Nomex shell for my Pinto, or use the money to enjoy the rich taste of fine Colombian coffee, hoping that the caffeine boost will avert yet another school crossing tragedy?<br /><br />Thankfully, once again Amazon has come to the rescue! The new ridiculously low price of $2.49 (that's 99.9256% off!) is practically charity! It's also literally a lifesaver! I never dreamed that I'd live in a world where I could both afford to get the dents and blood stains off of my car *and* enjoy a good cup of coffee! It's like living in a utopia! Now if I can just find another well-paying job inhaling dangerous chemicals then I won't have to keep hiding from the police and the bank's loan officers! Well, I might still have to hide from the police, but you get the idea. Thanks, Amazon and Starbucks!
