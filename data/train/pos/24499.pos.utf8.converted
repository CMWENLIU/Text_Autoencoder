The Panni dumpling mixes enable me to have potato dumplings any time that I want. Unlike making them from scratch, which is labor intensive and occassionally prone to failure (resulting in a watered down soup), this mix is almost foolproof. I have used this product for at least 30 years and have never had a problem. I get consistent high quality dumplings each time. This makes preparing a special German meal for friends so much easier. I highly reccommend this product.
