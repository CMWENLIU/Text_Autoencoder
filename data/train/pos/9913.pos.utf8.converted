There is not to much you can write about flour. But this is what I need to bake bakery type breads. I am baking my own sandwich(hoagie, submarine)rolls. And finally have duplicated pizza crust!<br /><br />Everyone thought I was crazy to buy such a large quantity. But I broke it down in to gallon sized zip lock bags. Each bag holds five pounds. I am storing the bags in my basement freezer, should keep forever.
