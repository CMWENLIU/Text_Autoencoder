If you think teas is just for when you are sick, you are saddenly mistaken<br />If you think decaf tea is "weak", I urge you to try again with the Twinnings Irish Breakfast decaf. This isn't a herbal tea that tastes like your neighbors' old grass clippings. This is real tea.<br />This tea has a rich, strong flavor without bitterness. It has a more robust flavor than Twinning's English Breakfast, which is also quite good. This tea is quite good in the morning as a wake up for those of us who have to avoid caffeine. And of course it's great at night because it doesn't have caffeine to keep you up.<br />I recommend everybody and anybody to try this tea. It is yummy.
