A previous grossly uninformed reviewer, stated that this cereal is FULL of sugar (aka. evaporated cane sugar).  She / he could not be more wrong.  Here's a little educational, factual information (sugar content in grams, per serving size in cups):<br /><br />Gorilla Crunch:  9g per 3/4 cup<br />Mueslix:  17g per 2/3 cup<br />Abundance:  9g per 1 cup<br />Kashi - Go Lean  8g per 1 cup<br />Cherios Banana Nut  12g per 1 cup<br /><br />What you DON'T get with Gorilla Crunch, but DO get with most other non-organic cereals is (put your reading glasses on):<br /><br />Partially hydrogenated soy bean oil, malt flavoring, high fructose corn syrup, distilled monoglyceride, alpha tocopherol acetate, niacinamide, vegetable glycerin, "natural flavor" - yeah, sunflower oil, canola oil, pal oil, caramel color annatto color, soy lecithin, various coloring (which BTW is benzine!), freshness preservatives ..... and the list goes on.  Do people not read the Nutrition Facts on the back of the box anymore?<br /><br />The Gorilla Crunch ingredients are:  Organic corn meal, organic evaporated cane juice, sea salt.<br /><br />Add some bananas, strawberries and blueberries to this cereal, and you've got yourself the most wholesome, nutritious, healthy and delicious breakfast on planet Earth!  :)<br /><br />Decide for yourselves people, but do your due diligence and your homework.  Ignorance is NOT bliss!  :) This is a wonderful and gunk free cereal.  Do you not all wonder why cancer is so rampant now days?  Do all the chemicals and preservatives and hormones (in meats and dairy) and things we can't even pronounce not play their part in it?  Think again....
