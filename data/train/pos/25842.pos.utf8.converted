These have become my absolute favorite candy, second only to chocolate!  I took a few handfuls to share at work today and all of my coworkers loved them too.<br /><br />The first positive thing I noticed about these after they arrived is that the serving size is * 3 * lollies, not just * 1 * -- not that I'm advocating overconsumption of candy, but if you have kids it's good to know that they can eat 3 of these without even getting close to a hundred calories!<br /><br />The Pomegranate and Berry flavors are traditional "red" flavor, only without the disgusting quality that most regular "red" lollies have of being made out of sugar and synthetic dyes.  Mouth-watering!<br /><br />The Lemon flavor is VERY lemony -- so much so that it tastes like you're chewing and sucking on a real lemon, lemon peel included.  At times it can be a little overpowering, but if you love real lemon flavor you'll love this.<br /><br />The Orange flavor is a typical orange flavor but pleasantly so.<br /><br />The Watermelon is very similar to the Jolly Rancher ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8GWR2">Jolly Rancher Hard Candies, Assorted Flavors, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> ) sort of Watermelon, but much, much tastier, with a very clean finish.  It is very much like licking a real slice of watermelon.<br /><br />The package I received also included a mango flavor, much to my surprise!  This, also, is fantastic.<br /><br />Overall I HIGHLY recommend these.  They are well worth the price, the package is HUGE, the quality is excellent, and they're natural and organic to boot!
