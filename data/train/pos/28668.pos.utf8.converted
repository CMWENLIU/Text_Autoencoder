I'm very pleased with this ginger - very fresh tasting, which is important since I use it mainly in beverages. The cheaper stuff just doesn't have the "bite" that this stuff does. Excellent!<br /><br />It comes packed in two one pound foil packs, so it should stay fresh for some time. It's a lot of ginger, but if you work out the cost per ounce, it's much cheaper than the smaller containers of quality ginger, and even a bit cheaper than the generic stuff you can buy at a discount (but worlds better in terms of taste).<br /><br />Highly recommend.
