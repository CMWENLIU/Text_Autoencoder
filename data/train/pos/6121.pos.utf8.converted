First off, I'm not one to leave reviews. Only if a product is extremely good or extremely bad. And as long as I've been an Amazon customer -- going on a decade or so now? -- this is my first review of a product.<br /><br />I'd like to consider myself a bit of a popcorn connoisseur. I love popcorn, but I'm extremely picky. It's either too stale tasting, not salty enough, too salty, not enough butter, too buttery -- you get the idea.<br /><br />Well, as the title suggests, three li'l words describe this butter to a T. It is unbelievably, incredibly, stupendously fantastic! This, combined with some Great Northern Popcorn make, in this lone popcorn fanatic's perception at least, sheer perfection.<br /><br />I've had some great movie theater popcorn in my day, and this emulates, if not actually TRUMPS, the best I've had. All the way down to the tickly aftertaste senstation you get in the back of your throat. It's dangerously addicting. If you like movie theater popcorn, this is quite simply THE one to buy.
