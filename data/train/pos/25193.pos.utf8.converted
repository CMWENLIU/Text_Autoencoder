These are one of the best snacks on the planet. The only thing that even comes close is Slim Jims. I used to get two small foil packs of these out of a vending machine, and a can of Pepsi for lunch every day when I was going through post grad school, and they never got old.<br />The smoke flavor isn't too strong nor so subtle that you can't detect it. They have a perfect amount of crunch, and just the right amount of salt as well. Wash them down with a Pepsi, (or Coke if you prefer) and it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />Why someone gave these a one star review due to the price is beyond me. You rate the  product here, not the price. But people also sue McDonald's for their coffee being hot, so what do you expect?<br /><br />If you've never had these give them a shot. You won't regret it.
