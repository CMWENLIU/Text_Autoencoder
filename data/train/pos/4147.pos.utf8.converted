I first purchased Joulies when they got their start on Kickstarter.  Since I purchased them I have used them almost every day in my coffee on my way to work.  I use them in a Thermos vacuum mug (in my opinion the best way to use them).<br /><br />Before I had Joulies, I would pour my hot coffee into my mug before I left and have to wait for about half an hour to actually drink my coffee.  This is because the mug does such a good job of retaining the heat in the coffee.<br /><br />When I use Joulies, my coffee is ready to drink in about 5 minutes.  The excess heat gets absorbed by the Joulies as the material inside changes phase from solid to liquid.  This heat is then released back into the coffee as the material goes from liquid to solid, so the coffee stays hot for a lot longer (this doesn't benefit me very much, because I drink my coffee pretty fast).<br /><br />I have tried using them in a regular coffee mug, and while it got cooler a little faster, it didn't stay hot for very long because so much heat is lost to the environment.  I wouldn't recommend using them this way unless you really need your coffee one minute faster.<br /><br />So far they have been really durable, I've dropped them a few times and shake them in my mug to circulate the coffee.  They have gotten a little scratched, but it is no different from well used silverware.<br /><br />I have purchased a couple sets as gifts for the coffee lovers I know, and they have been well received.  Perfect thing to get for someone who has everything and can appreciate the nice bit of thermodynamics that Joulies demonstrate.
