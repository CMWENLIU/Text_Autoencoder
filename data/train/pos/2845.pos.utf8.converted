If you want to taste something different, and truly wonderful, buy this product. &quot;Dulce de leche&quot; is a typical Argentinian product, and one of my favorite temptations. In case you are not familiar with it, I must say that you are really losing something great...<p>Dulce de leche is a dessert that can be eaten alone or as a topping (for example, on waffles, bread or ice cream). It is also used a lot in cakes and other pastries, and its savor is sweet. It is made by blending hot milk, sugar, and vanilla, and as a result has some nutritional value. However, the most important thing is that it is mouthwateringly delicious :)<p>Even if this product is extraordinarily good, it is important to choose the right label, because a good one can be guarantee of excellence. In my opinion, &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is one of the few labels that allow you to be certain that what you are going to eat is not only tasty, but also made of  superior quality raw ingredients. &quot;La Salamandra&quot; is very well-known in Argentina, but has also won some prizes in USA. For example, this product won the 2000 Fancy Food Show's Gold Trophy for spreads/sweet toppings. <p>All in all, I advise you to indulge yourself and give &quot;La Salamandra&quot;'s dulce de leche a try. The price isn't overly high, so you don't have much to lose, and all to win :)<p>Belen Alcat
