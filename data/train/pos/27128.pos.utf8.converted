So I'm not a vegan, just vegetarian, but I've been missing marshmallows for a while. Why we feel the need to stick ground up animal bones (gelatin) into food is ridiculous and unnecessary, but that's another debate.<br /><br />Anyway, I saw these in the store tonight and hesitantly purchased it, honestly thinking they would suck. Oh how I was wrong. These are delicious. They're fluffy, creamy and taste great. The only thing that could make these better would be if they were organic.<br /><br />They were pricey (at least locally, at the moment Amazon is out of stock so I don't know their pricing) but I would definitely buy these again.
