I must reiterate what another reviewer said.  Tasty Bite Madras lentils do taste an awful lot like beef chili, a perfect alternative for those who love chili but want a vegetarian alternative.  They also have a similar mouth feel and a nice hearty spiciness.  What they do not have is a lot of excess calories.  One can eat the whole pouch (2 servings worth) and only ingest a mere 240 calories.  That can't be beat!
