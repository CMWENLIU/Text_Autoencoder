I was a bit apprehensive about straying from the familiar Bob's Red Mill brand of gums, but I'm perfectly happy with this product. There's no discernible difference between this and the much-more-expensive BRM brand, so if you know you'll be using xanthan gum often, this is what you'll want to buy. I use some every day and have barely made a dent in my supply!
