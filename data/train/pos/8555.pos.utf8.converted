I love the unsweetened soy nut butter by I.M. Healthy. After eating some sweetened soy nut butter I wasn't sure I was going to like it but now I actually like it better.  It tastes very nutty instead of sickeningly sweet.  I love the chunky too!  The only thing I don't like is that amazon sells 6 of them for $29.99 PLUS $13.99 shipping when one of them cost me only $4.99 at Whole Foods!  Let's see- if I buy it at whole foods that's a savings of $13.99 in shipping costs!  I think i'll continue to buy it at Whole Foods until Amazon brings its price down.  The products is really good though.
