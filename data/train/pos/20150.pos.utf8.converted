Received a box of the Truffettes for Christmas from one of my husband's business partners (as a family gift!) and kept one of the bags in the fridge with the second bag ziplocked in the pantry. They are so rich, smooth and melty that we'd eat one a day as a special treat after dinner. Another review noted that they thought the chocolates bitter because of the cocoa dusting, which is true. But the dusting is a complement and perfect counterpoint to the sweet, rich truffle itself. It makes the truffle all the more delectable. I'm so glad I found them available online. My recommendation is that you bite through the cocoa dusting and let it melt in your mouth slowly. Mmmmmm.
