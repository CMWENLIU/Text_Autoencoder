Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews, many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.)<br /><br />When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)<br /><br />Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there were twice as much tea in each bag, for starters; this is a bit weak, and I use big mugs. I wish there was more pu-erh than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces) per bag. I wish that it was good for multiple re-steepings, as most pu-erhs are. A few more t-bags per box would be very nice too, or a lower price tag.<br /><br />In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals "eeew". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor wasn't there.<br /><br />But I found a way to make this perfect: I cut a bag open and mix it with regular pu-erh; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5L0I">Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> or a Camel's Breath tuo cha work beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!!
