They are good in cereal (Bob's Red Mill Muesli for instance) but are best in baking. I put half a cup or a cup in Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Gingerbread Mix and the result is outstanding. Try the dates, fig pieces and dried apple pieces (all from Bob's) in the gingerbread too. Absolutely wonderful and it keeps for days.<br /><br />For snacking, whole pitted dates are much tastier.
