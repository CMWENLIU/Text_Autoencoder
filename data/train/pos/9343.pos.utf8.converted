Cashews are my favorite nuts. Even cashews in a can bring back fond memories of the warm almonds bought at the Nut House in Cape May each year. No, the Emerald Whole Cashews don't match the magic of those ocean side cashews, but in their own right they are some excellent tasting nuts.<br /><br />I like the Emerald cashews because they are whole, sweet, and not overly oily or salty. They are seasoned perfectly and totally satisfy my cashew cravings. Today Mrs. Spudman opened a can of CVS whole cashews; of course, I had to open a canister of Emerald nuts for a comparison. The Emerald cashews surpassed the other in size, taste, and enjoyment.<br /><br />Emerald cashews aren't the least expensive snack, but they surpass most others. Be sure to eat these in moderation to avoid too high an intake of fat and /or calories.
