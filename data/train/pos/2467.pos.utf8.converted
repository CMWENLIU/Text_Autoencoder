To write this review is tricky. Blue Buffalo Cat Food is so superior to any other cat food. Nobody paid me to write this review, but I am aware it must sound like it. Because I am so content with it. My Kitties (3) love this food and I love that there is no crap in it like in all the other commercially available cat foods. My Kitties enjoy great health, they look exceptionally well and they are the liveliest Kitties on the planet. Besides my love for them I believe it to be Blue Buffalo Cat Food, that supports their well being more than any other cat food. (Minus the real expensive ones maybe...)
