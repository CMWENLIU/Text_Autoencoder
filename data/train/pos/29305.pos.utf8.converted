Los peperetes Sardines,,<br /><br />I'm American,, who loves sardines, especially when they are good, in my experience from the past sardines was just (tuna in a can) nothing much to it. However if you really want to taste some good sardines, by these, I know the price is high but the quality is well worth it, I received two packages very promptly.. and I was absolutely delighted with the taste and texture of these really nice small sardines..to be honest with you i rather pay for these sardines than by a new pair of pants...<br /><br />I've bought many different brands of sardines on Amazon. Mostly with great disappointment ... if you're a sardine lover and can afford it,, you would absolutely love Los Peperetes Sardinillas De Rianxo
