I started using Nighty Night about 2 weeks ago to help with my insomnia, and it is making a world of difference!  For anyone suffering from chronic insomnia like I have for years, try this product.  My daughter told me how it helped her for occasional bouts of sleeplessness, but my problem is more severe than hers, and I'm so glad I listened to her! I'm now able to fall asleep easily within 30 minutes of drinking this tea. I let it steep for 14-15 minutes, and the flavor is very pleasant. I add just a tiny bit of sugar to sweeten it. Soon after I finish it, I'm yawning and ready for bed! I'm sleeping through the night again, and even if I wake up, I'm having much less trouble falling back to sleep than ever before. I have not taken anything for my insomnia other than melatonin, and I think this works better than that!  Couldn't be happier now that I'm getting some quality shut-eye! I highly recommend this product!
