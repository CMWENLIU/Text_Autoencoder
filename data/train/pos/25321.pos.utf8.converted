When I ordered this food, I was expecting to wait longer than usual for it to arrive, but it came in less than one week.  I was also worried that my 2 cats, especially the older 7 year old, would not eat it, because since Petco stopped stocking Innova pouches, their favorite food before the pet food scare in early 2007, I've had some problems finding a reliable replacement.<br /><br />I decided to upgrade their food to something more nutritious, and tasty, away from Science Diet, which had been their emergency food replacement, and Innova was recommended on a holistic pet nutrition website, as an all wet foot diet (which is supposed to be the next best thing to a raw food diet), so I bought a case on Amazon, hoping for the best.<br /><br />When I opened the can, the cat seemed more interested in sunning at first, but then was soon seen eating half the can, much more than she usually eats.<br /><br />The food has 12% protein content, while Science Diet is only 9%.  It also has Vitamin E, amino acids, mineral chelates, and some vegetables that are good for carnivores.  It doesn't contain any grains or meat by-products, but does have carrageenen, which I believe is a thickener, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with this product.  I will be ordering again from this merchant because the process went so smoothly and it arrived at my door sooner than expected.
