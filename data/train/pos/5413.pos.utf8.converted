Yes, these olives remind me of my vacation to Europe. They know how to live and eat. Item came in strong plastic bag. Helpful hint ' you might want to save two large used glass jars before they arrive, so you can put olives in them. remember to add a little more water to top them off. The olive mixture is just right. (not salty). All I can say is enjoy.
