It's expensive, and it can be had for less elsewhere, but it's really, really, really good. If you have to refrigerate it, it turns very hard but softens up easily in the microwave.<br /><br />We sent some to my son-in-law who is stationed in Afghanistan. His unit went completely ape over it! If you have a soldier serving somewhere that relies on "drops" for grocery, this is a super treat for them!
