I bought this because I was looking for a lower cost alternative to the $12 small bags of Red Mill Xantham gum I had been using to make gluten free bread. I was trying to lower the total cost per loaf, otherwise I might as well buy the loaves in the frozed section which are pretty good. I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price. I also like the zip lock bag it comes in which is much more handy for baking and easy handling than the Red Mill bag.
