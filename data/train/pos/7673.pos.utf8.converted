The reviews as of today are correct.<br /><br />Navitas Naturals is a great brand. I prefer the cacao powder to the nibs but then freshness isn't a factor. I use a pound in no time. Be aware however, this is not a processed food. I've bought three pounds of cacao powder and all are slightly different in taste. I assume the Maca would be the same.<br /><br />Now..as to the taste. Well...it is different. Nothing something I would buy for the taste. It is smokey, deep, complex and if you take a lot, somewhat gagging. But I added  2 tbls to a 32 oz smoothie and couldn't really tell it was there (but then I loaded it down with cacao powder). It is also hydroscopic. More than instant potatos. Not as much as psyllium. Takes a few minutes to hydrate. Don't underestimate how much water it will absorb. It takes a lot.<br /><br />Medicinal benefits? I can't even sort out the anecdotal evidence I and those in my family I've given it to have experienced. Lots of clinical studies on the net. My concern, because liver failure was an issue, was it did no harm. And I don't see it did. Nor do I read of any in the literature.<br /><br />The five stars is twofold:<br /><br />I trust the brand (the packaging is great..it stands up in the cupboard and has a plastic liner. Light is kept out by the brown wrapper, water and air by the liner).<br /><br />Why not? The price is OK. Foodies (of which I am one) should know about Maca and this amount gives you more than enough to fool around with using it. Might be a recipe out there which needs a tsp or so of Maca in it to give it depth.<br /><br />Pills are usually overpriced and I want to see and taste the raw product (well not with some pills but with  supplements which are also foods).
