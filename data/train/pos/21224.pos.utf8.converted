I looked everywhere trying to find this plant. My Aunt has one but didn't know what it was called. I took pictures of it and took them to every plant place and nursery I could find. No one knew what it was. At last I was sent to a nursery that is ran by a master of plants. He knew what it was as well as that is was a prehistoric plant. I hope it lasts long enough to look like my Aunts whose is very big and beautiful<br /> It is a very low maintaince plant which is just what I like.<br /> Thank you Amazon. Without you I may have never found it.
