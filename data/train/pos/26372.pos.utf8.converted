We found out this is the BBQ sauce we've loved for years at our favorite roast beef sandwich place in South Boston, MA(Liberty Bell, if you're ever in the area) and my husband had to have it! We found it through Amazon, and it was a no brainer to buy it! Having it ourselves, won't stop us from going to our favorite haunt, we'll just have it to enjoy on other foods now, too! It's definitely on the spicy and zesty side and has a bit of a kick, so if you're looking for a sweet BBQ sauce, this one's not for you!
