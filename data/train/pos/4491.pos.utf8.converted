Had to try this coffee brand for my single brew machine.  Glad I did.  This is what fresh coffee should taste like.  Also like the idea that there is less plastic- don't want items brewed in plastic!  The flavor is the best- smooth and so fresh!<br />I hope they will consider making flavored coffees- vanilla, etc.
