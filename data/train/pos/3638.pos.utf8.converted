This product is awesome! I tried a couple tablespoons and POW! I did this for a few days and realized I do not need THAT MUCH energy. I take less than a Tablespoon a day in my shake and MAN, thats enough to keep me going for the entire day of work AND MORE. It's delicious when taken with a little agave or honey for a sweet tooth too! IT's RAWSOME AND YUM!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015Z20RU">Navitas Naturals - Certified Organic Kosher Raw Vegan Healthy Cacao Chocolate Powder - 16 Oz.</a>
