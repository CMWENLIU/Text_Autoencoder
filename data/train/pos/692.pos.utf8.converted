i have tried 3 pamela's products:  the brownie mix, the pancake mix and the bread mix.  first the brownies -- best i've ever tasted - i'm addicted to these things!  i tried doing the applesauce substituted for oil and i don't recommend that - the brownies were too dry.  the oil recipe is definitely the best -- also substituting espresso for water was yummy -- the pancake mix is really good too.  i've made the pancakes and the waffles - the waffles are the best i've ever tasted, with or without gluten.  my co-worker used the pancake mix as a substitute in a regular recipe that called for all-purpose flour and said it worked great.  finally, the bread - my friend made me a loaf of bread in her bread machine and it was pretty good --not dry like most gluten-free products.  the only thing was that when i tried to toast it, the bread remains moist - it won't toast!  weird...anyway, i recommend all three products and buying them off amazon will save you $1.50 - $2.00 off the package price at the supermarket!  A++++ on these products!<br /><br />karissa, texas
