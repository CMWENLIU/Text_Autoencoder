I am not a raving optimist and am a highly ciritical comsumer. I have never before publicly rated any product 5 stars. This is a 5-star product.<br /><br />Why? It tastes good :)<br /><br />Seriously, it has near-zero acidity, an inviting aroma, and can be drunk without prior consideration as a "dessert coffee" just as easily as a "breakfast coffe". It's as versatile as a swiss-army-knife and as refined as the highest grade Damast linen.<br /><br />I have had 7 other distinct Kona coffees purchased on my behalf on the Kona island and brought home for me to try. All others Konas were compared to this one and found lacking (in some cases seriously lacking). No "Kona blend" will ever again be found acceptable once you drink this coffee.<br /><br />So, not only is it a 5-star coffee among general coffees (including the "Charbucks" of the world...yech!), but it is a 5-star coffee among other high-achiever coffees.
