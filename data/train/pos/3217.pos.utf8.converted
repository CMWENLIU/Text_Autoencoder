I got hooked on the House Blend at a gas station near the house. When I found out they had it in the k-cups I immediately stocked up. It's not too acidic (like Columbian) and not too weak (like a breakfast blend). It's my go to coffee for just about any time of the day. Definately worth a try if you have never had it!
