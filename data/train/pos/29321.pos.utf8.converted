I have been drinking tea ALL my life and this tea "Russian Royal Tea" is at the top of my list.<br /><br />This tea is bold and very rich in flavor, it's pure Cylonian tea leaf packed in Sri Lanka. Now days lot's of tea companies add "flavoring" to tea to make it fruity or nutty or what have you, this one is PURE! It's kind of pricey, but work every penny.<br /><br />You can find this tea in many local European and Russian deli stores, and usually goes for around $6-8 for 250 grams. But be careful there seems to be a look a like tea with similar name and label, it comes in a "soft" paper package, while this one comes in "hard" cardboard like package. The two teas are completely different and the other one does add flavoring to it, I'm not saying it's bad, just different.
