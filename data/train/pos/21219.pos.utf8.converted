We've tried so many K cups, and we keep coming back to Tully's French Roast. It is great both black and with cream, and the flavor is always strong but never bitter. Sometimes I want even more of a bite than this offers, so then I'll reach for Timothy's Magic Mountain. But on the whole, if we could only buy one type of K cup for our Keurig, it would be this one.
