I bought these for my mother-in-law's birthday, and they were a hit! I hate how all the other online flower sites have a huge processing fee that is almost equal to the cost of the arrangement, so I was ready to try ordering from somewhere else.<br /><br />I ordered these cut purple orchids on April 12th, and they shipped from Florida that day. My MIL received them in Oklahoma on the 14th, and they were in beautiful condition.<br /><br />The flowers shipped with individual tubes for each stem, so they were kept very fresh. Also, when I stopped by my in-law's house for Easter more than a week later, the orchids still looked fabulous! I will definitely order from this seller again if they keep their prices competitive. Spending about $30 total is great for quality orchids!
