I use this for everything- from cooking to hair care to body care. It is truly an all round product. My 4yr old daughter loves it on her hair which by the way has completely cleared a dry scaly festering wound she had on her scalp. Her hair is so soft (we are Africans by the way) and it tastes great when added to noodles and the likes.<br />We love it!
