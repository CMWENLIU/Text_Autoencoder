Don't let the lower price fool you.  This stuff is easily as good as other brands of greek coffee.  In fact, it's my favourite!  It has an almost chocolatey taste to it.  Smooth and wonderful.<br /><br />To make the best coffee, pick up a stainless steel maker like this one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RZWIY8">Stainless Steel Turkish Coffee Pot (14 fluid Oz)</a>  Not as pretty as the copper ones, but it makes a great coffee and it will last forever.<br /><br />Per coffee, medium-sweet: one demitasse cold water, two teaspoons coffee, two teaspoons sugar.  Apply medium heat on gas, high heat on electric.  Stir once after it's started to warm up a bit.  When coffee starts to rise, let it get close to the top, then remove from heat.  Let sit for 30 seconds, then pour into demitasse cup(s), with a slight rocking motion to get the froth off the inside of the pot.  Cheers!
