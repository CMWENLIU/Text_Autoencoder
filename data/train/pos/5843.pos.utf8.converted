My husband is a coffee lover; a connoisseur.  Okay, in reality, he's a coffee snob.  He likes his coffee strong, dark, robust, flavorful,  and piping hot.  Being from Minnesota, his usual preference has always been Obsidian flavor from Caribou Coffee.  However, the day he tasted his first cup of Kicking Horse (Kick Ass), he deemed it the "Best Coffee on the Planet" and has not since found any other that comes close!<br /><br />We first discovered this coffee while on a camping trip in Canada.  There, in the midst of six national parks in the heart of the Canadian Rockies (fondly known as Kicking Horse Country), we purchased our first container of Kicking Horse Coffee, primarily for its name.  We were deeply enjoying the beauty of the land around us and happy to support the local economy.  Back at camp we brewed our first pot and I've never known my husband to enjoy his java more intensely.<br /><br />Since that time, Kicking Horse has come to mean much more to this family than our endeared vacation spot.  The term now resonates as reference to the premier coffee.  I'm so glad we can now purchase it online;  my coffee-loving husband is a happy man and It saves a bit on gas!
