There is no argument as to the numerous health benefits of drinking green tea.  In fact, it's actually used in cancer centers as it's been proven to actually fight some types of cancer and prevent free radicals in addition to also being shown as a metabolism booster in study after study. That alone makes it a find!<br /><br />The best type of green tea with the most benefits is, of course, matcha...regardless of what brand you buy.<br /><br />Although I found the size to be small as there is also a bag inside the tiny tin, a little goes a long way and I've used it to make everything from green tea biscotti to green tea smoothies.
