I buy this product as a dietary supplement for my African Grey Parrot.  It helps keep his feathers nice and shiny and discourages plucking.  Its not appropriate for all species but greys eat palm nuts in the wild and need a high intake of oil in their diet.  My bird loves it and will eat it right off the spoon.
