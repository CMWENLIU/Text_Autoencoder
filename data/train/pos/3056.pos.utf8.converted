One day I was watching Huell Howser and he was visiting a Cuban family.  Grandma was making coffee and offered him a cup.  He went on and on about how good it was.  Luckily, I could see the can - it was Cafe La Llave.  I was thrilled when I found it at the store.  Mind you, I had tried a lot of different coffees, many very expensive, and was delighted that this one was reasonably priced.  When I made the first pot at home, I was very happy with it - it was the best one, and the least expensive.<br /><br />I have been using Cafe La Llave for six years, and have introduced it to other coffee drinkers.  They always say I make great coffee, and I always point to my can of Cafe La Llave.<br /><br />If you want good, rich coffee, this is the one for you.  You don't have to make espresso with it, I use mine in a percolator, a French press, a drip coffee maker, and even a Melita one cup coffee insert.
