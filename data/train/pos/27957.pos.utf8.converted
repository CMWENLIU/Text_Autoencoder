This is my favorite whole wheat pastry flour.  It has a very fine texture & it doesn't have big pieces of bran like some brands I've tried.  I use it 100% in pancakes & they turn out light & fluffy.  I also use it as about 50% (regular white flour for the remaining 50%) of the flour in biscuits.  We like really fluffy biscuits, so that's why I only use half.  Works great in cookies too.  This is for non-yeast baking & works much better than w.w. bread flour in cookies, pancakes, etc.
