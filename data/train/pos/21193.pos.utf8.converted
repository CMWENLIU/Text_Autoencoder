In a couple of recent reviews I've blasted some "Healthy" soups for being unnecessarily bland.<br /><br />Well, you don't have to worry about that with this soup. Progresso generally gets it right, and this is no exception. A one cup serving of the soup is filling, and is only 80 calories. Is it the thick and creamy chicken and dumplings that my mother and grandmother made? Of course not. However, you do get enough small dumplings and pieces of chicken to at least make you think you're not just slurping up broth. LOL<br /><br />The addition of carrots, celery, and a pleasing set of spices insures that you'll enjoy this bowl of soup. It is filling, healthy, and tasty. You can't really ask for more than that.
