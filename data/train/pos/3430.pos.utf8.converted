"Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first.
