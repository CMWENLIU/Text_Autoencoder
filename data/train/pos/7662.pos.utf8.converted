I was told your maca powder was the best, so I ordered two bags to benefit from the free shipping.  I was a little leary when I opened the bag and it smelled stronger than any other maca powder I tried.  Then I mixed it in a protein shake and then a smoothie and I was convinced.  I couldn't taste the maca powder at all like I had with other brands.  I will definately continue to purchase my maca from Nativas Naturals.
