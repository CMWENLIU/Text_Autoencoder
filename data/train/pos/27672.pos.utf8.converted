These are truly delicious dark red kidney beans. Although higher priced than the "other" dark red kidney available online, these do not appear to be from China as the case with the other brand. After the dubious quality of foods coming from China - I'd personally prefer to pay a tad more. These cook well, become plump and very tasty...just like a kidney bean should be. Spouse immediately noticed the diffrerence (much to my surprise!) and insisted on purchasing these above all others for chili/other dishes. Very good selection.
