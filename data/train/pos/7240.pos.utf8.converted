I just transitioned my 8 month GSD to the duck recipe.  I was using Orijin Large Breed Puppy previously for the grain free/low calcium aspect.  However, it was difficult to find and really expensive.  After researching different brands, I found this one.  Again, it is grain free and low calcium, high quality ingredients and about $10 - $12 less than Orijin!  My dog transitioned very easily and really quite quickly.  I was surprised she didn't have the loose stools that some have experienced while transitioning.<br /><br />In addition, I am finding that I am actually giving her less food than the Orijin.  She is satisfied at 3/4c - 1c.  With Orijin, she wasn't satisfied until she had almost 2 cups.  I thought she was eating less because she didn't like it, so I added a few things to it and she would still stop at 3/4c - 1c.<br /><br />Her coat is amazingly shinny and I have found that she is shedding less.
