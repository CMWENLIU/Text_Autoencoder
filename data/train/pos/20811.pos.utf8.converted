I am not a salt person - I'm on high blood pressure meds, yes, but have never been a big fan of salt except on french fries and onion rings (which I allow myself only infrequently) anyway.  It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled sauces I use generally have way too much sodium all by themselves).  They are excellent with shrimp or with scallops.  Good stuff and the AMZN price (plus no tax and no shipping) makes them much more reasonable than local stores.
