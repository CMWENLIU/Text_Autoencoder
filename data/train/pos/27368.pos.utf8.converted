I love this formula! It's great for babies and not full of tons of chemicals and waste.  I started my daughters on this formula to supplement because I couldn't keep up with her appetite. Other formulas taste HORRIBLE, and had a bad metallic taste. This formula tastes much better and smells better too. My child didn't have any problems with constipation but her BM's where much more pasty compared to the watery breast milk ones. If you do feed this is an infant make sure you give them a **VITIAMIN D SUPPLEMENT**. This formula does not contain enough vitamin d, but and neither does breast milk (so no biggie). But it has just enough and (in most cases) more vitamins than other formulas! It's nice to know you're not giving your baby crap. I would recommend this, BUT do not go with Earth's Best, it contains hexane which is dangerous for babies. My only complaint would be that it is foamy, but if you let it sit for a few minutes then it goes away. :)
