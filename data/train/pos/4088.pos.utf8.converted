I use this stuff like it was ketchup, honestly. It goes with everything. Hoisin is awesome on chinese food, thai food, vietnamese food, its good with hamburgers, fries, and even with steak instead of steak sauce. Hoisin is sweet, and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments. The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook, and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color, and Yan Can do no wrong with me!!!!
