This is the best nut butter I have ever tried.  I bought an assortment of squeeze packets of Justin's nut butters to take on a backpacking trip and found that this maple almond one was my favorite, hands down!  I got my brother and his wife hooked on it too, and I can't wait for this item to come back in stock because they were out of it at my local Whole Foods.  Try it on banana or apple slices, it's a delicious and healthy snack and satisfies my sweet tooth!  The only down side is that it is not made with organic almonds, that would make it even better.
