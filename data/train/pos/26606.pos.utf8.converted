This oatmeal is the only kind that I have found to be gluten-free.  It is tasty and cooks quicker and has better texture than rolled oat varieties of oatmeal.  The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter in 2004 with lab analysis showing that McCann's had significantly less gluten on median than two other brands; unfortunately, the analysis also showed that one of the four samples of McCann's had high gluten, so it's possible that there may occasionally be bad batches, or it's possible that they mixed up their sample of McCann's with the other brands since the other three samples were so different.  The World Health Organization's definition of gluten free is less than 200 parts per million (ppm), and the more conservative definition is less than 20 ppm.  The four samples of McCann's had gluten contents of:  &lt;3 ppm, 12 ppm, 23 ppm, 760 ppm.  The second brand was around 100-200 ppm.  The third brand was around 300-800 ppm.  McCann's is clearly better.  I have personally had no problems with it, but I have had problems with the second and third brands that they tried.
