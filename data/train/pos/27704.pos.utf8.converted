As someone who has gone Paleo diet for weight control reasons as opposed to gluten allergies, I was looking for something that stuck with the restriction of the diet while still offering satisfaction in taste and satiety.  Up till now I have been using coconut flour and other low cal ingredients to tend to that snack/indulgence urge, but its a hassle and prone to heating up the house too much with the oven use.  These cookies come in small, individually wrapped servings, about the size and thickness of a oreo's single waffer.  They are dense and chewy and give a fairly pleasant experience both in mouth feel and taste, in fact they taste IMHO better than most home baked cookies, and even better than what I made for myself.<br /><br />However don't expect them to arrive with a week or so, I guess they make them in small controlled batches (given the individual packaging this wouldn't surprise me) and that takes time.  I tried all 3 and though all were great, I liked the oatmeal raisin the most.  I will definitely keep a few bags of these on hand as I think they should freeze pretty well and I can thaw them in small batches, my only complaint about them is their size and calorie density, for how good they taste, I want to be able to eat a lot more than I should lol.
