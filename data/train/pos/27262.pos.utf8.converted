I went over to a freinds house for dinner one night and after a great meal, they brought out the dessert. They gave us the options to have coffee, tea or Cafe Orzo along with it. Normally, I am a big tea drinker, not coffee, so for a change, I decided to step out on a limb and try the Cafe Orzo drink. It was super delicious and now dessert just feels lonely without the Cafe Orzo. Yummy!
