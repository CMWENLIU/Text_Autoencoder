If you are missing real louisiana Red Beans and rice and want some NOW or if you don't have 3 or 4 hours to devote to making your red beans then this is for you. These rice mixes are some of the best foolproof real(not parboiled ) rice mixes ever. Louisiana founded  and beloved by Louisiana natives. I send these to all my friends every Christmas. Try Black Beans and rice mix also. Much better than Zatarin's  I use them myself often a New Orleans native.
