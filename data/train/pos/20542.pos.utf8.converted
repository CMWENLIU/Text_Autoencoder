Hershey's Sugar Free Dark Chocolate candy bars tastes very close to the full sugar version. Dark Chocolate was always one of my favorite treats before coming a Type 2 diabetic, so it is great being able to have it again in a sugar free version. There is a little bit of an after taste with these but dark chocolate is usually bitter so it isn't really an issue for me (but my wife says she notices more than I do).<br /><br />I should mention that eating too many of these (more than 3 or 4) does cause me some "gastric distress", so you might want to try them at home before eating a bunch while out in public.<br /><br />Recommended
