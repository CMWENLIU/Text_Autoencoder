I brought 20 packets of this over from New Zealand because I was simply stunned at how authentic this curry paste was, and I did not think I would find it in the US. But here it is on Amazon! I have ZERO hesitation in recommending this brand of Asian spices. They are as authentic as I have ever come across. It tastes exactly like restaurant food. Actually, better than some restaurants. Even the price is better than NZ. Oh I am so happy tonight. I was saving these packets for special occasions, and now I can just go nuts :)
