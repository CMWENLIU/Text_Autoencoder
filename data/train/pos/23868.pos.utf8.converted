While these are insanely expensive, they are wonderful and keep a long time in this dried form.  I was lucky enough to find them on sale so got several bags and they've kept beautifully.  This is a good-sized bag and because of the robust flavor of the porcini mushroom, a little goes a long way, so a single bag lasts quite a while.  Many soups seem to be better with a bit of this added and a mushroom soup is to die for.<br /><br />The mushrooms reconstitute really well and are in big enough pieces to make a hearty mushroom accompaniment for poultry or steak.  They can be chopped into smaller pieces, of course, for other applications. The richly infused reconstituting water offers a good base for a sauce.  I don't usually even bother to strain the broth since the product is quite clean.<br /><br />I've tried other dried porcini in the past and have not been impressed, which is what led me to go with this brand even at its higher cost.  I'm so pleased, I'll be sticking with it.  Highly recommended.
