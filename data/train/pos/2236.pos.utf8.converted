Pure sex in fudge form... I WILL be buying more in the future, and would like to try out some of the other flavors offered. I'm looking at you peanut butter...<br /><br />What great packaging these fine people use! The fudge itself came in a nice cozy little box, which was lined with a special ice pack to keep it cold during transport, which was then wrapped in a special bubble wrap which I assume keeps EVERYTHING well insulated! Arrived perfectly un-spoiled and ready to eat out of the box.<br /><br />I shared this delish treat with my room-mate, and we both went NUTS over it!
