After I started using Shakakai and Amla powder on my hair with fantastic results (you can see my reviews for them as well) I did some research on Avurvedic hair care and decided to try using oil on my hair as well.  I found studies showing that coconut and olive oil are two of the few oils that will penetrate the hair shaft so I started mixing them (50/50) to use in my hair after washing as a leave in treatment.  The result was unbelievably soft hair!!!  But even better than the way it's worked on my hair is the way it's worked on my daughters hair.  One of my girls has very curly, baby fine hair which does NOT make for a good combination when it comes to tangles.  The first time I used these oils I was able to brush through her hair with virtually no tangles!  But the best thing was the way it made my hair feel.  I have a sensory touch sensitivity... I can't tolerate feeling oil or sticky substances on my hands.  I can't even stand to pet dogs who have short, coarse fur.  So it goes without saying that I was a little concerned about putting oil in my hair!!!  But not only did it turn out super soft, it is absolutely non greasy once it absorbs into the hair and it also feels cleaner somehow.  My hair looks super shiny and healthy... I'm so amazed at the difference.  It's really done wonders!
