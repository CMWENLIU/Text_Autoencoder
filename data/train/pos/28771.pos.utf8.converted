I bought the coffee originally because i liked the idea of an organic coffee that was french roasted. i like a strong cup of coffee and this coffee provides that as well as one of the best aromas and tastes of any cup of coffee ive ever had. I use this coffee with an inexpensive grinder and a nice percolator. This coffee is absolutely worth the price.
