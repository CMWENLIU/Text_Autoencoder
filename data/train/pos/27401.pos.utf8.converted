I adopted two very undernurished kittens from the Humane Society, whose on-staff vet said that AvoDerm dry and canned food is the best on the market for cats. When I took the kittens for their vet checkup 6 months later, my own vet also agreed that this is the best food available and was so pleased with the health of the kittens. My older cats have also seen a huge improvement in their coats -- much more silky and shiny, shedding is reduced and their weight is easily maintained on this food. I recommend trying this food if you have finicky cats or they have health problems.<br /><br />My cats absolutely LOVE all the Avoderm Select Cuts (chunky-style) flavors AND all the flavors of this pate-style food. The seafood flavors seem to be the most popular among the cats, but many vets recommend avoiding too much seafood for male cats due to the urine crystals it can cause. I started feeding the beef and chicken exclusively and they eat every last drop.<br /><br />Bottom line: It costs more than your average food, but it's worth every penny (buying it by the case can give you a pretty good discount from most vendors). If you consider that it keeps them healthier, which can save you from expensive vet bills in the long run, then it's worth it. Plus, think of the time you'll save not having to clean up after their shedding! Also, I've noticed that this brand does not result in the runny, smelly poo that some other, cheaper brands do. Try this food out on your cats -- you'll be pleasantly surprised.
