My daughter asked me to make her more vanilla extract for next Christmas.  Ordered these beans  on a weekend and received them early the following week.  Tahitian beans smell more mellow than Madagascar beans, so I anticipate a unique  vanilla extract by mixing the two.  I was able to  order much more product than I could afford in the store.  And I will leave the beans in the Vodka for 11 months so by Christmas the extract  will be just wonderful.  These  beans arrived plump, blemish free and very fragrant.  Will definitely order again.
