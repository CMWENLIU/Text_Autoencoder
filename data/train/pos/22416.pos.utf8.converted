I researched food extensively when preparing for my German Shepherd puppy.  I eventually settled on Canidae for the quality and price.  Unfortunately the store that carried it was just way out of my way for routine pick-ups.  I hadn't gone w/ CS because I couldn't find it at the specialty pet shops around.  To my surprise my hometown feed store carried it and it was less than the Canidae.  He's had this since he was a pup and his coat is always shiny.  He's a long-coated shepherd so it really shows.<br /><br />Trust me.  Get this.  Now that Amazon is offering free shipping on it I'll buy it here from now on.
