I used to be hooked on Tabasco, but when the whole "Buffalo Wing" craze started, I HAD to know what that sauce was... !!  And, when I found out it was Frank's RedHot mixed with a little butter, I was in HEAVEN!  I make hot wings at home for hubby and me (with a side of celery and homemade bleu cheese dressing!) every couple of weeks and always have a bottle of Frank's in the pantry.<br /><br />But, when I read about Frank's RedHot Sauce in Cook's Illustrated magazine about 5  years ago (I've been a subscriber since the magazine's inception) I decided that it needed to see more use than just hot wings.<br />Cook's tested it against other hot sauces, one of which was Tabasco, and Frank's came out #1 (To quote CI: "Tasters liked Frank's "bright" and "tangy" notes and potent heat when sprinkled atop a portion of steamed white rice. The full, tomatoey complexity and "luxurious" body of Frank's was also a high point for many tasters. One taster put it succinctly: "Tabasco is an ingredient, while Frank's is a condiment."") and Tabasco came in last... "Tasters said the searing heat masked any other flavor in the sauce, and most found the thin, watery body to be unappealing. "Bitter, like pepper skin," said one taster. Our recommendation is to use Tabasco for its heat, and that's all."<br /><br />The CI review opened my eyes!  I couldn't agree more and now I use Frank's in place of Tabasco with great success!  We love our food spicy, so now it's Frank's and Sriracha (which is a little more garlic-y and a little sweeter)... and maybe some Tabasco added if I want a little MORE heat!
