I was a little bit leery of ordering a product like this by the case, but found them to be very satisfying.  They have a bit of a "bite" in the cheddar cheese which is too my liking.  I will certainly be ordering more of them, and it is very hard to set the bag down once one has started eating them.  I highly recommend the product to a white cheddar fan.  J. Scheer
