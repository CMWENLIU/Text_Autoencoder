Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason.

I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]
