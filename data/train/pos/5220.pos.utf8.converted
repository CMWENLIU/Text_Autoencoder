This was my first filter bag for making nut milk, which I have been using almost daily for a couple of months now.  It strains the milk very well--much better than cheese cloth.  However, I would recommend purchasing the 2 quart bag over the 1 quart for the obvious reason of making larger batches when needed for additional use of the milk as an ingredient or for more people.  Also, the 2 quart bags are MUCH easier to transfer the milk into from a blender.  They are very reusable, and wash in a few seconds.  Very easy cleanup.  This product is saving me tons on what I was spending on purchased/prepared nut milks, and homemade milk has many health benefits over purchased alternatives (e.g. raw, free of preservatives, etc.).  You need one!
