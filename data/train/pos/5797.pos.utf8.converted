I decided to be creative with my Thanksgiving turkey this year by using rendered duck fat instead of butter.  I was so glad to find this at such a great price!  I ordered 2 jars with standard delivery and it was at my door 2 days later!  I blended fresh herbs with the fat and worked it under the skin.  Wow!  This really elevated the taste and gave it a nice crispy skin.  The breast meat was so moist and tender--almost steak-like.  I can't wait to use this again.
