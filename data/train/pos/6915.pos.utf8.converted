Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is certainly one of the most sinful of foods but, oh my gosh, is it delicious! It is a very rich but very flavorful coconut cream made from certified organic dried coconut meat from the Philippines. (I live in southwest Florida and room temperature here is just perfect for ensuring a very spreadable coconut cream).<br /><br />When I first opened the jar the fresh fragrance of coconut made my mouth water! Just like a kid, I could not resist sticking my finger into the jar and taking a big, generous taste. My taste buds simply exploded when the unique flavor of this decadent coconut cream melted on my tongue like sweet butter! And just like a kid, I know I will be tempted to take those sinful dips into the luscious coconut manna jar.<br /><br />I have noticed other reviewers' comments about the "grittiness" of this product and I just want to point out that coconut meat is a high fiber food and coconut manna is 100% whole coconut, so the texture is much like one should expect in a high fiber spread. Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna contains 12% fiber and 9% protein, whereas coconut oil contains none.<br /><br />Coconut in general is such a versatile food with an extraordinary taste and all manner of health benefits. In Sanskrit, the coconut palm is called "kalpa vriska" meaning "the tree that supplies all that is needed to live." But I must be frank...I do not think Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna or any coconut product should be used as a food therapy for any health purpose. Coconut meat is nearly all fat, 80% of which is saturated. With that said, as difficult as it will probably be, I will be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna only sparingly (but with utter enjoyment!)<br /><br />Being a raw vegan foodie and with the holidays quickly approaching, I do look forward to getting creative with Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna and devising culinary applications with it, such as in my raw, vegan spreads, soups, smoothies, sauces, cheeses, and especially in desserts. Of course I will have to consider it a celebration food because of the high saturated fat content. This luscious treat is not the best choice for health or waistline but it is so good to the palate! I will definitely be using Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna for special occasions, for entertaining and for those times of private indulgence when I need to treat myself... and I will do so with wild abandon!
