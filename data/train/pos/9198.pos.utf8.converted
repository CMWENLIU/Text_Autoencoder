Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines are the best sardines I have EVER eaten!  I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier, and when one of the attorneys in our office prepared a plate of sardines, sliced tomatoes and cottage cheese for lunch, I was intrigued.  He let me try the sardines and I was hooked!  They are absolutely delicious!  And they don't have that strong "fishy" smell most sardines have.  Unfortunately, my local grocery store doesn't carry them so I was extremely pleased to be able to order a case from Amazon, and I'll keep on ordering them until I can get them locally.
