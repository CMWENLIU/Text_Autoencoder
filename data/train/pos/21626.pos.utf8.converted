If you love quinoa, as I do, you will be pleased with this product.  The problem with the quinoa I have been able to purchase in local outlets is that it has to be washed, which is a major nuisance.  This product is prewashed and very simple to prepare.<br /><br />I frequently make up a big batch and keep it in the refrigerator to use as needed.  It makes a quick and healthy alternative to the potatoes, pasta, or white rice I prepare for my husband.  When I want to add something, usually spinach or onion and peppers, I simply saute it as needed and add the prepared quinoa.
