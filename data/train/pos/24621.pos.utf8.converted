Everyone in my family has tried these, and we've recommended them to others with 100% results. These are super-quick to make - you just add hot water, since milk is already included. They are smooth, rich and have excellent flavor. The local stores stopped carrying them for a while and I had my folks ship them from Florida to NC, but I'm happy to find them here on Amazon!
