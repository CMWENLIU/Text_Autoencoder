This Huy Fong rooster brand sriracha sauce is very popular in Asian communities. Its distinctive shape and green top is the kind you see in Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants all over. Named after the Thai city of Sri Racha, this bottle is on almost every table of every Southeast Asian restaurant I've ever eaten at, next to the soy sauce and napkins. The squeeze bottle and pointed nozzle makes dispensing very easy. The sauce is smooth, so a gentle squeeze will give you control and precision. It looks like ketchup coming out, but is a bit more viscous.<br /><br />It's great on chicken or beef satay skewers and just about any food. It made with chili peppers and garlic and has a wonderful flavor on its own, not just heat. I enjoy it regularly with Vietnamese beef pho. It dissolves easily into the soup and adds a wallop. It's hot, but not insanely so, and the heat doesn't stay on your tongue and keep burning you like habeneros. American-styled hot sauces like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB34JE">Trappeys</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce</a> are typically very drippy with a dominant vinegar taste and smell. Sriracha is not.<br /><br />The product contains preservatives, so it needs no refrigeration. Refrigerating can cause the ink on the label to come off over time.
