To initially sum this review up: I am so glad I bought this food for my dog. This is an excellent quality dog food and is a great value. Not only does my dog absolutely love it, but it has had many noticeable benefits to his health.<br /><br />I have an 18 month old chocolate lab, and unlike every other Labrador Retriever, he does not eat anything and everything. He is very picky about his kibble. For months, I was buying every kind of dog food, and never found a single brand that he was excited to eat. Normally, he would sniff the food, walk away, and return minutes later only because he was starving. For the past month, I had settled on Beneful, because he seemed to enjoy it more than any other food. Granted, he obviously wasn't ecstatic about it, but he usually finished it all. However, I eventually realized that I had to focus more on what he enjoyed. First off, he has several problems with his stomach. His stomach growls constantly, he belches, and he's occasionally gassy. He also throws up often and worst of all, he has trouble using the bathroom. He often appeared either constipated or his stool was very soft. Very worried, I made an appointed for a vet visit. My veterinarian instructed me to stop feeding him supermarket dog foods because they were all, for the most part, of terrible quality and not helping my dog at all. He told me all about reading ingredient labels on dog food, what to look for and what to avoid and went on to say that if I wanted to help ease my dog's discomfort, my only option was to buy a high quality dog food. I was reluctant because I knew that along with high quality comes a high price- except in this case, that is.<br /><br />I searched Amazon and found Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul. A 35 pound bag was only $40, and I had been paying $16.99 for a 15 pound bag of that Beneful crap. So obviously the price was great. Furthermore, it appeared to be a high quality food--no bad fillers and REAL MEAT as the primary ingredients, and the reviews were all positive. So I bought it, and I will never buy anything else.<br /><br />The first day I fed my dog Chicken Soup, he practically inhaled it. He LOVED it, which lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. He is actually excited about eating kibble now, doesn't hesitate to eat, and can't get enough of Chicken Soup. But the best benefit: he is so much healthier. His stomach problems seemed to have ceased altogether. I have not seen him throw up once, and when he has to use the bathroom, he is not constipated, nor are his stools runny or soft. He is able to go effortlessly and best of all, he doesn't go as often. He is not gassy and I never hear his stomach rolling. Moreover, his coat looks shinier and his bark sounds healthier. And did I mention: NO MORE STOMACH PROBLEMS!<br /><br />I returned to my veterinarian, and though he had never heard of Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul, I brought him the ingredients label and he said it appeared to be a kibble of great quality. But the best evidence I had to show him: my dog. He is a thousand times more healthy, and my vet (as well as myself) was so pleased to see the turnaround.
