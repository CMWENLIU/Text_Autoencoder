If you like mustard, real mustard, and are offended at the plain yellow stuff made by French's...this is the real deal.  I first discovered Colman's at one of my local haunts, The Cat & Fiddle, in Hollywood.  I usually get something or other to eat with my Bass Ale and the waiter was kind enough to drop off a bottle of Colman's one fine Saturday afternoon.  My culinary life (and nostrils) were forever altered that day.  There is no other mustard quite like this stuff.  It has a delicious mustard flavor coupled with a very smokey taste.  It really can't be described properly with mere words.  I was lucky enough to be in London last Spring, and I brought home a couple of large jars of this stuff.  However, it's damned expensive here in the states. Amazon has the best on-line price by far.  If you haven't tried it yet, go to your local British style pub or restaurant and give it a go, and be prepared for the 'kick'.  All other mustards pale in comparison with this legendary British product.
