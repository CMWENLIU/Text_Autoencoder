I have been drinking this tea for over a week now. I am not sure if it actually help with the losing weight stuff but I got to say this tea is one of the best tea out there. By the way, I got it from the Asian Supermarket. I love to buy stuffs from Amazon but some stuffs are just cheaper if you can find it in stores.<br /><br />I have tried so many teas out there but nothing like this tea. It is smell soooooooooo good and plus it's not bitter like other tea. One of the reason I got into drinking the tea is because I did lots of research online and lots of people claims that by drinking Oolong tea will eventually help you loss weight. I am not sure is because of the tea or not but I did lost 1-2 lbs per week (1-2 lbs is alot for my body type). I also work out 3-4 days a week and plus I watch what I eat. So I really not sure if this tea work for weight loss. I will still continue to drink the tea whether it work for weight loss or not. I like the smell of the tea. This is the same type of tea (at least for the smell of it) they serve in the Chinese restaurant.I hope my review will be hopeful for some of you.
