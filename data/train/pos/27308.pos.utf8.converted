If you're a fan of dark chocolate covered cherries you don't need a review. Milk chocolate is easily available during the Holidays, but dark chocolate has to be hunted for. Ordering them thru Amazon is great! I've ordered the last two years.<br /><br />I noticed a change in the individual wrapping this year. They now have a sticker holding the foil closed. I have no complaints with the candies (they're delicious as always!) or with the shipper. The shipper did an excellent job packing them.
