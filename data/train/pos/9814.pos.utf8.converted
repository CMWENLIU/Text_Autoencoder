I don't mess around when it comes to peanut butter or cookies. These are the BEST pb cookies you'll find in a box for sale at the grocery! As good as Nutter Butters, Girl Scout cookies and the rest, but without all the unneccessary ingredients. My only complaint is that they should sell them in larger boxes, ha. You won't be disappointed!!!
