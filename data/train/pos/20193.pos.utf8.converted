An excellent healthy choice for snacking!  Each box has 8 packages; each package is about 130 calories.  They are slightly larger than most of the 100 calorie packs available now, and I find them equally filling.  The portion size is more than adequate for a snack.<br /><br />They actually taste better than Ritz Bits, which I still like, but now I prefer these.  The price here is similar to what I pay at a local grocery store, but sometimes they are limited in quantity at the store.  Compared to some of the natural markets (Wild Oats, Whole Foods, etc) the pricing here is about half the cost.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase if you like a good cheese & cracker snack in a "metered" portion.
