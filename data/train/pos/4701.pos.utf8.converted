It's pretty good tahini from Israel, very creamy, not bitter at all.  The price was low, which is what made me try it.  The only thing weird about it is that it comes in a plastic jar with a pop-on, not screw-on lid, but it seems secure enough unless you turn it upside down (which I have not tried and don't intend to).
