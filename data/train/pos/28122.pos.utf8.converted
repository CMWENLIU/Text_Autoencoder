Excellent ground vanilla. I wanted pure vanilla that had no sugar which was difficult to find but here it is. It tastes great. I sprinkle it on yogurt, use it for baking, or sprinkle it on cereal. If you're used to the sweet artificial stuff, this isn't for you. But if you want a natural unadulterated vanilla taste, you'll love this ground vanilla.
