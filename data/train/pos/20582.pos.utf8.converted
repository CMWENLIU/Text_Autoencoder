I have to say that these beans are as good as my mom's home made.  At first I wasn't sure how freeze dried beans would taste, no regrets.  These are the best I've had and I've had them all!  My recipe for them is:  I heat up the water, add a tablespoon of olive oil or maybe bacon drippings, then add ground cumin to taste, garlic powder to taste, chili powder to taste, and onion powder to taste.  Once it's all boiling I add the beans and mix until I get the consistency I like.  Take it from someone who grew up on Mexican food... these suckers are good! Don't skip the oil part because the oil carries the flavors better.  Also, no need for salt.<br />I don't get the southwestern because they have partially hydrogenated oil or something like that.
