Special K has a knack for giving us delicious cereals that won't ruin your diet or your waistline. The Vanilla Almond is among my favorites-a staple in my house for breakfast or a late night snack. A perfect combination of sweet and crunchy, it's great with or without milk--and no guilt afterwards.
