...but quinoa is better.  This is good stuff; it cooks just like brown rice but has a nuttier flavor and is considerably more nutritious.  At under $3 a box, it's cheaper buying it at Amazon than at the supermarket, and it is VERY difficult finding it here in Florida where people tend toward grits and rice. As an added bonus for those to whom it applies, quinoa is technically not a grain; as such, both the regular and Inca Red varieties of Ancient Harvest brand quinoa bearing the "Half-Moon K" (as these do -- see my customer image) are kosher for Passover. The boxes bearing this symbol come from a factory that processes quinoa only, so there is no chance of chometz contamination.<br /><br />Delivery was under one week even with the free Super Saver Shipping.
