I've been using barley and wheat grass juice for about 20 years. I use to grow a lot of it myself, juice it, and drink it. In recent years I have travelled extensively and don't have the circumstances for growing and juicing barley/wheat grass. (from this point on I'll simply refer to barley grass, although all statements also apply to wheat grass).<br /><br />In recent years I have watched a multitude of cheap barley/wheat grass powders make their way onto the market. Please note that most of these products are, in my opinion, next to useless. They are made from whole dried barley/wheat grass--cellulose and all. The primary concept of having barley/wheat grass is to have the juice, free of the almost indigestible cellulose fibre of the leaf. All the early research on the many benefits of barley grass was from ingesting the pure, fresh juice. Then a process was developed (in Japan, as far as I am aware) to spray dry the juice whilst keeping most of the enzymes and nutrients intact. That processed involved using using simple sugars as a medium to help the juice turn to powder. The result is a high quality product, but one that is not pure juice powder.<br /><br />Fast forward many years, and I come across the grass juice products from Pure Planet. As you will see from my review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DRYF4">Just Barley - Organic Barley Juice - 80 gram - Powder</a> I give it five stars.<br /><br />Having used 5 or so jars of this product from Now Foods I have to say the product seems identical enough that I can't tell the difference. However, Now Foods gives you 118 grams for (currently) around $20 on Amazon. The Pure Planet product on Amazon is (currently) around $14 to $15. When you do the math, the Now Foods product is almost half the price.<br /><br />Obviously the many barley grass powders (not JUICE powder) as going to be a lot cheaper, but I really don't think it's worth it. Much of the nutrients in those powders are still going to be bound up in hard-to-digest cellulose, and they are far less concentrated. I've tried a few and they taste pretty poor and don't give me the lift I get from JUICE powder.
