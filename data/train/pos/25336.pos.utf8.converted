Look what I found in the new Langenscheidt French-English Dictionary!<br />SPAM: 1. an undesired, unwelcome commercial message delivered via the internet; 2. a tinned block of meat by-products, fed in America by urban liberals to their lapdogs and by conservatives to their children.<br /><br />Criminy! How spiteful can they get? SPAM used to be made exclusively at the Hormel packing plant in Austin, Minnesota, where some of my own uncles and great uncles worked. Those were good UNION jobs, though the aroma of the plant made living anywhere nearby less than idyllic. Kids I knew grew to be "above average" on a diet rich in SPAM. Most of them are still above average... in girth. The heirs of the Hormel packers, by the way, include the first "gay" American ambassador (to Luxembourg).<br /><br />Here's how to make a SPAM sandwich fit for a Congressman: First, fry a thick slab of SPAM till it's crisp on the edges. Toast two slices of soft white bread. Spread mayo on one slice and slather the other with ballpark mustard. Build the sandwich with the SPAM and a slab of Velveeta cheese. Toast the whole thing in the oven or toaster-oven, and wash it down with a 32-ounce bottle of your favorite brown diet soda.
