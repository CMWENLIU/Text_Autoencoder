This food is a lifesaver. My cat loves it. He howls for more just an hour after eating! He isn't vomiting or drinking unhealthy amounts of water anymore. I tried another brand when the shipper failed to send my second delivery in a timely manner and my cat turned his pink nose up at it. This food is stinky, but my cat and I are happy to have it.<br /><br />If the secondary seller, PREMIUM PETS ETC comes up when you try to purchase this, run, don't walk away from the shopping cart. I ordered 3 additional cases from them when I had one week of food left. Although he charged my credit card immediately, it took him 6 full days to ship the product and he couldn't provide tracking info to me. His office phone mail is often full so you can't call for an update. Since he was so late in sending the food out (with NO communication of the problem, I had to chase HIM down), I requested an upgrade to overnight shipping. PREMIUM PETS ETC rep told me he couldn't upgrade because he'd already shipped it, then refused to provide the shipping confirmation despite my continued requests for the #. When the package arrived, I found that he was lying, he didn't ship it until late that night when he said he shipped in the morning. HORRIBLE customer service.<br /><br />Amazon should be ashamed to be associated with such an unprofessional seller. It's really sad because this is a product which is needed for medical purposes. Because of PREMIUM PETS ETC's poor service, my cat was sick all weekend when I couldn't get to the vet to buy other food because he was still promising he had shipped it when he hadn't. When the food still didn't arrive, 8 days after my order was placed, I had to take off work to go buy other food, losing income on what was supposed to be an easy online transaction. I can't say enough bad things about PREMIUM PETS ETC.
