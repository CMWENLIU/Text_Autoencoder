I am still raving the benefits of flaxseed meal after three years of daily use.  Flaxseed meal aids digestion (flaxseed meal is easier to digest than flax seeds) which can be easily experienced by anyone with Irritable Bowel Syndrome or a sensitive gut. Another nice visible benefit for me has been growing longer and stronger fingernails.  Bob's Red Mill comes in nice sized packages which should be kept refrigerated for longer shelf life.  For an even longer shelf life, I keep a few packages in the freezer until I am ready to use them.<br /><br />There's some evidence flaxseed can help reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Although flaxseed contains all sorts of healthy components, it owes its healthy reputation primarily to three ingredients:<br />* Omega-3 essential fatty acids, "good" fats that have been shown to have heart-healthy effects. Each tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains about 1.8 grams of plant omega-3s.<br />* Lignans, which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities. Flaxseed contains 75- 800 times more lignans than other plant foods<br />* Fiber. Flaxseed contains both the soluble and insoluble types<br /><br />I recommend this product highly.
