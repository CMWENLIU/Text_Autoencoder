It has been over a decade since I saw this on store shelves, so I was quite excited when I saw Amazon carries it.  It is EXACTLY as I remember, and well worth the money to try it if you haven't had it.  Also, to clarify (the description as of today is confusing) this is for 4 six-packs of 12-oz cans.  That would be a total of 288oz, not 48oz as the description reads.  I got this for less than $8 and free two-day Prime shipping, so it was a damn good deal too!
