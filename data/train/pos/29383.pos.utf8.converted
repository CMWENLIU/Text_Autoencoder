My grains revived in less time than the instructions suggested, in 2-3 days. However, I live in Florida and my kitchen's been running at about 80 degrees in the afternoon. I had some leftover low fat milk I didn't mind sacrificing, but now I 'm making goat milk kefir like an old pro. Next up is coconut milk. I'm not convinced that will culture without the lactose present, but supposedly it will.
