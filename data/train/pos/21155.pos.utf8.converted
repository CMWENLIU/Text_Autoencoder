This black garlic is incredibly delicious and good for you!  Sweet!<br />You can purchase a 5.5oz container of peeled black garlic from the manufacturer for $10.99 which is $2/oz and the price here on amazon of $68.35 for 16 ounces is $4.27/oz.  Usually Amazon offers great prices so I am wondering if this is a typo?  Maybe you get two 16oz packages????
