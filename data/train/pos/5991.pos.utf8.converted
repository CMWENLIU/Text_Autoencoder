I had been using Muir Glen Organic whole/diced tomatoes, but after having had cancer I read a lot of research publications indicating that BPA's estrogen mimicking effects can be quite dangerous. BPA found in cans with acidic foods are some of the worst since the chemical is leached out even more. The same is true of plastic containers with BPA -- acid, heat or surface abrasion lead to much greater leaching into the food.<br /><br />Although Muir Glen is promising to get rid of BPA in their can liners, they are replacing it with some unspecified 'vinyl-based substitute'. If you want to get their cans without BPA, look for a use-by date of around the summer of 2013. [This info is per a conversation with their customer service representative.]<br /><br />I had heard about Pomi Tetra-pak products before -- Mario Batali and other foodies/chefs have recommended them so I thought I would give them a try.<br /><br />The tomatoes are naturally grown in Italy without pesticides and have no salt added. I used them to create a wonderful marinara sauce. They taste great and I am very happy with the quality.
