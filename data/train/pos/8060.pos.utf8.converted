I am a fanatic of authentic Asian cuisines. No American-Asian foods...I want the real thing and have been cooking and eating authentic Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai cooking for many years.  These noodles are very comparable to bean thread (mung bean noodles) aka glass noodles, vermicelli noodles, etc. They are virtually calorie-less and carb-less. Great for dieting.  If you are looking for a western/Italian style noodle, you'll probably be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy authentic Asian soups, stir-fry's, etc, you will be delighted with these noodles.  For those 'steak and potatoes' eaters, you may not enjoy this product.  I think they're great! But I also like, squid, sushi, sashimi, and all sorts of Asian dishes that might turn off many western palates.
