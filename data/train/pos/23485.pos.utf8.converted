If you are looking for an all-natural mint without sugar, the xylitol-sweetened mints are pleasantly minty with a sweet burst of flavor. The mints crumble fast, have a cooling sensation and dissolve almost immediately after being crushed. These are not the type of mints you can suck on for any extended period of time and only serve to refresh the mouth immediately.<br /><br />Unlike sugar, Xylitol will not promote tooth decay. This ingredient also helps to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actually produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />Xylitol has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br /><br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br /><br />Inhibit the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br /><br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br /><br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30g per day can cause stomach discomfort. Since one box of mints is 42 grams, you'd almost have to eat an entire box of mints to experience any problems.<br /><br />The strange ingredient in these mints is "Hibiscus powder." This is sometimes used in diet formulas. It may cause you to feel less hungry.<br /><br />Please keep out of reach of pets, especially dogs. You may not want to keep this in your house if you have dogs.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
