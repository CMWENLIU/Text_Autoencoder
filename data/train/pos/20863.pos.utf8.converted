Finally, light.  At least I was well protected and shipped in a hurry, but I hate that box.<br /><br />Hey You! Yeah you, the big pink meatsack, get rid of that box and get to making all that moss wet again.<br /><br />What are you doing standing there?!  Do you think I like being stuck in a plastic ziptop bag?  That confused look on your face isn't pleasing your new Overlord!  Oh great, you have no idea what to do with me, do you?<br /><br />"Oh, this will be so much fun.  I'll buy some carnivorous plants and just stick 'em in a pot of dirt and give them a good drink of this tasty tap water."<br />*smack*<br />You don't know me punk, and its a good thing that the Master knew you'd be one of our mindless minions and included a handy sheet of instructions.  Follow them carefully, please.  My life depends upon it, and consequently so does yours.  My associates and I arrived in good health, and I'm sure you were pleasantly surprised at our numbers.  Follow the Master's instructions.  Prepare yourself properly as instructed by his first communications.  Give us the purest of water and plenty of light.  We'll take care of the bugs.  And if you treat us very well, we might even repay the favor and take care of the neighbor's yippie dog, too.  But all in due time, Minion.  I'm thirsty.
