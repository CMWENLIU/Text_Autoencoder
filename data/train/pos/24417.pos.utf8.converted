My partner has to moniter blood sugar so we really don't get to eat a lot of pasta, bread, or starches like potato.  We found these at a local store and gave them a try.  They require attention to prepare: you have to drain, rinse, and parboil the noodles to remove the smell of the preservative, but once that is done these noodles are great.  I make them in thai noodle dishes and with some italian pasta sauces.  They are better with the thai dishes because they cook with the sauce a little more.<br /><br />Worth the effort especially if you have a limited diet because of sugar restrictions.
