This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!!
