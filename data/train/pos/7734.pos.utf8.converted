I brought some of this back from Thailand with me, knowing that I would not be able to (very often) get fresh durian. I have to say that it's a good substitute if you get the craving.(And there's nothing quite like a durian craving). The texture is totally different (crunchy instead of soft and creamy) but a wonderful snack nonetheless.
