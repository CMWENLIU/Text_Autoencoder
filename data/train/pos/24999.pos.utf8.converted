I've used the Saco Cultured Buttermilk Powder Blend for at least 10 years as it makes a fine buttermilk substitute. You can add this to any and all baked goods that call for buttermilk in the recipes. I've found the buttermilk biscuits and pancakes made with the Buttermilk blend taste like they were made with fresh buttermilk. My yeast breads and rolls turn out just fine too when I need to use buttermilk to finish the recipe.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
