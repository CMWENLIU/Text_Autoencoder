Tried to look for the whole grain barley from our local supermarkets but failed.  Found it on Amazon.com and very pleased with the purchase.  It is chewy and delicious, and loaded with nutrients.  I made barley water (note: it is Alton Brown's recipe), and used the cooked barley in salad.  Highly recommend this product.Bob's Red Mill Whole Hull-Less Barley - 26 oz (Quantity of 5)
