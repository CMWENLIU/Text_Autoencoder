My dogs are now veg dogs. I'm a vegan & all of my family is, so for a very very personal reason I wanted the dogs to eat veg too. I was tired & grossed out when feeding them & having them lick any of us, so now I feel better. I know they are getting the nutrition they need & they can be veg along with us. They adore the food too & don't seem to be missing meat, if they were I would let them have some, but I would buy some organic, better farmed stuff to feed them in that case, not dog food in a can. Meat in a can has so much junk in it, it's not really meat anymore or healthy.
