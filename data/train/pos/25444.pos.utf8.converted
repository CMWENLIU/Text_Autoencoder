I have tried them all...all the brands on Amazon, that is. Some have been less than thrilling and some pretty good. The Senseo Espresso Coffee Pods are the best I have found. You can make a great cup of coffee...I wouldn't really call it espresso with the convenience of a pod. I read a tip somewhere on Amazon about wetting both sides of the pod and it was the best tip I got in 2008. The resulting coffee is rich and full flavored, without bitterness. I think I will stick with Senseo Espresso. I did not use the special espresso pod, just the usual one pod holder, and it worked fine.
