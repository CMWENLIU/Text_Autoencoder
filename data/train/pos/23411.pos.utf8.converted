Parsley is one of the best sources of flavonoids on the planet. It is loaded with apigenin in the form of apin, and it is very difficult to get this much apigenin from any other source. It is roughly 10:1 gram for gram, so that parsley is pouring flavonoids. This ample supply makes it practical to add parsley using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. I recommend up to one cup of parsley daily, which necessitates a large supply, such as provided by this product.<br /><br />I will admit that I am not an expert regarding parsley as spice, but I love the fresh green parsley flavor that is imparted by this product. It brightens and freshens every food that I have added it to, which is many. When I get a little more money, I will get more so that I can have some in storage. I am sure that it stores well, in a cool dark place.<br /><br />I may write a parsley guide, so that I can provide recipes to use this much parsley. Apin and apigenin are not absorbed very well by the body, so it probably helpful to use parsley with yogurt, cheese, and acid/oil emulsions in order to improve the absorption. Fatty fish, such as red salmon, is a often neglected source of healthful oils. Citrus and vinegar work equally well for the acid. Be sure and add plenty of fresh ground pepper as well, which is very flavorful, but also likely to aid absorption. Until the time that I am able to write a guide, you can check my blog, which is linked from my profile page.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus
