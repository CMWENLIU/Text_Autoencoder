I am an avid fan of Emergen-C. I do my best to get in 2 a day. I started taking them when I was on a new diet. I was going to a clinic and the nurses recommended them to ensure that I got all of my daily vitamins. Your body absorbs vitamins much more this way rather than taking the huge horse pills. The clinic also recommend them to help curb headaches. I was giving up my beloved 'Diet Coke' and this was the only thing that made it possible. Plus the B vitamins really boost your metabolism.<br />These are also great when you feel a cold coming on. They really help to boost your immune system. I never leave home without Emergen-C! I always have a stash in my purse!<br /><br />I've liked all of the flavors I have tried so far. I love mixing them with Crystal light or something similar. With the Raspberry I mix this with the Lemonade Crystal Light and made it Raspberry Lemonade. It's delicious. I've also put it in with Diet Sprite and it was very good.
