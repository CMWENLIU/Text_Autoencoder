I have tried every gluten-free pasta I could find, and this one comes the closest to the pasta I remember and loved, before celiac.  It cooks quickly and needs no rinsing, yet it does not turn to mush like so many of the rice pastas do.  It's made by a company in Italy that has been making pasta since forever, and they really know how to do it.  I just wish, fervently, that someone in the States would do it as well, so I don't have to feel global-warming guilty about shipping it all the way from Italy just to satisfy my pasta craving.
