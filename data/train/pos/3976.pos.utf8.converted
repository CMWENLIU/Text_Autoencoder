I am very sensitive to MSG and all its derivatives (yeast extract, etc).  This is the only Cream of Mushroom soup I have ever found that does not have yeast extract in it or MSG.  Even other "organic" cream of mushroom soups contain yeast extract.  I had to give up some of my favorite recipes because I couldn't find a cream of mushroom soup that didn't cause me to have my "MSG headaches."  Well not any more.  I can enjoy all my favorite recipes again!  This soup is great tasting and adds wonderful flavor to my recipes.  I even love how it comes in a carton rather than a can.  The quality of the soup is great and the ingredients are all natrual.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has MSG sensitivities or who is just looking to add more great tasting natural ingredients to their recipes.
