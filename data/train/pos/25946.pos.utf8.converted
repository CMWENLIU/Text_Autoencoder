I love finding new spices to play with in recipes and was excited when I came across this product.  In my family the love for the flavor of fennel has long been a favorite and I planned on giving a can of this to my father for Christmas. When it did not arrive on time due to an addressing error, Pollen Ranch very generously made up for the mistake by sending me a sample of their products. The evening the package arrived I made Chicken Piccata, adding the poultry blend to the flour (although just a tad because it does not take much). The flavor was subtle yet with marvelous savor and will now be a permanent addition to my recipe. The next day I made Spiced Muffins and added a bit of the Fennel Pollen to the streusel topping, which again, added a unique flavor that was alluring to the taste buds.  I have now tried the Fennel Pollen and Fennel Pollen Blends with a variety of recipes and loved the flavor they bring to everything I have cooked. Next on the menu is to create a fennel flavored chocolate truffle as a gift for my dad (it really is his favorite spice)- I imagine these will be wonderful as well. I encourage anyone looking to add another flavor dimension to their recipes to give the Fennel Pollen a try, I do not think you will be disappointed. And with the outstanding  service the the Pollen Ranch extends to its customers, I will be supporting their company as often as possible.
