Along with a supply of Cliff bars and Larabars, I keep a few packets of Amazing Grass in my bag for use as a meal replacement or in between meals.  This item tastes best when added to cold water and one packet of Stevia (or to taste).  It doesn't have an after taste or chalky taste like some others that I tried.
