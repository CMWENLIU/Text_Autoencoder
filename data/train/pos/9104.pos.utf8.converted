This garlic is excellent for a dried garlic, nice pungent smell and taste. Not only that, but the bottle has the USDA Organic logo on it. ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE on the bottle or its packaging does this product mention ANYTHING about being made in China. Either the review that mentions China is too old, or it is possibly posted by a jealous competitor--if its not an old post, he/she should take a photo of the bottle with those words on it to prove the (unprovable from my experience) point. Its NOT made in China, folks. My family and I are really pleased with this purchase.
