After years of not knowing the difference between baker's yeast, brewer's yeast and nutritional yeast, I got these nutritional yeast flakes which are a versatile addition to many recipes (another company, Red Star, has actually put out a nutritional yeast cookbook available on Amazon). Since vegetarian diets lack this essential vitamin, nutritional yeast flakes, with its cheesy/nutty taste, should be part of a daily diet for this group. You can pretty much sprinkle it on anything (salad, cereal, vegetables) and do your body good.
