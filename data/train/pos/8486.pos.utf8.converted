This tea is wonderful if you love cinnamon that is. It is like eating a tasty cinnamon roll. I do not taste the peach and thankfully I do not taste the black pepper. It is very much like Redbush Chai tea, which I love too. I loved my new detox peach tea then I got a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker for my birthday in May and I thought I'd try iced tea with half this Peach Detox tea and half regular black tea. Fantastic!! The best-iced tea I ever had in my life!!<br /><br />Now for the best part the wise quotes from Yogi Bhajan on every tea bag. What wisdom! So you not only get a wonderful delicious cup of tea or iced tea, you also get the wisdom of the divine truths about humanity. No other tea on the market can beat that!<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br />"Happiness is every human beings birthright."<br />"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is."<br />"Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light."<br />"Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss."<br />"Be happy so long as breath is in you."<br />"Compassion has no limit.
