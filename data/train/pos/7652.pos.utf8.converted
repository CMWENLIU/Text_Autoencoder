i use maca in my morning smoothie -- it provides, along with the other smoothed products (chlorella or spirulina, ground flax, trace minerals, vegetarian protein powder, blueberries and home-made nut milk), a great start to the day and energy for many hours.<br /><br />regarding the taste -- i actually miss it when it is not in my smoothies. it gives a deep, smoky flavor but it certainly isn't the dominant flavor as that would be quite strong.
