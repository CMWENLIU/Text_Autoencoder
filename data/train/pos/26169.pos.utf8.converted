I just placed my third order of this product and this time I bought two! It tastes excellent and its really good for you. I have substituted it into all of my baking and I make protein bars with it. When I make pancakes in the morning with it I can eat one medium sized pancake with Agave Nectar on top with some whey powder mixed in and it keeps me full and energized until dinner time!!! Enjoy!
