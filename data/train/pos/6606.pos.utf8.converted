My mother's specialty is gooseberry pies.  Her grocery store doesn't carry them and my grocery store now no longer has this item.  I was pleased to find them available on Amazon.  With shipping and handling the price came out only a penny more a can than what I paid at the grocery store. Additionally they were shipped directly to my mother saving me a 100 mile trip!  She was absolutely delighted to receive the box of 8 cans.
