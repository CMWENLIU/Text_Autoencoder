I've been drinking Crystal Light lemonade since it first came on the market and I love(d) it.  This stuff now comes in packets instead of those little tubs, which I hope saves them money or reduces the environmental impact or something, because they've pretty much ruined the taste. This is so much weaker than the old stuff that I only use 3/4 of the water called for, which of course raises the effective price.  Why do they always have to "improve" things?  Why couldn't they have just put the old formulation in the new packets?<br /><br />REVIEW UPDATE 8/11/11:  OK, I admit it.  I'm an idiot.  Once I read the directions and prepared it properly, this is the same old Crystal Light I've known and loved.  I've just reactivated my Subscribe and Save subscription.  When in doubt, read the directions...
