Hi-Lo Maple Pecan Low Carb Cereal is THE BEST low-carb cereal I have found in 8 years of living a low-carb lifestyle.  If it didn't say "Low-Carb" on the box, you would never know it was a low-carb cereal; the flavor is better than many of the usual grocery store cereals that are loaded with carbs and sugar.<br /><br />Although I have tried the other flavors of Hi-Lo Low Carb cereals, this flavor is my personal favorite (the others are also very good, but I am a sucker for maple - the maple flavor in this cereal is excellent).  The cereal contains both flakes and puffed crunchy pieces similar to Rice Krispies as well as chunks of pecans.<br /><br />I enjoy this cereal with Hood's Calorie Countdown 2% Dairy Beverage (used to be called Hood's Carb Countdown), or with heavy cream if the Hood's is unavailable.  I also enjoy it dry as a healthy between-meal snack.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for anyone living a low-carb lifestyle.
