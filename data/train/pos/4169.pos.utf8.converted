My husband and I share 5 wonderful elderly aunts and one uncle. This was our choice of a Christmas present. We had them shipped direct and they all could not get over them. The only complaint I had was 2 did not have cards but since all the rest did and the 2 aunts that could not find one are in their late 80's they might have just missed them.  All 5 said they were absolutely beautiful.
