We LOVE these crackers! They have a lot of flavor and no harmful ingredients. We've tried just about every organic cracker out there, and these are by far our favorite. All 6 boxes arrived in great shape--and this was in the middle of the busy holiday shipping season. So perhaps the other reviewer's experience was not the norm. No problems with crushed crackers here!
