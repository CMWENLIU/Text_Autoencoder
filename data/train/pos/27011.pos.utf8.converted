I'm a tea drinker and like a lot of different hot teas.  When it comes to iced tea, though, I'm very picky.<br /><br />I've tried Nestea, Lipton, Tetley, etal, but the smoothest and best is Luzianne for iced tea.  It's not as "musky" as Tetley, nor sharp as Lipton, nor fake and stale as Nestea.  It has a bright, smooth taste that stands alone easily over ice yet still shines through when used as Southern sweet tea with lemon added.  I've tried it with tap water in Memphis, Little Rock, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Las Vegas and have no complaints.<br /><br />In fact, I like Luzianne so much that, when I couldn't find it in local grocery stores in Las Vegas, I ordered it from Amazon.
