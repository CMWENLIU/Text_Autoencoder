My son has gluten free and sugar free diet restrictions. I came across this candy and ordered it! FABULOUS! He loves the CHERRY flavor especially! Pomegranate and apple are pretty good. The honey lemon I was hoping would taste like butterscotch, but not really. Next time I might try to buy a bag with just 1 flavor instead of the mix, but we wanted to try them. AWESOME alternative to regular candy, and highly recommend for people with food sensitivities, or just want to eat healthy! My son and I love them!
