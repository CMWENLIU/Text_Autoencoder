If you're looking for a powder substitute for pure vanilla extract, look no further!  The first ingredient is natural vanilla bean extractives, then evaporated cane juice, silica, and cellulose.  It has a wonderfully rich smell and taste that will enhance your baked goods.  Just substitute 1/4 tsp powder for each tsp of vanilla extract.  Very glad to have found this!
