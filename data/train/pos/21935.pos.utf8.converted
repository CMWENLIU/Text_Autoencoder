I've looked everywhere for Cherry Chip cake mixes - my mom made them for my birthday every year when I was growing up, but you just can't find them in stores any more.  I was thrilled to be able to buy them online!  Packs of 12 are a little much for me, but I've been sharing them so everyone can taste  how good they are. :)
