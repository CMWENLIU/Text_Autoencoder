I have been a Droste Cocoa (Dutch cocoa, and Dutch processed) customer for nearly 50 years, but was running out last week and I had another look at what's available at Amazon in the way of cocoa. The almost uniformly highly positive reviews here made me decide to try Pernigotti, another Dutch processed cocoa. I've cooked with cocoa over the years but am not in the habit of doing so recently. My usage has been limited to hot cocoa, and that's what I have tried so far with the Pernigotti, and I've compared it several times with both Droste and Valrhona cocoa. They are all good, but somewhat different. I definitely notice the vanilla accent of the Pernigotti. I wasn't sure I liked that at first, but decided that it's a subtle accent and not too intrusive. I wasn't used to it, but I think it's OK. The chocolate flavor is very nice, I think maybe better than the Droste, even, which was the best cocoa I had ever experienced. I once bought a can of Hershey's cocoa to see if it was OK, this was back in the 1970's and I was disgusted and I think I actually returned it to the market for a refund. I prefer Droste to Valrhona, but I may have found a new favorite now. The reviews at Amazon for Droste cocoa are not nearly as positive as for Pernigotti. Droste is more expensive here, but I can get it locally for about the same as the Pernigotti online, however I may stick with the Pernigotti now.<br /><br />I have developed a system for making hot cocoa that removes the guess work and results in uniformly pleasing cups of hot cocoa. Here it is:<br /><br />It's (by weight) 1 part cocoa, 2 parts sugar, 3 parts non fat dry milk, all mixed very well together and stored. To make, boil 3 parts water, pour over 1 part the mixture (again, by weight), stir well.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I dug up a long time favorite chocolate recipe of mine (my own creation) and tried it with the Pernigotti -- Cocoa Pecan Cookies. It came out great. This recipe is to make cookie rolls, you bake a batch very quickly and easily any time you care to. To prepare the cookies, you preheat the oven, slice up a cookie roll, spread the slices on a cookie sheet and bake. Very simple. Here's the recipe:<br /><br />Cocoa Pecan Cookies<br />(Dough for 8 batches)<br /><br />1 stick melted butter<br />3/4 c. cocoa powder<br />1.5 c sugar<br />2 eggs (large)<br />2 c flour<br />1/2 t salt (this can be adjusted according to preference)<br />1 t baking soda<br />1 t vanilla (this was with Droste cocoa, since Pernigotti has vanilla this can be eliminated or adjusted)<br />1 cup pecans (previously kept in freezer to prevent staling)<br /><br />Melt or soften the butter. Put all the above except the flour and pecans in bowl and beat well. Add 3/4 of the flour and beat and then add last portion of flour (1/2 cup) and mix in. Then add the pecans and mix reasonably well and then scoop out on a floured board and knead to get the nuts evenly distributed. Cut in 2 and cut one of those in 2. Take one of those and roll to about 10 inches long and cut it in 2 (you have an eighth). Cylinder should be about 1 inch thick and about 5 inches long. Press ends to flatten with blade and put in pan. Do same with the rest and put pan in bag, seal and place in refrigerator to firm for a few hours. Remove the rolls to plastic bag for refrigerated storage.<br /><br />To cook, preheat oven to 350 degrees, using sharp knfe slice one cookie roll into approximately 30 cookies, place them evenly on cookie sheet (teflon coated) and cook 10 minutes. Immediately scrape off with plastic spatula and let cool upside down. They should cool to crispness if they've been cooked properly. Cook only to that point and no more or there will be some burning.
