I was quite surprised with the quality of this product.  I wasn't expecting too much from canned beef, but this is very tasty.  The beef chunks are in a nice, fairly thick gravy and it works well in many dishes including just pouring over rice or mashed potatoes for a simple meal. The texture of the meat is very good--it reminds me of crock pot cooked beef stew.  It's a real time saver and I keep several cans on hand.
