I ordered a"Broadway Basketeers Chocolate Heaven Gift Basket" for my sister for her birthday.  It product arrived in Florida in and I'm told it was beautiful and apparently very tasty except that the truffles had melted at some point during the delivery process.  I left a 'fair' review for them.<br /><br />In a little while I was contacted by the company asking if they could resolve my problem for me.  In the end they are sending a new batch of truffles.  They were very courteous and speedy at coming to a resolution and I am very happy with the results!
