Yogi Tea Throat Comfort Tea is what I consistently tote with me for Karaoke singing. This Yogi tea box talks about this tea supporting the respiratory system and soothing mucous membranes in the trachea, refers to it as a healing formula made with Slippery Elm Bark and Mullein, and talks about the herbs in this tea helping to form a protective slippery coating along the throat's mucous lining which the box says can be especially important for singers and public speakers, and mentions inclusion of Black Cherry Bark for soothing effects and pleasant cherry flavor. Prior to my finding this tea, I would sometimes experience rasping sensations following singing my all into certain songs. Now, I drink 2-3 tea bags into a cup (or 3-6 bags into a thermos) of preferably hot water prior to singing, and my throat no longer becomes raspy after enthusiastically belting out my favorite songs. I have gifted fellow karaoke disc jockeys and fellow karaoke singers with this tea, and many have reported back to me the same positive results. So far, my throat seems to really love this tea, and I am a very happy camper !!!
