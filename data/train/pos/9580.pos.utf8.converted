My parents sent me the Aerogarden so I could grow cherry tomatoes in my dark garden-less apartment. I started with the Salad Green kit that came with the unit. Within 4 weeks I had a plethora of greens to pick and eat, so plump and juicy. I just nip off a couple of leaves as I need them. Can't wait to grow my tomatoes.<br /><br />The unit super easy to set up, very clear directions, a real no-brainer. Simply click parts together, fill with water, plop in tablets, insert seed pods and leave it alone until it is time to eat. The seeds sprouted within 3 days and took off. I set the lights so they are on during the day until about 11 p.m. the unit really lights up the room. The Aerogarden lets you know when you need to add more water and nutrients. The air in that corner of the room feels moist which, in Southern California, is a blessing but should be kept in mind when placing the unit.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering about getting another unit, I just have to keep it out of the way of my cat who thinks the garden is her own personal nibble fest.
