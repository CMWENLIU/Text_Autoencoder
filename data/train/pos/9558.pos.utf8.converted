Yes, it's the real thing! This is the genuine UK-made Lea & Perrins, and it tastes so much better than what we buy at supermarkets in America.  Most people don't realize it's a totally different recipe, with a rich, smooth flavor that complements even the most delicate foods, meats and seafood.<br /><br />Grab a bottle of your USA-made L&P and compare the ingredients to these of the real UK-made product: Malt Vinegar (from Barley), Spirit Vinegar, Molasses, Sugar, Salt, Anchovies (Fish), Tamarind Extract, Onions, Garlic, Spice, Flavouring.<br /><br />Notice there is no high-fructose corn syrup!<br /><br />Once I tasted this, I just couldn't buy the American version ever again. The shipping cost listed above blows me away, but the product is superb. If you can get this product from whatever source, you'll love it.
