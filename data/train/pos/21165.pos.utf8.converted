This dry food is just that. It's a dry kibble. Considering the need for us pet parents to be conscientious about the food we feed our fur kids, this is a high quality food that is packed with protein and has no junk chemicals, fillers and what not. I take my cat to an all cat clinic. The vets highly recommend Innova Evo. My cat has no elimination problem. She has been eating Innova Evo for the last 4 years.
