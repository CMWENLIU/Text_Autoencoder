The every day Amazon case price is about the same as the sale price. I've been eating these for years and they are a very good source of protein. Soy protein is about the best you can get. LOw fat and carbs.<br /><br />In 17 crisps you get 120 calories (25 from fat), 17g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber and 7g of protein. ZERO Trans fat, 0 Saturated fat and 270mg of sodium.<br /><br />Much better than steak in my opinin. After all, you'll never hear of "Mad Soy Bean" desease!
