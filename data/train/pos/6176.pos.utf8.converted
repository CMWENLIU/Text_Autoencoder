Heart to Heart really is the best cereal Ive ever tasted. A couple of months ago my mom and I were shopping at Rite Aid buying toilet trees and then I came across this cereal, Heart to Heart. I looked at the back and found out that its low in calories. I had been trying to find a cereal that tasted delicious but is also low in calories and hadnt found one until I came across Heart to Heart Cereal. It also lowers cholestrol and it also lowers blood pressure. It doesnt have a bland taste like lots of low calorie cereals do; it has a honey flavor to it which is wonderful :) I eat Heart to Heart every morning, Ive lost a lot of weight (maybe because I start my day off eating Heart to Heart Cereal), and I totally recommend this cereal to anyone. You will LOVE it!
