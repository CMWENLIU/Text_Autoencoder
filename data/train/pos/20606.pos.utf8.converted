Box of convenient xylitol packets perfect for on the go.  Xylitol is a sugar alternative that is a sugar alcohol, but an organic compound.  It is low calorie, lower than sugar, but not calorie-free.<br /><br />It's about as sweet as sugar, and doesn't have the odd aftertaste of other alternatives like stevia.<br /><br />It's great in coffee, or as an additive just like sugar.  Plus, it does not promote tooth decay like regular sugar.  In fact, xylitol based products like chewing gum are even supposed to help prevent cavities!
