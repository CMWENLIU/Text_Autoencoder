This was my first coffee order for my new K-60 that came at Christmas. I read the reviews for virtually all the K-cups that Amazon offers and chose this one based on its consistently high rating. The name scared me a bit, but I had to give it a try.<br /><br />I am very happy with this choice. Midnight Magic is strong but not bitter or harsh. Its smooth and strong flavor comes through the half-and-half and Splenda that I drown all coffee in. I'm not quite the coffee-gourmet that others are so I can't say crazy junk like "hint of chocolate" or "strong notes of bark." I just know it tastes like strong, smooth, non-bitter coffee and I like it.<br /><br />Its caffeine buzz factor is about average for a cup of coffee, so don't let the name fool you into thinking you'll spend all night staring at the wall and shaking. It packs no more chemical punch than the weaker-tasting brews, and you get to enjoy the flavor and complexity much more. I currently have Midnight Magic in the rotation as my wake-up cup and it does well there.<br /><br />I will still try a few other K-cup varieties including the Coffee People selection. But I will always keep a supply of Midnight Magic on hand in the future.
