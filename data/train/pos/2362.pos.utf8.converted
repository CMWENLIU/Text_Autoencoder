I'm SO glad I gave these tuo chas a chance!!! I've recently become a huge pu-erh fan, so I've been on the lookout for great pu-erh that won't cost me a leg. I keep hearing that tuos don't usually have great quality, that often tea dust and poor quality leaves are compressed to make the "nests" (and yes, I've tasted those often enough to say it's true), but that's not the case here. In fact, this has become one of my favorite pu-erhs. (I've also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021I8F60">Rishi Tea Pu-erh Classic, 3.2-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>, which I thought was bound to be better simply because it was loose leaf, but that is not the case. I was not impressed... this one is much tastier.)<br /><br />I can get 3 huge mugs (each with a strong brew) out of 1 little tuo. The 4th one is already too watery, but the 3rd is still as strong as I like. This tea made me understand those comments about good pu-erh being "a mouthful", thick (I used to wonder what on earth it meant); it is like gulping milk, very interesting experience. I can't really describe the flavor, except to say that it's mellow, sweet, and very yummy. As all pu-erhs, it never gets bitter. To make this taste like heaven, I sometimes add a little bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N749GY">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> for some chocolate/vanilla/orange flavor - perfection in a cup!!!<br /><br />I was wondering how many tuos actually fit into one of these little tins... and the answer is, quite a lot of them! That was another good surprise.
