My wife is addicted to these Suckers, Lollipops, or Pops. She could go thru a box a week if she had them. Very good to eat, not so pretty to look at :-) She says they taste just like a caramel apple.<br />They are not shaped like normal suckers. they are inconsistant in shape but that shouldn't matter.
