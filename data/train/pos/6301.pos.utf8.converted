My cat was eating Purina Cat Chow and 1/2 a 5.5-oz can of Friskies per day at the shelter.  I switched him to Wellness Core dry food with ~3 oz of wellness moist food per day (one 12.5-oz can served over four days - stored in the fridge, in the can, and a serving warmed up for 10 sec in microwave).  In the end, the dry food only costs about 25% more than the Purina Cat Chow, considering how much less the cat actually eats.  The moist food is about twice the expense, if you compare the large 12.5-oz cans of Wellness to the 5.5 oz cans of Friskies.<br /><br />If you're giving just a dry diet, the switch to Wellness Core is definitely worth the additional 25% in costs.  The moist food is about $0.54 per day and the Friskies was about $0.23 per day, so that can add up.<br /><br />My cat made the switch easily... not a finicky eater.
