This muffin mix makes the yummiest cobbler.  I've made cobbler with peaches and raspberries; with cherries; with apples; with blueberries...  Just spoon the mixture onto the cooked fruit.  i like to sprinkle it with cinnamon and a little stevia or succanat.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes.  Namaste has a terrific cookbook.  Also tells how to make dumplings with the muffin mix.  THANK YOU, NAMASTE!!!  The yummiest products for those of us who are gluten-intolerant and have other allergies.
