This coffee is more than just a hyper-caffeinated gimmick. Although it's caffeine content really isn't that much higher than other blends you might be drinking (~150 mg per cup: Definitely not deserving the hyper-caffeinated name; extra-caffeinated maybe but not hyper), it still is high and I can feel the difference.<br /><br />But the real thing that you're probably concerned with, as I was when I first ordered this coffee, is the taste. The taste is bold and a little earthy, and really quite good with only very minimal after taste. I have had a few friends ask me what blend (thinking Starbucks) I was brewing; it was good enough to make them want to go get it.<br /><br />And the best part considering the great taste is the price and convenience. At this price per pound, Shock hyper-caffeinated coffee is comparable to pretty much any other whole-bean quality coffee you might be buying (but probably a little cheaper is my guess). And with free shipping in a 5 pound bag to your door, you don't even have to leave home to buy your coffee.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more Shock Coffee soon.
