This is the one coffee that I have recommended over and over again and it is my all time favorite Starbucks blend.<br /><br />Earthy full bodied bold flavor that goes well with everything from waking up in the morning to an after dinner coffee to enjoy with friends.<br /><br />I have traveled over an hour to find this blend before when Starbucks only made it available seasonally. I was thrilled when they started offering it year-round.<br /><br />It is best in whole bean is well worth the price.
