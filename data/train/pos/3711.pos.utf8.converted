After many years of not being able to find Atora suet in our rural area of Australia I finally looked on the Internet to see if I could find suppliers of this product anywhere in this area.<br /><br />What I did discover was that it could be purchased through Amazon!!!!  As I use Amazon a lot for my ebooks, I decided to  try ordering the Atora through them.  Would it work - Amazon in America - the Atora required in Australia!!!<br /><br />Just over a week later I had 4 pack of Atora suet!!!!  The product is as good as it has always been - and I have a very happy husband who now is getting a Steak and Kidney Pudding every couple of weeks, which he loves and had missed for so long!!!<br /><br />Thank you Atora and thank you Amazon !!!!!
