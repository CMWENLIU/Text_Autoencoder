I am not a sweet eater and will generally decline them when they are offered to me, however, the chocolate Truffles of France are smooth, rich, and creamy and have a stong chocolate flavor that I have never tasted before.  They are so good that, when occupied with other tasks, my mind wanders and I think about their delightfulness and wonder  ~  Is it OK if I have another?
