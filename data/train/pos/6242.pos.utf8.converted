I have used this rice to make sushi several times, and it always works great, though I usually have to cook it longer than the instructions say. In any case, the texture is perfect and sticky, and making sushi is well worth the effort--it's a crowd pleaser, as well as a fun thing to try with friends. Don't forget the rice vinegar!
