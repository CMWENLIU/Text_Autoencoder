For Christmas, my husband and I got an espresso machine.  The only coffee I like are the White Chocolate Mochas from S***bucks, so I set out to find their syrup. . . almost impossible, unless you plan to use 63 oz in a month.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try the Toriani White Chocolate Sauce.  Based on other reviews, I added a little more than the bottle said.  Here are the recipes I used for both iced and regular drinks (because I wished I could have found recipes).  For hot drinks, I used the recommended 1/5 espresso and 4/5 steamed milk and the 2 tbsp of syrup (I actually like a little more milk).  I actually used 1 oz. espresso, 5 oz. steamed milk and 2 tbsp of syrup.  This turned out really well.  I really liked it.  For the iced version, I doubled the entire recipe.  2 oz. espresso, 10 oz. skim milk, 4 tbsp syrup.  This is actually pretty good as well.  It's a little sweet (which isn't usually a problem for me), so next time, I'll try 3 tbsp and see if I can get good results that way as well.  The downside is that the syrup is 120 calories per 2 tbsp, however, I'm pretty sure that's not much difference from the coffee chain.  I'm allergic to aspartame, so I don't want to try the sugar-free syrup.  I'd recommend this syrup.  It's not exactly like the coffee chain, but considering that a White Chocolate Mocha is the ONLY coffee drink I've liked from there, and I like this, I consider that a win.  Also, you will most likely use a lot of syrup. This isn't that bad, considering it's probably $1 per drink instead of the chain's $5.  Enjoy!<br /><br />So, I made an Iced White Chocolate Mocha today with less syrup and it was perfect!  10-11 oz. of skim milk, 3 tbsp Sauce, a double shot of espresso.  Can't complain when I can save 60 calories per drink!
