I am committed to getting unfermented soy products out of my diet.  I find that most chocolate candies use soy lecithin as an emulsifier.  After finding out that soy lecithin is pretty much the sludge that is left over after chemicals like hexane are used to extract the oil from soybeans, I decided that I want nothing to do with it.  (In the days before corn and soy crops were subsidized by the government, we got lecithin from eggs, not soy sludge.)  Enjoy Life chips are soy free and they taste great.  I use them to make my own mint truffles.
