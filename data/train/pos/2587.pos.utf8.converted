The cappuccino and the Latte Macchiato are where the Dolce Gusto machine really shines. On the cappuccino, I get a great cup of cappuccino with perfect foam, perfect flavor. I did not expect such quality when I got the machine. The plain espresso & coffee lived up to those expectations; the cappuccino and macchiato blew them away.<br /><br />I have begun to fine-tune the drink to my flavor preference. A little less milk, a little more espresso for some extra strength. Or for a little later in the afternoon, when I want a lighter beverage, I can do more milk less espresso. I like the free that Dolce Gusto gives to make me feel like a barista and have some control over my drink.<br /><br />The cost, since each beverage takes 2 pods, is about a dollar apiece. A bargain, considering the great taste, convenience, and ease of preparation.
