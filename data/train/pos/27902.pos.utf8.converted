I remember fondly the day I met Sharkbanana.  We ended up in a corner discussing Ayn Rand for the better part of an hour.  I shall not bring those controversies into this review; if you want to know Sharkbanana's position on Objectivism, I suggest you ask him yourself.  He became my date for the rest of that party, even convincing him to take me to bed that evening.  Sharkbanana was not just out for a cheap one-night-stand, though, and a little over a month later he came home with me for good.  He has been my constant companion since.<br /><br />I have spread the love of Sharkbanana far and wide, all over the US and even across the oceans (any Netherlands sightings are probably due to me.)  He has been the inspiration for theme camps and giant plushies.  Songs have been written about his exploits. (Search for him on YouTube.)<br /><br />Sharkbanana will never give you up and never let you down.  He will never run around or hurt you.
