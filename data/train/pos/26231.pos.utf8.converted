For years I have loved the "Reeses Pieces sundae" that is served at the Friendly's restaurants. However, the price of that sundae has risen sharply through the years. I've always wanted to make this sundae at home, but finding the peanut butter topping that Friendly's used has been the issue. I finally located this peanut butter sauce which is excellent. I am on my third jar of the sauce, and actually purchased two jars this time. Just remember to thoroughly stir the sauce before using, as the oil migrates to the top of the jar and the sauce thickens on the bottom. And enjoy!!!
