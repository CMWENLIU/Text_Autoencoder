I've tried many different vegetarian broths over the last 3 years and McKay's brand is, by far, the best! I have both the chicken and beef style and use them frequently. I highly recommend these products. I was able to find these products easily at local health food stores for a VERY affordable price. I recently made french onion soup with the beef style broth and it was impressive! A definate upside to buying the powder is you can make the broth as weak or strong as you'd like. Only 1 tsp per cup! It's MUCH cheaper than buying canned broth.
