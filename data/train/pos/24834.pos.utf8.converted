Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the "Better-n-Peanut Butter" brand sold here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of "better n peanut butter" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( "Better n Peanut Butter" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this.
