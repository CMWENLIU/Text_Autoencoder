I bought some of this at my local health food store for almost $9 for this size. I decided to try it because of Weston Price and reading about his research on cavities. I'm impressed. I've always loved butter and eat quite a bit already, but I have to be careful because I'll eat this stuff right out of the jar like it's candy. But it's also great for cooking - put it on fish, popcorn and cook eggs and saute in it. I know that between eating this, fish, vegetables and taking cod liver oil, my cavity has stopped hurting and I wonder that the effect he predicted - total healing of that cavity - is in effect. Regardless, I will be buying this in the future for its mere taste and versatility. I highly recommend! It's a little costly, but your health is worth it.<br /><br />I agree - make this a Subscription item please!!!
