I am not experiencing any difficulties with dissolve rates with this product.  Ideally you would have both this little shaker canister plus the individual packets because when adding to a drink the packets are convenient but when whipping up some tasty dessert or, as I have been doing lately, making a batch of coleslaw dressing, being able to dip a half teaspoon into the canister is easier and neater than opening a bunch of packets.  If I could only have one though I'd have the canisters.  It's a great product that I am very thankful for.  Update - I have discovered a reason to buy the packets instead.  I found last night that the remaining powder in the canister I've been using has hardened to a solid impenatrable rock.  No amount of jabbing with fork or pointy knife will break it up.  The lid was closed tight so it wasn't because of that.  I suppose I could add some distilled water to see if it will make liquid stevia out of my petrified product.
