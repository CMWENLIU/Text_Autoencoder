I bought the madagascar vanilla beans for a creme brulee recipe that I wanted to make. I was skeptical before buying them because of how affordable they were compared to the vanilla beans I found at grocery stores like whole foods & fresh market ($10 for 2 vanilla beans!). However, once they arrived I was more than satisfied with my purchase. They came in an sealed airless bag but the vanilla smell was so strong you could even smell it before opening the bag. I'm very satisfied with the super fast shipping thanks to Amazon and the excellent quality and price of the vanilla beans.
