Ever since damson plum preserves were not to be found on ordinary grocer's shelves due to the blight that afflicted damson plums in the U.S. i have searched for a product that most nearly resembled the taste and look of the damson plum preserves my grandmother used to make every September after purchasing a bushel of damson plums at Findlay Market in Cincinnati.  No luck, however, until, on a visit to Bermuda, I found the Tiptree product.  Tastes and looks exactly like hers, and Amazon.com brings it right to my door!  It's got everything except the occasional plum stone that escaped Grandma's watchful eye. I've tried many, many jars of supposedly damson plum jellies, jams, and preserves, but nothing comes close to Tiptree.
