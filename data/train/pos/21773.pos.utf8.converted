First time buyer from this supplier.  Product was on time and as described.  For tamarind, I've always used real bean pods with the shelling, soaking and straining to wind up with a messey kitchen and watery sauce.  When I opened the first jar of Tamicon, I knew those pod days were over.  This sauce is thick and tangy just the way it needs to be for my cooking.  A favorite item for my friends is BBQ with a unique African BBQ sauce that requires tamarind.  Now I have less excuse for not making it more often!
