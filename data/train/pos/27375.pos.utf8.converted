At first I was reluctant to spend the extra money on the small packets of Ken's Fat Free Italian my daughter requested, as this is one of the salad dressings her college offers in the dining room. I thought I'd be able to find it in a bottle, and save some money.<br /><br />After looking in all the local stores, I visited Ken's website where I discovered that, for some reason, the Fat Free Italian is only available in the packets.<br /><br />I was very happy to find the packets here. Yes, they're a bit pricey, but super convenient, taste almost like the regular Ken's Italian, and have only 20 calories!<br /><br />The individual servings are large enough that I can use 1/2 packet on a side salad and 1 packet is plenty for an entree-sized salad. Delicious!
