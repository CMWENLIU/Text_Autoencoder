I love this pasta because it doesn't get all gummy like rice pasta does.  You are limited sometimes when you have wheat allergies.  This pasta however makes it eaiser to because you don't have to feel like you are being deprived when having pasta.  I have a child with allergies adn I used to cook him this pasta and the rest of my family regular pasta. This is so good though, and so cheap buying thru amazon, that we all eat this kind now.
