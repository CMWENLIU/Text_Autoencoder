This was my first experience with Pu-erh Tea, also known as the "champagne of teas." It was fairly easy to steep and produced a dark liquid, even darker than my longest brewed Ceylon tea. I found that steeping for 3 minutes allowed me to get 3 to 4 pots (about 18 oz per pot) of full flavored Pu-erh. It has an excellent earthy taste with a scent that is reminiscent of oak wood and something sweet. I have read some books about tea and watched a couple documentaries that focus on what makes good tea. Some of that literature discusses what characterizes quality Pu-erh tea and this product seems to fit the bill. It's now definitely among my favorite teas, a list that includes Darjeeling and Oolong. The only difficulty I had was breaking apart the cake, which is very hard and held together extremely firmly. I ended up sawing off pieces with a serrated knife - once I got some pieces broken off, some of it would break away and crumble more easily by hand. I expect this cake hardness is common to all Pu-erh teas since the fermentation and cake drying process is the standard for this type of tea.
