I'm really, really pleased with this bread machine mix. First of all, it's really easy to make: just put it in the bread machine with water, oil and yeast. The yeast packet is included, so that's nice. It bakes up with a really nice texture and tastes great. It's great for making sandwiches and it's healthy! I will definitely be buying this again!
