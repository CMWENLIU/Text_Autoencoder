Ever since I saw Mr Miyagi in the Karate Kid meticulously pruning his Bonsai tree with a pair of toenail clippers I've wanted one of these cute little trees.<br /><br />When it arrived I was immediately impressed. It looked just like the picture here on Amazon. Well packaged & healthy. Many months later its still going strong. It even grew enough so that I had the opportunity to break out the toenail clippers & have some fun. If you're into that sort of thing, this is a great little tree. If not it makes a great gift. Either way I think you'll be happy.<br /><br />UPDATE I<br />Two years later & the same little tree is still going strong.<br /><br />UPDATE II<br />Four years later sadly I must report my favorite little tree is no more. She began drying out over the Winter, no amount of watering seemed to help. I attribute this to low humidity & it possibly being too close to the baseboard heating. Who knows though? *shrug* I can't really complain. For the price I payed I received many years of enjoyment. Will probably buy another come the holidays.
