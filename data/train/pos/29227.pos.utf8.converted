Ingredients: salt, imitation butter flavor, anti caking agent, artificial color. There is no fats or oils.<br /><br />Popcorn is a whole grain with lots of fibre.<br /><br />The problem with popcorn not being a healthfood is fats from butter & cooking oil and the salt.<br /><br />Using this in place of salt makes one of the three problems go away (the butter fat).<br /><br />This product is in granules sized to fit in a shaker just like salt.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste as good as real butter, you knew that already.<br /><br />But it is a bottle large enough to refil many shakers, and is in my opinion better than the imitation butter oil products.<br /><br />Better to put the butter flavor in the salt, like this!
