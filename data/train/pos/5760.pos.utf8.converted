For those of you who are acting so hyper about MSG, consider this.  All cheese, meat products, soy sauce (including the naturally brewed shoyu without added MSG), oysters, clams, mollusks in general, and tomatoes are LOADED with MSG.  This is a naturally occurring substance in many fermented or aged products.  If you can eat cheese, enjoy your tomatoes, and tolerate naturally fermented soy sauce, think again about MSG reactions.  This info is coming from a biochemist and a physician who does a lot of nutritional therapy.  There are a lot of myths that are still being perpetuated, and this is no exception.  Even the tongue contains taste buds that are specific for detecting MSG.  So it's in your genes!<br /><br />As for this soup base, it's fabulous!!<br /><br />If you still have issues about the thought of consuming ANY MSG, then be prepared to stop eating all deli products, any mollusk, anything with soy sauce or other fermented bean product (including black beans, other soy bean products like miso, etc.), any aged milk curd, and anything containing a tomato, including pizza.  If you truly believe in the MSG ban, then put your money where your mouth is!
