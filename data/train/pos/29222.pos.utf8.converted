i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu-erh's fermentation process.  But I am so glad that i didn't let all of that discourage me.  This is a very smooth, rich, full-bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee.  It definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day.  I used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed!!  What makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item!!
