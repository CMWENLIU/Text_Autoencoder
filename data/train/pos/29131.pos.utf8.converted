This product is a great value as well as good for you.  It has a falafal type texture that is easy to prepare and cook.  We make our Fantastic Burger mix into small patties and freeze them.  Its then easy to take what we need for each meal from the freezer. You can microwave them on high for about a minute each to get a firm texture.  We're going to try baking them as well as making a "meat" loaf with the mix.  We really like this product.
