With the recent problem of some dry cat foods containing a potentially life-threatening substance, I decided I simply wasn't going to take a chance. I was already feeding my cat some of the top quality dry foods, including one of Hill's Prescription Diet varieties that you can only get at a vet's office; however, I wanted to move him up to a good natural dry food as well. He loves fish so I tried the California Natural Herring & Sweet Potato dry food, which I got in their small size just in case it wound up being squirrel food to his picky taste buds. He loves it!
