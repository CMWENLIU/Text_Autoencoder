I was brought up on Melitta drip coffee makers and that's all I've used so you might say I have more than 65 years of experience with these.  We used to take them on vacations because the coffee we made so far out-distanced other available percolated or coffee-maker generated coffee.  My only disappointment is that the purveyor of these for Amazon charges much more money for the set than does the Melitta site on the Internet.  How did that happen?  So far I've always found Amazon to have the best prices for everything I purchased online.
