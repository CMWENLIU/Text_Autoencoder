I am one those people who lacks complete cognitive thought process until I have had my first cup of coffee. I usually follow it with a mid-day cup for added boost. Since, I've transitioned over to brewing yerba mate in my coffee maker I definitely feel a difference. I am energized mentally and physically. I remember where I park my car.  I can drink it alone, but I've added coconut milk and/or manuka honey for even more flavor before. By itself, it has kind of an earthy flavor. I am into that so it wasn't surprising, that isn't for you, but you want the benefits use your normal coffee embellishments (creamer, sugar, etc.) I can't even relay how much energy and focus this gives me. Not only am I alert, but I feel like I process information better. I'm not a morning person, but this gives me something to look forward to.
