Excellent product, especially great for dogs that NEED-to-CHEW (like mine).  Our Golden love these treats and they provide her with the satisfaction of having chewed something up without it being one of our shoes, furniture, or other valuables.  We found these initially at our COSTCO, but have not been able to locate any other source aside from Amazon.  Delivery has been wonderfully quick and we order 4 to 5 at a time and re-order when we are down to two.
