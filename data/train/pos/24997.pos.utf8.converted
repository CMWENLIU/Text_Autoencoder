I'm never dissapointed with the great gadgets this company comes out with. My brother picked up the new Concerto for me and it is absolutely awesome! My wife likes whites and I like reds, so the 2 stoppers really come in handy. Also, I love the new clicking sound it makes when the vacuum is at the correct level. Neat design, great looking gift, the absolute best invention for saving wines.
