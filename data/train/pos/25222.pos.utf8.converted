I got this to use with the aztec clay mask.  You mix the clay power with the apple cider vinegar.  But as it turns out, this is very nice on my salads.  Brunettes, after you shower mix this with 1 cup with two cups of water and spritz on your hair for natural brunette highlights, it also fights dandruff, removes soap film and sebum oil and leaves hair shiny.  You can add a cup to your bath to soften your skin.  You can mix two teaspoons of olive oil and teaspoon of Braggs to make an ant-aging moisturizer for your face,.  You can also apply this directly to your face via a cosmetic pad or cotton ball avoiding your eyes, like an astringent, leave it on for 10 minutes and rinse with warm water to remove dead skin cells on your face.  So cook with it, or beautify yourself.  I'd stick to the organic varieties.
