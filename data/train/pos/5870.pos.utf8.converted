I previously wrote a review for the smaller, 8.5oz version of this supplement powder, which is the exact same product but costs slightly more. When I finished the smaller one in 2 months I got this one because the shelf-life is around 2 years, depending on when you buy it (both my purchases had August 2013 as the expiration date). Per my last review:<br /><br />This is very healthy stuff. I don't eat as much vegetables as I should, but this helps balance my diet with the chock-full of nutrients it provides. The most appealing benefits to me are 100% DV vitamin A as beta carotene, powerful antioxidant blend, and probiotic active cultures like those in in yogurt.<br /><br />The aroma is pleasant and so is the taste, but the solubility is difficult. Since it contains insoluble fiber, it doesn't dissolve completely with water or juice. Smoothies are best for this mix. I tried cold water and hot water, and its quite gritty in both --not sand-like mind you, but sort of like not completely mixing cocoa powder and trying to drink it. Speaking of which, for some odd reason the taste and aroma reminds me of hot cocoa. After discovering hot water doesnt help dissolve everything, I wouldn't recommend it since heat can diminish a lot of the nutrient power this mix provides, especially the antioxidants.<br /><br />Per the label, it is best kept frozen or refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/10/2011 ***********<br />I find that I like the taste when it is mixed with vanilla-flavored soymilk. One way I use the mix is to add flavor to my high-fiber cereal and soymilk, which looks gross since your milk turns green, but at least the gritty bits are masked by the cereal and dont bother me one bit (pun?).<br /><br />UPDATE 1/20/2012 ************<br />I'm really enjoying this supplement powder! I can sense myself feeling better throughout the day. Since I take this supplement first thing every morning, I have become more regular in my bowel movements (almost clockwork) and noticed good changes in my stool, defecating clean and easy. At first, I was very gaseous as my body tried to get accustom to the high volume of fiber in my supplemented diet. But after a couple days the flatulence subsided, and I was reaping the benefits of fiber without the sound effects (which by the way did not smell... at least to me =P ).<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2/2012 ************<br />I noticed that there is another size available for this Green Superfood (17oz vs 8.5oz) for a cheaper price per ounce value. Just to let you guys know, I bought this one back in November 2011 and the expiration date for my container says August 2013. Thats nearly a 2-year shelf life! But I think they are referring to the shelf that is in your refigerator, rather than your cupboard.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/24/2012 ************<br />I've been taking this every weekday at work, one scoop every morning with my cereal. Finally finished the container roughly in two months. As I try to reflect on any long term changes, I do notice that I wake up easier for work, which is at 4:00 AM every morning. I try to get at least 7 hours of sleep, but most of the time I fall asleep between 10:00-11:00 PM, and surprisingly I'm still mentally awake until that time.
