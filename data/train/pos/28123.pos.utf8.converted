Before I begin, I should make it clear that I am not a fan of breakfast cereal -- or even breakfast in general.  I don't care how much the nutritionists wail and gnash their teeth. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day in my book. Give me coffee and kick me to my desk, please!<br /><br />But for Bob's Red Mill Honey Almond Granola, I make an exception. I would eat this as a cereal seven days a week from now until Bob's Red Mill runs out of oats. It's not too sweet, not too crunchy, not loaded with ingredients I don't know or can't pronounce (or both), not too hippie, not too yuppie, not too sun-drenched fields of happiness commercials.<br /><br />What's in it?  Oats, honey, canola oil, almonds and vanilla.  That's it. That's plenty.<br /><br />How to serve it? That depends on your schedule. Out of the bag and into the right hand, on the run - that works if you're in a mad-dash hurry. Right-handed? Use your left hand to catch the granola. Ambidextrous but drive a stick shift? Use either hand.  If, however, you prefer milk on your cereal instead, use a bowl.  And a spoon. And wait until you've parked, please.<br /><br />Not in a hurry? Pour a few ounces into a bowl, bury it in water and nuke for 2-3 minutes. Voila - almost-instant hot breakfast.<br /><br />Need a snack? Grab a handful out of the bag.<br /><br />Hate raisins like I do? No worries! There aren't any of those pesky little former-grape critters to pick out and destroy.<br /><br />Love raisins? Add 'em in! They'll be right at home, whether you're serving your breakfast or lunch granola or snack hot or cold. Amazingly versatile product!<br /><br />So Bob's Red Mill, employee-owned Oregon Nirvana, has moved yet another person closer to a healthier lifestyle. They're to be commended, not only for having some of the best granola on the planet, but for holding to the highest standards of product quality and customer service known to mankind. Yep, I'm a fan of both their granola and their corporate mindset.
