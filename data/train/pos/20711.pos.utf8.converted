It's not placebo. I feel more energetic and clear-headed after taking this product for a month. In fact, you can already feel a little bit of the uplifting effect after drinking it in the morning. Taste pretty good, too!<br /><br />The bottle says "60 servings." However, I feel that it's more like 40 servings. I used the scoop it provided inside, but I used up the whole bottle in slightly more than a month.<br /><br />Still cheaper than buying fro Whole Foods though. I recommend subscribing it, especially if you intend to become a long-term user of this product.
