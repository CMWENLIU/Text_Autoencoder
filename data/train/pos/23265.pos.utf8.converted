This was a great gift for a party. The dark chocolate is not bitter like many others. I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and all over, and can guarantee that Leonidas is the best af all of chocolatiers. Great sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate. If you love chocolate try it. You will not regret it.
