Chickpea bean is an excellent source for many minerals and proteins. I purchased two packs of them in order to get free shipping. The beans are carefully selected with fresh smell. I use them mostly for making the soup by the automatic soymilk maker. You will get smoother soup if the beans are presoaked in water for 8 to 10 hours just as you would do with the soybeans. I would recommend this product for everyone that wants to try the dairy replacement for proteins and calcium needs.
