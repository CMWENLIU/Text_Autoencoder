I have 3 cats, 1 is almost a year old and the other two are 8 months. I recently did a lot of research as to the best diet for my kitties and came up with this brand.<br /><br />My cats love this stuff.<br /><br />I feed my cats 2x a day. They get wellness wet food once and CORE once. I know that there is nutritional value to each of these options and that there are dangers to completely excluding either wet or dry food from a cat's diet. I also mix in 1/2 teaspoon of missing link vitamins into their wet food to make up for what they can't get without eating in the wild. Between these three things I have healthy, happy kittens. :)
