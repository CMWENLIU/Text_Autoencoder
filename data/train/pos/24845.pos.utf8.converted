This is the most economical way to buy yeast even if you only bake with it 6 times in a year.  Do the math comparing the cost of those little packets & you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />This is an "Instant" or "Rapid Rise" yeast which should not be confused with "Active Dry".  Active Dry is dried at a higher temperature & therefore more of the yeast cells are killed.  If using AD, you need to soak/activate it in warm water before adding to dry ingredients.  This is unnecessary with Instant yeast; add it directly to the flour.  You also need to use more AD because more of the yeast cells are dead.<br /><br />I store mine in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator.  I write the expiration date on a label stuck to the lid.  It has always stayed active beyond the expiration date.<br /><br />This is the yeast to use if you are using a bread machine.  You can use AD yeast but it's more convenient to just dump all the ingredients in to a bread machine and let it do the work.<br /><br />You can substitute Rapid Rise/Instant yeast in a recipe calling for Active Dry yeast.  Use about 25% less Rapid Rise/Instant than the recipe calls for.  Example:  The Active Dry packets usually contain about 2-1/4 tsp./.25 oz. so use 1-3/4 tsp. Instant/rapid Rise yeast if the recipe calls for 1 packet (2-1/4 tsp.) Active Dry.<br /><br />You can also substitute Active Dry for a recipe that calls for Instant/Rapid Rise.  Use about 25% more Active Dry than the recipe calls for.  Example:  Use 1-1/4 tsp. Active Dry if the recipe calls for 1 tsp. Instant.<br /><br />1 tsp. Active Dry = 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br />1 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise = 1 1/4 tsp. Active Dry<br />1 packet (2 1/4 tsp/.25 oz) Active Dry = 1 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br /><br />Other yeast to consider:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWEZTO">Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2-Pound</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY31WW">Safmex Instant Yeast ( 16 oz / 1 lb )</a>
