This is a smooth luscious chocolate that you want to savor as it melts in your mouth. It's also quite nice as you are finishing up a glass of Zinfandel (red, not the pink stuff). A couple of the squares are quite satisfying, so this is one bar that will lasts a few days. Give yourself a nice Halloween treat.
