I have been eating Seven in the Morning, now called Seven Whole Grain<br /><br />Nuggets, for a few years now and started having trouble finding it in<br /><br />my local grocery store.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  This cereal is<br /><br />tasty and satisfying.  Crunchy texture if you eat it right away, gets<br /><br />softer if you let it sit in the milk a few minutes.  Love it with fruit<br /><br />on top!
