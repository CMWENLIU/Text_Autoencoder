I received my order of the Red Velvet Pancakes today and couldn't wait to cook some up.<br />I didn't know what to expect, I usually find that red velvet cake (the actual cakes, not pancakes) can be too sweet and artificial tasting, in my humble opinion. I followed the directions exactly and out came wonderfully fluffy red velvet pancakes! They taste awesome.  Just sweet enough and very light. I made a little as a snack for my dog too and he won't stop following me around now. Which is a nice change since all he ever seems to do is lay around being gassy.<br /><br />2 thumbs up for red velvet pancakes!
