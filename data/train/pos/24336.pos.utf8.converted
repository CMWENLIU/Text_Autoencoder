I am rather new to Tea, but this sampler is great way to discover and choose your favorites. The tins are packed with, in my opinion, good quality dry packed leaves, no stems or dust, or at least nothing I could complain on.<br />Tins are clearly labeled, and the quick search for the labeled names on Wikipedia makes a great learning experience going along with the tasting as well.<br />I'm on my second round thru 6 tins, and with each teaspoon making more than one cup of tea  by multiple steeping, I think these 6 tins may as well last for couple of months, much more than its "sample" title may reveal. For some teas, second steeping(s) may give a better or different quality than the 1st one - in any case it is a good experimenting exercise, along with water temperatures etc...<br />If you want to "try and see... what is this tea thing all about", go for this sample package!
