This is must for greek 'frappe' drinkers.  Different than the regular instant Nescafe found in grocery stores. Add one heaping tspn of this instant coffee, two tspns. sugar, about two ounces water, and shake like a mad person in a shaker.  Pour over tall glass of ice, add more water to the remnants in your shaker and pour the rest in your glass.  You are now good to go.  The greek version of this product is the only way to go for true Greek frappe.
