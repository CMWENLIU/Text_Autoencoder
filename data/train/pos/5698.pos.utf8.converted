I ordered this for my mom who is a shut in and wished for a plant to take care of. I did not have the funds to purchase a "gift" plant with a fancy pot etc. I saw this plant for a great price and took a chance that it would be ok. It arrived in GREAT shape with no damage from shipping, mom was very happy and pleased with it which makes me happy as well. I want to thank you for the great price and customer service for this order. I will do this again.
