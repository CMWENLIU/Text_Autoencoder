I've been drinking this stuff every day for over 4 years now.  It has basically replaced soda in our house.  It is relatively sweet tasting - similar to sweet tea, but not quite as sweet.  I've tried many different types of zero calorie tea mixes and nothing seems to compare.  Not only does it taste great but is also chock full of antioxidants.  It doesn't get better than this.
