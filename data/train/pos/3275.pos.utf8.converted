So far, this is one of only 3 dog food brands that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food. Our australian shepherd had pink around his mouth and on his belly before switching. It has limited ingredients, less chance of food alergies. I have tried many high cost and probably high quality foods but nothing worked. I ended up having the best luck with this and with Purina one smartblend of all foods. I know, I know, that's not what you read when you research the internet but my dogs do best on Purina or this California brand.
