This is simply the best frozen chicken tikka masala I've found--far better than Ethnic Gourmet or other competing brands.  I eat this at least once a week.  The creamy sauce is great with rice, the chicken is juicy, and the spicing is just right.  Most Indian restaurants don't even produce as good a chicken tikka masala as this one.
