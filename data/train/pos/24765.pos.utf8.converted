If you're looking for something that's going to taste exactly like what you get at your local Indian restaurant, forget it. Don't waste your time. Go spend $15 for lunch.<br /><br />But if you want some variety in your diet and an easy to make entree for lunch or dinner, then this is good stuff. Just cook for 90 seconds, add to rice or whatever you want and you've got a meal. Again, if you like Indian food and you a) don't have time to make it from scratch yourself and b) refuse to spend a ton of money, then buy this Aloo Palak.<br /><br />I gotta go, I'm ordering more.<br /><br />BTW, I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, but this stuff is good.
