I have been having this coconut sugar in my tea each morning, and it adds an amazing rich flavor. It reminds me of jaggery, a coconut palm sugar used in Sri Lankan desserts. Today I made a banana bread with it, and it came out great. You can substitute it 1 for 1 with white sugar as far as texture is concerned. The added depth of flavor was a really nice addition to the bread. I could not tell the difference between the blond version and the regular version - they look and taste exactly the same to me. In baking I would use this to add a complex, caramelized flavor where you would normally add brown sugar, although I am not sure the properties would be exactly the same (since this sugar doesn't have the moist quality of brown sugar).<br /><br />UPDATE: I baked a lemon pound cake with the blond coconut sugar as a substitute for white sugar with great results again. The only difference with using either the blond or regular coconut sugar in baking is that the end product will be darker than one baked with white sugar. The dark coconut flavor is very subtle in baked dishes. Its best flavor comes out when stirred into your tea or sprinkled over oatmeal. It's definitely something I will use going forward!
