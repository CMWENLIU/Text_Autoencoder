For those picky dogs that don't want to take pills, this is the solution. I tried to hide my dog's pills in peanut butter, cheese, and cold cuts, none of which worked. I purchased both the roasted duck, which is for allergies, and chicken flavored pockets and tried out both of the sizes (pockets for tablets and capsules) as well. My dog much preferred the chicken flavor. I preferred the pill pockets in the capsule size. This is because these pockets are larger. Even though the tablet sized pockets are large enough for any tablet, the capsule size allow me to get twice as many pill pockets for my money. I split them in two and can still fit a tablet inside each half*... just a TIP for those wanting to save a bit of $
