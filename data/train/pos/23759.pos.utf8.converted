When ordering candy, there is always the worry of getting old & stale stuff. Well, I ordered mine from Candy Crate, and I got some excellently fresh candy corn! Well packaged, nice and fresh!<br /><br />The candy corn was inside a nice bag that will keep the freshness (which was tied on the top) and then inside of a shopping bag style bag with handles that were also tied. Then inside a box with packing paper to prevent accidental tears on the trip. Bulk packaging, but well worth it!<br /><br />This is the traditional candy corn I was looking for! Orange center, white pointy end, and yellow on the wide end. Brightly colored and tastes great! If you are looking for candy corn, this is a sweet deal!
