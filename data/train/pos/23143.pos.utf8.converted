A beach on Ko Samui. A bikini-clad waitress brings you a coconut, then produces a machete. "Pour vous, monsieur," she says, bringing the blade down upon the coconut with a raunchy thwack that strangely excites you. Why did she speak French? You don't care. She unwraps a straw, and places it gingerly into the coconut. "Merci," you say, confused. You didn't order a coconut. Even so, as you sip the sweet sweet milk, the sound of the waves remind you of an old lullaby, and you close your eyes, adrift in the warmth of the setting sun.<br /><br />You open your eyes. You are in your apartment in Brooklyn. Was it all a dream? You are holding a 14-ounce unit of Thai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk. Eleven units remain--maybe it wasn't a dream, after all.
