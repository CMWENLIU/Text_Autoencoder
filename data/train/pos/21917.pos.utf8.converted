40 individual bags of great tasting kettle corn made into chips.  Tried them first on JetBlue and I was hooked!  I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V8Y5KY">Medora Snacks Popcorners Popped Corn Chips with Sea Salt, 1.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 40)</a> also - it would be great for dipping.  Kettle is my favorite though!  Great tasting gluten-free alternative to regular chips.  Highly recommended!
