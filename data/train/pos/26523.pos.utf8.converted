I have never eaten dried eggs, so I can't comment on the taste or quality for human diets.  I bought this product to add to my dog's food because I have a couple of picky eaters, especially one older girl who doesn't have much of an appetite sometimes.  I feed only top quality, high protein, all natural dog food, but even so, I sprinkle a tablespoon of the powdered egg on top of each dog's meal and add a little water.  My dogs love it.  In addition to adding taste, it's low in calories and a great coat supplement as well.  I would highly recommend this product for this type purpose.
