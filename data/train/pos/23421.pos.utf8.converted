Pure Kona coffee, especially when it comes directly from the farm, is everything the coffee lover ever hoped for, absolutely as good as its description suggests it will be. The flavor is rich because farm-processed coffee never has the chance to get stale--the cherries are skinned and the beans are dried and roasted immediately after picking for maximum freshness and mellow flavor.  They don't sit around over-fermenting while waiting to be processed (which then requires dark roasting to kill the "spoiled" taste).<br /><br />Though pure 100% Kona is rare and difficult to find, this coffee is the real deal--a premier coffee which is among the costliest and most sought-after.  If you are just browsing for coffee, take a close look at the label.  For some strange reason, coffee can be legally called "Kona" if it contains just ten percent Kona beans (with 90% of the beans coming from unknown sources), and some new buyers are unaware of this.  This brand of 100% Kona will justify its price and confirm everything you ever wanted in taste. n Mary Whipple
