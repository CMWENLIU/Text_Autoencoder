I used to buy 100% natural fruit roll-ups at a local fruit market down the street from me. They were sold individually for like 65 cents apiece and were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. They were nothing like the fruit roll ups for kids you find in the grocery stores today. Those things are gross and have no resemblance whatsoever to a real fruit roll up. I used to literally buy like $50 worth at a time and would just eat one after another after another. In particular the Apricot and Strawberry flavors were just outstanding. Anyways, I went to the market one day and they had gone out of business. That was about 8-9 years ago. I tried finding a different store that carried them and to this day I have been unsuccessful. I tried finding them using the internet but unfortunately I just cant remember the name of the company to save my life. I just remember they were sold individually, were round and actually quite large in diameter, and they came attached to a piece of cellophane.<br /><br />I came across Stretch Island Leathers on Amazon just a few weeks ago and got extremely excited after reading the description as it sounded exactly like a fruit roll up, just presented differently. While a Fruit Roll-up is large and thin, The Fruit leather is small and thick. Anyways I immediately order a box of the strawberry and anxiously awaited its arrival. I received my shipment 2 days later and immediately ripped open the box and dug in. They were exactly what I was looking for and they were just as delicious as I remembered them to be. I would up eating one after another after another, just like I used to do, until I had a fairly large pile of wrappers sitting in front of me. I honestly cant even express how excited I really am. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I found it on Amazon which means I can buy them in large quantities for a very reasonable price. On top of that Amazon offers them on a subscription based service so I don't even have to trouble myself with re-ordering more.<br /><br />The bottom line - Stretch Island Leathers are OUTSTANDING and my hunt is finally over. If you are a big fruit lover than you simply have to give these a try. Of course these are not just for adults, in fact these are absolutely perfect for kids especially if your trying to cut down on the amount of junk food your kids eat. They are all natural and have no added sugar. For those that have dietary restrictions, they are also gluten free and dairy free. I honestly cannot give a higher recommendation!!<br /><br />5 Stars!!!
