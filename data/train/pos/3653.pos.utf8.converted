If your dog is the kind with a cast iron gut who chows down on road kill with nary a problem and you have an extremely limited budget, this may not be the treat for your dog. For my own case, I have a Border Collie with a sensitive stomach and my budget for dog treats is modest. These are a great treat made here in the USA as the previous reviewer noted, avoiding the potential problems of Chinese made goods making the news recently. Feeding one of these 2-3 times per week gets that excited, eyes bugging out, reaction one would expect from a treat while providing an all natural, high protein component to your dogs diet, while remaining very affordable. As with any treat, overindulgence can upset the proper balance of your dogs diet, but even 2-3 in one day have not upset my dogs gut. In my opinion, this is almost as good as cooking for your dog yourself.
