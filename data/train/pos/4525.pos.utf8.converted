My vet @ 183 Animal Hospital in Irving, TX is totally fine w/ this food.  They sell Science diet but what he says about Chicken Soup is "That's a very good food, nothin' wrong with that!"  Meatball and Zippo's coats have become shinier and they LOVE the stuff!  Been eating it for 3+ years.  My vet is very happy w/ their health.  He says he wishes his teeth were in good as shape as both my kids.  But I attribute some of that to "flossing".  They play pull-toy every day and I'm sure that, along w/ a good diet has a lot to do w/ it.  They also get supplemental anti-bacterial fluid for their water bin.<br /><br />Read the ingredients.  Some dogs have allergies to some ingredients so not all dogs can eat all things.  Mine most certainly benefit from Chicken Soup.  I am going to see if my feed store sells the canned version so the kids can get some real meat on a regular basis other than the incidental chicken, turkey or beef portions from my kitchen.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
