Skyline chili based in Cincinnati, OH has the best Cincinnati style chili available. Unfortunately, there are not that many Skyline Chili restaurants out there.  You can find their products in the frozen food section of your grocer (at least here in Ohio) but not all of them carry it and it is somewhat expensive.  Enter Cincinnati Recipe mix.  Cincinnati Recipe is the closest in taste to Skyline Chili and is easy to make.  The packet contains all the seasonings and spices to create the great Cincinnati style chili taste.  I used to be able to find the Cincinnati Recipe mix at my grocery store but unfortunately they stopped stocking it.  I was extremely happy to find it thru Amazon and bought the six pack.  My craving has been satisfied.  I love the 5-way with spaghetti, Cincinnati chili, kidney beans, onions and shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!!!
