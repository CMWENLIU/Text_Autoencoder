In the effort to include more H2O into my cats' diet's I, the mostly educated pet owner, started buying canned food. First try was Wellness canned food. Two of my cats dived right in enthusiastically, the third, my picky Ragdoll cat, Phoebe, sniffed and snubbed my offering immediately. I then proceeded to try many different canned food varieties, even resorting to yucky Fancy feast, which I thought any cat would love. But low and behold, she is the most stubborn finicky cat I have come across in all my years of cat ownership! I know I probably made it worse by offering her so many choices for her to turn her pretty little nose up at!<br /><br />I think it became a bit of a game to frustrate "mommy" to death with the endless food purchases. Luckily, I have a cat whom I affectionately like to call "the garbage disposal" b/c he will literally eat anything and everything (which is really lucky b/c he has IBD and has no choice but to eat a grain free canned diet now)so nothing really went to waste. That's what happens when you live on the streets and fend for yourself versus being born in a breeder's house and having a silver spoon in your mouth like Phoebe was. She's an ungrateful brat! She's also a kitty kibble addict to her very core! I at least was able to get her to eat a grain free dry cat food, which although not ideal, is better than her going without food for more than a couple of days (I know that this can be dangerous and that's why I finally caved on the dry food issue with her).<br /><br />As a last ditch effort I decided to try the L.I.D. diets from Natural Balance. What could it hurt? At least is was readily available from my local pet store as opposed to some of the brands I tried only available online. She continued to turn her nose up at them all EXCEPT the Venison and Green Pea canned food. EUREKA!!! She amazingly LOVES this cat food. I thought that would never happen.<br /><br />It's been a year and she still will only eat this canned food. I'll occasionally throw her a curveball and try and sneak in some other flavor and sometimes she'll even start to eat it, but quickly gives me the evil eye and walks away, so I now only give her the Venison and she still loves me (mostly:). Sometimes for variety and even more water intake, I'll put the canned food into my little Magic Bullet blender w/ water and blend it into something like a kitty smoothie. She really goes gaga for that and will lap up the whole bowl instead of leaving some behind, so I do that as often as I have time. On a sidenote, my other cat (the non-garbage disposal:) who is a little something of picky eater sometimes too (although not nearly in the league of my ultimate picky eater) really, really loves the Natural Balance L.I.D. Duck and Green Pea, more so than any other canned cat food. He will eat most chicken based cat foods, but will leave a lot behind. But if I give him the Duck and Green pea he'll eat it all.<br /><br />Whew! Sorry to be so long winded, but this cat has put me through the wringer and I just had to share my trials and tribulations before my discovery of the Venison and Green Pea "magic" kitty food!
