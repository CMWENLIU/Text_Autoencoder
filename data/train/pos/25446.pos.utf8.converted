Years ago Philips and Douwe Egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods.  The copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only; no more brick and mortar stores.  Philips then sold their share of the coffee business to Douwe Egberts and are moving pod production to Brazil.  This is causing the delay, especially with the Dark Roast.  According to Senseo the coffee should be by June or July at the latest.  Or so they say.  I am surprised that they have not made this info more available.  Seems like many will simply move on to another coffee machine.  Meanwhile try using a regular coffee filter and espresso grind your own coffee.  I've tried Starbucks coffee and not bad.  Less creama, but good flavor.  Google 'make your own coffee pods' to see the methods used to trim the filter and pack the coffee.  It's easy, but not so easy as dropping two pods and pushing the start button.
