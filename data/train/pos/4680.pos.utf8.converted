This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via "Subscribe & Save" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.  It doesn't take a college education to know that's a deal!
