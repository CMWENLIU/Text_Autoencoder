For alcohol-free vanilla, this one is both delicious and healthy.  It is great to cook with or to add to your 'raw' recipes, and the flavor is very true.  There is no 'off' flavor that some vanillas can have.  It has only glycerine and water as additional ingredients.  Some other alcohol-free vanillas have corn syrup, and who wants corn syrup?  This can be hard to find in some stores.  Our local organic grocer seems to have trouble ordering it for me (that would be on them, not on Frontier), so ordering through Amazon has proven to be very convenient.  Enjoy!
