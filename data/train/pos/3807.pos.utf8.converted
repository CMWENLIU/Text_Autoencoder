I ordered two boxes of the Hershery bars for a party I was having. It was three weeks before the party and I was going to be out of town for one of the weeks. Apparently there was a heat wave happening so I was sure they were going to be melted when they arrived.  I received an email from the company advising that they held my shipment due to the heatwave.  As soon as the weather was acceptable they sent them out.  I received everthing on time and in perfect condition.  I am very satisfied.
