This is just the best "herb" tea!  It's actually a sumptuous blend of a few exotic spices, with a kiss of vanilla.  It's yummy as a delectable pastry or dessert but it can be brewed up in a few minutes, smells divine, and can be consumed without guilt (read zero calories, fat, sodium, etc.,).  If you love cinnamon, you HAVE to try it.  The hint of cardamom, ginger, plus a few other all-natural flavors, simply pushes this tea to the top spot on the delight-o-meter.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it can be a bit hard to find outside Colorado.<br /><br />I hope you keep it in stock Amazon.  Thanks.
