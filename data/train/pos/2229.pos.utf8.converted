The Girl Scout Samoa is possibly my favorite cookie of all time. But I'm tired of having to wait so long between offerings and paying what I find to be a bit of an exorbanant price for a pack of cookies. Enter: Keebler. These cookies are near-perfect reproductions of the Samoa, available for purchase year-round and you'll save a few bucks too.<br /><br />On the other hand, you'll have to face yourself in the mirror after taking money from the service-oriented activities of Girl Scouts and siphoning it towards another money-grubbing corporation, Kellog (don't get it twisted, these dudes in the boardroom aren't magical elves).<br /><br />So to reconcile your palette and your conscience, I recommend buying from Girl Scouts during cookie season while using Keebler for the the occasional relapse during the off-season.
