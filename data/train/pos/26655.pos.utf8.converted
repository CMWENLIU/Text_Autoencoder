I was a little leery about spending so much for cheese from a seller I didn't know but decided to take a  risk !  First let me say I live in Florida so was also a bit concerned about ordering perishables with the heat. I was correct in that concern as my cheese arrived as expensive gooey fat.  I contacted the seller and was very pleased with their quick response and replacement of my cheese.  It is excellent. Thank you  A.G. Ferrari Foods for offering a very fine tasting cheese and for your prompt and stellar service.
