If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom.  They really are that delicious.  And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc).<br /><br />These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds.<br /><br />Edit on 9/27/07:  This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor.  I just noticed that Amazon is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed.
