This was the first Ghee or clarified butter I'd ever tried, to my knowledge, and I have to say it's the most amazing stuff to cook with. I saute a large batch fresh organic vegetables in it every week, using my large cast iron skillet, and the flavor it imparts is stupendous! Just a touch of celtic sea salt and a few tablespoons of this make the veggies something my whole family craves.<br /><br />Bonus: it's a healthy oil for us! You can also use some on a spoon as a chaser to fermented cod liver oil to get the maximum benefits. Look up the work of Weston A. Price for more information on that preventative, but even if you don't, you'll absolutely love this for cooking and in recipes.<br /><br />I also LOVE that it doesn't have to be refrigerated, so it sits in the cabinet, happily, with the salt and olive oil, not taking up precious refrigerator space.<br /><br />It's delicious, and it's NON-GMO!! In this day & age, where so much GMO corn, soy, canola & other foods are genetically modified, and I'm trying to outrun them, this is such a relief to find. No hormones, no antibiotics & no GMOS!<br /><br />Fantastic!
