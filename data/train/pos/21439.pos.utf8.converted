While living in Singapore I became aquainted with these seasonings packets.  They are simply wonderful.  The Butter Chicken is my favorite.  I have ordered them directly from Asian Home Gourmet because I could not find the Butter Chicken anywhere. Now to find them here on Amazon makes me so happy!<br /><br />To the uninitiated in Asian food, Butter Chicken is a great place to start.  It is unique and yet wondefully familiar.  Not hot, at all.  This dish is superb when served with steamed rice.  This packet makes up easily and tastes the way I remember eating it at Indian places in Singapore.
