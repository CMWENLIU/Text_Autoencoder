These almonds are "packaged by Spicy World, sold by Simply Beautiful, fulfilled by Amazon, shipped by Deeva Fullfillment Services, Inc" - so its hard to know WHO takes the credit for the quality. They dont state the origin, but these almonds are definately smaller and less tasty than the "California almonds" I purchased previously - but I KNEW they were probably foreign because they are packed by Spicy World, and because the price was less than 6 dollars a pound, including postage. So there u go. I got what I paid for - cheap almonds of uncertain origin.
