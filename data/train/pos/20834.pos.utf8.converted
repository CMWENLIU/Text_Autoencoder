I am the proud slave/minion of two feline evil geniuses.  I only hope that my servitude will allow me to one day be reincarnated as a cat who gets to sleep in front of the heating vent all day, only rising for food and attention.<br /><br />Royal Canin is exceptional cat food.  My older, part Siamese kitty has bad teeth that are typical of his breed.  I have fed him everything from Purina Indoor to Iams to Eukanuba.  All of these he would eat whole and yak up on the floor.  Because his nutrition sucked, his coat was dull and he would shed and shed.  So I went on a search for something better.  I found Royal Canin.<br /><br />First off, when you open this bag (and it's resealable, so it won't get stale!), expect your cat to go nuts.  It actually SMELLS better than any other dry cat food I've found.  The first time I opened it, my older cat (didn't have the little one yet) tried to climb into the bag.<br /><br />So here are the pros:<br /><br />  -It's really appetizing/appealing.  For cats anyway.<br />  -The weird flat triangle shape makes it harder to yak up on the floor.<br />  -The higher amount of protein/fats (less "filler") means that it's easier to digest and less likely to be yakked up on the floor.<br />  -Within a couple of weeks you'll notice WAY less shedding and a shinier, more lustrous coat.  Kitty feels like bunny fur, shines like a mink.<br />  -Less shedding and a higher fat/oil content means less hairballs to yak up (mine does it VERY rarely anymore...maybe once every other month.  He just digests them now.<br />  -You can actually feed less than you would the other foods because less filler means more is digested.<br />  -Also means less poop.<br />  -And that poop is less stinky/nasty.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />  -It's more expensive.<br />  -When it's feeding time, your cat WILL NOT SHUT UP until you put it in the bowl.<br />  -If you really like stepping in cat yak or kicking it across the floor in the middle of the night in your bare feet, sorry, your mooshy toe days are numbered.<br /><br />So, don't be detered by the price (which is WAY cheaper here per pound than it is at PetCo...and with free shipping!), give it a try.  It's worth it if you want to be the best minion/slave you can possibly be (and increase your chances of being a cat in your next life!*).<br /><br />*Disclaimer: Purchase of Royal Canin does not guarantee purchaser will be reincarnated as a feline in any of their following lives.  This reviewer takes no responsibility for reincarnation disappointments.
