I can't believe there aren't any other reviews here yet. These are great. Even the raw dough is fantastic. I make some type of low carb dessert whenever we're faced with a holiday or birthday so that we have a legal treat. It helps us to avoid the illegal ones. Don't hesitate to try these if you're a low carber and need a treat.
