I first discovered Orgain (chocolate flavor) at Farm to Market. Although very skeptical, I found the high protein content to be appealing, so I purchased it, and cautiously tried it a couple days later, room temperature.  I was delighted at its great taste!  And after reading the nutrition label, I realized this could be an extremely healthy and great-tasting solution to being too busy (or too lazy) to prepare food.  I ordered a case from Amazon, and chilled them... even better, IMO.  Now, not only do I feel healthier, less hungry, and have more energy, but I also broke through the pound plateau and have lost weight since I started drinking Orgain.  I've recommended it to family members, and I continue to drink it myself.  I'm so glad I took an uncharacteristic risk and tried it.
