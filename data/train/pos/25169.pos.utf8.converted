I didn't know there was a difference between brands of gelatin.  I had gotten this brand through the Radiant Life company ([...]), and it had a pleasant, gummy smell when mixed in hot water.  Then I got Knox gelatin from a store, and to be frank, it smelled like pure sh**.  I guess they figure people are going to be mixing it with sugar and stuff, because I don't know how they could stand by that product.  I think I'll go with this brand again.<br /><br />I believe gelatin could be a food that heals.  "Good broth cures anything" is a South American proverb.  It could be because it is a protein that DOESN'T have tryptophan.  See more in this article: [...].<br /><br />And it has to be a broth that has GELATIN.  You can tell store-bought broths don't have an ounce of gelatin, because they absolutely do not GEL in the fridge.  They usually have MSG as well.  I don't know what it is, but it's not broth.  If you've never made your own broth, you'll be surprised that it turns like jello in the fridge.
