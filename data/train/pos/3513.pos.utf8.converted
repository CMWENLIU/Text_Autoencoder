I have been buying this product since I discovered it at Costco, and recently discovered it on Amazon. I find this to be a versatile and extremely useful ingredient in many foods I prepare ... casseroles, soups, stews, any non-sweet that requires flavor and liquid. It has the additional health benefits of chicken soup, and may be used in hot soup drinks for flu and colds. It makes an exceptional baked brown rice side dish when paired with Himalayan Pride Basmati Rice, which is also available here. I may sound like a salesman for this stuff, but I have made my own organic broths from vegetables and bones, and it takes a lot of time and care. For a prepared product, this has good flavor and versatility. And it is not canned, another large health plus - no leached metals, additives, or plastic liner contamination.<br />I can't testify to the shipping practices of the various postal services. I have received damaged products in the past, and it was the responsibility of the seller to package them properly, and it is the responsibility of the shipper to handle the goods properly. Usually, it seems to be the brutal treatment of the shipper in question, which means the seller must be notified. Amazon stands by their products, so I buy a lot from them. When I have had a problem, they promptly took care of it. I find I am buying more from them every month, and will do so as long as they are honest with me, as I am with them.
