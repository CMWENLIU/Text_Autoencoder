I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because "rain forest" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey.
