I recently received a Vitamix Blender, and have been experimenting with using it to grind my own flour at home. Once you have tried *real* whole grain flour, you will never go back! The pricing of this 25 pound bag, with delivery, is better than I have been able to find anywhere, and the grains make a great, strong whole-grain flour. Note that this is not flour, but actual wheat seeds (often referred to as "wheat berries").<br /><br />In addition, the grains are fertile, meaning that you can use them to make sprouted grain. Or if you are a survivalist, you can plant the grains and actually grow a crop!<br /><br />Another main advantage of whole grain is its shelf life. There are reports that 2000 year old grain has been found and germinated! In any case, if properly stored, you can expect a 5-10 year shelf life from whole grain, as opposed to a much shorter shelf life with flour. I purchsed a 5-gallon bucket with a "gamma 2" lid for storing the grain, and I'm confident that it will keep nicely fresh for a long time to come.
