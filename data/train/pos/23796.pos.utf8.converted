I bought a couple strainer bags at Home Depot for about 2.50.  I used one bag for maybe 5 times and it was obvious that it was loosing integrity every time I used it.  I don't think I could have got 5 more uses out of it.  It did work fine... though I think that the pulp was starting to stick to the bag a little.  I would NOT recommend buying paint strainer bags.<br /><br />This nut milk bag works great.  I have used it to make almond milk about 20-25 times now.  I can see it easily lasting quite awhile....at least a year.  Though I will update my review as time passes.  It is easy to clean and the mylk goes through well.  I think it is well made.  For the convenience of buying this and having it last a long time and not making one myself, I think this bag is definitely worth the investment.  The only thing I think the maker should change is the drawstring.  It is made out of a slippery type rope and when you tie it, it does not knot tight and stay knotted.  So I have to re knot it many times.  Also, the rope is starting to fray at the ends.  Even so, I am still giving 5 stars for this product.<br /><br />Advise....buy this nut milk bag and not the paint strainer bag
