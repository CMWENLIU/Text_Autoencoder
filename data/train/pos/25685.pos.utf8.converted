My husband and I both have very low sodium diets and know how difficult it is to find low sodium products that taste good. This is one. We have had Arrowhead Mills Amaranth Flakes every day for breakfast ever since we discovered the product a couple of years ago. We are vegetarians, and also limit our fats and sugars.<br />What on earth DO they eat, you might ask...well, Amaranth Flakes is one thing : ). We love them, and recommend them as all organic, healthy (zero sodium) and tasty.
