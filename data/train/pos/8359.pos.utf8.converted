My wife and I have vastly different taste buds, which is perfect.<br /><br />She loves the green apples and green bananas and I love the yellow<br /><br />spotted bananas and the mealy ripe apples.  She loves the San Pellegrino Chinotto and I like my syrup sweet hot chocolate.  If you like sour things, then give this a try.  My wife wants this drink to stick around so is enouraging me to write a good review of it, since she does not write online reviews and barely emails. (^:<br /><br />Jonathan
