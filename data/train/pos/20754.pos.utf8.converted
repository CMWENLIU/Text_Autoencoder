Our Rhodesian Ridgeback has a somewhat sensitive stomach.  With this food he is happy and fit.  A very good quality food that is healthy and good for your dog.  The price with free freight is very good an much lower than local.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Since it is no longer with free freight it costs about the same as your local pet food store.
