Red Palm Oil is a wonderful, healthy, tasty addition to a low carb diet.  If you are searching for a new healthy fat to use in your meal preparations, in addition to the coconut oil you are already using, then Red Palm Oil is for you.  The bright orange color comes from the abundant caratinoids in the red palm fruit. It is also rich source of vitamin E, and CoQ10.<br /><br />It adds a wonderfully unique flavor to egg, meat, and fish dishes.  I typically like to blend red palm oil w/ coconut oil for pan frying salmon, or grilling meat or poultry.  It also works well in chili recipes.<br /><br />Red Palm Oil is difficult, if not impossible, to find in retail grocers, including the large, organic, health food grocer.<br /><br />Even though this oil is widely used throughout the world, being produced in countries such as, West Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South America, it must be a scarce import to the USA.  Why else would the price for this oil be so expensive?  When you add $10+ shipping cost to the $14+ retail cost, that's EXPENSIVE! for 16oz, relative to other healthy cooking fats like olive and coconut oil, or butter.<br /><br />I've tried both the Okonatur and Omni brands sold by Amazon, and while both are good, I prefer the Okonatur.  The Okonatur red palm oil seems to smoke during frying a little more readily than the Omni brand, which may be due to a different fatty acid profile, however, the flavor characteristics of the Okonatur are more pleasant to my palate.<br /><br />For price comparison purposes, I have purchased a 16oz jar of Okonatur Red Palm Oil for $18.99 retail (San Francisco, CA) That, vs the $28.00 it will cost on Amazon - not a difficult choice to make.<br /><br />Bottom line: Buy Online if you can't find it locally - but give red palm oil a try.
