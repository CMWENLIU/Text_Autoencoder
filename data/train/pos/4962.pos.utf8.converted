If you haven't tried this product you really should buy a bottle and experience it for yourself.  I think that it is good enough that you won't miss the sugar.<br /><br />Water is so good for us, but so boring.  If you are trying to increase your consumption of water, try a little of this in the water.<br /><br />This product can also be used to make an Italian soda (a little syrup, a little cream, and some sparkling water).  Another yummy treat, if only they made a fat free cream it would be perfect.  I have not tried to make an Italian soda using the Land-O-Lakes Fat Free half and half but it should work.<br /><br />My husband and I have been buying this brand of sugar free syrup for years.  A pump of this syrup into your coffee changes it from a standard morning beverage into a liquid candy bar in a mug.  I recently switched from half and half to soy milk in my coffee.  With this syrup in my coffee the switch to soy milk was very easy.<br /><br />This product can also be used to drizzle on fruit if you need a little extract sweetener.<br /><br />The ingredients in this product (listed in order) are as follows:<br />Purified water<br />Vanilla extract with other natural flavors<br />Potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate (to preserve freshness)<br />Citric acid<br />Xantham gum<br />Sucralose (splenda brand)<br />Acesulfame potassium<br /><br />Nutrition Facts label reads as follows:<br />Serving Size:  1 oz.<br />Servings per Package:  25.4<br />Calories:  0<br />Calories from fat:  0<br />Total Fat:  0 g<br />Sodium:  15 mg<br />Total Carbohydrate:  0 g<br />Sugars:  0 g<br />Protein:  0g<br /><br />If you find that you like this product I would suggest that you order a pump for the bottle.  It allows you to dispense the same amount into your coffee without having to tediously measure.
