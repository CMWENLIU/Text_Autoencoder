I wanted to make a playable Angry Birds cake for my son's birthday.  After hours of surfing the net to find figurines, not finding them, and then surfing for fondant to make them myself, I decided to try fondarific and couldn't have been happier with my choice.  Here is my review of the product after making the figurines.  (I posted pictures of them as a customer image so you could see the results.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />* This stuff tastes great!  The vanilla tastes like a homemade marshmallow fondant (you can find recipes on the web) but is much easier to work with.  I also bought some of the Melon flavor to make the pigs and it tastes just like honeydew melons, well, just like a honeydew flavored Jelly Belly would taste.<br />* Amazingly easy to work with.  It is hard out of the tub, so I used a semi-sharp knife to cut off a chunk.  Then just fold and squish a few times and it is as pliable as fresh Playdough.  If it gets to soft, just stick it in the fridge for a while to harden.<br />* Takes color well.  I used Ateco gel food colors, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1C6">Ateco 1112 12-Color Food Coloring Kit</a>, and got great results, even with the black.<br />* Holds its shape.  I wanted to be sure I could pull this off, so I made one pig three weeks ago.  Then I let it just sit there for three weeks.  It still looked great.  Held its color and shape and even stayed glossy.  I would have included a picture of it, buy my 1-year-old found it on the counter and smushed it today.<br />* Doesn't go bad.  Three weeks sitting out and I could still reshape and use fondarific (not that I'd eat it after letting it sit out in the open for that long).  When the company says it's good for a year after purchase, I believe it.  I had a bunch left over.  I'll probably end up using it on next year's birthday cake.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Fondarific will not harden if you leave it out to dry.  You have to add tylose powder to get hard figurines.  I didn't add tylose because, well, they are angry birds.  I figured I was better of if they stayed a little soft since there is a high likely-hood my son's will end up throwing these birds at each other, or at me. :)<br />* Fondarific is a bit pricier than making it yourself...but not much.  By the time you've purchased a pound of marshmallows, two pounds of powdered sugar, and some shortening, I think the added expense for fondarific is worth it.  I know, this is supposed to be a con. I'll admit I'm biased at this point.<br /><br />Note:<br />Not that anyone would think it, but I'm not a professional cake decorator or figurine maker.  The angry birds figurines I made were my FIRST attempt at making fondant figurines.  I did watch some instructional videos on the web, but it's essentially like sculpturing with Play Dough.  I did try to make marshmallow fondant for last years birthday cake, and I would never have been able to make figurines out of that stuff.<br /><br />So, there you have it, my honest opinion of fondarific.  I would definitely purchase this again (not that I plan on making another Angry Birds cake any time soon).
