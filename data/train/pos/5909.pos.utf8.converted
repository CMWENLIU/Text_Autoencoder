Its sad that most of the bad reviews are from people who don't realize what they are purchasing.  This is Double Salt Licorice, and its a very salty tasting candy (if you can call it candy).  Since its salted with salmiak, it has no sodium (but ammonium chloride).<br /><br />Anyways, when I was a kid I used to love to get rock salt and let it dissolve on my tongue and thought it was way better than regular candy, so as an adult, I have finally found what I consider to be the perfect treat, highly recommended to those people who love salt.  This stuff is pretty much perfect, I've tried many different types of Salt Licorice and along with the amazing Tyrkisk Peber, this stuff is the best (note: I prefer the harder candies not the chewy ones).  If you're expecting traditional US licorice (which mostly I don't like) then don't waste your time or money.
