I ordered the Breadman TR-875 the other day when it was a Gold Deal.  I have never used a bread machine nor made bread.  I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer.  While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain.  They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman.  The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for the Breadman. I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf.  It is fabulous.  The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature.  Today I just completed making the other five loaves.  Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six.  Everything was so simple, with a little research.  I am one proud novice; soon to be considered a professional. :)
