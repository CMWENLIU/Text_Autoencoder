I absolutely love granola!  And this stuff is great.  I'm a runner and I love the fact that this granola not only taste great, but has the added protein, which you don't normally find in granola.  I can't find it locally so I always buy it from Amazon and in fact subscribe to have it delivered on a regular basis.  On a side note, my 3 year old daughter loves it as well!  Enjoy!!
