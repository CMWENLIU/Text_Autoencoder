I have tried many syrups and Teisseire is definitely the best ever. Some other brands can have a great color to attract customers, but they have no taste even with a lot of syrup and just a little water. Not gonna happen with teisseire. I have never thought I would be soo much into a syrup, but here it is, I love this syrup and I am not trying other brands anymore (was always disappointed).<br /><br />Works also great in replacing water by milk .. mhhhhh :D
