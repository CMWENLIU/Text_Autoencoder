My 11 yr old daughter's pierced ears were infected, red, and crusted. I put the Trivedi water on a cottonball and soaked her ear lobe before she went to bed. In the morning the infection was completely gone, and she was able to wear earrings!<br /><br />Also, I took in a stray kitten who had an eye infection. I kept bringing her to the vet's but her eye never stopped leaking and drooping for many months.  and put some Trivedi Energy Infused water in her water dish. Within one day, her eye cleared up and completely matched the other, so much that I had to think twice about which eye had been infected. The infection has never returned.
