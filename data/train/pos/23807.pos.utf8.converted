The Pop Secret Homestyle microwave popcorn is my absolute favorite.  When I think of popcorn, this is the standard against which I measure all other popcorn. Very buttery tasting without tasting fake or weighing down the fluffy goodness of the popped corn, with just enough salt.  For anyone who wants a rich popcorn-butter flavor, for movie watching or just a quick snack, buy Pop Secret Homestyle. I've tried their other flavors, and some other brands and this is the most to my liking.  (If you're going for sweet like kettlecorn, this is not that flavor.)<br /><br />The 1.75oz snack size size is just right for 1-2 people.  It pops in my microwave in 1:55, and only if I let the packs get old do I get more than  4-6 unpopped kernels.  I almost never bought the "regular" sized bags because they were too huge for anything but a party.  I almost always keep the snack sized packs on hand.  I'm hoping they know how much I love this and keep making it, and sizing it right, for a good long time.
