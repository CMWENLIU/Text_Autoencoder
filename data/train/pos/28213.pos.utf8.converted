When my box arrived, I tried out this mix to see if it was going to be the same weak concoction that all mixers seem to be.  Not so with this mix!  I was surprised at the strenth of flavor!  Now, I want to say that I make "Rum-ritas" with 151 rum.  So the strength of the alcohol usually washes out any flavor a mix would have.  I could not taste the rum like I do with other mixers!  And while this may be good for me, all guys know that a drink has to have good flavor for the girls!  Also, I can take this mix overseas and pack it in my suitcase because it is in powder form.  And lastly, it is a great idea for those of us on the Atkins or low carb diet.  They say that there will be more flavors coming soon.
