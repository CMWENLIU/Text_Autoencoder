These are my all time fav donuts!!! Unfortunately they are extremely hard to find in New York. The only time I have ever been able to buy them is when my kids' school would have a fundraiser, but now that my kids are teenagers, the fundraisers have stopped :(. I have searched high and low for these puppies and have been unsuccessful in finding them anywhere. There is a Krispy Kreme shop in Pennsylvania, but that is too far to go and there is one in New York City, but too hard to get to. I had gone on Krispy Kreme's website to order them, but they don't even sell their own donuts on there, which in my opinion is totally lame!!! One time I even spent an entire day searching the net for places that carry them and was told 7-11, Hess and Wal-mart do. So the obsessed woman that I am went to each and every store looking for these, only to find out that they didn't carry them :(. Sooo after feeling totally defeated, I came home and as a last resort I went on amazon. Why I didn't just check them in the first place is beyond me!! Because as I have said in the past, when in doubt, check good ol amazon. I have literally found the weirdest and hardest to find products on here and they have NEVER let me down. I think because it was food or something, I just assumed they wouldn't have them, but I stand corrected!!! Granted they are almost triple the price of a normal box of Krispy Kremes, but when you are desperate (lol), you will pay almost anything and since they are non-existent in my area (sigh) I just suck it up and pay the price.These are my all time fav donuts!!!

I have also bought them from Huggys Haven & Connoisseur Market too, but they are more expensive and take forever to ship their items. I like Moms Express because if there is a problem with your order, she sends you out a new box of donuts free of charge.
