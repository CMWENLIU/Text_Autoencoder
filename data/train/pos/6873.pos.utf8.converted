This is my new replacement for whey protein.  The taste is very different but good.  At 15 grams of protein per every 4 tbsps (the size of one scoop from the scooper that came with my whey protein) is a pretty good dose of protein.  I blend in 3 scoops of protein with some fruit and it tastes great.  I'll be ordering this protein again when I go through this batch.  My muscle retention has been outstanding and this does not make me feel as bloated as the whey.
