Bragg's amino acids are very good for digestion. i have put one bottle in a spray bottle to spray on salads and have another bottle opened for measuring teaspoons full into soups and stews. It not only adds flavor to foods, but makes them easier to digest, thus more healthful. I wish I could have bought fewer bottles than 6, but I know that I will use them up before the expiration date.
