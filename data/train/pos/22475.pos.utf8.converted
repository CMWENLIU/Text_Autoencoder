This is a great tea. I highly recommend all Davidson's teas and I am really glad I discovered them for myself and my family- chamomile, rooibos, hibiscus, green teas- the price is great and you get the organic tea of high quality & quantity.<br /><br />Rooibos tea, like green and black tea, has been found to be rich in anti-oxidants and flavonoids. In fact, Rooibos tea has been found to have as much as 50 times more SOD than Green Tea. It also has other anti-oxidants not found in other teas.<br /><br />The effect of free radicals (a by-product of normal cell function) in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the anti-oxidants in Rooibos tea.<br /><br />Rooibos tea is completely pure and natural, as it contains no additives, preservatives or colorants. It is a soothing drink for people on a calorie-restricted diet, without adding kilojoules.<br />Rooibos tea is also strongly recommended for people suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension. Rooibos tea contains no caffeine and therefore has a soothing effect on the central nervous system. Rooibos tea is also low in tannin and therefore does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.<br /><br />Rooibos tea has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants. Rooibos tea also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach ulcers and constipation.<br /><br />Furthermore, rooibos tea also supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and especially fluoride, needed for the development of strong teeth and bones. It contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid, which promotes healthy skin and magnesium which is necessary for a healthy nervous system.<br /><br />Rooibos tea has a soothing effect on the skin, relieving itching and certain skin irritations like eczema, nappy rash and acne when directly applied to the affected area.
