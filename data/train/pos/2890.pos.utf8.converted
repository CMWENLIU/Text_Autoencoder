<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTD84">Bellagio Sipping Chocolate, Original, 1-Ounce Packets (Pack of 25)</a><br /><br />The directions for this beverage are to add one 1-ounce packet to 1/3 cup whole milk, and I'm sure this would be delicious.  I, however, prefer to add the packet to one cup of 2% milk and find it makes great hot chocolate.  I like dark chocolate and it may be a bit strong for those people who prefer milder chocolate.
