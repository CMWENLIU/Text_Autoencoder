I bought this honey due to the fact its not cooked and is raw which provides more nutrition than Grade A honey( Any Grade Honey is Cooked and filtered). This Honey is really cheap for the price if you subscribe. The honey is not as sweet as clove honey or regular honey because its from gallberry and palmetto honey. I'm glad I tried it and will probably continue to buy this honey for what I use it for(Make honey lemon water, and etc) but if your looking for a sweeter honey look else where, this honey is a more balanced taste. I recommend palmetto honey for a sweeter taste which can be found here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045H25X4">Tropic Bee Palmetto Honey, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)</a>. Also the honey came perfectly packaged which was great. A+
