My 10 year old cat was on the brink of death about a year ago, when my vet theorized he might be allergic to the grain in his Science Diet food. When we put him on Felidae Salmon formula he recovered and is now more healthy than he has been in years. He loves it. No more cat puke, no more "missing" the litter box. His coat is beautiful. If your cat is having digestive problems with all of the usual unpleasant symptoms, try this food.
