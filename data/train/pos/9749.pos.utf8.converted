Great product. I order direct from the company by the pound. Much better price! I also get it from Vitacost at a great price in this size container, $2 and change. I am addicted, my body is obviously craving minerals. Each batch is different since it is fresh from the sea. So expect a slight difference from order to order. I love it so much I eat it straight, I love the crunchy granules in my mouth. Crazy fiber when I eat it like this and almost nothing in terms of sodium. I highly recommend! I go crazy when I run out, my local store has it for $4.45 per 1.5oz. So I try to keep a pound around all the time.
