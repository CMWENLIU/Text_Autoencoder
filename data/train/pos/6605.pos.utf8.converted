I have loved gooseberries ever since I had my first piece of gooseberry pie at a small family bakery in San Luis Obispo county. I've always preferred the more tart fruits in desserts, preserves, chutneys and such.<br /><br />I find them a refreshing change from the sweeter desserts, etc. I was thrilled to find them available from Amazon and at such a good price.<br /><br />Amazon ------- not just for books anymore!!!!!!!!!!!
