I use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream, cookies, cakes etc... I find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own. Because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated. To obtain this, i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk.
