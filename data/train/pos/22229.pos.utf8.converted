Obviously, I can't tell you how these taste, but I know my dogs love them. This was the first time I bought the FunBites Beefhide Chews, and from the package displayed, or even the product page, It didn't give a lot of information about the size, but these chews are 5 inches in length, and approximately 3/4 inch in size, so these chews last a long time. They were a bigger package at a cheaper price than what I was buying for my dogs. I'm very pleased with them.
