Being gluten intolerant it was really nice to see that Pamela's has put out a GF type clif bar (best analogy I had for it). Oddly enough, it does taste like a lighter version of a clif bar (which are usually very dense). Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.<br /><br />It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).<br /><br />Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty darn good.  I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste.<br /><br />As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a break quickly?<br /><br />Yeah, I would.<br /><br />They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice. I'll buy them again easily.<br /><br />If I had to pick between a clif bar and Pamela's Whenever Bars. I'd take Pamela's.
