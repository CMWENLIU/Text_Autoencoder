I love cacao and chocolate, but only eat organic.  I've tried a number of different organic cacao powders--both "raw"/cold-processed, and hot processed.  So far, Tisano organic cacao powder is the best tasting one of those I've tried.  And it definitely appears to have a lower acid content than others I've tried.  My only complaint:  I wish it didn't cost $16/lb!  I can't afford that high a cost on a regular basis, so Tisano will be in my "special treat" category from time to time.  The only problem is that when it's in the house, I lose my self-control and want to have a cup of hot cacao every day instead of only as a special treat.  So the only way I can control myself is to not order it!<br /><br />In addition to producing great tasting certified organic cacao, Tisano gets props from me for direct sourcing their cacao beans from farm cooperatives committed to sustainable farming.  Other facts about their cacao: sourced from Venezuelan Criollo single beans; cold-pressed--no roasting of the beans
