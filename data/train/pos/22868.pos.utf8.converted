The candy bars are delicious, arrrived in good condition, and on time.  I tried to locate this product at several retails in town to no avail.  I wanted them for a baby shower favor.  The new baby is going to be named Henry and this was a fun way to tell the guest.  I purchased extra to be shared when the baby is born, beats cigars.
