Love this stuff. I use it on eggs, rice, potstickers, potatoes, fried foods, pizza, chicken, basically anywhere you put ketchup and then some. It's been called the country's fastest growing condiment, coming straight outta Rosemead, CA. Note that the price shown currently on Amazon ($7.48) is nuts. I got my 17 oz. bottle in NYC Chinatown for $2.99.
