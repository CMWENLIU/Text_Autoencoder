From the first milisecond of the hairs on my teeth hitting the golden brown surface of the geniously pretzelly, and perfectly salted crust I knew that I was in for a treat among snacks.  now i'm a salt man, not really a pretzel fan, a chex-mix man, cheeze-its are the food of the gods, and i love salsa and chips and jalapeno flavor is my own personal objeto favorito, so as you can tell a lot was riding on what would happen next. i sunk straight throught the golden crust in the next chamber on this complicated food labyrinth, a cavern filled with the creamiest, perfectly spiciest, taste bud satisfying, bodacious jalapeno filling a man of my age and religion could ask for.  i instantly fell in love and like smegal became golem, I became obsessed.  so the first thing i thought was i must have more, more.  than i though i lost my ebay account i wonder if amazon sells food online.  i looked it up, and they do! so i came here and saw this great bargain? i will buy the cheaper first and see if i don't get sick of them eventually, if not it's gonna be the big bags next. peace.
