I test healthy recipes for a national website. Honey is a wonderful additive for food, but it's broken down as a simple sugar by the body, so we have to use it VERY sparingly. At least we DID have to use it sparingly! This tastes just like real honey...and there's no sugar. It's the best tasting honey substitute we've ever tried. It also works great in recipes we've make both hot and cold. We like it so much, we're no buying it by the case.<br /><br />There is ONE important thing to remember. It is sweetened with sugar alcohols (which is neither sugar or alcohol...but that's another story). For most of the people, that's no problem. However, some people will get an upset stomach by eating sugar alcohol. Just be aware of that one potential side effect.
