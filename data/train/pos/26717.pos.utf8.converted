I buy this at TARGET stores, it comes in a smaller box. While the recipe basically calls for just water and tomato sauce i found that you can add a lot more to it that makes it SO much better.<br /><br />-- Mexican or Cheddar Cheese (this is a must!) You top each bowl before serving<br />-- Baked chicken - my mom used already seasoned chicken meat but I bake 4 breasts in the oven seasoned with chili powder and slice up to add to the pot.<br />--  Green Onion diced<br />-- Tortilla Chips, doesn't really matter what kind. It just thickens the soup and makes it hearty.<br /><br />Basically it's really easy to make. And the leftovers really taste good too. I haven't tried the other flavors of this brand, didn't really care to. But this is one that i keep stocked in my pantry and those who have tried it really enjoyed it. You could serve as a main dish or perhaps a small side soup with a mexican meal.
