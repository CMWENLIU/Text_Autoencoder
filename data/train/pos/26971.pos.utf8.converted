The Country Choice brand is domestically produced and certified organic by Oregon Tilth.<br /><br />I bought the Multigrain Hot Cereal the first time by accident instead of the steel cut oats but decided to try it rather than return it and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It contains rolled whole grain rye, barley, oats, and wheat in that order.  It is a great hot breakfast on a chilly morning and a nice change from oatmeal.  I like it slightly undercooked and topped with a sliced banana and raisins with a splash of milk.<br /><br />As far as nutrition, a half cup has 5g of fiber!<br /><br />Even if you don't like oatmeal, you might want to give this a try.
