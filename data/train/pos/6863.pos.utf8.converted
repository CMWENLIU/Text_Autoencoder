The number one thing to know about this item is that it is not made with petrochemicals or with any chemicals linked to cancer or to hyperactivity. That makes it the only food coloring that we use in my house. Having said that, I'll agree with the other reviewers who noted that the colors are not as vibrant as artificial, carcinogenic, hyperactivity-inducing dyes. Nothing makes a rainbow on pavement as pretty as anti-freeze leaking out of a car--it doesn't mean that I'll put it in my food!<br /><br />My advice for getting brighter colors in baking is to keep your pre-colored item as clear as possible. This means using agave nectar, honey, or rice syrup, for example, instead of Sucanat. I don't use any refined sugar in my house, so when I want to color something with India Tree, I use a light-colored natural sweetener like one of the aforementioned items. Rice syrup doesn't interfere too much with the India Tree food colors; in fact, I was able to make a beautiful mint-green ice cream with rice syrup as the sweetener and India Tree yellow and blue as the coloring agents. You have to practice to get it perfect, but if your kid isn't used to the chemical food dyes, then anything you do with these India Tree dyes will be a bright difference from plain brown or tan baked goods.
