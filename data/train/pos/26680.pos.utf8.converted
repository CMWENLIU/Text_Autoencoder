I have been drinking Acai Gold for about two months and here is what I have noticed. My energy level went up a great deal in the beginning. Followed by a lack of appetite. Then I began to notice that I was losing weight since I wasn't eating as much.<br /><br />After two months, my hair is really healthy and shiny. Since I gave birth to my second child, my hair and skin have not looked this vibrant in some time. I was warned that acai juice doesn't taste very good but I actually like the taste of this juice. Just make sure to shake it before you pour so the seeds are not all settled at the bottom.<br /><br />I like ordering it by the case since my husband has now joined me in my ritual of taking acai shots. Dynamic Health was professional and prompt in fulfilling my order. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results that I hoped to achieve by consuming acai.
