Tearing your hair out? Toddler exist on crackers and air? Do you have nightmares, wake up sweating at night, because your tot isn't taking in the food pyramid # of fruits and veggies? Have no fear. Peter Rabbit is here.<br /><br />I don't feed my kids in the car. OK, I'm lying. But I try really, really hard not to. Who in their right mind would hand their toddler a freaking pouch of goo, and say "have at it"? No sane person.<br /><br />I do. They latch onto these things like a deranged octopus and go to town. Not a drop left. Not a drop spilled. We're talking a 15 month old and a 28 month old here, people. If that's not impressive to you, if that doesn't soeak highly of this product, you obviously do not have children. And if you don't have kids, you can still enjoy these slurpy delights. My husband, The Skeptical Parent, took a swig and said "oh! It's just fruit. Like, it tastes like, you know.. fruit." Yes buddy. That's the point. Yum. Enjoy.
