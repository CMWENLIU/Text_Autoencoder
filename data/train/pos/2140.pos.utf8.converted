These syrups are absolutely delicious! If you like snow cones, and are tired of weak or diluted-tasting syrups, try these. The flavor is anything but weak and they make you want to go back for more. This assortment is a great value, but if you have lots of family and friends over for your frozen treats, they will go fast! I highly recommend them.
