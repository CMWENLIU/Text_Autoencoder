I'm a gal who LOVES her sweets - and I had one of these babies just early today HOLLA!!  Twix hit a grane slam with this addition to the Twix family.  I remember when the two varieties of Twix were the original caramel and the peanut butter - both featuring the same kind of regular cookie base.<br /><br />That was then and this is now!  These aren't your fathers peanut butter Twix.  With the new kind, you'll find a chocolate cookie base, and the difference is truly impressive.  This is uniquely different Twix flavor - and the spookiest chick around recommends them like nobody's business.  Just don't overdo it or you'll be passing gas more than usual.
