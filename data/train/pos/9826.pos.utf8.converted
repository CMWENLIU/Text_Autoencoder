I love these bars, I'm so glad that Amazon has started carrying them, as it's difficult to find them in sufficient quantities!  I literally eat one or two a day, and though a number of grocery and healthfood stores carry them, they often don't have the full cases I need.<br /><br />The low GI takes a little getting used to at first - you won't get an instant sugar rush like you will from other energy bars, but an hour or two later, you'll still be sated and won't be craving more carbs.<br /><br />Great science, great taste (I prefer the chocolate and chocolate mint, but my wife prefers the berry and lemon), and these make it easy to get the healthy small meals I need to maintain even blood sugar levels (no, I'm not diabetic, but I've lost significant weight and kept it off by switching to a low-GI diet and more frequent, smaller meals).
