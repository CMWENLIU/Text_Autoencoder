This is what you have been looking for unless you grind your own annato seeds!  If you're wanting that yellow rice you've had in Miami, Puerto Rico, Brasil, Cuba or a thousand other Latino restaurants, then look no further. I've been using this product for 30 yrs. and it is the same thing, same quality, same mistake free results. All you need now is that unreal rice, onion, garlic, oregano, pepper, salt recipe I've been using passed down from my dear old Brasilian father....hehe....good luck.
