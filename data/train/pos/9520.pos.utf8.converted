This is my first time experimenting with coconut oil and I am very pleased. I've used it in cookies and brownies and they have turned out amazing. I would that that when I make cookies, I melt the oil instead of creaming it with the sugar like you would butter.<br /><br />I've used it on my hand when they dry and crack and it works very well and smells wonderful.<br /><br />I've also used the oil for a stir-fry and in some basmati rice and both turned out wonderfully.<br /><br />0 Cholesterol is an added bonus to the wonderful taste it adds to dishes.
