It seems the almond & apricot bars were changed when they switched from the 8 pack to the 12 pack so that they added more apricot or sweetness in some way.  I was happy with the less-sweet version, but the taste is still divine. The kids' favorite are the fruit & nut, but this is a close second.  The subscription price beats all the market prices I've seen.
