Excellent product.  I have celiac disease and need to eat gluten free foods.  These onions are gluten free were subsituted for the traditional fried onions in my gluten free green bean casserole.  Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner loved the taste of the casserole.  I highly recommend them to everyone, whether they are "gluten free" or not.
