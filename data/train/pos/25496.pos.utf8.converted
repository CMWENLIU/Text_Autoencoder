This is one of the highest quality dog foods available. Full of nutrients. My 2 1/2 year old lab retriever has done very well on it. His coat is great, he is the ideal weight (labs tend to get chunky if you're not careful), and his stools are solid. Yes, Innova is expensive, but quality food should decrease all the potential health problems (and that's where it gets really expensive) down the road.
