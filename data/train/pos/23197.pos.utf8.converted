I had never heard of "Vernor's Ginger Ale" before my neighbor (originally from Detroit, Mi) recommended it for my daughter's morning sickness. I don't like to over-medicate and, fortunately, my daughter feels the same. I'm not a fan of ginger ale, only having tasted "Canada Dry Ginger Ale", but this stuff is fantastic! It doesn't attack the senses in a harsh way with too much effervescense. It settled my daughter's nausea right away. She loved the taste! Also, knowing that it's one of the country's first homemade carbonated drinks, was also a plus.<br />My daughter, now six months pregnant, starts her day with a Vernor's and always has one in the car, chilled, with her. In case she gets an "attack".<br />Highly recommend "ericfinnegan" as a seller. Shipped quickly, well pckged, and great price!
