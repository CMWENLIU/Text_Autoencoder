This is delicious Shiro Miso paste and has a lovely golden color and a delicate salty flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water, Soybeans, Rice, Salt, Alcohol<br /><br />Since these come in plastic bag type packaging, once I open these up I immediately transfer the contents into one of my lock-n-lock containers to keep fresh (and for easier scooping and storing). Miso will last a loooooooong time in your fridge. I have YET to have miso go 'bad' since this is a fermented, well preserved product already.<br /><br />I will definitely be making a lot of miso soup this winter because it is the perfect comfort food right along with grandma's old-fashioned chicken soup for the soul.<br /><br />Product Origin: Japan
