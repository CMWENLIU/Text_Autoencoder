I was thrilled when they developed Diet Moxie as I usually drink diet soda. This is faithful to the recipe of the regular Moxie, without sacrificing too much of what makes Moxie Moxie. For a very limited product (only really available in scattered locales in New England), I was frankly surprised that they would produce a diet edition, but am very happy that they have. I understand all the reservations the full-octane drinkers have about diet drinks, but if you love Moxie as I do, your avenue is not cut off for enjoying the flavour of it if you need a diet variety.
