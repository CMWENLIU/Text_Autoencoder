Here you have an excellent tasting product that isn't THAT bad for you - even the carb-conscious folks. One serving has 28g of sugars and 2g of fiber - yes, fiber even. That's 4 tablespoons. I, personally, only need 2 so cut that in half, which is the same sugars as a light yogurt.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the best part. If you are like me and have grown addicted to the sweet tasting mochas from any of the number of specialty coffee places out there (Tully's, Peet's, Starbucks, etc.), but you hate paying $4-$5 for your fix, check this out.<br /><br />Buy your favorite coffee (I like Peet's house blend myself) and brew your regular coffee. Yes, you don't need a $1,000 espresso machine to do this. Add 2-4 tablespoons of "Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Mix , Chocolate Mocha" to a large, dry cup (I use 2), pour in your hot coffee. Mix thoroughly. Now, add your favorite creamer (I like Mocha Mix light or nonfat lactose free milk). Stir. And, you have yourself a darn good mocha w/out the espresso machine hassle or the cost.<br /><br />Now, throw it in your favorite spill-free travel coffee cup and head off to work bypassing the unsuspecting grumpies standing in line for 10-minutes waiting to pay $5 for their chocolaty caffeinated beverage. Just smile knowing now you have an extra $100+ per month for something else.<br /><br />Excuse me whilst I take another sip of mine.
