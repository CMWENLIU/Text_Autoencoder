This is not your Good and Plenty sweet chewy licorice.  It's potent, hard drops of real licorice extract.  Yummy and addictive to those who have acquired a taste for it, but shockingly bitter to those expecting little kids' movie theater licorice.  Give it a chance.  You didn't like beer your first time, either.
