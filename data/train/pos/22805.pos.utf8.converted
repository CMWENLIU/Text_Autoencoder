I was making a wedding cake and the bride wanted passion fruit mousse between the layers.I said no problem. Then I tried to locate passion fruit puree in my area(Sacramento).Couldn't find it. Thank goodness for The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley. The passion fruit puree came frozen, thawed beautifuly,and tasted fantastic.What a great product!
