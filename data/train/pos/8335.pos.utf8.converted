Good Seasons Italian dressing is one of the most versatile spices in my rack.  I don't only use it as a salad dressing (though it makes an excellent one), but it's also a lovely topping to toss fresh or steamed vegetables in to add a little bit of flavor.  Also, typically when I am making it into a sald dressing I use extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a tasty vinaigrette that's great on any salad.  There are also usually a number of recipes on any packet you buy giving you a number of new ideas for using this versatile flavoring.
