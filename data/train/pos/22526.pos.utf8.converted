Excellent price for outstanding oil. I won't touch highly processed vegetable oils that are usually rancid from processing additives and high heats, and with lousy omega 6-3 ratios. Rice bran, although not expeller pressed, does maintain a fantastic nutritional profile. No off-putting tastes, fairly high smoke point. Highly recommended.
