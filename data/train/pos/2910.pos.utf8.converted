I remember as kid having malt shakes (back then it came in a 10lb tin from Carnation) and I wanted to relive that experience again but found the quality of Carnation/Nestle was not nearly as good as I remember.<br />A few sites said that Soda Fountain brand blew all the rest out of the water so it thought I would give it a try.<br />Its great in malt shakes and prob the best that I've found and its also very reasonably priced.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose (sugar) which surprised me as most other brands don't so this might be a deterrent for folks with diabetes or a sugar free diet.<br />I prefer to add my own sugar into the shake or get the sweetener from the ice cream but I suppose its OK as its one of the last ingredients on the list next to salt and baking soda.<br />5 star for the quality and great deal available on amazon (especially if you have prime w/free two day shipping)
