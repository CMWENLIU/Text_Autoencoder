I tell every canner I know about this stuff!  I don't know how long it's been around, but if more people knew about it, SureJell, Ball, and other makers of conventional pectin would be out of business.  No more worrying about having to add a ton of sugar to recipes that are already plenty sweet just to get the pectin to set!  And, although it may seem that Pomona's is pricier, it's actually CHEAPER because one box of Pomona's will do multiple batches.<br /><br />So awesome product, but even more amazing is their incredible customer service: I had made a large batch of pepper jelly that didn't set with conventional pectin (shame on me for septupling the recipe!), so I called up Pomona's "Jam Line" and was amazed at the expertise and care of the woman who helped me--she coached me on exactly how to fix my mistake and turn my syrup into the jam it was intended to be.
