I bought this thinking to give it a try, and maybe cut down on the diet snapple that I've been buying at costco.  I just made it today, and I really can't tell a difference!  There's no aftertaste that I can pick up, and it really does have the peach flavor, and no bitterness that tea sometimes has.  I used 4 teaspoons in a 16 oz snapple glass bottle (for that authentic feel, and also because it was handy), and it really tastes the same.  It looks a little darker, but that's fine.  I'm very happy with my purchase, given the money I'll be saving!
