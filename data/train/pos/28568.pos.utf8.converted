I've drunk PG Tips for over 30 years and it is by far the best tea there is.  It is super to find PG Tips more widely available outside the UK.  In fact this is the first time I've seen PG Tips sold in the USA in quantities of more than 80 bags per box.<br /><br />Regarding N. Pierre's negative comment regarding the lack of a string: While it is fine to brew a single cup of tea with these tea bags, they are really intended to go in a tea pot.  If you are looking for "one cup tea bags", try the PG Tips "Envelope-Tagged Tea Bags".  Not only do these come with a string, but they are smaller than the pyramids, making them more appropriate for a single cup.<br /><br />PG Tips tea come highly recommended.  Buy with confidence.
