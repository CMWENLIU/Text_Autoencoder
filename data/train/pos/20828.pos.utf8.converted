First the selection is immense, second this is EXACTLY as described, I sent off my list promptly and received my oddball choices, which I am carefully going through and rating.  There are so many choices, even if you limit yourself to say, unflavored, or decaf.  We especially loved the Green Mountain choices, particularly Lake and Lodge and Our Blend, as well as several of the others.  I'm going to reorder with a new selection, expanding the experiment and repeating a few of the favorites to be sure.  What a fun way to explore our new Keurig coffee machine.  The delivery was prompt, and the communication was delightful.  I could not recommend this product and this experience more highly.
