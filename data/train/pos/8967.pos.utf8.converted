I bought these grains for my boyfriend who needs probiotics but hates the taste of my milk kefir. These grains arrived quickly. As others have noted, the seller is thoughtful. They sent along over a sheet of information on rehydrating and culturing your water kefir. We followed the instructions to the letter, and it took about two weeks for these guys to plump back up. We had placed them in a jar with distilled water, a few drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMUWLK">Liqumins ConcenTrace Trace Mineral Drops, Low Sodium, 8-Ounce Bottle</a>, and some sugar and placed a lid loosely on the jar. Then we set the jar next to our crock-pot, because these microbes like the warmth. A few days ago, we strained the first batch of water kefir, and I'm happy to report it was a success! My fella said it tasted like apple cider. He's happy with the taste, and I'm happy he's getting the probiotics. We have started experimenting with adding various fruits to see how they alter taste, too.<br /><br />Terrific seller. Healthy kefir grains. You can't go wrong.
