This tea blend is excellent and tasty. Usually teas with valerian root are hard to drink as they smell/taste bad; not this blend! The Healing Tree blend has great flavor and will put you to zzzzzzzzzz.<br />Finally a good valerian root blend on the market.<br />We also like The Healing Tree Herbal Blend Echinacea Immune, Caffeine Free Loose Leaf Blend Tea, 2.08-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)It works wonders especially during the cold season.
