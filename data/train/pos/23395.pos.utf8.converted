My baby was born at 34 weeks and was only 4 1/2 lbs. She spent 22 days in the NICU at the hospital, and this was the formula they recommended. By the time she left the hospital, she weighed 5 lbs, 5 oz! Now she is 5 months old and weighs 14 lbs and is healthy and happy as can be!<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that it can be hard on babies' tummies. I had to cut her Neosure amount in half and supplement the other half with Similac's Sensitive formula. Since I started that (at about 2 1/2 months) she has felt MUCH better and she hasn't missed a beat in her weight gain and healthy check-ups!
