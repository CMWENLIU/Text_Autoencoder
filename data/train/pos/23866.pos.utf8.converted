I don't write a lot of reviews, the but one negative one on this product shocked me and I just had to give my own opinion.  Taste is a subjective thing, but I think this product is awesome.  Enough so that I mail order it regularly.  The best thing about the non-vegetarian jerky I grew up with was the tough chewy experience of it.  This jerky manages to recreate that experience and tastes fantastic.  Try it and form your own opinion.
