My whole family loves those cocoa beans; in fact, I am going to order 2 more packages of those once I finish typing this review, because they didn't even last for a week because they ate them all, not leaving me enough to enjoy them.  I love chocolate, but having the processed chocolate, even the extra dark one, leaves me feeling guilty, and, I am not a sugar fan: yes, the dark chocolate bar does still contain sugar. I am used to the cocoa bean taste, since I have had them before, and I used to get them from a chinese store, but, they were packaged in South America. Now they closed the store and they opened Fresh and  Easy store instead, but, they don't carry them. It is best consumed with almonds and walnuts. But, whoever did not have the cocoa beans, need to get used to them first.<br />They were shipped very fast, and were nicely packaged. The beans were whole and fresh; that is the main reason that I am ordering from this vender again, plus they were not so expensive, although in the Chinese store it cost $2.99 for 9 ounces of cocoa beans. Still, it is a good buy if I can't find them in the local stores.<br />I would recommend those beans to anyone who has tried cocoa beans before, or, if you are new to those, why not try the best and the freshest. I will also try to add a video response next time; I don't have any more cocoa beans to record now.
