We have 2 dogs, both mini aussies, 30 and 50 pounds.  We were going crazy letting them in and out, and the last time we went on vacation and had a pet sitter come over, they chewed things all over the house waiting for her to come by to let them out.  So, my wife said, "We have to get a doggie door."  I began researching the field.<br /><br />We didn't want a traditional "flap" door because of the likely HVAC leaks and the potential for animals to enter our home.  So, I decided we needed something with an electronic sensor and lock.  The only other electronic door that has any sales volume is the Pet Safe door, but reviews for it were not at all favorable.  That left the High Tech Power Pet door as the only good option.  We had to buy a new patio door to install it (because our existing one was all glass), but decided it was worth it based on reviews.<br /><br />The reviews are correct (you can read many, many at[...]). This is the best solution for anyone wanting to let their pet out when it wants to go out.  Our dogs learned immediately how to use it.  Now we can go to bed at night knowing that if Pepper or Dusty want out, they can go out.  And squirrels, etc. won't be able to get in.  The only problem is our two cats feel left out.  But they lose their collars, and the sensors are expensive.<br /><br />The only negative is the sensor.  I know we are going to have to buy more of these, and at $35 a shot, that is going to add up.  Also, they come with a simple thin strap that goes around your pet's neck.  There is no easy way to attach it to a traditional collar.  They should make an attachment that permits this.  The good news on sensors is they are light weight. They are also directional, so if your pet walks by the door but doesn't face it, the door most likely will not open.  If your pet stands there in front of the door, it will stay open, waiting for the pet to go through.  It's basically a Star Trek door for your pet.<br /><br />The best part was Amazon Prime.  Not only was the door cheaper than ANY PLACE else, we got it in 2 days.  I love Amazon Prime!
