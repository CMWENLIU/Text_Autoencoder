I used to snack on this rather than eating things like cookies, donuts, and other sweets.  Imagine my disappointment when all the grocery stores I went to quit carrying it.  As soon as I saw it here I placed my first order.  I've reordered it twice already.  It's sweet but not not overly sweet like cereals like "Super Sugar Crisp" or "Froot Loops" (I never have liked Froot Loops).  Rice Krispies Treats cereal tastes just like the name says.
