This bone is the tops and best of all not expensive.  I have bought many different toys for my dog and he destroys them all within a few days.  This bone is great because it has actually lasted over two weeks and is still going strong.  The ends are getting chewed up but at a very slow pace.  My guess is this will easily last a month or two, if not longer.  My dog also absolutely loves chewing on this.  If he is inside sitting around this bone is in his mouth being chewed.  That is why I am so surprised it has lasted this long.  Usually if my dog chews something for a whole day it would be in a million pieces.  The only other toy that has been able to last this long is a king size kong, but my dog won't even look at it twice unless it is packed with treats.
