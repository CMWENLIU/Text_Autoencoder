The flavor and quality are excellent.  It is not too strong of a coconut flavor so it works in many foods.  The price was so low compared to other brands.  I almost gave up using coconut oil because it was becoming three times the price of organic butter (the only two "safe" high-heat cooking oils according to my Naturopathic Doctors).  After shipping it is just a bit more than organic butter!  Now my 10-year-old son makes popcorn with half coconut oil and half butter that exceeds theater popcorn!  My 12-year-old daughter says it tastes great and I have used it as the only moisturizer on my face for two years in our hot, dry climate.  I am a satisfied customer!
