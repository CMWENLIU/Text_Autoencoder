When I first tried Fazer chocolate, a friend from Finland sent it to me.  I was skeptic about it being the "best in the world", but after trying it, every other chocolate out there is a poor subsitute! Fazer chocolate is the best out there period.  Once you try it, you probably won't want to eat any other chocolate, it will only be fazer.
