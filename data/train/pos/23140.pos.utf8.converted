I love the product but I would love it even more if my cans did not come bent into half-moon shapes.  Six of the 12 cans are severely beat up and make me wonder how bad the shelf life of my product has been affected by the weakening of the can's structure.<br /><br />I am VERY displeased by the condition in which this package arrived.<br /><br />edit:<br />I complained to Amazon that my cans were so bent that they could not even stand on their own and had to be lain on their sides, and they immediately shipped me a replacement order overnight.<br /><br />I now have no complaints as the order came in perfect condition.  I am extremely satisfied with this item!
