I'm just getting into the whole plank cooking thing, and so far I'm really enjoying it. It is a great way to give a mild, woody flavor to fish.<br /><br />These are the thicker planks, which are nicer than the considerably thinner type. The thinner ones are called disposable because they can really only be used once (maybe twice, but don't bet on it).<br /><br />Another fun thing to try is grilling papers. They are really thin slices of wood that you wrap completely around the fish. It holds the moisture in and gives more of a steamed effect.<br /><br />This same company also makes square planks that are intended to be served on individual plates for serving after cooking.
