This product will give you the crispiest chicken, fries, onion rings and the most delicious country fried steak. The flakes are made of rice and have a much heavier texture than just plain breadcrumbs, so it sticks better to food and gets 10 times crispier. You use it the same way you'd use regular breadcrumbs.  Because it has so much more volume than regular breadcrumbs, you can also use it as a topping for casseroles.  It's also the perfect filler to add when preparing a meatloaf. It's the only breadcrumbs I use!!
