This Twinings Chai Tea Latte is soooo delicious.  This tea is to be used with a Tassimo single-serve coffee maker.  Included in the package are milk t-discs, and chai tea t-discs.  Use one of each to make a cup of Chai Tea Latte.  Deliciously spicy: cloves and cinnamon and ginger and cardamom, with a bit of sucralose for sweetness.  The milk t-disc contains a bit of sugar as well.  Very good!
