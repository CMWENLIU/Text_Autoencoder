I have been a long time devotee of White Truffle oils, but somehow I had been out of the gourmet loop, unaware of the growing popularity of Black Truffle Sea Salt.  My curiosity was piqued, when I saw an Iron Chef using it on the Food Network, and, then by the outstanding reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Well, thanks to ALL, unknowingly complicit in leading me astray, I now have an expensive habit; but don't we all deserve to indulge ourselves, once in a while?  Since this is my first purchase, I can't make comparisons, but I can say this, the fragrance and taste are moderately strong for BT infusion, when you consider the contrast in pricing for this product, over others.  It's a great entry point for those without much experience with Truffles, white, or black, to give it a try. Be careful though, you'll likely be hooked, too.<br /><br />Since it takes such a small amount of product to enhance flavor, the 5.5 oz supply should last a fairly long time. The container is nice enough to leave on display. It has a pop-up, sprinkle lid, for convenience. The container does not offer a percentage, nor does the website, so I'm not sure if this Fusion brand is 10%, or not, as some other brands' advertise. So on my next purchase, I will opt for one that designates such, just for comparison.<br /><br />I consider flavor enhancers, such as Truffles, to be a diet aide, when watching calories. If you feel you are having something delectable, it heightens the sense of satisfaction---that somehow your sacrifices are lessened.  For example, I was blown away by the taste of a simple boiled egg, with a dusting of BTSS---and, vegetables reach new heights, as well. And, don't get me started on, plain pasta, with only a little Truffle oil, and sprinkle of BTSS; it's decadent. Actually, I think I could take a chunk of Iceberg lettuce, give it a sprinkle, and feel I was having a treat.<br /><br />If you've not yet ventured into BTSS, give it a whirl. I doubt you will be disappointed.
