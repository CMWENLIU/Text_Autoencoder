Got it in less than a day. Product itself was good -- not broken up at all even though they are crackers and getting packaged around everywhere. Really fills you up and gets your daily dose of fiber! Good mixed with cereal and milk, or with some jam.<br /><br />REMEMBER TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER, or else you'll get the opposite of the intended effect....
