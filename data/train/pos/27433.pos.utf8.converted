I find it ironic after reading this that someone mentioned air force and Germany.  As, growing up that is where we got used to the greatness of German candy.  If you believe America was the king then you missing out.  Most fond memory was in Germany going down to the lake with my german coinage.  Was a small little shop there and would get 3 different types of gummies(twin-cherries,frogs,and cola bottles).  Hardest thing to find and now and if you do find its alot for just small portions.  If I had the money I would buy 20 of these.  Hope everyone who gets them enjoy them and maybe remember great memories!
