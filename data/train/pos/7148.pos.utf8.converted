I have skim dry milk at my house and I use it a lot for cooking (especially for making fake "quiches") but 2 things compelled me to try this full fat whole dry milk: 1)One of my friends said he used to eat this stuff out of the can and that it was delicious (at that time my husband and I thought he was crazy) 2)One of my baking recipes called for milk powder... and well, skim dry milk tastes really gross so I wanted to try something more delicious.  So I ordered the smaller cans of this Nido milk even though it was more expensive than the big cans. First thing I did when I got home was open the can and grabbed a spoon. So how good can this thing be anyway? OH WOW. It seriously tasted like milk candy. And there wasn't even any added sugar.  I gave a spoonful to my husband and he thought it tasted like candy too! Now I think I need to order more b/c I just keep eating it out of the can... sigh, what am I going to do when I need it for baking?
