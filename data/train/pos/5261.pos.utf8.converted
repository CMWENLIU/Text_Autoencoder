...Then you've never been on a diet in the winter time.  If the only asparagus out there was the fresh kind, I'd just go into withdrawal.  Granted, the canned spears taste absolutely NOTHING like the fresh, but that's okay.  They still have virtually no calories; they're a natural diuretic; they taste good -- and faintly asparagus-like.  The texture is completely different -- but again, just think of it as a separate kind of vegg.<br /><br />good cold out of the can with a little balsamic vinegar; and actually, good in soup when you cut them up.  Some relative of mine used Green Giant asparagus for a baked dish that was a lot like potatoes au gratin -- but with GG asparagus instead of potatoes.  Kind of a green, gooey, messy thing, but the flavor was nice.  I suspect that if you sub'd 2% sharp cheddar cheese, 1% milk, and used a bit of Egg Beaters instead of real eggs, it would be a decent low-cal quicky meal.<br /><br />A good, utilitarian food.  Fresh is always better -- but with our 110-in-the-shade summers -- fresh is about 1 week in May.
