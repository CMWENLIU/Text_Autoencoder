Caf&eacute; Altura's Biodynamic French Roast is a rich, full-bodied coffee grown in Chiapas, Mexico.  The beans are oily and fragrant, and produce an exceptionally smooth cup of coffee.<br /><br />Living on a small agricultural island where many of the local farms practice varying degrees of sustained agriculture, I find it an added benefit to be able to support biodynamic farming efforts with my purchase of an excellent cup of coffee.  As several of the other reviewers here have pointed out, you're not likely to find better coffee or a better value.
