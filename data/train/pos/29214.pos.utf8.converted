Who on earth would ever think to eat these things? Black soy beans? Seriously? Relax, they are just about the best canned beans out there. Firm and tender, they are high in protein and fiber and VERY low in carbohydrates (something other beans are loaded with). This picky eater thinks they TASTE GOOD! Just give 'em a good rinse with water before use. I make chili with them, a fabulous three bean salad and there is nothing better than mashing some up and sauteing them with a little garlic in a splash of olive oil (huevos rancheros, anyone?) Although you can find these (if you're looking for them) in health food stores, they are virtually absent from main stream grocery stores. Why bother with any of that when you can get 'em here at the best price (especially if you can use Super Saver Shipping)
