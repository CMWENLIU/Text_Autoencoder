So last night I made a key lime pie with a graham cracker crust.  I served it to my non-gf significant other, and guess what? He had no idea it was gluten free.  And guess what else?  He ate the ENTIRE PIE!!!  The crust was delicious - perfect taste, perfect texture, in a word: perfect.  It's hard to find these on the store shelves where I live, and they appear to be out of stock frequently on Amazon...frustrating for a constantly-cooking woman like me. I'm picky about gluten free foods, and honestly there are other Kinnikinnick gf products I truly despise.  These, however, will become a staple on my shelf - the Graham Style Crumbs with STYLE!
