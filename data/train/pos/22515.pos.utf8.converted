I purchased this product for much cheaper from diapers.com. It is wonderful. Unlike another reviewer, I like that fact that it doesn't prepare a large portion. I don't have a lot of freezer space and I like to offer my daughter a variety of foods, so, making a pound of sweet potatos at one time would do me no good. I rather prepare a few carrots, a few apples and oranges, and other small recipes, than have a whole lot of one thing. It's easy to clean and saves you time on having to clean out a steamer, and processor. I LOVE IT! ALSO, IT IS BPA-FREE!!
