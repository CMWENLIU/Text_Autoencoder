I'm able to purchase this in my local large chain grocery store, right by the Quaker brands.  YES it takes longer to cook but you can pre-cook it and keep it in the fridge, covered, for 5 days!  Just re-heat when needed!  It is SO much healthier AND tastier!  If you're not going to buy the healthier stuff for yourself, DO IT FOR YOUR KIDS! I did look into purchasing the import brands but it is TWICE the cost!!  I compared the nutritional value and it is virtually the same! Hodgkins Mill had 0.5g of saturated fat compared to McCanns -0-, but Hodgkins had 10% of daily iron compared to their 6%.  So, in the end the good and the bad kind of balanced out.  So come on people, feed your family the healthy stuff and keep our dollars in the USA rather than sending it off to another country!
