I couldn't wait to get my package of these little seeds because of the health benefit they provide and plus I am trying to lose some weight. I've only tried them once but they made a lovely pudding.<br />1/2 cup coconut milk<br />2 tsbp chia seeds<br />1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (i used amazing grass chocolate powder 'cause it's all I had)<br />1 tablespoon cinnamon<br />1 tablespoon honey<br /><br />mix well in a container or small bowl, making sure to incorporate the cocoa powder.<br />Cover and place on a counter for about 30 minutes, stirring a few times.<br /><br />It will turn into a wonderful gelatin-esque yummy dessert!
