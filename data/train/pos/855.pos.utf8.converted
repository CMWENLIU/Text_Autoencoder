At my age, I can't be eating bacon and eggs everyday unless I want to speed up a trip to the hospital.  Eating oatmeal is a great thing to eat for breakfast because there's a lot of research proving it's heart healthy.<br /><br />The problem is, I don't have enough time in the morning to stand over a stove and cook some oatmeal. However, with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09BQQ">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Regular, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>, problem solved!! I just empty three of these packet in a bowl, add water, and pop it in the microwave for a minute.  Then I add some sugar and some milk and I'm good to go.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal and are like me and don't have a lot of time for preparation- give it a try!
