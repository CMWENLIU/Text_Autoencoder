We love eating waffles at our house, & have traditionally made belgium style waffles from scratch.  A friend introduced us to Carbon's Golden Malted, touting the quality of the waffles it made.  I was skeptical, but definitely agreed after tasting our 1st batch.  The mix makes light and fluffy waffles without the fuss of whipping eggs and folding batter.  The malt in the flour adds a welcome "nutty" taste as well.  This product has never failed us.
