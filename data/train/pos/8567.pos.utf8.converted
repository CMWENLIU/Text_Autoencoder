I finally bought the 6 pack of 24 of this tea as it is one of my favorite Tazo black teas on Amazon. They are really convenient to use and easy to take along in tea bag form. I also get the loose leaf version at (which is bolder) at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a tin. It is a nice mixed flavor of English Breakfast (Twinings brand is best for English Breakfast in my opinion) and ever so slightly Earl Grey and other black teas. The Tazo Awake black tea is not as strong as some but bold in flavor or aroma, the loose leaf version by Tazo is even more so. I don't drink caffeine in the form of sodas or coffee but I do drink lots of tea and I don't ever feel wired or caffeine'd out after a few cups of tea each day. Tazo has impressed with both their loose leaf and tea bag versions. Seep it long enough to get the bold color, flavor and aroma but don't over do it as the tea will have bitterness if you leave it seeping too long.
