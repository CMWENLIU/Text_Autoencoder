ORVILLE REDENBACHER BUTTERY SALT & CRACKED PEPPER MICROWAVE POPCORN<br /><br />I was at a friend's home for dinner with the girls.  We were all admiring her new kitchen cupboards and when I looked inside to see how cool they were -- and yes, just being nosey! -- I noticed this new OR BUTTERY SALT & CRACKED PEPPER popcorn!  Wow, Brenda gave me a bag and I was blown away!<br /><br />If you like GOOD popcorn that is not dry, has a distinct, different flavor, and goes down easy with diet-Coke, ice water, or red wine, this is the popcorn for you!<br /><br />EVERYONE I know who has tried this absolutely loves it!  Get some, nuke some, enjoy some.  You will be hooked!  YUM!<br /><br />Thank you!!!!<br /><br />Pam
