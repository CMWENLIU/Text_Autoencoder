I bought this Baking Soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week.  They say that teeth become noticeably whiter.<br />But you've to to be very gentle while brushing and use "soft" type tooth brush.  I did notice a difference.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that when Baking Soda was mixed with water, the PH indicator showed the highest level (almost 8.5-9 on the chart).<br />This may explain why Baking Soda is so effective to fight germs.<br /><br />It's a good product.
