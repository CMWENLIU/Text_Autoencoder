These are Turkish apricots that differ from varieties found in the U.S.  Dried Turkish apricots are moister and thicker and have a somewhat tangy taste.  Since these apricots are unsulphured, they are brown.  (Sulphur is used manly to make fruits look more attractive.  Sulphured apricots are yellow, just as sulphured "golden" raisins are.)<br /><br />Any bag of dried fruit (organic or not) will most likely have a piece or two that is drier and tougher than the rest. Made in Nature is no different.<br /><br />I find the fruit to be mostly sweet and chewy.  This is a good mid-day snack.  Dried apricots can also be finely chopped and cooked with oatmeal.  The reasealable bags are terrific. I will continue to purchase these as the price is lower than health food stores and shipping is free on orders of $25 and up.
