I ordered this through Amazon because it was such a good bargain. I can't even find the muesli at any of my usual stores here in San Antonio, so I was excited to find Amazon could ship it out. I anticipated it would be a good product, and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It's not overly sweet; the dates and raisins take care of any sugar cravings you might have, but they're not so sweet that you feel like you're getting a kids' breakfast cereal. Instead, what you get is a very nutty flavor enhanced by a delicate sort of sweetness. If you want more sweetness, I suggest you add a dollop of honey. That would just put this over the top. I guess you could also use some artificial sweetener, but I'd not do that. Why mess up a wonderful "natural" product with something artificial like aspartame or the like? Yuk.<br /><br />I love the addition of sunflower seeds and flax, and the oats are especially healthy choices for this mix. YOu can eat this hot or cold, with cold being my preferred mode, but I like the hot version, too. I make mine with evaporated skim milk, which allows for a richer milk flavor without any of the fat. It's a hearty breakfast food, but I think you could also use it for dinner on especially cold evenings when you want something that will "stick to your ribs" and be all-around healthy as well. Oats--good for your heart. Flax--ditto. Sunflower seeds--good source of protein, I think. Dates and raisins--can't go wrong there, but don't ask me to pinpoint a body part they particularly benefit. Heh. Let's see--lots of whole grains here, so you will get your servings of the stuff that will keep you healthy, happy, and "reglar." :-)<br /><br />I love that this is so healthy a food and that it also tastes great!<br /><br />I plan to order more Bob's Red Mill products as a result of my good experience with this product.
