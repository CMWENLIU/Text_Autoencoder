I just recently started looking into super foods and a way to get more healthy in the way I eat. About a year ago my food needs and wants completely changed. I started to eat more vegetables and fruits but noticed its actually pretty expensive to buy those things and the rate they can go bad is very quick.<br /><br />I bought my first order of Green superfood and i must say im pretty impressed out of the box. I made my first glass and the taste is not bad at all. I Drink alot of water so i mixed it in with a tall glass of water and im drinking it as i type this. The taste is really not bad at all, tastes a bit earthy but if you are used to drinking green tea or any other earthy blends this will be know different.<br /><br />Worth the try, and i will be purchasing more when this is done.<br />Ill redo the review when I use it for a while and see if there are any benefits.
