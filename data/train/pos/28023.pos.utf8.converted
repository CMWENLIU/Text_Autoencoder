For me, Ceylon is always much more enjoyable in the mornings than English or other so-called Breakfast teas. It has much more taste and flavor. Out of Ceylon teas, I particularly enjoy Twinings Ceylon Orange Pekoe. It has nice big leaves and great golden color. Before I was buying this tea at grocery stores tin by tin (which is expensive as only "fancy" stores sell it) and I'm glad I discovered the package deal here.
