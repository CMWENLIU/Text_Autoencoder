For years I couldn't really drink coffee without suffering some kind of upset stomach, be it cramps, nausea what have you.  I discovered The Bean at Coachella this past April, and I have to say that this is a coffee saver for me!  The low acid/antioxidant mix is exactly what I needed.  I can now enjoy coffee again, without the nasty stomach side effects.  If you have ever suffered from the same symptoms due to coffee, you might want to try this brand.  The Hawaiian Hazelnut is precisely the blend I usually drink, so I am thrilled that the Bean has introduced it.  I highly recommend it!
