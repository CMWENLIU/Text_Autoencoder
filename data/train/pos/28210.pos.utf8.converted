I've been using Minis by Splenda for years.  For some reason they have become impossible to find in the grocery stores where I live, which is why I'm shopping for them here.  Each packet is equivalent to 1/2 packet of Splenda which is why I like the Minis; plus it's impossible to measure out 1/2 a packet. One packet is too much for my morning coffee.  The packaging is also for great for travel.
