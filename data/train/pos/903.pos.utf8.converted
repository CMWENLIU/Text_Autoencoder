Delicious.  I had to tell you.  This is my first time I've taken time to review a product<br />and I felt like I HAD to, after such a bad review.  ALL of the Blue Sky Free products are<br />very tasty (as far as diet drinks go).  I drank diet drinks for years and gave them up<br />when I found out how toxic the artificial sweeteners were.<br /><br />I kept wondering why someone didn't come out with a diet soda made with Stevia (since<br />it's totally natural and healthy).  Finally, a few makers did.  I've tried several and<br />Blue Sky Free tastes the best to me.<br /><br />It is expensive and hardly ever goes on sale--but when it does, I grab all I can!
