I am the newest fan of the BLK water.  I am uncertain what water the other people are drinking but certainly they have an air for the ridiculously exaggerated.  The BLK water is very clean tasting and yes it has faint taste of minerals but nothing like what some of the haters have posted.  It does NOT taste like 1. motor oil 2. old stump water, or any other absurd examples posted.  Yes the water is completely black but that is about it.  I find it chic looking in fact and the fact that it normalizes my pH levels are the plus plus and worth buying factor.  The price point is also nothing sticker shocking.  It is what you would pay for any other specialty water available on the market.  I intend on continuing to buy BLK water and take in the benefits of the dark side.  As for the folks with some over the top gnarly reviews, please stop with the lies.
