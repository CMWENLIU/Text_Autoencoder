As someone wrote earlier, these are thinner, less sweet, and drier, but welcome all the same to those of us who miss our domestic raisin biscuits. This isn't to say that Garibaldis are stale or somehow inferior in any way, because they aren't. Be advised, however. Each package contains two biscuits about 2 5/8" wide by 7 1/2" long. At that size, and for this price, you may as well order a case; it's cheaper and you won't run out before you get your nostalgia fix. I'm going to order a case right now...
