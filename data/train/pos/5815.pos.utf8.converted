I have been making bread machine bread for about four years now.  Until recently I'd been using the little brown jars of Fleischmann's or Red Star bread machine yeast because I thought that was all there was.  Then my local markets stopped carrying that variety.  The little packets are way too expensive and I had a sad experience with cratered loaves and uneven texture when one cookbook assured me that active dry yeast would work fine with bread machines.<br /><br />This yeast is amazing.  Once I figured out the exact amount to use with my machine I've been getting beautifully rounded, fine textured whole wheat loaves every single time. It's stunningly better than the stuff you buy in the grocery store.  I've been following the other reviewers' advice on how to store and keep the yeast, since I think I've got enough for several years.  I wasn't quite clear on how much yeast I was buying here.  One pound seemed a better deal than the grocery stores offer.  But four pounds . . . it's practically free.
