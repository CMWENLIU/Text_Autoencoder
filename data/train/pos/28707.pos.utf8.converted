Just to respond to the previous review, consumers should know that mussels in escabache means that they were cooked and then covered in a vinegared sauce to preserve them. The taste is indeed tangy and perhaps is acquired (I inhaled these when I was in Spain). Consider them tapas, and eat them on crusty bread with some wine or beer.
