These pistachios were the cheapest I could find, so I didn't expect much as far as taste... But was I wrong.  These are probably the best I have ever tasted, and I am a pistachio nut... Haha, so I know good pistachios.  In short, this company will send you the best pistachios you've ever had for the least amount of money you've ever paid.  Highly recommended.
