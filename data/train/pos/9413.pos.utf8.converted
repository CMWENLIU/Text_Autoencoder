It takes me about 10 to 15 minutes finish one of these small, but complex bars. Definitely satisfying.<br /><br />I took my box cautiously from my weight-loss facilitor, who warned that while most program participants loved them, some reported too close a similarity to "bird seed."  I'm squarely in the "loved them" camp.  I've tried two varieties, the organic chocolate & the goji berries. Both were lightly sweetened, barely salted & packed with flavor.  A fan of granola or other nutty bars, will find these similarly enjoyable with a longer-lasting sense of fullness following consumption.<br /><br />Sticking to a low-carb diet is significantly helped by the addition of this snack.  I use it in the mornings w/a bottle of water to get me going, and I have another in the afternoon or evening.  Great for a quick movie snack when I'm tempted by the smell of the surrounding popcorn, or at the office to build resistance to an endless parade of sweet treats.<br /><br />pros: individually wrapped, portable, filling, tasty, satifies sweet & salt cravings<br />cons: crumbles easily, relatively expensive
