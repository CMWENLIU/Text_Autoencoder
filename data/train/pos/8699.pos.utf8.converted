I bought a bottle of this because I found the concept of bacon-favored syrup hilarious.  Imagine my surprise, then, when it actually turned out to be very tasty.  It's salty, sweet, and smoky all at once, and the bacon flavor itself comes through very strongly without tasting the least bit fake.  The brown-sugary sweetness surprised me, but it works very well.  A little goes a long way, too - just a few drops add a very pleasant bacon flavor to a cup of coffee.  I'll be buying this again.
