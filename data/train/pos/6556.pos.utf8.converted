I fell in love with Indian Tonic Water when in the UK a few years ago.  Not being able to afford having it shipped from the UK, I tried this.  It. Is. Amazing.  Granted, it'll cost you more than a liter bottle of Schweppes and/or Canada Dry tonic water, but it is completely worth it.  Tonic water by itself is now a tasty alternative.  And what it does for my gin and tonics is AH-mazing.<br /><br />I fully recommend you trying this drink for your special event - and then you'll find yourself hoarding bottles for daily use.
