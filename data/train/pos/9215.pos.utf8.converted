well, most likely you will have already tried these before you order them in bulk, so my guess is you already know the magic that lies within those foily pink packages! i almost dont want to tell everyone how good they are for fear that there may be a shortage or something. seriously, i dont know why these little rings of sugar have captured my sweet tooth, but they are just plain tasty good and fun to chew. i used to eat a bag this size every day, but have cut back recently because of finances...but now, i have bulk from amazon! and with prime i get em in two days or less...which is less time than it would take me to get to a market to find them...they're not avail in every store like the five flavors...so do yourself right and order em here. best price and fastest shipping!<br /><br />!
