I am taking flaxseed and this stuff is the best. It is rich in fiber and omega-3 fats, which is a good thing. Just put some of this on top of any of your hot meals and it will give you the best dietary fiber you can buy. It has a robust, nutty flavor which taste great, especially if you put it in your cereal.<br /><br />Try it...you'll like it!
