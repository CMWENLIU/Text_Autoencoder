I actually don't like eating tapioca pudding normally, but it does make an excellent thickener for fruit pies (about 3 heaping tablespoons is what I use). Has worked well in raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, and mixed berry (combination of those three) so far for me. It certainly is far superior to having the juice run all over when you cut into a raspberry pie made out of juicy frozen berries. I got a several year supply during one of the big discount specials on Kraft stuff about a month ago (along with a very large supply of Shake 'n Bake for chicken & pork at the same time).
