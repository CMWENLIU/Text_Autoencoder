this is the only kind of seasoning I use for my soy tacos.  I stopped buying the Del Taco flavoring when I read that it contains msg.  Just to give you an idea of my tastes, I loved the del taco seasonings, so Simply Organic is a great alternative that tastes just as good, without the side effects of msg.
