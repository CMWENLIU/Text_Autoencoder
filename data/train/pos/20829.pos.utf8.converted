After I submitted my order, I contacted the company right away through Amazon with my flavor requests.  They sent me an acknowledgment message back, and I received my order with all the correct flavors within a few days.  My husband and I got 2 of each flavor we wanted so we could both try them all.  The price is a bit higher than other k-cup selections--especially since they're not eligible for Prime free shipping--but I think it's definitely the best way to try the k-cup flavors you want without getting a bunch that you won't use.  From that perspective you might actually be saving money by not wasting product.  I'll definitely get this sampler again!
