I've tried them all, believe me.  Most are just too gritty. But Kinnikinnick's GF Montana chocolate chip cookies taste good. They have that real brown sugar flavor.  Crisp but not gritty at all.  No weird aftertaste.  These are my #1 top choice to buy when I can find them. I am glad Amazon has decided to carry them.  Wild Oats GF mini-chocolate chip cookies are good too, but not AS good as these.
