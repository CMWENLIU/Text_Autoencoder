This is one of three products we rotate daily for our dog to keep her teeth and breath clean.  We have been using this approach for almost eight years, and her teeth have remained very healthy and her breath has never been a problem.<br /><br />Amazon provided these chews for a better price that we had gotten at the vets, and we didn't have to drive there to receive them (or find out we'd have to come back as her size was currently unavailable).
