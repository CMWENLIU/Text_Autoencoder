Gosh, I hate to admit it but I love this stuff. Spam is one of my guilty little pleasures in life.<br /><br />I get hungry late at night and a fried Spam sandwich absolutely hits the spot.  I like to cook it until the edges sort of curl and get just a bit brown, add horseradish and mustard and tuck-in.<br /><br />I also always carry cans of this when I am camping.  It is fast and easy to prepare and fills you up with a minimum of hassle.<br /><br />As to the ways of preparing this stuff...well, that is only limited by your imagination.  There are entire cookbooks devoted to the preparation of Spam dishes.<br /><br />Now this is not something I eat every day.  This is not something that is classified as a health food.  But I really do not care about that and I have absolutely no fear of the food police what-so-ever...hey, I buy fast food from time to time and actually eat it public without slinking home out of sight of the food critics.<br /><br />This is good stuff folks...eat it and enjoy.
