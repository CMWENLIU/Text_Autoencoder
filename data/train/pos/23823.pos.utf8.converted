You know i read alot of the negitave reviews for this product, ans notice alot of people refer to it as a small pot ect, I am gathering this is typical amricanism of food product, The pot makes easily 3 glasses when i say glasses i mean traditional tea size not 16oz american size. Sadly the americanism of food is prevelant in everything, DO you know why in europe their cooking can be soo rich and creamy, Because they exercise PORTION controll, Tea is traditionally a intimate drink involving enjoying the aroma and sipping from a small glass with no handles, Anyone here know why NO handles? Because those that say the pot is too hot to handle obviouslly dont. IF IT IS TO HOT TO HOLD IT IS TOO HOT TO DRINK, that statement has only existed for thousands of years.<br /><br />Now this all aside i prefer republic of tea for the bags, never tried their flowering.<br /><br />But i say if you are looking for good tea and drink in a traditional sense then this is a product for you,
