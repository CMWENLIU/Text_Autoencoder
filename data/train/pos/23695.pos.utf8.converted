this stuff did not do much to help me make more milk. it did however make my boobs look bigger. also me and my daughter smelled like maple syrup. i could even smell it when i went to restroom. if i wiped under my arms, i smelled maple syrup. i took 4 capsules every 8 hours. i used the gnc fenugreek though. i am waiting on my mother's milk tea to come in the mail. i will be writing a review on that when i get it. hope that works better.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I have noticed that when I take fenugreek, or drink mother's milk tea, my daughter gets baby acne(really small cluster of bumps on her back and legs, nothing too scary). I also noticed that when I take less fenugreek pills with mother's milk tea, it does increase my supply. it takes about 1-2 days to increase it. i would go from 3 1/2( 1 1/2on the right and 2 on the left) ounces in one session all together from both breasts. to filling a 4 ounce bottle almost to the top in one session. this makes me very happy. the only problem is that it still gives my daughter baby acne, so i use every now and then. HOPE THAT HELPS!!!
