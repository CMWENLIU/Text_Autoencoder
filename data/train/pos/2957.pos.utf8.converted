I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days.  Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the "drop" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right?
