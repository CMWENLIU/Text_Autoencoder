I purchased these sunflower seeds from Living Whole Foods, and was worried about how many seeds would actually sprout when  used in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GHUD86">Easy Sprout Sprouter</a>, since I'd read many reviews on other sunflower seeds sold on Amazon saying that they need to be germinated in soil, etc., and that in most cases, they had a terribly low germination rate.  Still, I figured I'd bite the bullet and just try it out.  When the seeds arrived, I saw that the package they came in also said they needed to be germinated in soil.  I figured I'd still give it a go, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that after an 8 hour soak in water, and then twice daily quick (5-15 minute) soaks, I had a nice set of small sunflower sprouts within a couple days.  I'd estimate somewhere around an 80% germination rate, though I really wasn't counting.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for sunflower seeds for sprouting purposes in your regular sprouter, these do seem to work.<br /><br />And yes, the seeds taste quite yummy all by themselves, if you're impatient...
