I am currently drinking my second can of Zevia Root Beer, having managed to sneak it away from my three kids.  It's got a rich, full flavor and plenty of fizz--all our cans did.<br /><br />I left a fuller review on their Cola entry, but everything I said there stands for this variety, as well.  It's just as good as either sugar-full or sugar-free brands, but is not bad for you, and even good for you because of the stevia, which can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />Makes a killer float, too, with my own homemade sugar-free artificial sweetener-free ice cream.
