I grew up in Sri Lanka and had the opportunity to enjoy different types of tea. Since I moved a while ago I have had this shipped to me from Sri Lanka and I've enjoyed every cup. I go through about 3-4 cups every day and I can't say anything bad about them. I know I can't expect the perfect cup of tea that I used to have in Sri Lanka but this brings back memories.<br /> If you like pure tea with no additives this is the one for you. I hate those "flavored" tea sold at stores but this always puts a smile on my face.
