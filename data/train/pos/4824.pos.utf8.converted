i switched to this whole herb concentrate because i didn't like the idea of a super refined white product that was missing all of the plant's other constituents and medicinal properties.  i use it every day in my smoothies.  blended with yogurt or coconut milk and vanilla i find it hard to distinguish from sugar.  in other recipes, i find it sometimes useful to mix with a bit of honey to balance the flavor.  stevia doesn't lend itself well to baking, so i go without in those cases.
