I ordered this grain because I am following the Ultra Metabolism 21 day detox phase...ok, stop the eye rolling. It's basically about removing potential allergens (diary, etc.) and cleansing yourself from processed foods -any sugar, hydrogenated oils, white flour...and although I dont eat that stuff in general, it's amazing how many "all natural" foods have high fructose corn syrup (many Marie's dressings, etc.)<br /><br />Anywho- my amaranth arrived quickly but one bag had burst open - the packaging was a joke! Amazon shrinkwraps books so they sre sealed air-tight, yet bags of grain soar freely in their big Amazon box, begging to explode.<br /><br />The other bags remained in tact - the stench from the grain takes getting used to. It smells swampy to me, but my sister says that's just "earthy."<br /><br />It's a complete grain and it cooks up nicely as a hot cereal - and it pops like popcorn, too.
