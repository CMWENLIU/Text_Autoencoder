i bought these last summer, and absolutely loved them because i never got a bite when i used it (i usually use 2 if i'm scantily clad). i live in texas, and mosquitoes LOVE to bite me. i'm slightly allergic, and the bites stay around for weeks, so it was such a relief to find this product. i like it much more than the spray bottle because i feel i can cover all of my skin.<br />i prefer it to the off! brand of wipes because i like the smell better. this has less DEET than the 'off! deep woods' one, but i really dislike the super-strong smell of that one, and for normal use, 7% DEET is plenty.<br />if you are in the woods, though, i would recommend products with more DEET. i use this for outdoor festivals and parties at night.
