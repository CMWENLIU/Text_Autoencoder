I did some research on coca tea before I ordered this. I am a severe asthmatic and I get extremely fatigued. Coca tea is supposed to help blood oxygen absorption at high altitudes, so I figured it would also work at low altitudes. I brewed a pot with two tea bags and found that it was good for four cups (I put the rest in the fridge). Within twenty minutes I felt the energizing effect, and it tapered off somewhat over the hours, but helped me keep a nice energy level going for most of the day, and I drank less coffee. I slept like a baby at night.<br />The tea is the real deal and is of high quality.
