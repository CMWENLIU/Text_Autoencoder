Ok, this mint is very strong. I got these for desk candy and got very polarized reviews from customers. Some loved them, but most seemed to prefer mints that were just mostly colored sugar. Why 5 stars for me? I put one in a hot cup of tea and WOW! Mind you it is being diluted in about 10 ounces, but the pure mint really gives a cup of tea a refreshing coolness. I will keep getting them for this alone.
