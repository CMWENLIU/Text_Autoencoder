I have several varieties of Artisan salts and this one is my favorite.  It is naturally smoked over hickory wood, which is the most desired wood for smoking food in the Midwest.  It is not produced by using liquid smoke like some other brands.  Upon opening the container the first time, I thought the smokiness was a little overwhelming, but when used, I found it to be perfect.  When you sprinkle it on your food at the table, you get an aroma similar to walking into one of Kansas City's famous BBQ restaurants.  The flavor is wonderful.  I use this as a gourmet table salt/finishing salt.  The other Artisan smoked salts are also wonderful, but as I said, this one is my favorite.  Highly recommended!
