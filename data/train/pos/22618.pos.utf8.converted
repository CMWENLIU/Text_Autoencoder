It's interesting to read that some reviewers are saying the bars contain GMO ingredients.<br />The information is erroneous. Green & Black's does not use GMO soy lecithin or any other GMO ingredient.<br />This is taken directly from their website:<br />Are your products GM-free?<br />Yes - as all of our products are certified by the Soil Association, this ensures no genetically modified (GM) ingredients are used in their production.<br />Just FYI, the Soil Association is the UK equivalent of the NOP here in the US, the organic certification body.<br />They're very strict.
