I very much enjoy dark roasts.  The challenge I find is that many of them are either burnt or overly bitter from poor roasting.  This coffee does a very good job of being a strong dark roast that is full of flavor without any hint of burnt or bitter flavors.  It is very dark and oily and the small portion that did not fit in my airtight container dried out a bit and was not as strong flavored.  That took over 3 weeks though due to the volume of coffee and it was still better than other dark roasts I have tried.  I have used this for guests to eat with pies and cake over the holidays and all of them commented on its excellent flavor.  A couple who don't really like dark roast did request some cream, but still gladly had multiple cups.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who:<br /><br />1.  Likes dark roast coffee<br />2.  Doesn't know, and wants to try it<br />3.  Wants to change it up from a medium, or god forbid, a light roast.<br /><br />It is a good quality product made more so because of the cost
