We purchased a Senseo coffee machine shortly after my son "borrowed" my Bunn coffee maker in March with the promise to get his own as he strolled out the door. Since I was the only person in the household drinking coffee regularly anymore instead of buying another Bunn and wasting half a pot of coffee every time I made a fresh pot of coffee, I thought I should at least look at the single cup coffee makers. I then promptly set off on a mission to find the coffee that "rocked my boat" given the fact that I was a sworn dunkin donut coffee drinker for years.<br /><br />I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees in general although they are nice to have on occassion, so I tried all of the Senseo coffees and eventually found that the Kenya Blend was the best of the lot given my individual taste for coffees.<br /><br />And then they came out with the breakfast blend. This makes a superb cup of coffee and it has effectively ended my murmurings for Dunkin Donut to get on board with Senseo and make a pod coffee just for the Senseo. Well ... maybe that is a slight exaggeration. I would still like Dunkin Donuts to team with Senseo and make a pod coffee but that only because I would like to have two superb coffee pods to chose from with one being the Senseo Breakfast Blend.
