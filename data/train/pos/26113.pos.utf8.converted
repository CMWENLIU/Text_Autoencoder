I bought this as a milk alternative for making homemade ice cream because of dairy issues on my part. I have not been disappointed! It adds the fat for creaminess that almond milk does not (the good kind of fat, mind you!), and it tastes great. My husband loves it as creamer in his coffee, and it makes tasty smoothies in the blender. I highly recommend this product and will buy it over and over again.
