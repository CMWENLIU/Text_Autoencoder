I'm a velveeta lover, don't get me wrong, I like 'real' cheese too.. but Velveeta is handy to have in the fridge for grilled cheese or a quick hot dish and, unopened, can be kept in the pantry.<br /><br />Ordering three at a time, delivered to my door, was a convenience and a great help when our car was acting up and would be a while to fix. This gave me some meal options to go with food already stashed in the pantry and freezer to jazz things up a bit...<br /><br />I just ordered a second pack to keep a good stash in the pantry... I prefered to be prepared.. you never know what might happen, ya know??<br /><br />The packages were well packed and arrived promptly, in perfect condition...not so much as a scuff mark or crease in the cartons.
