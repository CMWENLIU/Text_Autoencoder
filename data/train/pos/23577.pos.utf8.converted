Purina Glucotest is a wonderful product to use, in conjunction with veterinary monitoring, to manage feline diabetes.  My cat has been diabetic for 2 months, & is now getting better, because I have this product to use. It came quickly & worked very well for us. I have ordered at least 10 packets, and all of them worked well. Thank you Purina!!
