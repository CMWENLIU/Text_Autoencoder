This is my second bottle of The Source now and I must say, if you have never experienced real hot sauce, you are in for a big surprise. This stuff is not to joke with friends about as you can seriously injure someone with it used inappropriately or against the manufacturers' guidance.<br /><br />If this is your first time tasting real hot sauce, one drop per pot of chili is more than enough. This is not the hottest stuff available but it is one of the best "hot to price" ratios you will find. It has a rating of 7.1 million scovial units where I think a habenero pepper is only about 500,000 units. The high end sauces range around 14-16 million I believe.<br /><br />Having a chili cook off soon? One or two drops of this in the entire pot of chili and you'll be a sure fire "hottest!" category winner I bet.<br /><br />Do not eat this stuff directly from the bottle ... do not give it to children and be sure to wash your hands 4-5 times if you get it on them. Keep away from your eyes at all costs!
