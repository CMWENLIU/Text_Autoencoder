Tahsildaroglu Traditional White Cheese is inarguably the best pre-packaged white cheese not only among imported Turkish cheese, but also in Turkey. The fat-salt consistency is perfect, the taste is wonderful, and it has the right texture. Go for the sheep's milk, since it is a better representation of the 'Traditional White Turkish Cheese' (not feta, big difference), better tasting than cow's or goat's. It does not smell like sheep, so don't be turned off by the title.
