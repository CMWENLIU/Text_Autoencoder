For many years I used dried minced garlic in many dishes, much preferring it to the powdered, often salted type.  We used to be able to get it at a local big box store, which unfortunately stopped carrying it.  I like not only the convenience, but the taste.  This does not have any additives like most of the blends, and most significantly does not have salt (which many companies add because it is a preservative and adds cheap bulk!  I like being able to control what I add to recipes, which means adding salt when I want it, and not when I do not!  I use a lot of garlic in my cooking and usually have fresh on hand.  There are times when I actually prefer the dried.  It is a more concentrated flavor, so if you are adding it to a sauce where it will absorb some of the liquid you can get a more intense flavor than you can with the fresh.<br />Then, there is the obvious advantage that it does not spoil as fast.  In fact, I have never had it spoil (and I live in a humid environment where things go off rather quickly).<br />When this disappeared from my local store in bulk I had to buy it in small spice jars *for vastly more than this costs* something on the order of 10- 20x the price!  What you get from Amazon is an enormous amount (given that it is typically sold in 1 oz spice jars) which I suspect would last most people a long long time.  I transferred one of the bags to a quart jar and after a month (in the tropics) it is still dry & fresh. This is something I like well enough that having used it I do not want to be without it, and yes, did pay over 10x as much in the supermarket before I found it at Amazon.  I hope this is something they continue to stock, an item which I now consider a staple.
