This is my favorite baby food line by far. They are consistent and readily available at just about any store. We got this variety pack on Amazon after already purchasing it from local stores. This is a great price compared to most stores and the variety of flavors is great. I wish they had more variety packs available for stage 3, but compared to other products out there it is hard to complain.<br /><br />Now I am just waiting for the day that earth's best moves away from glass jars. Our daughter has started grabbing these out of her diaper bag and if she drops them on our hard floors it will break the jars. I have broken a couple myself dropping them from the cupboard on to the granite counter tops. I really like the pouches that some lines are doing and even the plastic containers that Gerber does. Glass is great because it is recyclable, but so are the plastic ones if you live in an area that supports that or you can reuse them like we do for storing bulk spices. That is the only the con I have and it is not even big enough to rate this product any lower.<br /><br />For those of you that cannot tell what flavors you are getting, they are:<br />2 - Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal<br />2 - Chicken Tenders and Stars<br />2 - Vegetable Beef Pilaf<br />2 - Strawberry Banana
