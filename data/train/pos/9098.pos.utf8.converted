One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!
