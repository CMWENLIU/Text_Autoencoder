This is a great company that is looking out for our health. Stevia is more then a sweetener; It helps reduce sugar cravings and even acne. (I challenge you to look it up).<br />This company emailed me right back when I asked about it being Organic. They said yes and were working on getting it on the label. They are coming out with more products to benefit our health.<br /><br />I was not a fan of Stevia at first because it is a different taste,so I tried Chocolate first (Yum, not real chocolaty). This is also a great creamy flavor. I have been told the liquids are better then the Powder.
