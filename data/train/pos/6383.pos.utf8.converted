As a diabetic on a calorie counting weight loss program, I initially bought dark chocolate sugar free bars from YC chocolate, and fell in love with them immediately to get my daily sweet tooth fix. I also give it to my toddler son to increase his calorie/protein intake and he actually loves it (albeit I have been very careful not to give him any non-dark or sugared chocolate so far). This bulk pack have bite size pieces and saves me the work of breaking up the bars. They are also slighly cheaper than the bars. These chocoaltes as a whole are more expensive than other brands, but the taste more than makes up for the cost.<br /><br />Dark chocolates are an acquired taste, so it would help to first buy them from a local grocey store and acquire a taste before moving up to these ones. In my experience, any chocolate is best consumed prior to having milk tea/coffee/chai/hot chocolate and allowing them to melt in the mouth rather than chew on them.
