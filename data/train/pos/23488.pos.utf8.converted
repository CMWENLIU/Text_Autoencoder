An earlier review mentions possible intestinal discomfort but points out that you'd need to eat almost a whole tin to get that dose.  I wouldn't just dismiss that possibility!<br /><br />The mints are tiny, chalky, leave white residue on your fingers, and dissolve within seconds.  I'm still going to give them 5 stars, because I can't stop eating them.  They have a very clean, very strong peppermint flavor, with no odd notes or aftertaste (which I've noticed in another brand).  Between the peppermint flavor and the lack of bacteria-friendly sugar, they leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I have them at work, and have noticed reduced cravings for midafternoon snacks -- I figured it was because they gave my mouth something to do, but another review mentions hibiscus, which seems plausible as well.<br /><br />And despite eating an entire tin in a day on more than one occasion, I haven't had any stomach issues.
