My 8 year old cat was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. She was having blood and mucus in her stools.<br />The vet prescribed a couple of different high fiber diets, neither of which worked. He also tried giving her steroids.<br />The steroids worked while she took them, but once off them her symptoms returned. He wanted to do more testing.<br />I spent $500 on an ultrasound, which was inconclusive. Next, he wanted me to do a $4000+ procedure (colonoscopy)<br />which would give a complete picture of the state of her disease. The next course of meds would be a combination<br />of chemo and steroids.<br />Meanwhile, after also mentioning this all to the breeder that I got my cat from, she told me to try the Core diet.<br />I had helped all her cats that had similar symptoms. She was pretty sure that all my problems were being caused<br />by grain allergies. So, I made the switch, using both the Core canned and the Core dry kibble. In addition, I<br />add probiotics and food enzyme powders to the wet food, daily. My cat is now almost completely symptom free.<br />Occasionally, I see a little mucus and maybe a smear of blood in the stool. My occasionally, I mean maybe<br />once in 8 weeks or so, where as before, it was every day.<br />I am sure the probiotics and the enzymes help, plus the holistic vet did some acupuncture, but I am thinking<br />also, the Core diet was the most beneficial treatment of all.
