I have breastfed all three of my children.  My first child I breastfed until about nine months.  I had to stop at that time because I was pregnant with my second child (surprise!) and my milk dried up.  I went to the supermarket to look at formula.  I was appalled when I saw that the first or second ingredient was corn syrup.  I hightailed it to our local health food store and discovered Baby's Only formula.  I took it home, made a bottle, and my daughter guzzled it down.  A few months after we started her on formula we were traveling and ran out of the Baby's Only formula and couldn't find a place to buy more.  We bought regular formula from the store and she couldn't stand it.  I didn't blame her because it smelled really bad compared to Baby's Only.<br /><br />I was able to breastfeed my second child until he was a year and, therefore, didn't need to switch over to formula.  My third child is almost ten months old and I weaned him last night.  He has never taken a bottle before.  I was concerned that I was going to have a battle on my hands.  Well, we got home from the store, gave him the bottle, and he drank it all down.  He did well today, too, especially tonight.<br /><br />I don't know enough about DHA and AHA to comment on what this formula would be like for a newborn/young infant.  However, for an older infant (9-12) months, I think that this is a great formula when you can no longer breastfeed.
