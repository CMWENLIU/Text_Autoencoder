After searching long and hard for the best value extra virgin organic coconut oil on Amazon, I found this product. Unfortunately since I made the purchase, the price has gone up from about $18 to about $20, but it is still the cheapest EVO coconut oil on Amazon. This is the only EVO coconut oil I have bought, but in my opinion from research I have done, all such products are the same or virtually the same in terms of quality, based on how they are produced.<br /><br />Again, I do not know how other EVO coconut oil products taste, but this product tastes (and smells) great to me, just like fresh coconut, so why would I pay a lot more for another product? As far as I can tell it is identical in every way to the more expensive EVO coconut oil products on Amazon, so I am guessing that few people have bought it and thus no one until now has reviewed it because they assume the lower price means it is lower quality, and I can attest that this is not true. You do have to buy 3 of the 54 oz containers to qualify for the free shipping deal, but if you use this product as much as I do every day, that shouldn't be a disadvantage at all.<br /><br />Lastly, the product actually arrived a day before the expected arrival date, which has only happened for me once before in all my time shopping online, so Vitacost is definitely a reputable seller.<br /><br />Who says you can't sell a high quality product for an affordable price? This is definitely an exception to that rule.
