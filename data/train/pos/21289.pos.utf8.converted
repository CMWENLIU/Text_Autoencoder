I tried a larger catnip ball that had catnip on it and my cat licked it and the small amount of catnip came off and it was cardboard underneath.  After that he walked away. This doesn't happen with these balls. He loves the way they roll so quickly and when he catches it, he holds it in his paws and licks, bites, and even tries to kick it with his feet. He seems to feel like he really got "IT". Was surprised as he doesn't like balls normally. I have great pictures but should have taken video. Really great product. Ordering more now.<br />Addition: I received the new order very quickly but thought I had ordered 2 balls. The picture was somewhat misleading but the add is accurate. There is only one ball for the price. Worth it but just a warning.
