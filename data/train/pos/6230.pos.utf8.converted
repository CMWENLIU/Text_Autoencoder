Our cat loves this grass!  As soon as we put it down for her, she goes right to it and starts munching away.  In fact, she likes the grass so much, the first time we let her eat it, we had to take the pot away before she ate all of it in one sitting (since then, she has started to show some restraint).<br /><br />We've also found that she doesn't beg for food as much if we let her eat some grass; she has even skipped meals after eating it. If weight control is an issue for your cat, this might be a substitute for food when kitty is begging.<br /><br />I was worried that it might upset her stomach but it's been several days and she hasn't had any adverse reactions.<br /><br />The seeds were very easy to grow. They sprouted within just a few days and grow very quickly.  We were a little stingy with how many seeds we planted, so the grass is a little sparse; next time we will plant more seeds.
