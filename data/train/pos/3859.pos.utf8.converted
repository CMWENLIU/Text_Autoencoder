We finally found this food, just by luck at the pet store.  Our dog (boxer/bulldog mix), now 6, had suffered mysterious allergies from the time he was 2 until I found this food.  We went to a Veterinary Allergy Specialist for over a year, spent thousands of dollars, went to extremes trying prednisone (which the side-effects are very problematic) & antibiotics, and tried over 6 different prescription pet foods; nothing helped.  Our dogs paws/feet would blister up in between his toes, burst, and bleed.  We even had our dog run grassed with synthetic/artificial turf in case it was due to grass allergy.<br /><br />The food is a little pricey, he eats 6 cups of food a day, but I cannot express the relief we have had from finding a food that eliminates his allergy symptoms.  I have to admit that the smell of the fish is a little overwhelming.  We had had to resort to feeding him outside now, which wouldn't be so bad, except the birds seem to like it too.
