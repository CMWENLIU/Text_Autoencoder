I first saw Mexican Coca-Cola at my local warehouse store. What is this, I wondered? Then I read an article about it and the story about how American Coke had been gradually changed and no longer was made with cane sugar. It seems that the U.S. Coke is made with corn syrup. Mexican Coke was said to be like the old-fashioned American Coke I knew and loved as a kid, so it seems. Actually, I preferred Pepsi and you got twice as much for your dime. Well, I just had to try Mexican Coke and I bought a case. It's quite delicious, and is indeed better than the Coca-Cola generally purchased in the U.S. I suppose you could say that it's gourmet Coca-Cola.<br /><br />In any case, I seldom drink anything except diet soft drinks because of a calorie problem I have. However, I have friends, relatives and guests that won't drink diet drinks. So, I always have a few bottles of Mexican Coke in the fridge. I offer it with a slight explanation and people seem to love it. They're almost always amazed. The novelty is worth the extra price.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
