I would give it six or seven stars here if they allowed it.  You get what you pay for, my friends, and this is the MOST HEAVENLY thing on earth to drink--tastewise and healthwise.  However, I will tell you that we use 1/2 Teaspoon in a 1 pint bottle of Lipton ICED green tea.  See my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> for the recipe.  I make a pot every morning and have completely replaced the morning coffee ritual with green tea.  It gives you the right lift and does not let you down at 11 am.  We still have 3 pm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6UX0Y">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> on days when we exercise, but we've broken our addiction to coffee with cream now.<br /><br />It has the most EGCG and mixed catacholamine antioxidants of any green tea product you can imagine.  There is a small insert with the packaging that details the contents for you and also contains the recipe for a Green Tea Frappachino that looks just great.<br /><br />We tried to "do it on the cheap" with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVNSFW">Vita Life Matcha (Green Tea Powder) - 10.58 Oz Twin Pack - 2x10.58 Oz</a> but it has an aftertaste that I don't really like.  The Do Matcha is the real article, and it's organic as well.  It's so concentrated that it's actually economical.  You will save $4.00 every time you make your own Starbuck's Green Tea Frappachino.  If you want to know what this tastes like go try one of those which are fantastic but contain a lot of calories and fat:  our iced tea with Do Match is much healthier and every bit as delicious.
