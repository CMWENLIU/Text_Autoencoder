My son and I have been eating gluten free for many years and I have tried every GF mix that becomes available. Pamela's Ultimate baking and Pancake Mix is truly the best! The rest of the family cannot tell the items I make are wheat free and gluten free, a tell tale sign that this mix is really good. It doesn't have a gritty texture like alot of the other GF mixes out there, and makes the most wonderful muffins, pancakes and crepes. I'm eating a delicious blueberry muffin as I type and order my case! I paid $5.69 for one bag of the mix when I purchased from the store, but Amazon has it here at $4.00 a bag when you buy the case. A great savings and I know I'll go through the case quickly!<br /><br />I'm trying the chocolate cookie recipe on the bag next and as any GF eating person knows, it's difficult to find a good GF chocolate chip cookie! I'm sure these will be as equally satisfing as all the other foods I've made with this mix! Try it, you won't be unsatisfied!
