Can't do sugar.  Have tried scores of SF Syrups.  NONE of them can touch the excellence of this product.<br /><br />Thick, delicious.  Perfect.  3 ingredients: Water, Maltitol, Natural Maple Flavor.  PERIOD.  No chemicals.  No garbage.<br /><br />Have numerous friends & family members hooked on this stuff.  My husband & son, who do NOT like "sugar free" prefer this over major label regular syrup.<br /><br />I use this as my SWEETENER in baking: cheesecakes, white brownies, muffins, pumpkin pies, etc... Unbelievably delicious...<br /><br />Can you tell I like it? :)
