Pros:<br />This is a terrific chocolate-y breakfast cereal.  And only slightly higher in calories than the original flavor.  Lower in calories than similar chocolate-y cereals.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The factory stopped making it for "awhile."  I contacted them and they assured me that they still market the product.  But it's hard to find.  Even when I tried to order it from the factory it is on back-order.
