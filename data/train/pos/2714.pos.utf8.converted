My 12 year old cat had ear mites in her left ear and I was recommended to pick this up. I cleaned her ears with a cotton ball first, and then applied a few drops. The mites were gone in one week! I noticed no side effects whatsoever.<br /><br />I was somewhat hesitant about the "Sentry" brand, but my vet confirmed that the medication in this was okay. I also find it odd that this brand has such negative reviews but is still operating and being sold in stores such as Petco and Petsmart. I will remain hesitant about this brand, but this product worked great for me. I would recommend it.
