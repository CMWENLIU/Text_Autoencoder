This chili powder has a great full bodied flavor.  I don't know if I can explain it so you'll understand, but some red chili powders have kind of a dull taste behind them.  (Don't know how else to describe it.)  Fortunately this brand's chili powder is always tasty.  I've been buying it for years and would recommend it to any chili lover.  I made enchiladas last night using my red sauce, (made with this chili powder), and got rave reviews from my husband.  I consider myself an "expert" on this sort of thing.  I had my first enchilada at the age of two.
