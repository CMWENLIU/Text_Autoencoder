I have made purchases from Berry Farms twice now and both times they have dilivered before the due date, usualy within a day or two.  The products are as advertised, and are real good for putting up for desaster storage.  The chedder cheese powder is the same thing as Kraft uses in it's macaroni and cheese.  The only draw back was there where no mixing directions for the chedder powder, but 1/4 cup of powder, 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 stick), and 1/4 cup milk makes a creamy sauce.  Just remember equal ammounts of powder, milk, and butter.  They still get 5 stars for prompt delivery.  I haven't had a customer service contact yet, so I can't grade them on that.  There web sight has a whole bunch of dried goods, and I have also ordered dried bell peppers and tomato powder from them.  Their packages are very well sealed and are packed for rough shipments.  I recomend this company highly.
