Since the product description and all the other reviews fail to mention it, I am writing this review. The beans are dried and vacuum packed so I expect they have a very long shelf life and the expiration date is probably required rather than realistic. Dried beans have been stored for 30 years and found to still be good. Storing that long will probably have some loss of vitamin. A package packed as these are that is a couple years beyond the expiration date will probably have no noticeable difference in quality or taste.
