If you are thinking about trying coconut oil for the first time and you are not sure which one to try, buy Nutiva!! You cannot go wrong!  My first purchase was from GNC and was not cheap but tasted and smelled cheap.  I ordered Nutiva and will never buy anything else! This oil has a white color and great smell and the best part is the TASTE! It has a clean coconut taste I did not get with the other brand.<br /><br />I am excited to see Amazon selling two 54 oz at such a great price.  This oil is addictive and I don't want to run out.  I use it from head to toe.  It is great for your hair, face, body and feet but even better when ingested.  I take 1 tablespoon 3 times a day.  If you don't care for the taste of the oil put it melted into a very cold yogurt and it will harden like the outer layer of chocolate on an ice cream bar!<br /><br />I now have more energy and appearance has improved.  I love this product and will never be without it thanks to Amazon!!
