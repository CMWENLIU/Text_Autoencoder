When it arrived in the huge shipping box I had no idea what to expect but after digging through the packaging  I discovered the the plant was in very good shape. I am amazed at the habits of this plant. It is already growing beautifully after only one month in its new habitat. It is quite fascinating to observe and requires so little but offers great rewards.I love it-- it was worth every penny!
