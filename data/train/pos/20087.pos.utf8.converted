Any of Ambrosial's products is hands down the best breakfast I've ever had!  Interesting menagerie of ingredients, super yummy and organic.  I have yet to find a comparable cereal that gets me going in the morning and i keep a bag in my office as a dry snack during the work day.<br /><br />Also, the company is so sweet.  I don't normally write reviews, but when I wrote a thank you letter to Anastasia at the company, they sent me a small complementary selection of their product.  Rare to find such a good company and product ethos.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Barry
