Seriously , these peppers add great heat and smokiness to any dish. Just puree or chop em with a food blender or knife. I use them in a simple sour cream sauce -mix in pepper purre, touch of cumin and a squirt of lime juice to taste. Use as a dip or on chicken etc. I use the puree for burgers too. Mix in one whole 12 oz can of the chipotle peppers (pureed) into 2 lbs of ground beef - add garlic and onion powder as well. Grill to your liking and top with cheddar and onion (cilantro is a good addition too!). I always get compliments on these smoky hot burgers. Good Luck.
