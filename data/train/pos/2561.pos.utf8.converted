I just had this for the first time. I can not believe how good this combination of fruit, seeds, nuts are. It is higher in calories but the fat is good fats. Eaten in moderation a serving of 3 TBS is fine. It has 8 gm of Protein per serving so it has staying power if you have it as an afternoon pick me up instead of candy or chips.<br /><br />Has Omega 3,6,9 which are very heart healthy and it is low sodium. I am very glad I gave this a try and I will get it again.
