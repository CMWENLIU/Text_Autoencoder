My husband and I have been using Morton Salt Substitute for years.  I've tried those "Lite" salts but they just didn't taste like salt.  Now my adult sons use only Morton Salt Substitute in their homes.  I've fooled people who say, "they would never use any type of substitute because they can tell the difference".  Well, they couldn't!! If I can't find it in a grocery store or supermarket, I order it online because it's the only thing that tastes like salt.
