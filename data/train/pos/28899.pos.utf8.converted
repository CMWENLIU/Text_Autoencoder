GoPicnic is a unique concept in portable foods.  Each lunch box has a individually packaged items:<br /><br />Ginger Zip Fruit and Nut Mix<br />Terra Nostra Organic Robust 60% Dark Chocolate bar<br />Seapoint Farms Lightly Salted Dry Roasted Edamame<br />Late July Organic Classic Rich Crackers<br />GoPicnic Chili Line Salmon Spread<br /><br />THE BREAKDOWN<br /><br />The Dry Roasted Edamme is dry roasted soybeans seasoned with sea salt.  They are a light crunchy, tasty snack.  The entire package is 130 calories with 4 grams of fat, 10 grams of carbohydrates (8 of which is dietary fiber) and 14 grams of protein.  Sodium is only 150 mg.<br /><br />Ginger zip is a trail mix of Ginger peanuts, cranberries and banana chips.  The ginger undertones is subtle and not overpowering. The package is 90 calories with 40 mg of sodium, 2 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 40 calories of fat (majority of which is unsaturated fat).<br /><br />The crackers and salmon dip combination is very good.  The dip tastes of mild chili with salmon and light citrus undertones.  The crackers are cripsy and lightly salted.  The combination of textures and flavors is just right.  However, I also put a few Edamame on top of the combination that made the combination a lot more enjoyable.<br /><br />The dark chocolate is aromatic, creamy and bittersweet.  I usually favor higher percentage of cocoa but this is an excellent finish to the Salmon Dip.<br /><br />The box is made of 100% recycled materials.  Inside the box there is a Sudoku puzzle.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />I don't consider this particular product a full meal, as I consider it a great item for grazing throughout the morning (or afternoon).  The entire package has 410 calories so it is a sizable portion of your daily recommended dietary intake.  Overall this is a great concept since it is a portable, non-perishable item.  It makes a great energy source for travel and hiking.  It is a product that I have never tried before.  I would definitely buy this with some degree of regularity.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
