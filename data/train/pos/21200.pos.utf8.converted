I don't usually go out of my way to write reviews for anything other than music, but I will for this cereal. It is a very underrated cereal that I believe can help pave the way for a better diet. I eat it everyday at different times and not only do I always feel satisfied that I chose a healthy alternative, but the taste is INCREDIBLE! One of my favorite tasting cereals hands down. Sometimes I even just eat a handful dry if I'm in the mood for a dry food. Not only is it a good source of fiber (10g, or 40% d.n.) but it's also packed with essential vitamins. With only 80 calories per 1/2 cup, I say yes to All-Bran every time!<br /><br />(Hahaha sounds like an ad, but it's so true)
