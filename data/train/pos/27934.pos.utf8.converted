Ordered this a couple weeks back and worried that they may melt while en route to my house due to what other customers have said in different posts. Once I received them, everyone loved them! They seem to have been stored in the right temperatures, and they taste great. They are definitely safe to buy from this seller - they don't seem to be last year's chocolates.
