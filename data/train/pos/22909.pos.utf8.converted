Made sausage today for the first time.This casing was super easy to work with,I soaked in warm water for 30 minutes,rinsed inside a couple times and went on to stuffing them with pork,garlic and a blend of spices.I oven roasted some of the sausages tonight,and it was so delicious!!I am very pleased with the casings,and my kitchen aid grinder and stuffing tube.
