Almost as good, and three times cheaper than my favorite Blue Flower Earl Grey. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPFGO">The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a><br />- Fragrant and full bodied<br />- Organic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None<br /><br />The Davidson's Tea Bulk, Earl Grey with Lavender is a great Earl Grey, and I would recommend it to anyone.
