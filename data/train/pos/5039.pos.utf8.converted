I've replaced my obsession with candy and chocolate with Back to Nature snacks.  They are awesome!  The different blends always taste great together although be careful, cooked in oil and high fat on most of these.  The higher protein and fiber content is what I needed for me and my daughter needed alternative protein sources as she is a vegetarian.<br /><br />My local grocery store sells them @ $5.99 a piece so this special was great for a small stock up on these treats.  Fabulous and much tastier and fresher than the average trail mix type blends you see everywhere.
