I've been looking for fig cookies since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease almost 7 years ago.  I missed fig newtons so much!  These cookies are probably far better than fig newtons.  They are so delicious.  They come in snack sized wrappings inside of the box, for easy portability.  These are worth every penny!
