I'm very strict with my diet.  I eat only organic foods, practice CRON (calorie restriction with optimal nutrition), eat minimal carbs and lots of nutrients.  I've tested 4 other brands of organic coconut oil -- Nutiva, Spectrum Naturals, and 2 small scale raw food companies.  This one is easily the best so far.<br /><br />The aroma is wonderful and the texture is much fuller than the other brands.  This coconut oil has fuller taste and less watered-down feeling than the other brands. So if you're looking for a good organic coconut oil, this is the one.<br /><br />Now for some quick facts about how amazingly healthy this stuff is:<br /><br />1) Medium chain fatty acids --> Digest very easily without requiring the gall bladder to do much.  Great for people missing gallbladders and truly everyone.<br /><br />2) Converts to usable energy very quickly.  A much more balanced and less manic energy than any carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, glucose, etc)<br /><br />3) Anti-viral, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal.  Keeps your digestive system very clean inside.  Helps destroy candida and balance intestinal (probiotic) bacteria.  Helps the immune system.<br /><br />4) Longer lasting energy without insulin levels being adversely affected.  Fats are the cleanest burning energy for our body.  Carbohydrates cause insulin levels to raise and crash, which is what creates the "eat every 3 hours" cravings that so many people this is hunger.  Healthy fats, like this oil, will not affect insulin and give us much more stable energy that last longer in the body.<br /><br />5) Tastes great.  Smells great.<br /><br />6) Can be used topically to make the skin very soft.  Is absorbed into the skin to nourish it, unlike most cosmetic moisturizers which leave residue or cause long-term dryness by unbalancing the body's innate skin oil balance.<br /><br />7) Can be used as a sexual lubricant.  Coconut oil is a natural anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial lubricant which helps keep these organs clean and reduce the spread of unwanted problem.<br /><br />8) Great for hair and can be used as a leave-on conditioner.  Like it's skin use, coconut oil will not imbalance the body's natural oils.... unlike chemical-based conditioners.  Plus, because coconut is anti-"everything bad" it will keep the hair clean too!<br /><br />9) Coconut oil detox cleanse.  The medium chain fatty acids make this and ideal food for detox cleanses because the energy is available with minimal digestive effort, plus all of it's anti-"everything bad" properties.  The detox cleanse is a 3 to 7 day process where all carbohydrate foods are removed and coconut oil is eaten as the primary energy source (approx. 14 Tablespoons each day).  The oil can be combined with organic lemon water as well.  You can find the instructions by Googling "Natural News Coconut Oil Cleanse".<br /><br />Basically, coconut oil is amazing!  And this brand is the best I've found so far.  Enjoy!<br /><br />*** Update: I found a good website for coconut oil information and recipes. It has summaries of many studies on coconut oil.
