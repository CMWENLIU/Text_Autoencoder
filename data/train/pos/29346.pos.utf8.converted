I absolutely love these cookies!  I eat pretty healthy (a lot of fruits, veggies and whole grains) and these are a treat when I eat them.  Just the right amount of chocolate to satisfy the sweet tooth while being healthy at the same time!  I like these and the other Kashi cookies, I think they are called the happy trail mix or something.  Also if you don't eat them right away it does help to put them in a zip lock baggy otherwise they get a bit hard if left open in the box.
