After reading about this salt and the benefits one can get from using it, I gave it a try.  It is really great tasting, and you use only a fraction of this salt to acheive the taste you want. Dr. Mehmet Oz recommended using the Himalayan salt for people with hypertension who have to watch their salt intake in one of his newsletters.  That caught my attention and I started researching it.  I found the best deal on this product right on Amazon!  Thanks so much.
