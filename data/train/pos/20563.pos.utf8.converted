Being born to dutch parents, I grew up on Dutch black licorice.  I was devastated when I found out they make it with gluten!!  This licorice is delicious...it could be saltier and stronger flavored for my taste buds but then again my fav dutch licorice is the double salt.  I have to hide this licorice from my husband so he doesn't eat it all!  LOL!!
