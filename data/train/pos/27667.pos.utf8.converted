I purchased a box from wal-mart, not really paying too much attention to the nutritional facts at first. After my first bowl (with strawberries on top), I was hooked. I looked at what was actually in the stuff, and it was INCREDIBLY healthy, especially in a time where most cereals are loaded with synthetic ingredients and tons of sugar.<br /><br />A+, Recommend, would buy and eat again...and again...and again.
