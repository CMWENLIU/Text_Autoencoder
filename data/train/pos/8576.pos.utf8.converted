I got this sample pack so i could try all four flavors, and they're all fantastic (my favorite is butterscotch, though). Like another reviewer, i expected dryer, flatter cookies, but was pleasantly surprised to discover that the cookie medium is classic shortbread seeded with tasty bits of the additional flavor.<br /><br />My co-workers all admired the packaging as well. I'm definitely going to buy more, and keep this in mind as a great little gift for people who like sweets.<br /><br />One caveat on that, thought: this wouldn't make the best gift for people who are extremely picky about appearances: the cookies themselves end up a little battered by the time they arrive, with many broken in half or chipped. If you care about the taste, this doesn't matter, but if you wanted to arrange them on a plate for company, it could be annoying. I don't (yet) know if they fare better in the single-flavor cans.
