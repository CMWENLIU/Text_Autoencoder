This ghee is wonderful. I now use it as my primary cooking oil. Being grassfed means this ghee is extremely nutritious and flavorful. The fat stands up wonderfully to high cooking temperatures meaning you won't get smoked out as easily and the resulting fat is not burned and rancid with the related health effects. I was elated to see a high quality grass fed ghee at a great price here.<br /><br />I have also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032RPLSY">Grassfed Organic Ghee 7.8 Oz</a> by Pure Indian Foods. This is the other grassfed ghee I know of on Amazon. That ghee is also very good and has a slightly nuttier buttier smell in contrast to Purity's sweeter almost caramel smell. At almost half the price, though, Purity blows that brand away. If you are deciding on a grassfed ghee there is no comparison, Purity is the way to go.<br /><br />Amazon, please please please make this a Prime eligible item with Subscribe & Save!!
