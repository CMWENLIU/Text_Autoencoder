An Italian acquaintance (from Milan) swears by this stuff.  Dead simple to make and pretty close to the "real" thing.  Heresy to serious cooks, but when the clock is running and two adolescent boys are HUNGRY.  'Nuff said.  Clearly, the additional ingredients - preservatives, et al. - give one pause - and should - but all in, it's probably not what is going to kill you or me.  Good stuff from a package.
