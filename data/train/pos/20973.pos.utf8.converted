OK, I have high blood pressure and love salt. In an attempt to lower the effects of sodium I tried this product.<br /><br />Let me state that my wife finds this product horrible and finds the taste almost abhorrent.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, love the taste. I have become a potassium salt lover. I add it to every food that needs a flavor enhancer. I actually have salt free plain chips that I pour this product on as a substitute for potato chips.<br /><br />Apparently, this potassium salt is something you either love or hate. I have read web sites where people find it great, and others who find the taste intolerable.<br /><br />As an aside, high potassium diets do lower blood pressure.<br /><br />So, try it, if you like the taste, you may be hooked.
