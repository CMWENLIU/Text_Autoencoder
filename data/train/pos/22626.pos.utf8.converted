As much as my family and I love cheese from Italy and Spain, we love French cheese more.  France is a country that produces more than 100 cheeses, so it must have been difficult to choose only four for this assortment, but in my opinion, four of the very best were chosen.<p>We are all watching our weight at my house, so we eat a lot of salads.  While cheese is definitely not a &quot;diet food,&quot; a little in a salad goes a long way, especially when you're using Buche Chevre.  My children love it on crackers as well.<p>My wife and I reserved the chaource and the epoisses for a &quot;wine and cheese&quot; party, but believe me, they are so wonderful and so special, you'll be tempted to eat them anytime, party or not.<p>The Gruy&egrave;re de Comt&eacute; is just so special I can't really find words to describe it.  It's rich.  It's creamy.  It's delectable.  We often eat it as a dessert cheese.  Yes, it's really that good!<p>If you're looking for a special gift, you can't go wrong with this French Cheese Assortment.  These are four of the finest cheese France has ever produced.
