I cooked this rice in my rice cooker with hesitation thinking that it wasn't going to come out well, but it was the other way around, just perfect and in no time, i used the measurements fron cook book "SUSHI TASTE AND TECHNIQUE" that I purchase here in amazon as well, fantastic book by the way, highly recommend it. Here you go just for fun: 1 1/3 cups Japanese shot grain rice, 1 1/2 cups of water and this is for the mixture that goes into the all done rice to make it sticky and glossy and tasty of course. I almost forgot, make shore you washed the rice before you cook it at list 4 to 5 times, very important!!.<br />Okay back to the review, the rice just comes out perfectly done all the time!!, i havent cook it in the stove yet because i dont need to but im shore the results are the same, nothing more to say. Good luck!!
