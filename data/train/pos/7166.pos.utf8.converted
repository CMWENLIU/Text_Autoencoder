I have recently tried  "Lavazza Tierra! Espresso 100% Arabica " which is great but a little too mild for me.  I make cappuccino, not espresso, and the SuperCrema is better for this.  It does have more caffeine then the pure Arabica  Tierra  and is more robust, more body and much more crema.  Actually, on the few occasions that I do have espresso I would lean to the Tierra as it is lighter. I use a Pasquini Livia Auto.  My vote is SuperCrema for Cap and Tierra for espresso (Tierra if you just want less caffine and a lighter full flavor).  So, get both.  Here at Amazon the price is great.
