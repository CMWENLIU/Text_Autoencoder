We adopted a mix breed that was approx 1 year old. His coat was coarse, dry and skin was flaky. He was licking his feet and shaking his head. Tried several brands and found that duck and lamb make him extremely gassy with a really rude odor.  He loves the fish and sweet potato, his coat is like velvet now in just a couple short months.  No more shedding or flaking and NO RUDE ODOROUS GAS problem. Highly recommend.
