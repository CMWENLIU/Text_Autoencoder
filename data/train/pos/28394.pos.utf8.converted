I know some reviewers don't like the "Capping" on top, but this is one important reason I like it so much and buy it. The health properties in the honeycomb, propolis, & pollen is nutrient rich. The Live enzymes are both healing and nourishing. I like to use this honey in my Almond Mylk recipes (I alternate using Honey at times and Dates at other times.), and Salad Dressing recipes.<br /><br />Also a real quick healing recipe/ detox helper:<br /> 2 oz. Fresh squeezed lemon<br />1/8th tsp. Cayenne<br />1/4 to1/2 tsp. Honey.<br />Bend Well Shot glass it down.<br /> Clear your cold, your throat, and head without the use of prescription drugs and much  cheaper!!!
