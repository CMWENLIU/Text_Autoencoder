I love this stuff.  Started a low carb diet and was looking for a better sweetner that didn't upset my stomach/gi tract.  This is really great and the flavors are terrific.  Made myself a cream soda with a little bit of club soda, a few drops of vanilla cream and a few drops of valencia orange!  Highly recommend to try out sweetleaf sweeteners!!
