First of all, this is a green superfood, not just "wheatgrass juice"; secondly, I've been drinking green foods for years, and this is by far the best combination of both taste and quality. I have more energy, less appetite, better skin, and lose weight more easily when I drink this. I very much prefer it to Barleans Greens.
