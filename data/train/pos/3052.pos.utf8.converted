This cereal is awesome.  I found it for sale in a plastic bag rather than the stylish box, but I'm sure it is just as fresh and crunchie as the other kind - and thankfully the artwork was the same.  I can't walk by that gorilla face in the grocery store without feeling good.  Although I was slightly worried about the healing affects of this product when sold without the exterior packaging, as we all know the old saying "a box on the table, keeps my jimmies stable"
