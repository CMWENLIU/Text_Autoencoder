Vegemite, the great Australian condiment and beer by-product.  This is a jar of vegemite.  Real vegemite, not that half-strength new stuff.  Not a big jar, but with Vegemite, a little goes a long way.  Really.  There is even a rumour that no non-Australian has ever finished a jar.  Also, don't worry about the expiry date.  Vegemite never goes off, even keeping it in a cupboard in the heat of an Australian summer, so you do think the sub-Arctic conditions of Europe or the USA will have any impact on it?  Nuclear waste will decay faster than this stuff.<br /><br />Alright, so you have your jar of vegemite.  Advanced users can find recipes involving vegemite as a dip, in cooking with meat, etc.  But if you are an advanced user, why read a review?  Walk away from the computer and go and eat some vegemite right now.  For you interested novices, here goes:<br /><br />1.  Buy vegemite.<br />2.  Eat vegemite, preferably on buttered toast or grilled with cheese.<br /><br />Step 2 probably needs a little explanation.<br /><br />Vegemite is not peanut butter, or marmalade.  It is best used in moderation.  Very moderate moderation.  So get your slice of bread, and toast it if you wish.  Spread butter on it - as thickly as you like.  This is vital, both to cut the richness of the vegemite, and also to act a lubricant (spreading vegemite on dry toast or bread is a recipe for disaster - just because it resembles engine oil does not mean it has the same physical properties).  Now, get a little vegemite on a knife.  Less than that.  Probably a third or half what you started with.  You only need enough to faintly discolour the butter with a brownish tinge.  Do the same thing with another slice of bread, or just fold over the one you have to make a sandwich.<br /><br />Now eat the sandwich.  Vegemite is an acquired taste, but its not too hard to pick up.  Remember, we feed this stuff to infants in Australia - and they love it.  Try it with both toast and plain bread.<br /><br />If you can't enjoy a vegemite sandwich, there is one more thing to try: a vegemite and cheddar cheese sandwich (Don't try using Brie, or any fancy cheese for that matter).  Its best using toast, and then spread vegemite as above.  Slice the cheese quite thinly - about 1/16th of an inch - and lay over the top.  Leave the sandwich open and grill in the over until the cheese bubbles.  Remove, let cool slightly, and eat.  Its best on a cold rainy day -but good anytime.<br /><br />If you like that, you can build up to using more vegemite on your butter.  But always be careful, as mistakes have been made by those who thought they ready to try more and more vegemite.  Some will even talk about the experience; most never will.<br /><br />Vegemite is a great source of vitamin B, and tastes yeasty and salty, in an indescribable sort of way.  It has to be tasted to be understood.
