A friend introduced me to Mallomars in the 60's, and it was love at first bite!  There's something inwardly satisfying about a delicate, crumbly cookie, topped with tasty, fluffy marshmallow, that is completely covered with a thin coating of delicious chocolate.  Is it any surprise that Mallomars have been pleasing the palates of cookie lovers ever since 1913?<br /><br />Mallomars are pretty good nutritionally:  two (2) cookies have 120 calories (45 calories from fat), 18g carbohydrates (1g from dietary fiber, 12g from sugar), 1g protein, and only 40mg sodium.  The sodium is negligible, if you're on a low-to-moderate-sodium diet!<br /><br />To me, these cookies taste completely "real" or "natural", because they don't leave any artificial chemical aftertaste. The main ingredients are sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, and vitamin-enriched flour.  However, they also contain processed chocolate (processed with alkali and soy lecithin), high fructose corn syrup, and palm/palm kernel oil, so you shouldn't buy them if you're concerned about your intake of either high fructose corn syrup or saturated-fat vegetable oil.  There is no cholesterol.<br /><br />The odd thing about me and Mallomars, is that I love them even though I don't like plain marshmallows or chocolate-covered marshmallow eggs or bunnies.  It must be the marshmallow filling recipe and the cookie base that makes the difference.<br /><br />This listing is for four (4) boxes of Mallomars with 18 cookies each.  Probably it's best to order Mallomars only in the winter months.  The cookies travel pretty well, but the chocolate coating is thin, and it can melt if subjected to high warehouse or delivery-truck temperatures.
