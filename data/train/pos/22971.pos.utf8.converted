My husband and I both enjoy this hearty soup.  It makes a perfect lunch or sometimes we will pair it with a sandwich for an easy dinner.  The texture is thick and creamy with a lot of flavor for a "healthy" soup, yet you don't feel like you are eating green pea mush.  The vegetables are all still recognizable - firm chunks of potatoes, carrots, celery, and whole peas, and nice bites of lean ham throughout.  It is really good (though not so healthy!) with Ritz crackers.  We always keep this soup on hand, I have it set up through Subscribe and Save to get a case a month.  As for the price, you could probably find it a bit cheaper at your grocery store but not much, and who can beat the delivered-right-to-your-door aspect of heavy items like canned goods!  If you like split pea soup, it's a simple decision.
