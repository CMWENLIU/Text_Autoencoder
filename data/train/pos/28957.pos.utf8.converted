I bought a bottle of this stuff over two years ago and I still have some in my fridge. Rather than go for the extreme pain by pouring it on, consider using it as a way to boost the heat in an otherwise bland recipe that's supposed to be spicy.<br /><br />Say you're making a Thai stir-fry with a store-bought sauce, and as you're cooking you notice it's kind of bland. Take a TINY bit (1/4 teaspoon or less - a few drops - do this over the sink btw, not the pan) of this stuff and then add that tiny bit to the stir-fry and stir for a few minutes. Taste again. You will be amazed at how how this enhances the heat without ruining the flavor.<br /><br />I'm sure there are a ton of similar or more potent (yeesh) products out there but for me this is the one everyone talks about. I'm not a chili-head and I don't like agony, just a noticeable kick when preparing certain foods. I would get this one again for sure.
