This is excellent almond butter, so much better than the usual health food store choices.  It tastes very fresh, and has largeish chunks of almonds.  it makes delicious sandwiches and is good in cookies.  It does not taste bitter, as so many HFS brands do. I an trying each of the brands of this that amazon carries; so far this wins my taste test by a mile!
