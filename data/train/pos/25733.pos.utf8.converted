I recently ran a marathon in November and trained all summer using Clif Shot Energy Gels during my LR's.  However, during one of the races I ran this summer they gave out PowerBar Gels and I loved them.  I recently bought an entire box of PowerBar Gels to train for a marathon in January and I can't see myself ever switching.  Here are the pros/cons:<br /><br />PowerBar PROS<br /> * thinner consistency which makes it easier to swallow<br /> * great taste - I have the Strawberry/Banana and found them to be the best tasting gel I ever had yet. 9.5 out of 10<br /> * easy to open - the packaging is very easy to open, even with sweaty hands during a run<br /><br />PowerBar CONS<br /> * haven't been able to come up with one yet<br /><br />Clif Bar PROS<br /> * Litter Leash on side of package to keep from ripping the top off.  Keeps the entire package in one piece to prevent littering.<br /> * Overall I can't complaining about the taste.  8 out of 10<br /><br />Clif Bar CONS<br /> * Hard to open - these Gels are almost impossible to open once your hands get wet.<br /> * Thick consistency - these Gels get thicker in cold weather and become very hard to swallow.  Plus the gel itself is a bit more powdery (Chocolate) then PowerBar.
