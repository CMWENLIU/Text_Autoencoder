I have bought several kinds of gluten free bread mixes.  I have made GF bread from scratch.  Namaste is the bread my husband always tells me is the tastiest, although he has no idea which brand he is eating.  I add ground nuts and some almond flour to all bread mixes because he preferred whole wheat bread before the GF diet.  The nuts make the texture more like whole wheat.  I have used walnuts, pecans and almonds chopped in a small processor.
