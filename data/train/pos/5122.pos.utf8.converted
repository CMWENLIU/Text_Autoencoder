I used know Gelatin from Publix for an alternative source of protein. Most my meats are so high in tryptophan that I figured I was already getting enough in my diet, that I could take this as a supplemental protein also. This product tastes much better than know, also, after going to their site, it looks like this product is made from pastured grass fed cows (which is great if you are on the Paleo-Diet).<br /><br />Most Paleo people have heard of Weston Price. Some have heard of Pottenger. Pottenger did tests on cats and found that after several generations of eating cooked only food that they became short tempered docile, they developed tooth problems and narrowing of the jaws along with skeletal deformities. The reason Pottenger's studies apply here is because he recommended that people consume some gelatin with their meals. The reason he recommended this is because the Gelatin is similar to RAW food in its water-loving hydrophilic quality. Gelatin Loves water and Digestive Juices and if you eat a cooked meal along with some Gelatin it literally draws digestive juices towards it and aids in digestion.<br /><br />Because I follow a Paleo diet mostly, I eat a lot of fat (grass fed butter/coconut oil) and after a little while of stopping the Know Gelatin and waiting for this product to arrive, I noticed that my stools were gray/ashy, I did a lot of research and found that Gray is a symptom of undigested fats. From 12 hours after I took this product I was back to a normal nice brown color.<br /><br />I also have kind of weak/popping joints so...<br /><br />This product is pretty much exactly what I needed, wanted and recommend, and it tastes great, if you need a product for digestion or joints, this product couldn't get a higher recommendation from me.
