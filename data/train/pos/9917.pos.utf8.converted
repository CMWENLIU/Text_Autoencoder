We moved to another state and could not find Blue Seal Dog food, unless we drove for miles to get it.  We decided to purchase Diamond Naturals and my dog absolutely loves it.  Like Blue Seal, our dog eats and feels satisfied.  She doesn't have the need to eat more and more like the cheap store brand dog foods which in turn made her poop more and more.  Her coat has an amazing shine.  For the price and free shipping this is worth it.
