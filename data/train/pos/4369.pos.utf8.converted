You really can't go wrong with Britt coffee.  I had it for the first while traveling in Costa Rica and fell in love with it. I stuffed my luggage full of it!  I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.  Britt has spoiled my taste buds for anything else.  I highly recommend this coffee.
