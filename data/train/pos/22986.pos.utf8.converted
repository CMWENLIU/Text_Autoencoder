I enjoy Halvah bars occasionally as a healthy treat and I was surprised to find some brands still use partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (aka Trans Fats) ...which is the opposite of healthy!<br /><br />Camel Halvah bars are completely natural with no partially hydrogenated vegetable oil!!! It is delicious, contains 4gms of omega 6 fatty acids, no cholesterol, low in saturated fat and contains no granulated sugar.<br /><br />This is not a diet food however. Each bar serves 3 at 150 calories per serving. The problem is: its so tasty, its hard to stop at one serving and so easy to just finish the whole thing. Thats 450 calories, which is more than enough for an entire meal. It would be nice if they could package bars in one serving sizes.
