Since not being able to get Kirkland's Organic 2lb. ground coffee at Costco, I searched the web and found Cameron's at Amazon.<br />At first I was skeptical because of the price.<br />Well, both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised.<br />The coffee is bold but not bitter.<br />The subscription option is a definate plus, saving 15% and free shipping.<br />Can't wait for next month's delivery. I'll probably up the amount to two bags.<br />Thanks Amazon for great products and excellent service.
