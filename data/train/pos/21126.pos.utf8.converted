Last November, at a small tapas bar in Barcelona, we chose these olives as one of our evening's selections. I'm usually indifferent to green olives, but these have a decidedly 'more-ish' taste!<br /><br />And it's not just me who finds them irresistable: every person who's tasted these in my home has insisted on knowing where they might find more... Never are there any leftovers, darn.<br /><br />I hesitate to submit this review, in case the demand for this product exceeds the supply. Were that to happen, I'd have to check myself in to a rehab center for sure, to combat my withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br />Wonder if they're available by the barrel?
