This is my very favorite tea.  I used to drink Earl Grey and wanted to go herbal, but find an herbal with a good strong flavor.  This is the one.  Great ginger flavor.  It truly is less expensive and more convenient for me to order this tea through Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save program than purchasing it at a supermarket or organic foods store.
