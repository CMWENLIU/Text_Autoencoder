I had to decrease my baby's feedings when I had to return to work 8 weeks postpartum. Eventually, my hectic schedule and numerous illnesses made me stop. My son is now 3 months and I have been feeling incredibly guilty about stopping, so I'm attempting to relactate. I only had about 2 drops of milk from each side, but after almost a week of Fenugreek (9 pills a day), I'm noticing more droplets and an occasional squirt. I find that incredibly impressive. Without this, and my pump, I would have given up and felt guilty for the rest of my life.
