This is the BEST coconut water!!!  I have tried 8 different brands and this is the absolute best.  I first discovered it at Whole Foods, 20 miles from home.  I was estatic to discover it was available on Amazon and then be able to subscribe and save. What a deal!!!  If you like coconut water you must try Taste Nirvana, it is delicious.
