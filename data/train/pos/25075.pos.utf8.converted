Another awesome product from Annie's.  This has a mild broccoli & cheese flavor.  Just tiny flecks of broccoli.  If you want real pieces of broccoli, you'll have to add your own!  I'm not sure kids would like this due to the "different" flavor.  This would be great with chicken and some veggies added for a complete meal.  Very easy to prepare.
