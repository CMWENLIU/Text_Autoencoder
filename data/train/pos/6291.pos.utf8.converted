I have yet to find a superior dry cat food. I prefer to feed my cat a raw diet, but sometimes it isn't possible. An apartment doesn't have a place for an extra freezer so unfortunately a raw diet isn't feasible. This food is the closest to a raw diet you can get in a dry kibble. NO GRAIN and all meat proteins, exactly how cats want it. And like other reviewers commented, cats LOVE it. My cat always runs hopefully to his CORE storage bin when I start to open it and cries and begs until it is on his dish. My cat's coat is glossy, thick, healthy and barely sheds. His eyes are clear and bright. He has tons of energy and every year his vet is impressed with how healthy he is. No digestive problems, and no kidney problems that are so common in cats fed grain cat food.<br />I strongly recommend this cat food!
