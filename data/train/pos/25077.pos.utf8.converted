La Chinata brand is DOG (guaranteed origin of denomination) from the La Vera region of Spain.  This is the real one that is smoked over real oak for almost two weeks and ground to a silky powder (think cocoa) rather that the gritty stuff produced here in the U.S.  Rather than just for garnish (which I do as well), it's a powerbomb of aroma and flavor.<br />All you need to do to understand the flavor profile is to start by making a compound with hot butter or some mayonnaise, and taste it.  Before you know it, it starts going on roast chicken, scampi, all chops, rice and noodle dishes, chicken and egg salads, infused oils and sauces.  It adds gorgeous color to everything you put it in.  Every review here so far is five stars.  Try it now!
