Our five year old Thai Ridgeback was getting a little chunky after a particularly snowy winter. The owner of our dog walking service mentioned Orijen food as a way to slim her down.  We had been feeding her Science Diet, 1/2 sensitive skin, 1/2 light food.  We always considered her to be reasonably healthy and active.  Twice before I had attempted to switch her to "fancier" holistic foods and both times she began losing hair.  I suspected lamb as the culprit but it could have been some other ingredient.  I have never reviewed anything before or felt passionate enough about a product to sing it's praises until now.<br /><br />The minute you open the bag you notice the food smells wonderful.  It looks high quality.  The dog LOVES it.  It's is excruciating to wait for that first bag that is mixed 50/50 to be finished so you can completely transition.  We knew right away that this was a good choice, but as time went on I was stunned at all the aspects of her health that improved.  1) Ashy-ness that she had developed on her elbows went completely away. 2) Her coat grew noticeably thicker and shinier over several months. 3) &lt;Gross-out Alert> Her stool is firm and smaller; she stopped farting, and no longer experiences anal sack leakage.  4) After a year of feeding her this food she is now visibly leaner and looks awesome for 6 years old.  This is the best thing we could have done.<br /><br />Now the economy of it.  Science Diet is $45 bucks for 30lbs.  This stuff is $65.  BUT, since she digests more of the product we literally feed her 2/3's the amount we used to, and she seems more satisfied, doesn't stand by her bowl and beg for more.  It's basically a wash on price!<br /><br />In response to the reviews that claim this food is dangerous, I have a hard time believing those aren't planted by a rival company.  She just got a full check up and three year rabies shot at our vet.  There isn't anything wrong with her liver.  The vet said they were not familiar with Orijen yet, but they agree that she is noticeably healthier and the higher protein content is perfectly safe.  It's about what is not in this food that makes the difference for me.  No pesticides, no cheap stabilizers, no filler grains, no ground up bones and connective tissues.  I'm not a vet or nutritionist but I am a first-hand witness to the positive effects of this wonderful food.  Thank you Orijen!!!
