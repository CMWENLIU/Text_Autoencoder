I love all soups but actually found myself reaching for this one over most of the other varieties of soups I have in my cupboards.  There's lots of corn and the corn is really crisp and fresh tasting while the whole soup has a mild but delicious flavor.  It's not overloaded with vegetables like a stew would be but, for me, that adds to the desirability of it.  Being organic and low in salt is an added bonus of Amy's soups.  As with all the organic soups, they are quite expensive but when on special sale, I found this soup to be well worth the money.  I highly recommend this soup to everyone.
