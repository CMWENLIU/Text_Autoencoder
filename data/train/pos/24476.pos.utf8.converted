I bought these for my brother in another state and accidentally had them shipped to me.  I am so glad that I did because then I had the opportunity to try them.  By the time I reordered some for him, they were out of stock.  They are in stock now, but will arrive after Christmas.  Great taste, quality. I have not found one bad one yet!
