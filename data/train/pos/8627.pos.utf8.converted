This product does come in a shaker cannister not only the small packets. The latter are useful for when you are on the go or at work. Like the lemon and orange versions this product adds excellent citrus flavor without much acid. This product has a good shelf life and can be used creatively. Not only do I add it to water but consider some of the following. Use it in chicken salad, turkey meatloaf, glazing for pound cake, with some butter and pepper over vegetables as well as add a few packets to you pasta water. Fresh lemons and limes may be expensive during certain times of the year and it can be disappointing when they go to waste. This product will not replace the need for the real thing but would be a useful addition to your pantry.
