I love these pens, they are great for decorating fondant pieces, icing, or cookies. The markers are taste-less but are very bright.<br /><br />Edit: I bought these over a year ago and they have lasted a long time, I use them mostly for drawing on fondant and they work great. They slowly started drying out over 3ish months ago but I just dipped them into water to hydrate them. I didn't have to buy a new set till about a month ago when my black pen would no longer work. Overall I think this was a great buy! Lasted a lot longer than I thought it would.
