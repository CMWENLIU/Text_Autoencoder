I'm a skeptic.  I've researched way too much about the available food for dogs out there.  In my search for something to feed my dogs, I had to balance my desire to not feed them the corn-laden garbage (which they cannot digest) sold in most supermarkets, against the $80+ per bag the premium foods cost.  I even considered going to BARF (biologically appropriate raw food) but it's just too much work for me.<br /><br />This is excellent dog food at an excellent price.  I switched my dogs from Eukanuba and they were practically inhaling it at mealtimes!  No problems switching, firm stools, and healthy dogs...done!
