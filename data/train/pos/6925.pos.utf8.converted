I tried this w/o any fruit or protein powder and the taste was a little too "healthy". However, I add protein powder and berries, usually blueberries, and it's delicious w/just a hint of chocolate flavor. It's a great way to sneak in those servings of veggies that are not so easy to get in when you're in a rush and on the go. My daughter says it smells like chocolate, so even though the flavor is pretty well hidden to me, the natural cocoa comes through in the aroma.
