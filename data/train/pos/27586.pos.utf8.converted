I am no connoisseur of white tea but I use FOOJOY SHOUMEI as the standard to compare the rest. This tea has a naturalsweet undertone that makes it  a pleasure to partake. I like to just steep it to a golden yellow and savor it. Othe white teas I have tried have a slightly bitter taste,I have tried the much more expensive and similar priced ones and this beats them all hands down. White tea kills more bacteria on contact in lab studies (google it) than green so its part of my fight the flu season regime as well. Did I say the price was unbeatable? Lets keep that our little secret.
