I have been drinking coffee, without cream or sugar, for about forty years. I purchase whole bean and grind and brew it fresh. This is a 'blend' so do not expect 100% Jamaican Blue. Last year, I did buy some 100% Jamaican Blue coffee beans at $35/pound. To be honest, I did not really care for the 100% Blue. Maybe the cost affected my taste buds. It is hard to describe taste. To me, this blend is mild and full of flavor as compared to many others. In the past year, I have gone through about fifty pounds of this and still enjoy it.<br /><br />I sometimes like to experiment with different types of coffee beans. The other beans by Magnum, that have comparable types in the local markets, have all been superior in flavor and similar in price to the available local brands. I would highly recommend any of the 'Magnum Coffee' types of coffee. This one is just my overall favorite.<br /><br />Ken
