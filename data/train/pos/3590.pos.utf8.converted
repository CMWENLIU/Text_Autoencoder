I thought this was going to be a good deal, but it is not so hot. I have a hard time carrying heavy items into the house and buy many heavy items through Amazon Prime (Also note that shipping is automatically free when you use Subscribe and Save). I am referring to heavy items that I use repeatedly like cat food, soup, and laundry detergent. Anyway, cat food like dry Fancy Feast can cost quite a bit at the store. Then it has to be taken off the grocery shelf, loaded into the cart, taken out of the cart and paid for and then lugged home etc. It requires a lot of manipulating to get to the kitty feeding station. So, when able, I get it delivered on Arizona Prime. The price for the bags was Fantastic: two 3 lb. bags for $7.19...much less that the grocery store or PetsMart. But, THEN, the dreaded shipping cost was added. That boosted the price to $13.18. THEN the deal does not look so hot. You are back at grocery stores prices then and all that is saved is the lugging about.<br />My Kitties prefer Fancy Feast in the dry food and like all the varieties. I mix them up by adding a scoop of chicken, a scoop of filet mignon, and a scoop of fish to the mix and the kitties eat contentedly off and on all day. They are active litle critters with whom I play and they have no weight problems so free feeding works for us.<br />I like the little kibble bites that Fancy Feast makes. It seems to be just the right size for the cats to eat since it is not so thick as other kibble bites. Makes it easy to pick up and toss back into the bowl when they spill. With 2 flavors per bite, it looks appealing and the cats doing the eating seem to agree. I may do the major part of my buying from Amazon but if PetCo or PetsMart is having a sale on dry Fancy Feast, I stock up. It easily keeps for 6-8 months in my garage or closet and the kitties eat it just as if it were purchased yesterday. That is a Big benefit for me since I buy in bulk if I feel up to loading and carrying heavy items about.<br />The other creatures who prefer Fancy Feast dry are my neighborhood Feral Kitty Buddies and the birds. If I have dry food out for the ferals and they do not finish it (perhaps they caught a mouse today) then the birdies swoop in and finish it off.<br />So, in the end, I am a great fan of Fancy Feast dry, as are my critters, but I do not care for the shipping. Next time I will wait until a Prime deal comes available.<br />After I wrote this item up I went back to look at it to see why I had ordered something with shipping attached. Turns out, I did not. It is available on "Subscribe and Save" which is how I had set it up. So you can get this deal without shipping. Just sign up for Subscribe and Save. Then it is, once again, an extremely reasonable price, and arrives on your doorstep at needed intervals. Could life get better?!<br /><br />LIFE JUST GOT BETTER: January 2012. These are pricier, BUT, they have the advantage of coming in very small bags, so that I am able to handle them easily. The larger the bag, the less the cost, but for convenience, nothing can beat this. And again, it comes right to your door!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00437H0OA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DEDJA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DHP04">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold Cat Food Ocean Fish, 16 oz - 12 Pack
