I just in the past two years have gotten interested in the science of baking.  I find comfort in the precision that is required to create biscuits, scones and bread.  I kept running across recipes that asked for buttermilk.  I'd go out and buy the buttermilk, use what I needed and eventually have to throw out the rest.  Every time I had to throw out this wonderful ingredient I cringed.  One day I noticed Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend on the shelf.  I picked up the container and read the label and much to my pleasure I saw that it just isn't a milk copy like a creamer for coffee, it is actually buttermilk.  I bought it and took it home to try not knowing what to expect. The first thing I made with it was buttermilk waffles and they were perfect.  Next biscuits they came out perfectly.  Then corn bread it was great too.  Since then I've made scones and bread with Saco Buttermilk. I've never been disappointed with the results.<br />So here is the deal.  When you use this product pay very close attention to how to mix water with your current use.  Sometimes it pays to just Saco buttermilk as one of the dry ingredients and others mix it as a liquid.  Once you master that, you will never have to throw out buttermilk again.
