The Cappuccino is a close very close 2nd place as my favorite drink from the Dolce Gusto. (The Chococino is my favorite, because, well, it's got chocolate.) The cappuccino is a rich frothy beverage with just the right coffee kick. I also like not having to wait around for it.<br /><br />I was curious about what was in the coffee capsules so I actually cut one open and, yes, that's real coffee, not powered "instant" coffee.<br /><br />One thing to note about the size of the drinks. The Dolce Gusto Cappuccino is an 8.2 oz drink. In Starbucks' world, this is a "short" drink, which is 8 oz., not a "tall" drink, which is 12 oz. Several years ago, Starbucks started selling customers a "tall" drink when they ordered a small drink, instead of the traditional small drink a "short".
