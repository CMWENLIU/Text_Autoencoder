(I've edited my review from what I originally wrote and updated to five stars.  I agree with the other reviewer about carageenan, after things I've read more recently. I've tried this product again and I still like it and now have no worries about carageenan.)<br />I really liked this. It has a nice consistency and tastes good, AND it's unsweetened. And the price is good here on Amazon.
