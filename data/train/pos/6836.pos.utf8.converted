I used to have EXTREMELY bad cramps during my time of the month. When I say EXTREME, I mean cramping so bad that I would have minor blackouts. My mother-in-law suggested I take some organic virgin coconut oil and I took a tablespoon of it, however it didn't taste good at all. It did make my cramps go away for that entire day. So my wonderful husband went out and bought me some of these capsules from the health food store, I was kind of skeptical b/c he paid $20 for it, but I thanked him and started popping the suggested amount, 3 caps, 3 times a day.<br /><br />Since the caps have a small amount in each cap, you have to take that many to get it in your system. The first month I took them, the cramps subsided to just enduring slight pain in the morning on my first day. The second month I didn't experience any PMS symptoms and even less pain on the first day. The third month I experienced NO PMS and NO PAIN through my whole 7 days. I've heard it is good for lowering your cholesterol and help maintain weight amongst other things. I'm just happy they made my cramps go away.
