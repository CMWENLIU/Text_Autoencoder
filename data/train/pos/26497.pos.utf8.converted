I had never tried this brand of tea & there are not very many reviews on it. But recently they ran a $10 off promo so i snagged this flavor along with some of the regular white tea.  It arrived yesterday & so far i have brewed 2 teapots with the same leaves.  Not sure how a third steeping will go but the 2nd one was as strong as the first.<br /><br />There are whole dried rosebuds mixed in with the tea, which consists of tightly rolled whole white and green tea leaves. (yes, there is green tea in this. it's not 100% white tea)<br /><br />There appears to be very little if any (i don't see any) broken pieces or tea dust like i see in many of the loose leaf teas i have purchased in the past.  This was a VERY nice surprise as usually a lot of little pieces of tea escape the strainer & end up in my tea cup. Well, not with this tea. :)<br /><br />The packaging is cute, it comes in the pink tin pictured here.  It has a metal lid that screws on/off.  Inside there is another lid (made of flexible plastic) to help keep the tea fresh. This inner lid has a tab so that it can be easily removed.<br /><br />The tea has a nice delicate flavor with a hint of jasmine in it.  I'm not sure if i detect rosebuds in the flavor (hard to say....what do rosebuds taste like???)  But they are definitely in there.  While the jasmine is there it isn't real real strong.  So if you prefer your jasmine tea to pack a punch this may not be for you.  I really like a nice cup of strong jasmine green tea. Of course i realize that this is a white & green tea mix.  Since white tea is much lighter & more delicate than green tea too much jasmine would probably overpower it.  Strong jasmine flavor or not, this tea is yummy. All i know is that i enjoyed everything about brewing & drinking this tea.  It is well packaged, has a pleasing aroma & flavor, and the leaves seem to be rolled with meticulous care.  It's a great quality tea & a nice addition to my collection.  I'm glad i bought it.
