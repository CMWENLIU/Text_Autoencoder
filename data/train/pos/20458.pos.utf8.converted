I've been hearing about the health benefits of true ceylon cinnamon and wanted to begin using it in food and teas.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered online.  Delivery took 1.5 to 2 weeks, but I was not disappointed.  It arrived in a foil pouch, as shown on the photo.  I transferred some to a small spice shaker bottle, and stored the remainder in the foil pouch, enclosed in a ziploc bag.  First, I tried pouring it into the spice bottle from the foil pouch, but spilled quite a bit on the counter.  If you plan to transfer to small containers, I suggest spooning/scooping it out into the container of your choice.  I also immediately made a 16oz cup of cinnamon tea, with one teaspoon cinnamon.  I love this cinnamon!  It smells and tastes wonderful.  The flavor is milder than "regular" cinnamon, which to me, is a good thing.  The texture looks and feels like powder, so it mixes very well.  I can't wait to try this in other recipes.<br /><br />Some have commented on the price of this cinnamon, but when I compare to what I've been paying for organic tea, the tea I make with this cinnamon is half the cost of the organic tea I've been buying in bulk.  ...and this tea smells much better.<br /><br />I definitely plan to purchase this cinnamon again.<br /><br />Update:  7Feb2012  I now add this cinnamon to my coffee, hot chocolate, and protein shakes.. and love the added flavor!  My favorite way to drink this as tea is about 1 teaspoon (or less) of cinnamon, 16 oz of hot water, and lemon juice.  This makes a healthy, delicious tea.  Cinnamon has also been shown to reduce glucose levels, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The smell of cinnamon supposedly also improves cognitive ability.. so I keep it around while my kids study.  I can't tell whether it's working, but they are happier and more alert while studying.
