I did not purchase this tea on Amazon (like I do everything else), but I came here to see what other people who used this tea felt about it. This may sound strange, but God led me to this tea back in October, but I didn't heed the 'sign' until recently. After having been on the pill for 10 years straight, I got off of them last year. My normal periods started up within two weeks, but then after a few months, they just stopped. I had started working out strenuously and not eating right and think this is what caused it. I eased up on the exercise but my period didn't come back (this started last July). After ruling out being pregnant, I prayed about it, asking God what was wrong with me. I'm pushing 40 and not quite ready for menopause and I didn't think this was what was wrong, but I was scared. I didn't go to the doctor because I didn't want to go back on the pill or any other type of drug.<br /><br />After a week or so of praying about this, I went into our kitchen at work (by now it's October, three months after my periods stopped)and was rooting around in the cabinets for something and found a box of Traditional Medicinals Raspberry Leaf Tea in there. I read the description and froze. It talked about how it works for irregular menstruation & promoting healthy menstruation. Was this God's answer to my prayers? I went online to do research but found more women who had used it while pregant than for irregular periods, but this whole herbal angle stuck with me and I went to something else for help - Vitex. I ordered the supplements from Amazon and took them for 2 weeks. It gave me horrible heartburn and I had to stop. Back to the drawing board, back to praying.<br /><br />Please know, I'm not a religious fanatic. I'm just a sinner who has faith in God. And sometimes it takes a while for me to realize He has already given an answer for something I keep praying about. After months without a period, worrying about it and trying to accept that I might not have anymore, a couple of weeks ago, I came across that box of tea in the kitchen where I work again. I had never given it a try - why not try it now? I went out and bought some and just started drinking it, 2 cups a day. Last week was my first week and it made me sleepy but I kept feeling these twinges in my lower abdomen. My guess is this was my uterus contracting. It was strange but it wasn't unbearable. I didn't stop drinking the tea though and got through last week. Then, this past Thursday, 3/28, I came home from work and went to the bathroom and was surprised to learn I was bleeding. Oh, my God! After less than 2 weeks on this tea, after eight months of uncertainty and worry, my period had returned. My flow is normal and I have no cramps. Hallelujah!! I know this is the first one, but I am thoroughly convinced this great tea is responsible. I just wish I had had the faith when I first saw this tea back in October.<br /><br />Sometimes God will snap His fingers and make things right for you, and somethimes, He will lead you to the tools to make things right for yourself. For anyone with irregular periods, I would definitely recommend trying this tea. I plan to keep it as part of my healthy daily regimen - and to pay better attention from now on when I pray! I will come back and write a follow up when I get my next period:-)
