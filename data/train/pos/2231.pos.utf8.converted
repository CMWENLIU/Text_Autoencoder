OK, so I became a coffeeaholic back in the 90's...since then I have tried just about every coffee imaginable....I have toiled with coffee presses...coffee grinders...pods...grind and brews...and you regular old drip mr. coffee pot.  I have owned at least 6 different machines not including espresso makers...so what's wrong, why can't I get a decent cup of coffee.  Oh sure, new machine I may like for a few months, but then it's back to mr. bitter coffee and many trips to DD and Starbucks...So what's wrong?  I'll tell you what's wrong, I kept passing by the $3 bag of 8 o'clock whole bean french roast with my nose in the air!  Fool!  I have been faithfully drinking this 8'clock coffee for 6 months now...I am beyond satisfied knowing EVERY cup will be a masterpiece.  I am now shunning DD and Starbucks...and my wallet thanks me.  Please give it a try...it will change your life...oh and, in case your interested, current coffee pot is a Melitta Mill & Brew which works well with the beans.<br />ENJOY!
