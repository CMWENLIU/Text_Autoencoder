My kids with multiple food allergies (including peanuts) already have enough on their plate without having to explain why they're eating weird looking stuff.  So I am thrilled to be able to recommend Sunbutter as a peanut butter substitute.  My kids don't have to do without that childhood lunch staple, the peanut-butter sandwich.<br /><br />Sunbutter doesn't taste like peanut butter; it tastes like sunflower seeds.  However, this is not an unpleasant taste, just different.  It has the exact same texture and mouth-feel as peanut butter, though, so it can be used as a straight substitute for peanut butter in all kinds of recipes.  We've used it as a substitute to make peanut-free peanut sauce, peanut butter cookies, and peanut butter fudge.  It functions exactly as peanut butter does, and as long as the sunflower-seed taste goes well in the recipe, it does just fine.  I should warn you, though, there are some contexts where the flavor just doesn't work with the recipe.  On the other hand you may find that some people will prefer the flavor.  Our neighbors don't have a single peanut-allergic kid, but they bought some Sunbutter anyway because their kids had it over at our peanut-free house and loved it.<br /><br />Sunbutter does have a couple of quirks.  First, if you expose it to alkali, it turns green.  So if you use it in a recipe that is heavy on the baking soda, you may get an unexpected result.  And of course since detergent is alkali, if you leave any on the knife and put it in the dishwasher, that which doesn't wash off will be a harmless but very ugly fecal shade of green.  Rinse thoroughly before putting Sunbutter-covered utensils in the dishwasher.  Second, it has more of a tendency than peanut butter to separate into oil and solids.  I used to buy it in the large tubs but when we'd open one up there was an inch-thick layer of sunflower oil on the top.  We tried to mix it in but then we found that the stuff at the bottom was so thick and dry that it couldn't be spreaded at all.  We developed two workarounds for this: one, upon opening a new container, we'd dump it in the mixer and mix it all up.  Two, buy smaller jars.<br /><br />Overall, three cheers for Sunbutter!
