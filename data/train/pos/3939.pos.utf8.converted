This product also comes in the single serving size<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />with little straws attached. The single-servings have 11.1 ounces, while the 34-ounce carton says it has four servings of 8.5 ounces each. I still drink about 11+ ounces per serving, so get a little more than 3 servings per carton.<br /><br />This is 100% pure natural coconut water, with no added sugar. The 8.5-ounce size serving contains 45 calories, 0 fat calories, 30mg of sodium, 515mg of potassium, 11g carbohydrate in the form of naturally-occurring sugars (no fiber), 0g protein, 4% of the daily value (based on a 2,000 calorie diet) of calcium, 4% daily value of phosphorous, 175% of the daily value of Vitamin C, 0% daily value of iron, and 8% daily value of magnesium. This means that Vita Coco 100% pure coconut water has more electrolytes, with 15 times more potassium, than leading sports drinks, without the added sugars and/or artificial sweeteners and other added ingredients (dyes, etc.)<br /><br />It gives excellent hydration. My only regret is that I didn't find Vita Coco before I did a 26.2-mile marathon back in 2002. I still take frequent walks, and with Vita Coco, I never cramp.<br /><br />I have noticed that my blood is clotting better/wounds are healing more quickly. I occasionally get small scratches from my cat, and have gotten various scratches from shrubbery encountered on my walks, and recently, a sharp knife got the better of me and I cut my fingertip. It was during these recent instances that I noticed the faster healing time and better blood clotting. I monitor my body's processes closely and can attribute these improvements, at least in large part, to consuming coconut water.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
