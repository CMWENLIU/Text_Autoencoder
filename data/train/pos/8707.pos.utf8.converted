I mix these with a 24 oz bottle of water instead of the 16.9 oz bottle it recommends and I absolutely love the flavor! I have tried all different types of Great Value, Crystal Light, Koolaid and Hawaiian Punch sugar free drinks and this is my favorite flavor.  You can not tell at all that it's sugar free and it makes it so much easier to drink the water your body needs for the day!
