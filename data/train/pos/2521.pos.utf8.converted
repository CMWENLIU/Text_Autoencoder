My dogs seem to love this stuff. It is neat to see the dried fruit bits in the mix of this dog food, my dogs love the bits so much they lick the bowl clean to get all the crumbs. Seems to be quite good quality dog food with good ingredients as I checked against many reviews. I will try to stay with this dog food if cost permits as I had originally purchased from Amazon when there was a special discount offer on it.<br /><br />I am also impressed with the shipping/packing of the dog food. I was worried that would receive bag of dog food that was worn out from shipping but it arrived inside appropriate box and with paper filler for safe shipping of dog food. Very happy!
