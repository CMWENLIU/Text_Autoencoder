Kraft's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette with Extra Virgin Olive Oil Reduced Fat Dressing (whew, what a long name) helps people like me who are on a diet. The taste is indeed bold but I think some of that "taste" comes from the sodium in this salad dressing. On the other hand, it is indeed made with extra virgin olive oil and that's wonderful. It has just 1 gram of fat in a 2 tablespoon serving (or 32 grams) and just 4 grams of carbs per serving. There are no artificial preservatives and that's a bonus.<br /><br />This is probably even better for your health than Amazon's nutrition facts would indicate. I don't think that Amazon got it quite right when they quoted the caloric content in the nutrition facts table above. On all of the bottles I have of this product (and yes, I matched it up with the picture--it's exactly the same product), the nutrition facts label on the bottles I have indicate that there are only 25 calories total per serving; and a serving consists of 2 tablespoonfuls. In addition, the nutrition facts label on the bottles I have indicate that the amount of calories that come from fat total only 10 calories per serving and not 25 calories as Amazon notes above. I would like to think that the Kraft nutrition label is correct; perhaps Amazon accidentally made a misprint or two above. Unfortunately, the amount of sodium indicated above on this webpage is accurate.<br /><br />Overall, this is great dressing. It tastes great; and it adds a punch to any salad. I simply can't find any salad dressing with fewer calories than this although you might have to watch it on the sodium if that's an issue for you. If you are on a salt-free diet check with a nutritionist or doctor first to make sure that this dressing is something you can enjoy on your salads. I use it on salads that have a mixture of romaine and iceberg lettuce with some carrots thrown in; and I'm sure it would go with a spinach salad as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!
