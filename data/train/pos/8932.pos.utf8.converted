These have to be my favorite noodle bowls EVER.  I originally purchased them at Big Lots for 60 cents per bowl.  I wasn't sure if I would like them, so only purchased a few bowls.  Big mistake!  I fell in love with them.  However, when I went back, they didn't have any more!  They did have the vegetable bowls, so bought some of them.  They are also tasty, but not as good as the mushroom.  I would love to buy more, but can't afford the asking price at Amazon.  If you can afford these, try them. They're great!
