Its about time Spanish products started getting their due.. The most famous (rightly so) Spanish cheese, Manchego, is world class, and is really tough to beat.  Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.  Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores.  They have great specials and offers, so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan.  Regardless, Manchego cheese is so good, you'll undoubtedly be back for more.. and more..  and more.
