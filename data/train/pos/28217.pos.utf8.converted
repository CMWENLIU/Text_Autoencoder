We have a seven year old Pekingese and she had really bad teeth, a lot of nasty buildup and her breath smelled like... well if you're looking for a product like this, you know. Last year, our Vet said we really needed to get her teeth cleaned and it was going to cost close to $400; not an cheap expense but something we were willing to live with to keep our pooch healthy. The Vet also said that the month of February is National Dog Teeth Cleaning Month or something like that and we could wait until then and get a discount (I didn't verify if there is a National Dog Teeth Cleaning Month). I looked at various different alternatives afterwards and decided to use this product and also a product called PetzLife Oral Care Spray. We used both for about 45 days before the dogs next Vet visit. The Vet said, "I don't know what you're doing to keep her teeth clean but keep doing what you're doing". That's all it took to have us sold.<br /><br />We gave her one of these treats once a day for the first 30 days and also used the spray every evening and kept her away from water for about 30 minutes. We still use the spray and she gets a treat about every other day. I don't know if she loves the spray but she tolerates it. She absolutely love the treats though. We're happy too; she can lick our face and we no longer worry about her breath smelling like... well if you're looking for a product like this, you know.
