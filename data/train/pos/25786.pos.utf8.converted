PB2 Powered Peanut Butter is a god-send!<br />I'm on Weight Watchers and a tablespoon full of PB2<br />makes my Protein Shake powder so much better!<br />And at only 2 points on the new PPV point system,<br />I can still get that P&B taste that I love for a reasonable<br />point count..... I tried both the regular and cocoa flavors<br />and both are equally as good --- now I have even<br />more choices.....<br />  If you love peanut butter but don't want the extra<br />calories --- try this great product!
