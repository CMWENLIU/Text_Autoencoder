My 10 year old dog has been plagued his entire life with back and joint pain.  We had tried Rimadyl, Deramaxx and Prednisone at different intervals over the years to give him some relief.  None of which worked.  Two months in on this Liquid Health K9 Glucosamine supplement, and he is med free and pain free.  I have never seen him so energetic and enjoy walking/playing so much.  This product is the real deal.  Keep in mind it takes at least a month for the glucosamine product to "kick-in".  Also I doubled the dose for the first week.
