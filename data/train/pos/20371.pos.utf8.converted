I've been using this curry for 25 years--I first saw it used at a Chinese restaurant I used to go to, and I copied their recipe. It is not as fiery as most Madras curry powders, so my kids like it. No sharp or off tastes--very smooth. The 4 pack of one pound tins from Amazon is an amazing deal--I've paid $7/lb when I can find Sun Brand, and other websites charge around $9/lb, and the 4 oz. tins are even more expensive, usually $3/tin (or $12/lb) in stores and other websites..
