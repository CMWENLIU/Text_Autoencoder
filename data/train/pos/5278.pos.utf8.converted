These do not look or smell very appetizing, but Casper loves them. He has been having his statutory 2 a day and wants more. He has found where they are stored and has demolished 3 paper towel rolls in an effort to get at the bags.<br />I haven't seen a dramatic improvement in his legs yet, but it does seem he is not limping quite so much. Time will tell. ***UPDATE**** Time did tell - NO MORE limping - brilliant!!!
