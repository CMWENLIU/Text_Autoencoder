I feed my cats a variety of canned foods, but I feel that Innova EVO is the best of the bunch.  I'm impressed by its protein-heavy ingredient list and the way that my cats gulp it down.  EVO has the highest protein count of any other commercial cat food.  My guys have shiny coats, lots of energy and are at just the right weight.
