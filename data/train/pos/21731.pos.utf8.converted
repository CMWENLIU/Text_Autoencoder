I'm a bit of a coffee snob and I have to agree with a leading consumer magazine about this coffee. It's good fresh tasting coffee without any faults and without the slightly burned flavor of the leading latte shops. You can pay a lot more but in my opinion you won't find anything better for the price. You really can't go wrong with it.
