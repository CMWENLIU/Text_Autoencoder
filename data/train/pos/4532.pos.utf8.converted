This is a high-quality product, and I agree with the first reviewer:  it would cost as much, if not more, to make this yourself from the same oils from retail bottles and jars. I've been making my own mayonnaise for years and while homemade is my favourite; with the price of top-quality, extra virgin olive oil right now, it just doesn't make any sense. And I'd hate to compromise with a lesser oil.<br /><br />This mayo is tasty as is and also takes very well to additions of lemon juice, minced garlic, dill, tarragon, and capers; as well as pureed roasted peppers, garlic, sea salt and cayenne pepper. I even use it for spicy tuna hand rolls:  mix finely chopped, sashimi-grade fresh tuna with some of this mayo, a bit of Nama Shoyu, Umeboshi plum vinegar, hot pepper toasted sesame oil and minced hot red chiles and scallions to taste. Now I'm all hungry.<br /><br />This is a great staple to have on hand, and will adapt to whatever you throw at it. Best of all, you can feel peaceful about eating the health-promoting fats in this mayo and avoiding the soy, canola, chemically treated salt and preservatives in the other brands out there.
