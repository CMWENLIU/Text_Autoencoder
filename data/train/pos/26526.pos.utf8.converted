I just tried this product for lunch, not expecting much, but I actually found it to be quite delicious. The sauce actually tastes like something you could get in a restaurant and the potatoes and chickpeas are not overly mushy. The portion size and preparation is perfect for a quick lunch and the fact that it doesn't have to be refridgerated is a plus. I will definitely be buying more of these meals for work.
