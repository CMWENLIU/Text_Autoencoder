This tea is wonderful. I was skeptical that it was going to help my cramps but I decided to try it. I knew the tea by itself is good for you and it's organic so I thought--why not? Because of this tea, this month is the second time I have not been popping Ibuprofen like candy. I drank this tea in the morning (double dose..2 bags in 1 cup) and 1 dose 3 hours later. I was at church so I didn't take the tea with me and the cramps were starting to bother me again. When I got home, I drank the tea and after 30 minutes, completely pain-free. I read raspberry leaf is good for the uterus..Anyway, it helped me. The tea has to steep for 10-15 minutes covered. Honestly a pleasant surprise. Everyone was telling me to take birth control pills to lessen severe cramps but I refuse to because of the serious side effects. Can't go wrong with natural.<br /><br />UPDATE: I cannot live without this stuff. It has consistently helped with my cramps. I will always buy this.
