Love the packaging of this tea - the bags are biodegradable, have no flavor, and allow for the expansion of the leaves contained inside. Yes, you read right: this tea bag contains intact tea leaves, like loose leaf, not fannings like most major bagged teas. Dream! This is def. the tea I've been waiting for. I don't know how they package these things without breaking leaves, but it's the best tea bag packaging I've seen. I actually prefer other flavors they have opposed to this one, but most people I know adore the green leaf tropical. Good buy for 3 boxes.
