I have been using Nutrajoint for a couple of years and it has reduced my hip arthritis symptoms significantly. I am using one scoopful a day in my morning coffee. At first I was skeptical, having tried the glucosamine products in the past, and found no relief. Gelatin (which is the main ingredient of Nutrajoint) was recommended by my doctor (with no guarantees of course ). I had been through physical therapy for my hips, followed by regular gym exercises for about 6 months with only minimal improvement. After about 3 weeks on Nutrajoint I started noticing a reduction in the frequency of hip joint pain episodes, even after relatively vigoruous physical activity. I continued to improve and now only experience discomfort in my hips infrequently compared to every week a few years ago. Nutrajoint is not a cure, but, combined with regular physical workouts, it has made living with hip arthritis alot easier. The only "side effect" I have noticed is that I am trimming my finger and toe nails more frequently ( of course, that indicates that Nutrajoint is doing its job !! )
