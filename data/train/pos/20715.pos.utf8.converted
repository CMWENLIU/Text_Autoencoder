I'll start by saying that if you already like the taste of wheat grass, you will probably like this product.  It mixes well and scoops out smoothly (no clumps).  Purchasing this product will taste just the same as you would get from a health foods shop.  Another positive point is that I am allergic to mold and did not have any reaction to this product.  (Sometimes cultivated wheat grass gets mold.  Not the case with this product.  I'm wondering if that may only be a concern of the fresh, recently grown/picked stuff.)<br /><br />I'll continue by saying that this was the second time I tried wheat grass.  I wasn't exactly fond of it before, and I still am not a huge fan.  It has a very earthy and strong flavor.  Even when you mix it into drinks, you still taste the wheat grass.  I highly suggest trying it first at a health foods shop before buying it online.  I plan on finishing this container (mostly because I am stubborn and don't want to waste a good product).  I've found that it is best to mix it (in small quantities) into drinks or smoothies that already have a strong flavor.  If you mix one part wheat grass and 2-3 parts your other drink, the wheat grass taste is muted a little (not completely) and it's tolerable to drink.  I do this every so often and it feels nice to know that I'm doing something good for my body.  (Next time, though, I'll just eat spinach!)
