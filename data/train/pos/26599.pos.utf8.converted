Seattle Gourmet Foods is a company I found through Amazon.com The past few years I have found myself ordering more and more on the internet.I always skipped the reviews because I just thought they were probably written by people who benefited from my purchase. However, I have become very dependent on what my fellow shoppers have to say,and really surprised when I realized Amazon allow customers comments good and bad to be printed.<br />Anyway that being said I will tell you this product came and was delivered as promised.There are so many in this barrel shaped container it almost seems bottomless.The chocolate covered gems are so rich and creamy with just the right amount of chocolate covering the crunchy fresh expresso bean in the middle.Just a few will do you packing a delicious caffein buzz! I thought they were a bit expensive when I first placed my order, hoping the saying "you get what you pay for" was true I orderd anyway and am very pleased with the value. Getting what I paid for and a whole lot more.<br /><br />Thanks from one very satisfied customer on Morgantown Pa.<br />Karen
