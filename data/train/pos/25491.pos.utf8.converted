I ordered Black Tiger by accident...I like the new(and economical)packaging of the Coffee People coffee, and meant to order the Donut Shop medium coffee in the "new box". When I tried Black tiger, I liked it.It's a bit strong, but not burned tasting.I add a little water sometimes to bring it to my taste. So I now have both Donut Shop and Black Tiger, and, love them both! And...I love my Keurig coffee maker(a Christmas gift for my husband and I from our daughter). A little bit of a luxury, but I have fresh cup of coffee every time!
