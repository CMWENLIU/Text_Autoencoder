No need to look. This is the best deal on Agave. Agave is the answer to the sugar issue. Its better tasting than Honey and can replace sugar in any situation. Is said to be very low on the glycemic index and a good choice for Diabetics. Is delicious on pancakes or sundays. Is made from the nectar of the cactus plant. Can be used by Vegans. Try it and you will be convinced. My family loves it. Desolves quickly, unlike sugar or Honey. Great in coffee or tea. Keep a squeeze bottle at the coffee pot at home or in the office!
