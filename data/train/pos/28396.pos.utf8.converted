I love Green Mountain's Mocha Nut Fudge k-cups. The chocolate and nut flavors are nice and strong, and it's fabulous with just a little sweetener and creamer (with most coffees I find myself using a ton of both). So I was really excited when I received the alert saying it was now available through Amazon. I've been purchasing this elsewhere online for months, and looked forward to ditching the shipping costs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even with shipping, the price of two 24-count boxes on the other site is a good $10 cheaper than the $38.99 offered here. Definitely try this coffee, but shop around and I guarantee you'll find it for less.
