I got for a Christas gift the Starbuckd three pack with the choch covefed espreson beans, choch coverev chrerries and the chock covdred alomod bars. while the later  was , least favofite, the former two blew my mind with all their chocholatey goodess. Needless to say when the season was over so were the chocholates; so I became a woman on a mssion. I found then! (NOT the brand, of course),Ghiradelli is next to perfect! I love them SO much not only did I order one order of three choch covered espresso  beans, but two of the choch covered cherries. Ok, so I love then SO much I placed TWO more orders, only this time with more of the cherries.<br />Now, that said, I've NEVER been a fan of the choch covered cherries, but these are NOT like the the traditional cordials with that gooey liquidy center that makes them too sweet for my taste. Needless to say I'll have enough to last me a while...at least a week or so, lol.<br />enoy!<br />OH, did I mention the packges are small...but dont all good things come in small packages?<br />Rachel
