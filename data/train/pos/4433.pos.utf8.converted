My cats loved this dry food. For me, it's a toss up between this brand and Merrick's Before Grain. They are both extremely high in protein with no additives and added calories. My obese cat definitely doesn't need that in his life. When I fed this to them as a treat, they took to it right away. Even my finicky cat came up to me when it was time to give them some of this food. They both ran, meowing, and circled my legs until I was done pulling the contents out of the bag. I was amazed to see my finicky one react that way. He has only reacted that was with Merrick brand foods, both wet and dry, and Innova Evo.
