This Coffee is strong. Everything I drink says bold or extra bold on the label. This coffee is strong. If you don't like it strong back up slowly and step away from the Jet Fuel.<br />On first drink this one can be overpowering. By the third time you drink it you'll enjoy the punch. I love this coffee. It might be my favorite.<br />I like Wake Up Call and Parisian Nights for every day, but I only drink one cup on weekends and this really hits the spot. No over roasted flavor here. Just really good strong coffee.
