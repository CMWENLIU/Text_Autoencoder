I use this product for breading anything from pork chops to fish.  I mix it with parmesan, which drops the carb count (my husband had type 2 diabetes), and dried italian herbs and it makes a great alternative to bread crumbs.  We also feel like we are having a treat whilst still eating healthfully and on top of all that, it keeps the meat/fish etc moist!!
