I'm celiac and raw vegan.  One taste of these delightful crackers and I was hooked, enough so that I bent the rules of my raw vegan diet to allow for Mary's Gone.  Even if I were not celiac, I'd have my pantry stocked with these crackers.  I live in hurricane country so I want my pantry stocked well with nutritious food in case of emergency.  Mary's sure are nutritious, delicious and way more convenient than dehydrating my own raw crackers which I'm not always up for preparing.  Bravo, Mary!
