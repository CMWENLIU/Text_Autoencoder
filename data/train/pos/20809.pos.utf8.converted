I was so excited to find these on Amazon; I have been waiting for a company to start growing GF oats, that are also organic, for so long!  High praises to the Gluten Free Oats company for being the first (to my knowledge) in offering these.  It just seems logical that folks who have food intolerances and/or allergies, would also be very conscientious about the quality of their food.  So it baffles me why so many GF foods are not also organic.  So glad this company took the initiative.  My Celiac daughter and I were so delighted to have oatmeal for the first time in years. The oats are very fresh tasting and cook up nicely for oatmeal.  The oats cooked up nicely in pancakes too.  I pre-soaked them in rice milk and the result was that the oats completely blended in and there was no discernible texture to the oats once the pancakes were cooked.  I actually would have preferred a little texture, so next time I will make pancakes without pre-soaking the oats.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the bag had "popped" open during shipping.  It was packed with other items and a heavy item probably squished the bag until it popped.  So sad to see 1/3+ of a bag wasted, but Amazon was great and quickly sent me a new bag.  I intended to order another bag or two tonight, but see that they are already out of stock!  Guess I'm not the only one who has been waiting for organic, GF oats.
