I heard a lot about Chai tea and was very curious. The one from Celestial is the only one I tried so far but I have to say it is great. As said in the instructions, replace a 1/4 of the hot water with milk. I love my tea with a lot of milk but while it usually weakens the taste, milk is mandatory here. Due to this it even convinced a person who rejected tea before as 'coloured hot water'. Actually, it resembles a bit a light latte with a hint of cinnamon and cardamom. Yummy!
