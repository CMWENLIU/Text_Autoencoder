I used these beans to make hummus and they worked wonderfully.<br /><br />I used the overnight soaking method (on package). I also added a stick of kombu (which Eden also sells) to the water.<br /><br />The beans in the package were clean with no extraneous debris.<br /><br />Before deciding to buy this product I visited the Eden web site as amazon.com is very lacking in the information and support they provide for the food stuffs they sell.<br /><br />One concern I have is the expiration date on the package. It's 120C28. I assume this code is made deliberately so that I will not be able to tell whether I'm getting a product that is at the end of its shelf life. With six boxes that is a concern.
