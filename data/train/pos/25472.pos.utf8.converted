I found these at our local base commissary and literally squealed with delight when I saw them!  I loved these things when I was a kid (I am 30).  I was so disappointed when the company closed down.  I was worried when I opened the package that they would just not taste the same but fear not, they are just as I remember.  The cookies look the same, feel the same, taste the same!  I am so happy they are back and my children enjoy them just as much as I did when I was their age.
