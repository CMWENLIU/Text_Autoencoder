I'm at the end of a HCG diet and have been eating these 0 calorie noodles as part of my dinner.  They don't have a lot of taste but they do pick up the taste of whatever you put on them.  They help fill me up and make me feel like I'm really eating dinner.  The best deal has been purchasing them on Amazon and buying enough to take advantage of the free shipping
