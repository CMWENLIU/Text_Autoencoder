I bought this for a friend as she mentioned she had received some crazy tea from someone else with a flower in it. I went searching and found this. She said it was even better than the one she had tried. Apparently it goes great with Italian Cream Cake too! I don't drink tea, so I'll trust her taste. Plus, it really is a fun gift for tea drinkers.
