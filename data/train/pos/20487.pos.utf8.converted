I have been gluten-free for over 5 years and dairy and soy-free for 9 months. My daughter has been corn-free for quite some time and gluten and dairy-free for the past 10 months. We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us. It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy. And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her. We are now in heaven and love all three flavors, but my favorite is the Banana Maple and mu daughter's fav is the Maple Raisin. We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever. It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!
