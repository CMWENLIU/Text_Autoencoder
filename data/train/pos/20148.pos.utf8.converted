I was introduced to this product at a Christmas party.  A local beverage distributor brought a selection of wines for party guests to sample. He also brought a box of these chocolates for us to eat with the port wine he served after dinner.  I was very impressed and had to find some of these chocolates to share with my guests.  These chocolates have a rich chocolate flavor that makes other chocolate seem tasteless.  I don't recommend eating the whole box at a sitting, but eating one or two with a glass of fine port wine puts a wonderful finish on any special occassion.
