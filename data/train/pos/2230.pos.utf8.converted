Green Label is my best friend. This is the Scotch I enjoy drinking regularly.<br /><br />Green Label is a smoky Scotch. One of the first single malts I ever tasted was Lagavulin, and eventually came to love Taliskar and Laphroaig. One day a buddy gave me a bottle of Blue Label as a present (yes he is a good buddy), and my days of drinking only single malt were few. I stumbled on Green Label in a four bottle Johnnie Walker tasting set. Green became my best friend that day.<br /><br />The first flavor is strong smoke and grass / peat flavor. Once the smoke clears, I get orange and fig flavors. It is all nicely blended and softened around the edges. This is one of the few Scotches I drink with no ice or water. The Scotches used for blending are all at least 15 years old, and that makes this easy to drink.<br /><br />I drink this regularly because it has some of the complexity and smoothness of Blue Label, without the high cost. I don't have to rationalize getting down the bottle of Green Label, unlike Blue. This is a softer smoother Scotch than Black or Double Black Label. I particularly like the aftertaste of Green Label.<br /><br />Green Label isn't always easy to find, but it is worth seeking out.
