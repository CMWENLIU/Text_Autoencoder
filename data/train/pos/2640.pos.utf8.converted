Very good, I just tried it tonight...you have to mix it well...but it is very good, it tastes like the miso soup that I had in a Sushi Restaurant a few days ago... Though the tofu pieces are small, the rich taste makes up for it...and if you want more tofu...I suggest buying firm tofu separately, then adding it when you make the soup...that's what I'm going to do... I hope this helped you... :)
