It not like fresh- but how much time and energy do you have to find real buttermilk and have it on hand for spontaneous baking frenzies?<br /><br /> This is great to have around, just keep it in an airtight  canister in a cool place. No, it's not for drinking. But powdered milk has never been for drinking, it's for preople who need to drive 30 miles to a grocery and need to cook a dinner party at the last minute.  I love this stuff, better biscuits and life easier.<br /><br />Keeping kitchen inventory up can be tough with perishables. This is a great idea.
