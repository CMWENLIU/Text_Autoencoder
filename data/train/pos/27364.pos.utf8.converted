Love this formula. All of the nutrition, none of the ridiculous crap.<br />My son started to self-wean around 8 months, which was devastating for me since I know the wonderful benefits of human milk for human babies. I researched a TON--from goat's milk, to raw milk, to every formula under the sun. This was the best option I could find. The ease of not having to refrigerate it, combined with it being the closest to human milk as you can get--even down to tasting slightly sweet. Yes, I tasted it.<br />I love that they have a lactose-free option that isn't soy. Soy mimics estrogen and should not be fed to infant boys. Or girls, for that matter.<br />It does tend to be foamy when you shake it up, but we just scooped it off with a spoon--no biggie. Even if we didn't remove the foam, son didn't get gassy from it.<br />I know it says it's a Toddler Formula for 12 months and up, but that is because the company is a proponent of breastfeeding for the first year. I actually think it's admirable for them to do that. This company's obviously not like the mass-market big brands.
