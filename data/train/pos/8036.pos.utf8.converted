If one of your New Year's resolutions is to snack more intelligently (without giving up the taste of a great snack), then Eden Organic's Dry Roasted Spicy Pumpkin Seeds are an option that's worth trying.<br /><br />I find their non-spicy pumpkin seeds to be a little bland, but these have just the right mix of cayenne pepper, garlic, and tamari soy sauce.  Relatively low in sodium, they are rich in protein and fiber, and pumpkin seeds are naturally high in nutrients such as manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, tryptophan, and zinc.<br /><br />Amazon's case price means I save almost $2.00 a bag over my local health food store, but the most important element to consider is that this is a great snack!
