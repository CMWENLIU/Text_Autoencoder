I orginally found this product after complaining to Nylabone.  I had bought one of their 'Pit Bull Tested' toys - some knobby thing -  for my half pit bull mutt.  He enjoyed the knobby thing but it was in tiny bits in under 5 minutes.  I pulled the package out of the trash and emailed nylabone with a complaint.  Much to my surprise they responded the next day and sent me the Galileo Souper bone at no charge. My dog loved it.  Nylabone later paid my dog $25 to test a new and improved 'knobby' product but it didn't last either.  However the Galileos are great and we keep buying them.  We get about 9-12 mos out of each one before they get down to plum size.  They keep his teeth nice and clean too.  The floor does tend to vibrate when he grasps it with his paws and start gnawing (wood floor over a crawl space) which is a little odd but does impress visitors :-)
