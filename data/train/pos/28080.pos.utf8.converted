I initially purchased this after reading an article in a food magazine which highlighted the high fiber content. On top of that I absolutely love Coconut and am always looking for new and exciting products for the kitchen. Of course, Coconut flour just sounds good so I simply had to give it a try. I am glad I did as its really one of the more unique flours I have ever come across. First and foremost it is absolutely wonderful in homemade smoothies, as others on here have already suggested. It has a very subtle flavor and really compliments a lot of smoothie recipes perfectly. You can really up the fiber content of your smoothie without severely effecting the overall flavor.<br /><br />Another great way to use coconut flour is with chicken or shrimp. Simply dip the chicken or shrimp in an egg bath and then coat with coconut flour. We then brush on a little more egg and sprinkle some Red Bob's Unsweetened Coconut flakes on top. We then fry using coconut oil. Its important to note that we fry at a lower temperature so as not to destroy all the nutritional value of the Coconut oil. High temperatures really kill a lot of the nutritional value of oils so I recommend cooking at lower temperatures when using oils like coconut oil or olive oil.<br /><br />We also tried coconut flour in many other recipes including my families nutball recipe. The first attempts didn't work out too well but we eventually found a good substitution ratio and the results were really quite amazing. We have also made muffins, pancakes and even english muffins. What I have learned is that Coconut flour is truly a unique flour and with a little bit of experimentation and patience, it can really be an amazing substitute for more popular flours. It is a much dryer flour and as such you will have to compensate for that in your recipes. Many times this can be countered by adding more eggs. I have found that a good starting point is a substitution of roughly 20-30%. Its also important to note that most of the fat/oil has been taken out so Coconut flour is not a good source for people looking to get coconut oil into their diet. You need to buy the meat or the oil separately if your looking to put some coconut oil into your diet. The flour itself actually goes through processes that pull the oil out.<br /><br />Bottom line - Coconut flour really is a very unique flour. It has a light flavor and can really add magic to your recipes. On top of that its absolutely loaded with fiber. Coconut flour will make a magnificent addition to your kitchen cupboard. Again all it takes is a little experimentation and a little patience and you will quickly learn just how wonderful this flour really is. I cant give this flour a higher recommendation.
