This is a beautifully aromatic fine tea, redolent of the delicate scent of oranges and spices. The aroma is absolutely heavenly and is, in and of itself, enough to make one feel good. The tea is simply delicious, light and flavorful. One may sip it with or without milk, and one will enjoy it just the same. Each tea bag is strong enough to make two delightful cups of tea. Constant Comment is, undoubtedly, my favorite tea. It is no wonder to me that it is so popular.<br /><br />Moreover, each tea bag is individually foil wrapped, so as to make it especially convenient. One may simply grab one of two of these foil wrapped tea bags and slip it into one purse, backpack, or pocket and take it to work for a refreshing afternoon cup of one's favorite tea.
