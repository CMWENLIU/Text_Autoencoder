I had been searching high and low for popcorn seasoning and finally found what I was looking for with Cornzapoppin.  I ended up buying the Sour Cream & Chive, Parmesan & Garlic, Jalapeno and Barbeque.  I wasnt sure which one I would like so I got a "sampler" order.  I liked all the flavors to differing degrees but definitely preferred the Sour Cream & Chives.  It was a perfect blend of seasonings and strength of flavor.  If you are not sure which flavor seasoning to choose, I would recommend the Sour Cream.
