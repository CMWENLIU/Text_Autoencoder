Like most who find out about the GF world, we've tried all the pastas we could with mixed results.  The rice pasta would be a gummy mess and don't ask about leftovers...  The corn based pastas weren't bad, but still not as close to the old wheat flour pastas as Heartland GF pastas.  There's another GF company who also does a really good corn/rice pasta blend, but comparatively Heartland is a better buy and hard to tell the difference.  Now with both WM and Amazon carrying them it's a great buy vs. others at $4+/box!  Well, until Heartland or the like make the corn-rice blend in a full-size lasagna sheet we'll just have spaghetti night around our house until then.  At least now we're able to fully enjoy it!
