Bob's White Rice Flour is my most-used gluten-free flour.  I use it for baking and also as a thickener for soups and gravies.  When I use it to make cakes, I mix it with corn starch and my cakes are unfailingly light and moist.  I use so much of Bob's white rice Flour that I decided to save money on it by subscribing to regular shipments in bulk.  Thank you, Amazon, for being there for the gluten-intolerant!
