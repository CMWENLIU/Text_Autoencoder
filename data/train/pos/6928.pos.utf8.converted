This product IS truly amazing.  It tastes wonderful, has organic ingredients, and helped to increase my energy levels and cut down my cravings for desserts and sweets.  All you need is one scoop a day (although you can have 1-3 servings).  I chose to add mine to soy or almond milk (because there is a lot of sugar in milk) and then I throw it in the blender with what ever fruit I feel like enjoying that day.  It tastes like a chocolate smoothie!  I am not a mother yet, but in the future I would definitely supplement my child's diet with this (they do make it for children as well). It helps the body get the nutrients it requires and tastes fantastic!  By far the best I have ever tried.  I read some reviewers had difficulty mixing it, but if you put it in the blender for 30 seconds you don't have to worry about any sediment on the bottom of your glass.  I just make sure to rinse the blender before it dries on it because then you have to scrub it a little.  If you don't have a blender I am sure you could put it in a cup with a lid and shake it vigorously.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.  It's more like a treat than a supplement.
