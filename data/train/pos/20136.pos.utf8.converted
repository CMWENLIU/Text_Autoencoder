I've been using these boullion cubes since I lived in Japan and had to buy all my health food online. They are made in Switzerland, are vegan and gluten-free, and are perfect for the gluten-free chef's kitchen. I like the flavor much better than packaged stocks, and although of course making your own stock or broth from fresh veggies is better, it is really convenient to have these cubes on hand for adding a little flavor to recipes. I use them in Chinese dishes, for risotto, and of course for soups or stews. I like the fact that they are convenient to store, don't go bad (within reason), and don't have to be stored in the refrigerator. They also have a low-sodium variety which unfortunately does not seem to be offered by Amazon. Also, love that these are available for Prime/free shipping. They run around $3.70 per package in California so this bulk offer is a good deal, if you don't mind storing a box. They are also soy free, but are not corn-free, if you have a corn intolerance.<br /><br />Happy cooking!<br />-gluten-free chef in California
