5-Hour Energy Drink actually does work.  If I am exhausted, it does not make me feel great, but it will get me through.  It creates enhanced alertness, also seems to have a positive effect on eyesight and helps with tired eyes.  It does take most of the "awfulness" out of being overly tired, and can make it possible to do the things I still need to do if the day is not over, even if I wish it were.  The first time you take it, everything may seem "brighter" for a few moments (light sources may seem to "pop" slightly more than normal).  This passes, and it feels like you were able to take a 90-minute power nap.  For me, it lasts a bit less than the full 5 hours, but it is a very welcome boost.  There really is no crash for me when it wears off, as advertised, and it does not make me feel "wired", just more alert.  Not bad for something that comes in a little bottle for a couple bucks.  As with all good things, be sensible, and if you choose to try it, use in moderation.  I do not and would not use this every day, but it is nice to know it is there when needed from time to time.
