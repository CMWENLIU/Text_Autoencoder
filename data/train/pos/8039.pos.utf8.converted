I've tried many other hemp powders and I found them far too grainy, but this product is nice and fine so it mixes easily and while I wouldn't drink it straight with just water, I find it adds a nice nutty flavor when mixed with almond milk or rice milk.  I usually blend 3 tbs. hemp powder, 1 banana, about 8 oz. almond milk and a dash of cinnamon for a good vegan post-workout drink.
