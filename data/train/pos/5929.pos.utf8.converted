Here's some info that was important to me. The first few ingredients are; chicken meal, chicken, brewers rice, chicken fat, egg product, cracked pearled barley,... Crude protein 32%, crude fat 25%. 4710kcal/kg (2143kcal/pound)(470 kcal/cup)ME. Feeding Guide on the bag suggests about 4 cups/100 pound weight of an adult dog. I paid some cents over $1.00 a pound.<br /><br />We have 6 dogs, combined weighing 550 pounds. We live in a rural area where the dogs can run a lot. One of our dogs is under weight by 20+ pounds. After lab work the vet's determination was a high metabolism.<br /><br />The Thin One doesn't have the time to stand around a food bowl for the 10 to 12 cups other dog foods were suggesting. She can deal with 5 to 6 cups of the Diamond Extreme Athlete. I've been researching and trying foods for over a year.  I've feed elk, deer, bison, cow, goat, chicken, no grain, with grain, the list goes on. While the debate over "quality" ingredients rages on, nothing works if it's left in the bowl.<br /><br />I'll buy it again. A 40 pound bag lasts me like 100 pounds of some other brands. The price is very good, and it was delivered UPS. The most important thing is that all 6 dogs like it.
