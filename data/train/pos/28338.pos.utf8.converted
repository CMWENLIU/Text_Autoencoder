With our children having been recently diagnosed with Celiac disease (Gluten intollerance), this product has been a great discovery as an excellent gluten free hot breakfast cereal.  Our middle son requests "Rice & Shine" pretty much every morning, and preparation/microwave cook time is approximately 10 minutes which helps for those crazy school day mornings.  We are very happy to have found this product!
