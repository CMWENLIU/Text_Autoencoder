Being allergic to corn REALLY sucks because there are not that many cereals that don't contain corn in them (heck even plain ol Rice Krispies do... didn't know that did you?). So I am very glad to see Barbara's Bakery able to fulfill this need.<br /><br />The Honey Rice Puffins maintain that perfect balance of being sweet, but not too sweet. Far too many sweetened cereals just go overboard in making them so saccharine it's inedible.<br /><br />They stay very crunchy in milk. My preferred method is to have them with some plain greek yogurt, great breakfast or mid morning snack for me.<br /><br />With a solid 3 grams of fiber, 1 gram of fat and only 120 calories per serving, they fit perfectly well in my diet.<br /><br />Tons of crunch, sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, and healthy, can't get much better then this!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Corn free and gluten free (less then 20ppm)!<br />Actually has some fiber in it.<br />Stays crunchy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Kinda pricy, but that's expected.
