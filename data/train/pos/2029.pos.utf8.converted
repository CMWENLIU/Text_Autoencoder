My husband and I switched to Stevia in place of sugar and other artifical sweeteners.<br /><br />The product is completely safe (you can web search for many studies) and now we saw on the news that Coca Cola is going to try it as an alternate sweetener!  It is used outside the United States normally!<br /><br />We tried many Stevias but this one tastes great and is economical!  We are Southerners and drink lots of ice tea and just a teaspoon sweetens a whole gallon of tea!  It melts easy and stores great! You use so little, the jar lasts a long time!<br /><br />Some say even this product tastes bitter.  That is because you are over doing the amount!  Back off with less and you will find the taste like sugar (and not artifical tasting like the artifical sweeteners).<br /><br />My husband was showing pre-diabetic tendencies and he only drinks Stevia for sweetener now.  He is a very "picky" eater and he loves the taste!<br /><br />We would "cry" if they stopped making this!
