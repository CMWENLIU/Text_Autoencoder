Lavazza makes excellent espresso which for a widely available "mass-market" espresso a huge step up from the American drek like "Starbucks" or anything found found in local supermarkets. A bit more robust & flavorful than the fine but delicate Illy without the burnt  harshness of Starbucks or "Gloria Jeans" or chain beaneries. Espresso should be flavorful but not burnt. It is also worth noting that most specialty shops or restaurant depots in this area will not have this particular Lavazza bean from my experience.<br /><br />Lavazza makes several espresso bean varieties (and some preground) and this particular one is very good and one I've used for years with other Lavazza espresso. Nice crema, smooth taste and you are probably more limited by your espresso machine and barista skills than you are this espresso roast :-)<br /><br />Making 3-5 cups daily of espresso one thing i really like about Lavazza beans are consistent in taste, texture and oily-ness, so you don't have to constantly tweak your grinder. I've tried many different brands & roasts but always seem to come back to Lavazza.<br /><br />The Lavazza beans also stays "fresh" quite long after opening the bag. They taste the same the first day you open the bag as they do a few weeks later. This is very handy if you do not go through a few pounds every few days so you neither have to throw out beans nor go espresso shopping every few days. Who knows how long the Lavazza bags sit in storage, but I have never encountered a stale bag which speaks well for the consistency of this product.<br /><br />I have used local roasters espresso beans and have found they typically do not hold it their flavor long. It seems the immediate "fresh" taste is great but in a few DAYS the local roasters beans fall off quickly in terms of being much drier (need to play with grinder every use) as well as become less flavorful and more bitter over time. Lavazza beans do not suffer from that problem which is another benefit.<br /><br />Lavazza is probably not the beans for tweak-and-geekers who like home-roast (ie. char-broiled beans) and prepare espresso more than they actually like to drink and enjoy it's taste. For real-life espresso drinkers who appreciate fine Italian espresso, Lavazza is a good place to start.
