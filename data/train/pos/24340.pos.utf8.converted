I ordered this gift basket for my brother and sister-in-law for Christmas and had it shipped directly to them.  I got a great price because it was a "lightning" deal and shipping/tax was free.  It arrived on time and was a big surprise for them!  They phoned immediately to thank me, and tell me how impressed they were with the size of the basket and the amount of its contents.  I asked, "Was it really that big?"  They said, "Yes!  It arrived in a huge box, and it was really big."  I'm so glad I bought it for them as it was obvious that they were genuinely impressed.  It always makes me proud to send a gift that turns out to be so great - unlike ordering $100 in flowers that look like $10 worth.  I will not hesitate to buy from this company again.  And thanks also goes to Amazon for their bringing such a nice gift box on a lightning deal.
