This soup is very good.  It has a nice flavor and is a solid comfort food. The container makes it practical for a fast meal, especially at work. The soup contains enough chicken to validate it's name "chunky chicken."  The vegetables are substantial and hearty which makes it a real chowder and a meal in itself.  Quick, easy and tasty -- you can't ask for more than that.  Enjoy.
