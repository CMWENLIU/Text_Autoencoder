I ordered this a month ago and have been using it in place of table salt since. I have to say, I want to believe the claims of this salt so I am hoping it's true. Everyone that has seen it thinks I fell for another scam from the over-hyped nutritional market. I will go one using it until I see data that proves contrary to this companies claims. It is moist (and pink) and I am keeping it in a glass jar. I do believe that table salt (Morton's etc.) is nutritionally devoid of minerals,etc. and it always burned my mouth/tongue like a chemical, so I never cared for table salt. But our bodies need salt so, Himalayan Crystal Sea salt is natural and nutritional--but expensive. Well, anything that has value today is expensive!!!!
