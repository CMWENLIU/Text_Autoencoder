As a Korean native I've had many different kinds of ramyun because it is a big part of our culture.  Shin ramyun is by far THE BEST spicy ramyun on the market and most Koreans I know agrees with me.  If you're not good with spicy food then I would not recommend this ramyun because you will be sweating like pig!  If you love spicy food and if you love ramyun then this your best bet.  Won't regret it!
