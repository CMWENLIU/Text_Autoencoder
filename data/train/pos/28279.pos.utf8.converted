I bought this for my mother for mother's day, and she loved it! She said it arrived in great condition and with instructions and everything she needed. The shipping was really fast. The tree seems to have arrived in perfect condition, she mentioned a couple of leaves had fallen off, but that the flower was intact. It's been about 2 months now, and the now wants to have more bonsai trees as a result. Great buy for a great price!
