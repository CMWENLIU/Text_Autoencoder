I really like this tea.  It has a naturally sweet taste without the use of any added sweeteners.  (There are no artifical sweeteners added to this tea.  Check out the complete ingredients list shown in the Label Information area.)<br /><br />I don't find the licorice flavor to be overly strong, but you will need to like the flavor of licorice to enjoy this blend.  The hint of cinnamon, ginger and pepper adds a touch of warmth to the blend, while the orange, clove and cardamom boost the spicy sweetness of the tea.  This is now my favorite organic herbal tea and I can't wait to try the Egyptian Licorice Mint tea too.
