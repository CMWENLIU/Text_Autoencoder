Bought this to clean our eight year old dishwasher. Now, every three to four weeks, we run the dishwasher empty with only the citric acid added. We fill the soap dispenser with it, then when the dishwasher's in the middle of its cycle, we open the door and add a little more. Does a great job cleaning the dishwasher and getting rid of any built up residue, etc. Dishwasher looks like new afterwards.<br /><br />Works as well as the Dishwasher Magic product (its active ingredient is citric acid -- 3 ounces of it in each 12 ounce bottle) and ends up being less than one-third the cost.
