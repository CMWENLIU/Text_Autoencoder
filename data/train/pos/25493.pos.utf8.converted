Sweet! I found Black Tiger in the display or coffees at my car dealer while I was waiting for my car and tried a cup. It was fantastic; just the right blend of acidity and richness in a coffee with a good punch. I came home and ordered some for myself and, while I keep trying different K-Cups, I keep going back to the Tiger.
