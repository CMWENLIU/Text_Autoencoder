This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!<br /><br />I used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix, but with this product it is all done for me. It's also good with raisins added.<br /><br />I'm delighted that Amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. The special offers bring the price within reason.
