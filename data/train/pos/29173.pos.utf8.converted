I am not a fan of hot sauce. My brother is the crazy one in our family who loves hot sauce, he eats red hot small chili peppers too. Anyway, I have been trying to find a hot sauce for him where he would eventually say "yup, its really HOT". Found this one and sent it to him. According to him, this is really hot and taste good too. He says he rates it a 5 star.<br />Found another hot sauce for him 357 Mad Dog Collectors Edition and sent it to him to try. Oh boy, almost got him a hospital visit. He said he thought he was going to pass out from the fire in his mouth and throat. I did warn him that it has 6million scoville and that it was suppose to be hot, well he finally said that this was the hottest hot sauce ever. He only uses a drop or 2 of this and he said he uses 1/2 teaspoon on Daves Total insanity if he uses it. Daves taste better, and hands down on 357.<br />Sorry, cant really do a personal review on this, I would probably go to the hospital if I get a drop of Daves and funeral on 357.  :-)
