I must admit I was a bit skeptical about this product and the promise that it will actually enhance the spirits that flow through it.  After now using it for a few weeks I can testify the product really does work.  Side-by-side tests confirm.  My bourbons poured through this product have more "nose" and I can clearly pick up on nuances that otherwise would not come through.  If you are a serious bourbon drinker, this product is a must.
