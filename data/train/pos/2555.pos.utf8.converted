I've been buying this cereal for about a year. I usually would purchase at my local grocery store or Target. I really enjoy the taste and the vanilla almonds add great flavor and the crunch is magnificent!<br /><br />After seeing the smaller boxes on sale at my local grocer for 3 for 10, I scanned the bar code on my Amazon Mobile app and was amazed that I could get the larger family size box for around the same price.  What a deal.<br /><br />When the boxes arrived, the expiration dates on the cereal were over a year away so they are very fresh (in addition to being sealed and boxed). The product was identical to what I can get in the store, but much cheaper and delivered to my doorstep!<br /><br />A+ Amazon!
