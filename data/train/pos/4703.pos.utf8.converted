For not boiling any ingreidients this is a great beer. Just add some hot water, syrup, malt, sugar, pitch the yeast and let ferment. Thats it. I have made a lot of beer and have never had a canned extract turn out so good. Usualy when you cook beer you are in the kitchen for hours. With coopers it only takes about 10-15 minutes and you are done not to mention it tastes as good if not better than cooked beer. Once you have taken a few sips it is very similar to Guiness. It has nice flavor and finishes with a slight bitterness. Make sure to age it properly. For maximum flavor age for at least a month. The flavor will improve greatly! Enjoy.
