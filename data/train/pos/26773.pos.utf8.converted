I like chocolate.  Despite eating chocolate products since I was three or four, I still eat it every time I have an opportunity.  Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed diabetic and warned off most chocolate.  Most such products have lots of sugar which spikes my blood sugar.<br /><br />I habitually search for healthy food, especially snacks.  I seek food that is low in  sodium, low sugar, high protein and high fiber.  As a diabetic, I also search for food that does not lead to sugar highs or lows.<br /><br />Extend Shakes are ideal for my needs.  This is chocolate without all the sugar.  Extend Shakes have only 110 Calories, 1.5 grams of fat (no saturated or trans fats), 1 gram of sugar, and only 120 mg of sodium.  In addition they have only 12 grams of carbohydrate and zero cholesterol.  As a bonus, Extend Shakes have 15 grams of protein.  They also contain 24 vitamins and minerals<br /><br />I mix my Extend Shake powder in light soy milk, which is smooth and tasty without having many calories (70).  I understand that skim milk is also good. When dieting I plan to mix it with water to save another 70 calories.<br /><br />Because Extend Shakes use uncooked cornstarch and soy protein, they digest very slowly.  After drinking an Extend Shake, I feel refreshed and not hungry for at least four hours.  With their documented hunger control, these shakes are great for anyone on a diet to lose weight,<br /><br />Also, the Chocolate flavor is delicious.  I highly recommend this product.
