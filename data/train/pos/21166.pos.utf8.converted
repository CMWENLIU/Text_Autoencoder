My last cat became diabetic because I didn't understand the damage that most commercial dry foods inflict.  By switching that cat to a canned food diet and monitoring his carbohydrates, I got him off insulin and he lived another five years after his diagnosis.<br /><br />When I got my current cat I was determined to never go through that again.  Imagine my dismay upon realizing that this new cat gives a whole new meaning to the word "fussy"...and that he'd cheerfully starve to death rather than eat something just because I decided it would be good for him.  Unfortunately, most canned foods were on the list.<br /><br />I eventually did find some excellent canned foods that he would eat, but I also discovered this dry food.  As others have mentioned, it's grain-free, which is my highest priority in a cat food - canned or dry.  After researching the other dry foods out there, I've come to the conclusion that this is the ONLY one I'll feed my cat.  (It's a good thing he likes it!)<br /><br />I hope others get to the same place I did and realize that too many of the foods on the market today are downright toxic.  I also hope others realize this before their cat's diet turns into a chronic health problem.  Because sure, this food is more expensive than Meow Mix and even the "premium" foods like Iams and Science Diet...but it's still far, far cheaper to choose a more expensive food than it is to battle a chronic health problem.<br /><br />(That said, I would recommend doing some comparison shopping and find places where it's on sale.  Right now this seller's food is listed at $12.99 for 2-point-something pounds.  You can find it cheaper elsewhere.)
