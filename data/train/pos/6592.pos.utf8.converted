I've been hearing mixed reviews about the vega shakes. The WFHO reviews have particularly scared me a bit because I have read that the shakes can be a bit gritty and over powered with stevia. I heard these shakes were different so I decided to give in and try the Vega brand. I was really pleasantly surprised. Initially when I opened the package I saw it was green and smelled a little nutty/bland which didn't scare me but I thought it'd taste like hemp. I blended it with 8 oz of unsweetened almond milk and a few ice cubes. It was really good. Definitely a tropical smoothie. Adding liquid completely transformed it. It wasn't gritty at all. It kind of reminded me of a starburst chew. I wouldn't say this is something I would want on it's own as a go to comfort food, but I could definitely do this for my morning breakfast. Out of all of the vegan/vegetarian/raw food shakes that I have tried (I've tried a lot and have wasted a LOT of money), this is by far the best tasting one. I've heard great things about the vanilla and chocolate mixes also so I'll be trying those next.
