I have been on a diet for a while now, only eating oil and vinegar on my salads. I ordered this product thinking it would at least improve the taste a little. Well, now everyone in my family is hooked on this stuff. Even my picky husband loves it. My daughter loves to mix with olive oil and dip bread in it. All of the flavors are absolutely wonderful. You've got to give them a try.
