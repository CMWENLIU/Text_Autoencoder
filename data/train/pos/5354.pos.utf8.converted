This is the Mercedes of coffee.  Jamaica is known for only a couple of world exports.  Why not be on top with one of the best coffee's on the planet.  If you haven't tried Jamaican Blue, it really is worth the cost.  These beans make a great cup to share with friends and family especially if there's a special event being celebrated.  It just makes a great cup of joe no matter what the reason.
