A very good mix, easy to prepare  as a basic gingerbread and also a great base for additions  and variations (I sometimes make it with applesauce).<br />I made this with chopped dried fruit and a touch of brandy for a holidau  coffee cake and have added cinnamon,cardamom, and cloves to the mix for a spice cake that is a huge hit. The traditional rolled cookie variation is great tasting and holds up well in construction projects such as ginger bread houses,trains and ginger people. The soft cookie variation get raves, These usually disappear as soon as they are barely cool enough  to eat. These mixes also keep well in the pantry.
