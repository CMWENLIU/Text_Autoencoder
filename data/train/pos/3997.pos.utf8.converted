I am so happy with this new economical and more environmentally friendly coffee.  The flavor and aroma are just what I expect from a French Roast -- deep and bold. I keep the pods in a ziplock bag in the refrigerator. My husband and I each drink at least two cups every morning, so we go through a box pretty quickly with no concerns about the coffee pods staying fresh.  The used coffee is much easier to remove from the pods for composting, too.  Fine quality, great price!
