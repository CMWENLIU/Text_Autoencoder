This is a very nice soup for those watching calories and wanting a scosh less salt than is usual for Campbell's soups. It's a tomato-based soup with a light dose of rice, black beans, and chicken. It's not thick or chunky. I'd call it a medium-density soup. Enough broth to slurp for those who like a not-stewish soup. Not super hot or spicy, but flavorful all the same.<br /><br />I find that it's very nice on its own, but I prefer it with more black beans (I just add canned ones) and chopped tomato and a sprinkle of low-fat cheddar cheese. That really makes it into a nice light meal, satisfying and flavorful.<br /><br />But I think if you like tomato-based soups and a Mexican vibe, this will agree with your taste buds. I consider it a pantry staple for lunch now.<br /><br />I do find the regular cans of this tastes slightly better. Maybe heating it in the can transfers some of the metal taste. Not sure. But if you can find the regular cans, I'd go that route.<br /><br />One cup has 130 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of protein, 20 grams of carbohydrates, 2.5 grams of fat ( 1 gram of those is of saturated fat.) It also has 480mg of sodium, and 800 of potassium. I add the low-fat (or fat free) cheese for both flavor and to up the protein to balance the carbs.<br /><br />I hope Campbell's keeps making these. Nice quickie soup.<br /><br />Mir
