Okay, so I've been vegan for 9 years. This means I haven't tasted actual franks in that long. These franks tasted very familiar though. After reading the last review, I realize why. He was exactly right! It has a vienna sausage taste. Though it doesn't have that exact flavor, which is great. I always attributed the part of the flavor it doesn't have with spoiling meat anyway. So this is perfect for me. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.<br /><br />These franks are nice and plump. I boiled them, though I thought it would mess up the flavor. But they were perfect after all. I can't wait to try the burgers!
