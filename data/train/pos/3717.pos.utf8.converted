I've been using this tuna for many months, buying it here on Amazon, and it has always been excellent! I've given away a few cans to friends and co-workers without mentioning anything, and all of them have came back and asked me for more info about it. It is simply the best tuna I've ever had by far!<br /><br />Read the labels and research yourself where your tuna is coming from, and how it is processed. I don't know of any tuna that is completely wild, line caught in the US and hand selected in the 17 lb size, and cooked in the can with no water added. Any liquid in the can are Omega 3 oils, so do NOT drain the liquid! The oils mix together very good with the tuna by itself, or in to a salad. It's like an anti-freeze for the blood, in addition to benefits.<br /><br />Most tuna comes from Asia, or elsewhere overseas, and much of it is wild tuna, caught and kept in pens, and fed by humans to fatten them up. Animal Planet uses sushi-grade line caught tuna, hand selected in the smaller sizes (called "peanut size" to the sport fishing crowd). And the sushi-grade means caught, immediately bled, and put on ice. Ask any sport fisherman, they all know this is the only method to use to ensure good tasting tuna. You will not have sushi-grade tuna unless you do this process, and quickly. It's the KEY to great tasting tuna. Having had wild caught sport albacore locally, and being involved with the sport fishing group, I have learned this. Check out other brands and then read about Wild Planet, and then make the taste taste. I highly recommend this stuff.
