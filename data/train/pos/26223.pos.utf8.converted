As the 43rd President of the United States, I often found it difficult to incorporate both oatmeal and dinosaurs into my daily routine.  One afternoon, after a busy afternoon at Chuck E Cheese, Laura dragged me to the supermarket to get groceries.  I'd normally sit in the car with my DS, but decided to venture forth this time.  I stumbled across these bad boys and my life hasn't been the same.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Brown sugar<br />Dinosaurs<br />Ninjas are pretty cool too (not included)<br /><br />Cons:<br />No ninjas
