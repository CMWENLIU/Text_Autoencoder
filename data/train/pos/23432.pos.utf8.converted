Most of the reviews here seem to focus on the taste, versatility, and health benefits of this oil in cooking, but coconut oil does so much more than just taste great! With the 108 ounces of coconut-y goodness in this product, you'll have plenty to use all over the home.<br />Use it as:<br />* moisturizer, especially in harsh winters or if you suffer from eczema or acne.<br /><br />* a hair mask, especially if you have curly/frizzy hair or dandruff.<br /><br />* a natural Monistat substitute!<br /><br />* massage oil, especially if you have poor circulation.<br /><br />* a natural Preparation H substitute!<br /><br />* diaper ointment, safe for cloth diapers, too!<br /><br />* insect repellant.<br /><br />* makeup remover.<br /><br />* deodorant.<br /><br />* a natural KY substitute... ;)
