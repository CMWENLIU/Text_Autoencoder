We are not [gasp!] chocolate addicts, so are always on the lookout for non-chocolate treats.  We first found these in Canada on Prince Edward Island, lured by the unusual ginger flavor, and both fell in love on first taste.  We spent the last of our Canadian money to buy up several tins to bring home.  And then they were gone...<br /><br />Our Internet search brought us to Amazon, and we ordered a case which is reasonably priced. All the usual accolades for Amazon apply - top quality, fast service, well-packaged.<br /><br />These chews are sturdy, not like gummy bears, so you can let them slowly dissolve in your mouth like a hard candy, providing you can resist the urge to chew! They are not too sweet, and the ginger flavor is intense, so if you are looking for a hint of ginger you will be overpowered.  Ginger lovers, though, will be hooked by the very first one and always make sure to have a tin around from then on.  They travel well without smushing and spilling out in your purse like the cardboard gum packets, and the tins recycle nicely for folks thinking green.<br /><br />For enterprising palates: I recommend you also try the peppermint ginger chews. Hubby isn't so much into peppermint and prefers the original ginger chews, but I'm more daring and will happily alternate between them.  And how wonderful that we don't have to go to Canada to get more!
