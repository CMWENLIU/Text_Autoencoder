I bought this candy for my son, who spent time in France, and came to like it.  We couldn't find much here locally, and nothing like the violet candy he had tasted, so I took a chance.  He said it is the same he purchased in France, so he is happy.  So am I!  It was well packaged, which was a concern, since it's in a glass jar.  I received the item very quickly.  I'm very satisfied.
