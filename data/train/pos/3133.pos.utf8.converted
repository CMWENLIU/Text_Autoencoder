Thought that this would be just another pretty rice blend, but it's become the "only" rice I make anymore.  It has a subtle nutty flavour that combines well with any seasoning.  The different textures you experience when eating are wonderful.  I highly recommend this blend to anyone.  Add a rice pilaf recipe, a wooden spoon, and you have a great gift.
