I was also looking for an alternative to the creamers with either fat or sugar in them.  This works for me!  For a tsp, you get 7 calories, no fat, 1 carb, 1 gram sugar (from the milk, not from added sugar), 4 mg sodium, and 1 gram protein.  I'm putting 1 tbsp in my coffee, so I'm getting 21 calories and 3 grams of protein per cup of coffee.
