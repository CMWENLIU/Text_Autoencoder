This product which I have many holiday recipes for became unavailable in my area. The only similar product was the same thing but with chocolate along with it. My recipes were for the toffee bit pieces only. We have<br />several grocery stores in my area that had carried it in years past, so I<br />had thought this product was no longer made. Much to my delight Amazon not only carried it but at a very reasonable price. One tip I might add is that since this product comes in boxes of 12, they do freeze perfectly. I just put the extras in a ziploc bag and pull a bag out of the freezer as I need it. This product can get a rancid or off taste otherwise if not used in a timely manner. But frozen they remain unchanged, and does not affect the quality in the slightest.
