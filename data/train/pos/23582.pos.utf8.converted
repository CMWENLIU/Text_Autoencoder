I first tried these at a food service show and was instantly hooked. They are light and crispy, more like a pork rind than a chip. The lightly salted is my favorite, they are so airy. I get them cheaper through work, a benefit of working in food service! I keep a couple of bags in my glovebox so if I am out running errands and get hungry I don't hit a drive-thru.
