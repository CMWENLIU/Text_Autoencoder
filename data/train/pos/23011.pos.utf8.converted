I was really glad to receive this case of cans of black beans from Amazon, because the cold winter is starting out here in the desert, especially over night, and I thought it would be great to have some warm black beans for lunch at work.<br /><br />So far this warm year I have been eating for lunch cold <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> mixed with Mori-Nu Silken Extra Firm Tofu, 24 pack and other stuff at hand, but the cold nights and days make me want something warm instead.<br /><br />When I lived in Guatemala back a quarter century ago, we had black beans and tortilla, hand made, so this sounded really nice. As soon as the case came, I got out a can at night to simmer with diced onion, garlic and a few cumin seeds, to warm to work the next day.<br /><br />Round midnight, I got up to check the beans, still warming,and smelling great. I decided to try half a spoonful to see if they were all right. They smelled way too fresh. One half spoonful led to another, and soon the whole pot was gone.<br /><br />They were THAT good!<br /><br />So anyway, next day I had the usual garbanzo and tofu salad, with fresh lemon juice, and will go now to see if I get some black beans ready for lunch tomorrow!<br /><br />They really are great: good texture, very fresh, and the taste very fresh. After using this brand name for so long, I can trust its uniformity, with no surprises from batch to batch, all of the highest quality. I know some people might say, dude, it's black beans, bake your own, dried from a bag! But the freshness of these apparently never dried beans is something "to die for!" or rather, to live for . . .<br /><br />Great beans. Won't let you down. Will fill you up!<br /><br />And good for you too in every kind of way. Soul food as well as food for the body.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
