Its impossible to find Wheatena on store shelves on the west coast. So its wonderful to have a place to purchase it. Growing up, this is one of the hot cereals mom served and I sure missed it. Tastes great, good for you, and warms the body and soul on the cold, wet northwestern mornings.<br />Tastes just like I remember it and the fun thing is that by adding all sorts of different fruits the taste changes and never gets old.<br />YUM.
