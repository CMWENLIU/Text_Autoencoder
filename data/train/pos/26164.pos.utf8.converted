I use coconut flour all of the time for baking.  I especially line the canister it comes in, so it stays fresher longer.  I also keep in the fridge.  Coconut secret coconut flour seems especially lighter & fluffier than other coconut flours that I've tried.  I was very pleased with this product & I will definitely purchase it again.
