Miso is a base for many Japanese-style soups and other food treatments, no western substitutions are possible. This is my first experience with miso and a positive one. It is salty and assertive, but it IS a fermented concentrate after all. Buying the 2lb. size is the only practical way to stock this item at home, IF one is serious about learning its uses. It stores beautifully in the fridge after opening. The flavors are a welcome change from the usual euro-inspired fare and is far superior to the "plastic" asian food to which we westerners are subjected.<br />Storage is no problem. Clip one corner of the package and squeeze the miso out like toothpaste to measure. Then, squish the paste back to the package bottom, squeeze air out, roll/fold the clipped end under and fasten with a clothes clip, big paper clip, etc. Stores for many months in the refrigerator.
