amazing...is the only word i can say to describe it!!!!! Now for those who aren't on a strict diet and arent used to not eating  chocolate foods as much wont find this as satisfying, but still will. however, for those who are have been missing that chocolate this is HEAVEN!!!! i JUST got it and kinda hard to just eat by itself bc it has a different after taste, but eating it with anything else u can't even tell!!!!!! i ate it with a sugar free vanilla pudding (this stuff is good too, only 60 calories, one gram of fat and no sugar) i mixed it with that and added some fiber one cereal to it and bam it was like my only little ice cream mix SOOO GOOD..also dipped a piece of light wheat bread (only 40 calories) into the chocolate dip and it was like a little chocolate donut/cake/eclair!! AMAZING!!! HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT IF U NEED THAT CHOCOLATE !!! :):)
