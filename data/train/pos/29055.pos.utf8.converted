My Siamese-mix cat had to wear a cone because of her non-stop compulsive grooming. Her overgrooming started when I put my cats back on kibble and stopped making raw food for them; even though I didn't buy cheap food and fed them premium kibble, apparently something in the food didn't agree with her. After going through all kinds of theories (including 'fleas' which she did not have) my vet suggested a hypoallergenic food (Science Diet being one). I refuse to use that product but I did see the Blue Buffalo Wilderness at Petco and decided to try it.<br /><br />My cats, notoriously picky, all loved the Wilderness from the minute we put it on the bowl; they thought it was a treat! So periodically we would try to take the cone off our overgroomer, and she'd start in right away so we'd put it back on. Finally after about four months we took it off (this was just a week ago!) and she started in on herself again...but then she just stopped and looked around. A few more licks, then she'd stop and look around. It was as if she realized she didn't have to do it any more.<br />What made us decide it was time to take the cone off this time, and leave it off, was that her fur is in the most amazing condition. It's deeply luxuriant and thick, and so soft! She also has a healthy weight to her for the first time in years! She's looked a little on the thin side for the past few years, but in a typical lanky Siamese way so we didn't think it was bad. Now though it's clear she has an allergy of some kind, some grain or the gluten perhaps? And Blue Buffalo has basically made a new cat out of her!<br /><br />As a side note, my 14 year old elderly cat looks like a cat 1/4 her age, and acts like it as well. When we switched to Blue Buffalo we did it wholeheartedly and decided ALL the cats would eat it (and the dog too!). My 10 year old cat has always had a weight problem EXCEPT when he was on raw food, now he's down to 12 pounds from his previous 16 lb. kibble weight but he's not emaciated; he's sleek and glossy and looks like a much younger cat. He plays like he thinks he's a kitten again, and he just seems so bright eyed and alert. One thing I noticed was that he always seemed to have an eating disorder (even though healthy at the vet's) and would eat and eat until he vomited it up and just start over...he doesn't have that insatiable eating disorder any more! Another bonus to the Blue Buffalo, I have not stepped in a cold wet pile of cat hork in the middle of the night, in quite some time.<br />That right there is worth the price of the food!<br /><br />We are HUGE fans of Blue Buffalo and I try to get everyone to try it! Don't balk at the price, you actually will end up having to feed less of this than regular kibble! Once you see the results that are possible from this amazing food, you won't want to use anything else. If your cat/dog has dry skin, sheds too much, has a weight problem, etc, this food is for you! Try the Blue Buffalo Wilderness before you buy anything else, chances are good that you won't need to go buy 'prescription specialty food'. If you have a diabetic animal, the Blue Buffalo Wilderness is one of the best foods you can choose! Compare it side by side to the 'prescription diet' you'll no doubt be told is best. See if the Blue Buffalo Wilderness isn't lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein than that prescription stuff! (Check with your vet to make sure higher protein isn't a problem for your pet though)
