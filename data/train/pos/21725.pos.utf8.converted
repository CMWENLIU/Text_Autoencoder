I was so glad I found this product.  I should not eat chocolate for medical reasons.  Carob does not taste exactly like chocolate but it satisfies my cravings and I think it's a great substitute; especially as chips in cookies.  These taste like bittersweet chocolate.  The sweetened ones are good too. I'm so happy I can have cookies and milk again!
