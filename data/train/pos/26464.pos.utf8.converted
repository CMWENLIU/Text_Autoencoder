After getting a Keurig I did a massive taste test of the 20 or so bold/extra bold varieties from different brands.  This was definitely my favorite - nice smooth taste, with none of the bitter/acidic/funky tinges many of the others had (stay away from Green Mountain 'Espresso').  The only other k-cup to come close was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUGY">Coffee People K-Cup Dark Roast, Extra Bold Jet Fuel for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>. (Green Mountain's other extra bold varieties - Kenyan AA, Double Black Diamond, Dark Magic - were a distant third; didn't find anything good from Timothy's/Emeril.)  If you want to do your own sampling without committing to a whole box, I definitely recommend Keurig's site - you can get 'extra bold' variety packs, as well as 5-cup samples of individual flavors.
