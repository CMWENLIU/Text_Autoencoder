I absolutely hate mayonaise, so this product is a great alternative for my sandwiches.  I just love this product.  It has just the right amount of ZING!  Though I do wish Kraft would go back to the regular jars and not the squeezable packaging.  You can get the last bit out of the old jars, but the design of the plastic squeezable bottles makes it difficult to get the remaining sauce out.
