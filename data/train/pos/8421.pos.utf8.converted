We LOVE the strawberry Crunchies!!!  You can eat the whole entire big bag for less than 100 calories.......that is crazy!!  And they are the best tasting things!  Just don't eat some, then leave your slightly opened bag in the car for a day (like I did ) ....the humidity zapped them and they turned into "Soggies" instead.  But we usually clean out a bag in no time, so no worries!  We like the Mixed Berry alot....and the Veggies are good, too!!!!!!! I add them to recipes, like soup and cornbread. YUMMMMMMM
