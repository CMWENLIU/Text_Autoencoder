I am amazed out how much I enjoy this soup with how little effort goes into preparing it.<br />It has a very good flavor, and comes out surprisingly creamy.  It won't replace homemade soups in my house, but I do always keep a bag in the pantry for a quick, filling, and tasty lunch when I just don't have time to make it from scratch.  It's delicious all on it's own, or you can throw in your own extras to customize.  I have tossed in jalapenos, frozen corn, mushrooms, broccoli, cheese or whatever else you just happen to have around and it always comes out great.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the little chunks of dried potato, they never quite reconstitute into a real potato texture.  I frequently just sift them out and dice a potato or two and toss those in instead, they cook soft in the 15 minutes it takes for the soup to cook and no one would ever know it came powdered in a bag.
