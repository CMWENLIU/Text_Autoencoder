I rarely write an opinion about products but I had to on this product.  For once the product worked exactly as advertised.  I probably use a K-cup once every three times and use the Kaps for the rest.  Different K-cups fit slightly tigher with the cap than others. I don't fill it to the top but close, too much and I find I get some grounds in my coffee.  Very pleased overall.
