I purchased these seed from Amazon to start an asparagus bed.  I planted 40 seeds (approximately 1/3 of the package) one each, in peat pellets and then placed them in an old aquarium 38 of the 40 germinated. I did a lot of reading online and was expecting a very low germination rate as most website said it was practically impossible to grow asparagus from seeds at home. This was a far better germination ratio than I expected they are all continuing to grow and thrive, Although I did lose about 15 plants to my wife's cat,(he ate the green tops).  He heartily approves of the asparagus and enjoys the flavor.<br />The price very good as most online nurseries would have charged of $150 for the number of plants I have now grown at a cost of 3 dollars.
