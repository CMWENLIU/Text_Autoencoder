i will start off by sayin the dr. mcdougall brand is a life saver for me. being a vegan it can be difficult to find really quick and easy meals. i was scared to buy all of them at once, so at my local store i got one of every flavor. they are all tastey but to me this one stood out. the flavor is awesome. i cook it differently than the package says ( i do that for all of them).<br /><br />the only problem i have with the asian entrees is that it is 200 calories per serving and there is two in a cup. noone is only going to eat half of it. that would just be a bad idea. other flavors have less calories per serving. and at my local store you can get it for the about the same price per container. i know that might be location dependant because when i lived in a different state it was cheaper to get it here. i know with the subscribe and save it always works out to get it on amazon. i keep these in my car because i never know if i need a meal on the go. these are super handy and super tastey. i would recommend any of them.
