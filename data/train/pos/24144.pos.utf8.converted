I would like to write about the rose plant that bloomed in middle of November after we had some snow here in Virginia with 35 degree F (close to freezing weather). I used half a bottle of water diluted over the rose plant which was almost dying in mid September. Before I used this water, I could not maintain it well with all the bugs and spotted leaves and roses never able to fully blossom because of all these bugs. I was amazed with the results in just 2 months. Not only were the leaves fully energized and green with no sign of bugs, but middle of November after all the snow and cold weather, we had a beautiful rose show up. The fragrance was so pure and the shelf life of this rose was more than 10 days.<br /><br />I have also used half a bottle of this water on my apple tree and am looking forward to the results next spring.<br /><br />I have used this water filled with energy transmission with amazing success with my herbs along with my own body. We have seen the energy transforming the wine to customize it to my taste but this water has really made these herbs look much more lively within a month with just half a bottle of this water. The herbs continue to thrive for the last few months even though I don't give them as much care as I should because of my travel. I think having the energy to sustain the day and feeling the best as if I was detox'ed with just a bottle of water is not a placebo but real experience for me.<br /><br />I am very skeptical person and don't go with the crowd usually unless I experience it. This is something I feel strongly about that helps everyone, because of my personal experience as well as the science and research.<br /><br />I am also happy that such energy is available in the form of water shipped to my door at a reasonable price.
