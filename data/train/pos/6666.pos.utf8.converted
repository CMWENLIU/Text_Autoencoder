If you try this stuff you will never want to use table salt on anything again.  With table salt they take everything that is good about salt and destroy it.  first they grind it up small with metal utensils which at this point i can now taste if someone tries to pass off some table salt on me.  then they bleach it, just want i want is some bleached food.  and finally they add iodine.  its amazing that we survived as a species without iodine in our salt.  this stuff goes further because it has more taste so you can use less.  its sundried and retains all the natural minerals.  also its mined with wood instruments keeping its natural taste. its a must for nutrition and heart heathy minded families.  its actually good for you unlike table salt!
