I research before I buy anything, and I mean anything.  I am picky and on a tight budget.  I appreciate others reviews as that helps me in making decisions.  I know pretty much what I am getting with few exceptions. Thanks to all of those who take time to give reviews.<br /><br /> I was a little hesitant to buy candy online without pinching them to see if fresh but all turned out well. They are fresh and delivered right to our door in two days with prime shipping.  The price was right too. Will order more as this order is going fast. My 84 year old mother loves her candy!<br /><br />Amazon and their Prime shipping has been such a blessing to us in our situation so I want to let everyone know about it that it might benefit. If you order almost everything online, like we do, Prime shipping  pays for itself many times over in a year.  No, amazon did not pay me to say that, in fact, I am sure they lose money on shipping to us!  Just don't know what we would have done without it. It is so nice to be able to order most everything from one site too. Keeps it so much easier and quicker. In 30 days I have ordered 68 things from Amazon, from powdered eggs to an electric snow shovel. There is not much they don't offer.
