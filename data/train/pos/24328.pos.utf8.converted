Okay: just in case you're not familiar, a whisky cake is basically a fruit cake with a good swig of whisky thrown in for flavour. That's what we get here. I think the term "shortbread" is just used as part of the "Walker's Shortbread" brand, because as far I noticed, there was nary a trace of anything even remotely like shortbread to be found.<br /><br />As fruit cakes go, this one is defintiely top of the range. It's a great cake. I confess my own pallet is nowhere near refined enough to specifically identify Glenfiddich as the whisky used, but hey, yours may differ.<br /><br />But yes, as fruit cakes go, this is definitely a five star one. No question. Hence the rating. On the other hand, it is also a very expensive one. If I were going to factor "value for money" into my rating, I'd probably knock it down to just four stars.<br /><br />One final thought: the tin in which this cake is comes is a nice and enduring one, and the lid is not of the type that is damaged when removed. So hey, as an added bonus you also get something pretty in which to store buttons, loose change, or whathaveyou. If you're like me, the tin will still be around for many years after the cake is long gone.<br /><br />Theo.
