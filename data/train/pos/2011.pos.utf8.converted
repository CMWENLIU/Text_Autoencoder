I love these curry packets!  I crave Indian food often, and this really satisfies that urge.<br /><br />I use them in the crock pot, which makes for a ridiculously easy and delicious meal.  I'll use skinless chicken thighs and dump the curry paste on top, then I'll fill the foil packet with water and add that as well.  Near the end of the cooking time, I'll add a defrosted box of spinach, and then I'll serve the curried chicken and spinach over rice.<br /><br />Interestingly, my husband -- who isn't a huge fan of Indian food -- likes this as much as I do.
