If you like mugicha (barley tea), this stuff is great, and super easy! The teabags are pitcher-sized, so all you have to do is drop it in a pitcher of water and refrigerate it overnight, and you're done. (Use filtered water -- it makes a big difference.) I like it plain and think it tastes slightly sweet by itself, but I know people like to add sugar to it, too. Since it's caffeine free and calorie free and really refreshing when cold, it makes a great alternative to plain water for staying hydrated in the summer. I keep boxes of this stuff in my pantry all summer. My local Asian Supermarket also carries this product.
