I am lactose intolerant. Eggs give me crazy gas. I don't eat meat. Nuts give me gas. Beans give me gas.<br /><br />I also body build. That leaves me with little options for protein. Luckily there is hemp, and this is the part of the plant my body needs most. As stated in the product description hemp is the plant kingdoms gold standard, much like eggs are the gold standard in the animal kingdom. And really the two are very comparable. Hemp is much cheaper though.<br /><br />It dissolves very easy in water, unlike egg protein. It is easy to digest, unlike egg protein. It tastes great, and is quite mild, almost nutty flavor -egg protein always tastes like crap because they always put artificial flavors in, which make no doubt about it, are chemicals that are bad for your body. The hemp + fiber variety Nutiva makes is too gritty for me. This 50% protein is more expensive because more of the fiber is sifted out. Being a vegetarian I get plenty of fiber as it is anyway.<br /><br />I eat probably 6 heaping scoops (like a standard protein extract measuring cup) of this stuff a day, and never get sick of it. It's great between meals, or with meals, or mixed into meals, and you can mix it into almost anything because of the quite neutral flavor. I recover from workouts faster.<br /><br />It never gives me gas or makes me feel bloated. It has little fat, and the small amount of beneficial healthy fats it does have are needed to build muscle. Since this is plant sourced protein it also has anti-oxidants I am sure, it's green color is a testament to that.<br /><br />I could not be without this product.
