I just tried these noodles after reading article in first magazine for women. Thought they were great and I only used organic chicken broth with carrots. I am very satisfied with the taste and ask everyone...what are you expecting for a pasta substitute????!!!!Just don't be so picky and be grateful there's something to eat thats healthy low carb and low calorie and can be doctored up with all kinds of foods and ideas. Happy snacking
