I use and enjoy this all the time. I strain out all the whey and water<br />after incubation and get a v-e-r-y thick yogurt after draining.<br /><br />How thick you ask?  Well thick enough to support a chief's knife standing upright.<br /><br />The taste is great!  Just the right amount of tart -- how real yogurt is<br />supposed to taste without the post incubation sweeteners added to most commercial yogurts found in supermarkets.<br /><br />THIS is the SCD recommended culture because it contains three, and only three cultures:<br />  -- L.bulgaricus<br />  -- S.themophilus<br />  -- L.acidophilus<br /><br />Specifically, it does NOT contain Bifidobacterium (frequently shortened to Bifidus) which is considered anathema to the SCD diet.<br /><br />Nor does this culture contain any "other", "unknown" or "miscellaneous additional" bacteria which are frequently listed under "Ingredients:" on commercial yogurt containers.  Yogourmet cultures are produced by Lyo-San, Inc. in Canada.  Lyo-San &lt;lyosan.ca> specializes in growing pure cultures as well as mixing & packaging their freeze dried cultures in precise amounts.<br /><br />[Lo-San does, however, offer a variety of other culture combinations which DO CONTAIN Bifidus.  Those packages containing Bifidus DO NOT have a cover graphic depicting a bowl of yogurt with SIX Strawberries.]
