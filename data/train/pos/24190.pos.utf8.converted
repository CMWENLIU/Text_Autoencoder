If you love peanut butter that is super creamy and all natural then this is the perfect peanut butter for you. I have found most all natural peanut butters to be are super dry and tough to spread or mix but not the case with the Peanut Shop peanut butter. I am very picky about peanut butters and this one is truly superb. I think you will be won over as well.
