Everytime I run out of sea salt I am amazed at how hard it is to find just what I want.  Right price, right size, NO additives.  This stuff fits the bill.  Because the price is reasonable and the flavor is simple, I use it in everything from pasta water to baking.<br />BE WARNED - it is NOT FINE.  I put it in my spice grinder if I need a pinch of fine.  It is at least as coarse as the big blue box of coarse kosher salt if not larger and a bit more irregular.  That said, it doesn't stop this from being my favorite.
