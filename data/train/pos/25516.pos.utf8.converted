I recently tried a different brand of kelp noodles which I liked a lot. I found this brand on amazon and took a chance. I thought the first brand I tried was very good. These are excellent! Kelp noodles can have a bit of a crunch. These noodles seemed thinner than the first ones I tried, so while they still had a bite to them, they had a softer consistency. They are so easy to use. You just rinse them off and toss them into a stir fry. I have served them to my family with pasta sauce and meatballs. Tonight I basically cleared out my leftovers by tossing in pot roast shredded with its gravy, sauteed onions and tomatoes and spices. Delicious! Each serving is only 6 calories and 0 carbs. (1 gram carb + 1 gram fiber = 0 carbs)<br /><br />I am going to try these noodles with chicken tikka masala this week. I am sure it will be great!
