I have only tried the NOW brand from my local health food store and am new to using coconut oil for my health. I noticed a big difference in flavor and texture. This oil just melts in your mouth and tastes so much better! I love it. I have a jar in plastic of the NOW and I did a taste test. Wow, I really think I can taste the plastic from the NOW jar. My husband swears he can not tell the difference. I think it has helped with my hypothyroidism. My energy levels are much better and I am not hungry as much. I plan to continue on with the coconut oil. Also, use it on my skin, very nice. I will definitely buy this brand again. Taste superior, and I like that it is not in plastic.
