Just tried these last week. Delicious! Savoury! If you like baked beans, you have to try them. This is a very rich, savoury flavor with a good balance of sweet. Navy beans, raisins and curry, yum! Beans as a dessert. Reminds me of a really good plum pudding for some reason; must be the richness of the spices.
