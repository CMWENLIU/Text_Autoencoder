First off, I'll let it be known that I'm English. That means I have spent my lifetime drinking lots and lots of tea, which I think is compulsory when you're English. I've had many different types of tea (mostly tea from England such as PG Tips and Typhoo) and when I finally stumbled upon Yorkshire Tea on a trip back home about 6 years ago I've been hooked. This is by far my favorite tea and I drink 3-5 cups of it a day.<br /><br />Although many reviews say a bag is meant for a pot of tea that is not truly the case. A bag is meant for a single cup of tea. Now, some people may prefer a weaker cup of tea, like my mum who will use a bag twice since she prefers a weaker cup, but one bag is really meant for one cup. Alas, to each his own. I personally like a very strong cup of tea so I use one bag per cup and I allow it to steep for a minimum of four minutes. Then I use a bit of half and half (whole milk at the minimum) and a half teaspoon of sugar. Wallah, the perfect cup.<br /><br />As for price, well, Amazon cannot be beat! I have searched high and low for this tea and have not once been able to find it for less than what Amazon sells it for in the States.<br /><br />Grab a cup and enjoy this very fine tea. You won't be disappointed.
