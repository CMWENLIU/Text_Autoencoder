I mainly use pearled barley in soups and stews.  It adds a chewy wholesomeness, extra fiber and healthy amounts of niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and selenium.  I just add 1/2 to 1 cup of barley to the boiling stock as I cook.  It also makes a great side dish when seasoned and served as you would wild rice.<br /><br />Arrowhead Mills pearled barley is a great value - I love that it comes in 6 28-oz bags. It works out to $1.57 per pound, and even less if you sign up for Subscribe & Save.  I keep one bag in a kitchen canister for daily use, and store the others in a ziplock bag in my pantry (to protect against moisture and insects).
