I have to say that this is the best food available. My puppy had been having dandruff and a dull coat on a diet of high quality, corn free kibble. Her coat was shiny and flake free within 24 hours of starting this diet, and she loves it (thats not saying much because she'll eat anything though). I ate some myself and it is pretty good. It feels good feeding a food that is actually FOOD, not mystery brown chunks. It is pricey, I feed it along with a homemade raw meat/veggie deal, but it is great for traveling.<br /><br />I really wish it was more affordable so we could feed it to large dogs (we have two 90lb+ dogs). Check out Grandma Lucy's for a comparable product that is slightly cheaper. (10lbs for the price of 8lbs of sojos).
