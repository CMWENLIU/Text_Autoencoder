The taste is something to get used to, but I have been drinking this every morning for close to a month and love it.  I just had to get on Amazon to order a new jar... I like it so much I signed up for "subscribe and save" which I have never done before...  I drink it as soon as I wake up and definitely feel a difference in my energy levels.  I also just feel good about having something so healthy everyday :)
