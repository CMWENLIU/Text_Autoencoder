Really Raw Honey is the best honey I have ever tasted.  It is produced by one of the last apiaries left in the United States using organic beekeeping methods.<br /><br />Really Raw Honey is not labelled as an organic product, so I contacted the company through their website and they told me that they do not use pesticides, miticides, or antibiotics on their bees and they do not feed the bees corn syrup or sugar and do not truck their bees all over the country to pollinate crops.<br /><br />The 5lb jar is pretty large but it is more economical than the 1lb jar and it taste so good, I will probably go through the 5 lb jar in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />$50 might see like a lot for 5lbs of honey but you get what you pay for.  Really Raw Honey is a high quality ethical product.  Do yourself a favor and try it.
