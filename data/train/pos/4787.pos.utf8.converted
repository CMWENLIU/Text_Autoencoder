My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level. It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of Glucophage.<br />The use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated (you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on www.pubmed.gov ).<br /><br />My mom gets it from the Indian grocer where it is much cheaper, though loose and not encapsulated.
