I had to stop drinking Red Bull and other commercial energy drinks due to the truth about what taurine can do to your blood.  When I found these at Whole Foods, I was thrilled they were organic and contained no taurine.  I like the berry flavor.  I have not tried the lime flavor yet.  The diet version (no chemicals, just 9 grams pure cane sugar per can compared to 23 in the non-diet Steaz)tastes ok, like watery ginger ale.  But the orange flavor is the BEST.  It tastes like a really sweet Orangina drink.  Plus, I have never had Yerba Mate before (it is in the Steaz drinks), and I felt very euphoric for about a half hour.  I am hooked, will definately be a returning customer!!
