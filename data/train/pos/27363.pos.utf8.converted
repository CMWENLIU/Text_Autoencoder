I bought this particular coconut oil at Whole Foods, but I wanted to write a review on here for anyone who is interested in using coconut oil. This brand is very good. It was a bit more solid in the store, due to the fact that it's cooler temperature than my apartment. When it heats up, it melt and is just a clear oil. When I opened the jar, the smell was amazing! I love the smell of coconut. I did a deep conditioning treatment with this for my hair which is a bit dry and damaged, and also very fine. I put a pretty good amount of this and rubbed it through the length of my hair, and also massaged my scalp with it. I left it in for about 2 hours and then washed it out with shampoo and then conditioned as normal. Even as I was washing it out, it felt amazingly soft. I also tried another version of the deep conditioning treatment - I left it in over night and washed and conditioned as normal the next morning. This really packed a punch - my hair was SO soft and silky and VERY shiny, I couldn't believe it was my hair. I couldn't stop touching it all day lol. This is more amazing than any hair product out there. And it's completely natural and inexpensive. And I forgot to mention your hair will smell absolutely yummy while you have it in :)
