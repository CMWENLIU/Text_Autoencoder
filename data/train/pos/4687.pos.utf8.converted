Very pleased with this. Good lavender flavor, good scent. The taste is strong, clean, and sharp.<br /><br />The website of the manufacturer appears to reflect a company preoccupied with product quality and health.<br /><br />This doesn't appear to be the most economical lavender flavor available, but when you factor in the size of the bottle--4 oz., twice the size of most--it has a very competitive price.<br /><br />I find this roughly on par with the Herb Pharm lavender <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TL6FS">Lavender Extract 1 Ounces</a>, but only 1/4 the price,<br />and greatly superior to the chemical-tasting Star Kay White <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L1XMAA">Pure Lavender Extract 2 oz.</a>
