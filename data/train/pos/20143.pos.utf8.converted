Great coffee.  It is hard to find but you can get a case of 12 for $63.00 at [...]<br /><br />I bought the 6 can pack from Amazon several months ago and it was the same price as the 3 pack.<br />What happened Amazon?  Instead of $5 something a can it is $10????<br /><br />Too bad you have to charge double... Amazon should shop around and so should you.<br />Again Great coffee - not as good as the original that Maxwell put out but the best Vanilla coffee we can find out there.<br />Just shop around though.. Sorry Big A this time I cannot recommend you.
