If you already know about wakame, then you don't need to read this review. If you don't, you should, because this is one of the greatest and most versatile staples you can keep in your kitchen. Wakame is a mild, slightly salty, tasty seaweed that is full of nutrients and flavor. However, you'd starve to death if you tried to live off this, because it has almost no calories. There are a number of ways you can prepare this. As a soup base, it's quite awesome - just simmer a half cup in a pot of water, add miso, soy sauce, or ponzu, and then spike it with frozen shrimp, thin sliced pork, or whatever else you'd like to toss in. Add a dash of sriracha and sesame oil, and you've got a great-tasting low-calorie soup that beats the pants off anything you can get in a can. If you want some carbs in there, add any kind of noodle you like, from vermicelli to udon. Because the wakame itself adds so much flavor, you don't really need to overload it with sodium-laden soy sauce - just add enough for a little more flavor. My favorite use it to use it as an instant salad - just add water! Place a cup or two of wakame in a bowl, and add 2 volumes of ice cold water. Place it in the fridge, drain the next day, and you've got instant salad to last the whole week. I add thin shredded daikon, carrots, cilantro, and whatever meat I have on hand: frozen shrimp, leftover chicken, canned salmon, even taco meat that didn't make it into shells. Add a sauce made of soy or ponzu with a little rice vinegar, fresh ginger juice if you have it, and a little splash of sesame oil. Top with toasted sesame seeds and you've got an awesome seaweed salad that costs pennies to make, has flavor for days, and very little calories. This bag might seem enormous when you first get it, but once you discover its many uses, you'll use it up faster than you ever thought possible - I go through 3-4 bags a year.<br /><br />More wakame trivia: don't worry about depleting the world's supply, as wild wakame is considered one of the top 100 invasive plants, and has even established itself in San Francisco Bay. Wakame also contains the chemical fucoxanthin, which Japanese scientists claim can enhance fat burning - this may be true or not, but given its low caloric content, it'd be hard to get fat eating this stuff anyway.
