What nicer thing to hear than your best friend telling you that his husband blurted this out with a big smile when they opened the package I sent them for their anniversary!<br />  I had decided only days before I placed the order that I wanted to give them a bonsai tree if I could possibly afford it.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable this tree was, but admit I was worried: could it possibly be as lovely as the picture?<br />  It was! The lovely juniper bonsai was almost an exact duplicate of the online image, with the same graceful lines and attractive traditional bonsai bowl.<br />And although there was no option to enclose a gift card when I checked out (which is something I suggest the seller correct) I sent an email asking if a gift note with my specific wording could be added.  The seller did so: accurately written and at no charge.<br />  In addition, my friends received their gift at the very earliest date within the window of time projected.<br />  A wonderful gift at good price; delivered with better service than I could have expected.<br />  What more could you ask for?
