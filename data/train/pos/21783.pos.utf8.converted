I discovered this tea about a year ago.  I love flavored teas and this one just hit the spot.  I make iced tea using the Four Red Fruits all the time and it's a relaxing cup of hot tea as well.<br /><br />Anyone who likes fruit flavored tea should try this.  I have introduced this tea to several of the people I work with and when I go my order I had to had out some of the boxes.  They quit selling it locally and I am going to stock up while I can.
