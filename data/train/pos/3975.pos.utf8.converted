Big League Chew.<br /><br />True Story: I was addicted to Big League Chew. Almost destroyed my life until I checked myself into the clinic. What a reality-check. The therapist slapped me in the face for even thinking of kicking my Big League Chew habit.<br /><br />The product description reads, "Target consumer: Boys 6-12 with an active interest in baseball" but declines to mention the rock-star status one receives upon bringing a box of Big League chew to work. Since I brought the box to work this morning, I've since been promoted nine times, from mail-room drone to Executive Director of Awesome.
