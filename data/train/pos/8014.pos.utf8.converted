I LOVE THE SMELL TASTE FEEL OF COFFEE ! However as a health issue i dropped all caffiene including my beloved coffee. Oh the Pain. Several months later i was on a trip and was served ROASTAROMA and it was amazing. Full bodied and rich like coffee without caffiene and not that horrible taste of decafe coffees. I couldnt find it anywhere and checked Celestial's web site and learned there wasnt ONE store within 25 miles that carried Roastaroma ..hence my purchase from Amazon. If you dont want the caffiene, and love the rich smell and taste of coffee...without that decafe taste.....this is the drink for you.
