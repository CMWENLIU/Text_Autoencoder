This is awesome! My kitchen is like an alchemist's tower now. Within 4 days, my little kefir grains started reliably producing unfathomably delicious kefir that is foamier, thicker, and infinitely better than the stuff my local co-op was gouging me for.<br /><br />It sets up, at least in my toasty casa, in under 12 hours. Left longer than that, it turns into horse sweat cheese. I keep it in the fridge until I am running low, and then bring it to room temp and let it work its magic.
