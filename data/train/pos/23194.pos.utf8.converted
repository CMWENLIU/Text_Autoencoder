We got the three-pack of all three flavors in an assortment with our SodaStream machine purchase. I just re-ordered the orange here (our favorite).<br /><br />As SisiL78 said (previous review), you add the flavor after carbonating. You can adjust the flavor to be as strong or weak as you like, although it's definitely best to lightly flavor seltzer; we use it in place of purchasing Polar seltzer.  The assortment right now includes orange, lemon-lime, and raspberry.  Probably the company "upgraded" the berry to raspberry at some point.<br /><br />We just purchased a set of glass eyedropper bottles to keep these in, since pouring is an imprecise method of dispensing the flavor, and my husband and I like our seltzer flavored differently (so we flavor by the glass, not the whole bottle).  We also like one drop of raspberry with 2 drops of lemon-lime to simulate the raspberry-lime Polar flavor.<br /><br />I'm glad they're stored in glass (to avoid the plastic-y taste a lot of beverages can have).  Also, they aren't sweetened, which is very important to us. You have to be careful, some flavors say 'no artificial sweeteners', then end up containing splenda or stevia (since technically these are natural). We wanted flavorings with no sweeteners and these fit the bill for a good price.  Now, if only they had more variety it would be perfect.
