To be honest with you, I got tired of eating the same old "wholesome" breakfast diet I've been eating forever and decided to spring for Annie's Cocoa & Vanilla bunnies for a change of pace.  Oatmeal is nice, but  . . .  you know how bland that can get.  I ended up loving the candy taste without the calories, excess sugar, or unknown additives found in some cereals.  This is definitely a cereal that will agree with the palate of everyone in the family from your toddler to grandma.  Your youngster will like the bunny shapes and you can bring this cereal along as a snack for your toddler when you go out.<br /><br />For me the ingredients were the key.  Personally, I was interested in the fact that it was low fat and "totally natural." Others may be looking for something else altogether.  One cautionary note listed is that it is "made on shared equipment that also processes milk, soy, tree nuts, and wheat."  Here's the scoop on this tasty cereal:<br /><br />* Made with Whole Oats<br /><br />* Low Fat<br /><br />* 0g Trans Fat & 0g Saturated Fat<br /><br />* No Cholesterol<br /><br />* Vegan<br /><br />* Grown & Processed without GMOs<br /><br />Nutritional Facts (abbreviated)<br />Serving Size 3/4 cup (30g)<br />8 Servings Per Container<br /><br />Calories ......................................... 120<br />Calories from Fat ..........................  5<br /><br />Total Fat 0.5g ................................  0%<br />Saturated Fat 0g .............................  0%<br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg .............................  0%<br />Sodium 180mg ...............................  8%<br />Total Carb, 26g ...............................  9%<br />Dietary Fiber 1g ..............................  4%<br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 2g<br /><br />Naturally, this cereal will not be suited for everyone, but I liked enough things about it to try it.  I will be buying it again when I need a break from the oatmeal. As much as I like this cereal, it's probably going to be a long break!
