I just recieved my Shanti Spice Box... AMAZING!<br />I agree with the other reviewers.. it is wonderful.  I am dabbling in Indian cooking and other cuisines and can't find all the spices I need in the supermarket, and when I do they are SOOO expensive.<br />This comes with 30 spices... not huge quantities, but much more than I will need for a long time.<br />It really is a treasure chest of spices... and very reasonable when you figure what it would cost to amass these different spices separately.  I HIGHLY recommend!
