This popcorn oil is the best for popping corn anywhere.  I have used it at home in my PopStir (similar to WhirleyPop) on the stovetop and at school functions in a commercial popcorn popper. If you use this oil, you probably won't even have to add any butter to the popcorn after it's popped - so no cholesterol and less fat.  A special feature of this product: It will NOT form black "varnish" inside or outside of your kettle - be it a commercial machine or a home version - it is a clean oil.  This oil is solid at room temperature, and you will need some sort of scoop (as an ice cream or cookie scoop) to measure it out of the container.  This oil gives popcorn the fragrance, taste and COLOR of commercially popped theater popcorn. You won't regret your purchase of this item.
