i'm surprised reading the 2 reviews saying there's no kimchi but the box of kimchi noodles i ordered does have bits of kimchi but they're small and few. I've tried quite a number of instant noodles but this is the ONLY one that i actually would finish the broth. the other brands i just ate the noodles.
