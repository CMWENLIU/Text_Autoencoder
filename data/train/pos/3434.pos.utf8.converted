Our little girl is 9 years old now. A year ago she was so ill, she would vomit up a lot of yellow mucus<br />and she would shiver & shake most all the time and she became so recluse & go hide under the bed and<br />stay there most all the time.<br />She use to play all the time, she has about 10-12 toys and we named them all<br />when we got home & we would always tell her go get, fish, frannie, bob, tye, and the list goes on and she would bring them to us. Well she even stopped playing.<br />Well I got on the internet and read for hours the reviews on Dr. Harveys dog food and I ordered it last Set 2010<br />and I kid you not, with in a day we had our little girl back again no more throwing up no more shaking.<br />We are retired and she wear's us out wanting to<br />play all the time.<br />I thank our Good Lord for this wonderful dog food.<br />I do not work for Dr. Harvey's and this is writtem by me personally. If you dog or dog's are sick (PLEASE PLEASE)<br />try this food.<br />I buy 5LB and it makes 33LB's of dog food. Do the math it is cheaper then buying the dry dog food with<br />all the chemicals in it and just end up throwing it out because your dog only eats it, because he/she is really hungry.<br />And you save money running to the Vet's because your dog is sick all the time.<br />I did not know Amazon carried this food until I checked it tonight. I have just ordered it tonight from Amazon.<br />I do a lot of shopping here & I love the service Amazon offers to us buyers.<br />Good luck everyone with your little babies.
