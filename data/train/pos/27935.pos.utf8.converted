My husband loves his chocolate fix, but there is really nothing more satisfying to him than the Lindor Dark Chocolate Truffles -- for him, every other chocolate candy pales by comparison. So to go completely overboard for Valentine's Day, I ordered the 60-count box. Yes, that may have been overdoing it, but I couldn't have made him happier. Also, he had recently seen a History Channel special on the making of chocolate, and was pleased to see the high quality of Lindor's processing featured! He has exercised unbelievable restraint in making the box last a while -- and every single bite brings bliss. Bravo, Lindor! Letting these dark chocolate truffles melt slowly in your mouth is a truly sensuous experience.
