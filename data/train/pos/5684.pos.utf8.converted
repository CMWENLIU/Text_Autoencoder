My husband and I love the Raspberry Quince tea from Republic of Tea and we actually received this as a sample bag when we ordered the Raspberry Quince bottled tea from RoT. I tried it and have to say that it's really good. The hibiscus tea has a hint of berry and citrus, lending it a nice fruity flavor without being overpowering. The natural sweet flavor is a bonus as it means I can have it without adding any sugar or artificial sweetener. This tea can be steeped hot or as iced tea. The tea is also caffeine-free, and the main ingredients are hibiscus (flower), sweet blackberry (leaf), and stevia (leaf). Refreshing and wonderful!
