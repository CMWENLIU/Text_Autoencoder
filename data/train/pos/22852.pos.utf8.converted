I lived in Germany and have consumed my share of gummi bears. :)  These sugar free bears are very good.  This type of candy suits itself to sugar free treatment.  Much like hard candy.  You don't get the big taste difference like you do with lots of the chocolate sugar free treats.<br /><br />A word on some of the reviews listed here on Amazon... Sugar Free candies are not meant to be eaten by the handfull.  Sugar Free is mostly made for people that can't process the Sugar and people that are in this category have all learned from experience, you don't eat Sugar Free sweets in any large amount.<br /><br />I have a mild case of Type II which I am gratefully able to control by diet alone and can tell you personally that these candies are very good if you are in a Gummi mood.  The affect on my blood sugar is typical of this sort of treat.  Just as I wouldn't eat 50 carbs of anything, a snack of this type is only around 10 bears.<br /><br />People living with health issues concerning Blood Sugar understand the requirement.  Those just looking to cut carbs or lose a bit of weight may want to re-think eating most sugar free treats and look into other type of sweets to satisfy.
