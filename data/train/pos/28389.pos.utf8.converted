This is simply the best I've tasted and worth the price. It's bold and will hold its own in salad dressings, dipping oils, sauteeing and for adding to just about any light recipe, although I doubt I'd bury this extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) in a sauce or a hearty stew; it's too good for disguising. I don't care for subtle olive oils. This one isn't, and it's become my EVOO of choice (cold-pressed). Be aware that Columela makes several different types of EVOO, so this review is meant to address only this particular varietal.
