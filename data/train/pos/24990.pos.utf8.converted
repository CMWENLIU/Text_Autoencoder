I'm trying to reduce the amount of sugary snacks in my life but when I get the 'jones' for something sweet these really hit the spot. They're not like the typical raisins you get in the box at the grocery store. These are soft and a bit sticky and have a nice sweet chewiness that really satisfies my cravings.
