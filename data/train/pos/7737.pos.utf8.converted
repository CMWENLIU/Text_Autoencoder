You won't be disappointed with these tasty, crunchy flakes. They are not extremely sweet like much of the typical fare you find in the grocery store, but throw in a few raisins, and you have yourself a tasty, gluten-free "raisin bran!"<br /><br />The flakes are nice and crunchy, but they will get soft if you leave them sitting in the milk for very long.<br /><br />I really appreciate companies like Nature's Path that still make some healthy GMO-free cereals without unecessary sugar, additives, and supplements.
