Aromatic, fragrant, pungent, this spice brand makes a terrific curry. Seriously recommended. I have used it for years. It keeps, too. Great in egg salad, add a pinch to almost anything to boost flavor and have people ask, whats that special something in this dish? subtle if you wish, powerful if you please. And impossible to find.
