I bought Fiber One cereal a couple days ago because (1) it was on sale at CVS; (2) I love the Fiber One bars, especially the Oats & Chocolate ("Fart Bars" at our house); and (3) I remembered the old Kellogg's All-Bran Cereal, whose tagline should be "Sticks to Mush in 30 Seconds," and wondered if Fiber One was better.<br /><br />Boy, is it ever better!  No surprise, since the top ingredient is corn bran (Anybody remember Crunchy Corn Bran cereal?  That was truly Da Bomb and I don't know if it's even made anymore), which packs a long-lasting crunch and gets you away from that ol' funky wheat bran "good-for-you" insta-mush thing.<br /><br />I do find it amusing that the cereal's size and shape (like a bacillum bacterium, a stretched-out Good & Plenty) is almost exactly the same as the food our youngest son feeds his newt.  "Human Super-Poo Sticks" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but make no mistake - this stuff will clean your clock.
