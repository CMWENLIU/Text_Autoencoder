My cat has had a poor appetite for months, which was explained recently by a diagnosis of chronic renal failure. I dreaded the prospect of trying to switch him to an even less appetizing food than what he was currently refusing to eat. Sure enough, like many other CRF cats before him, he wouldn't touch the Hill's canned k/d or Royal Canin pouch renal diet. I searched online for an alternative and found Neo Diet. On the advice of one "5 paw" customer review, I gave it a shot. He gobbled it up with such gusto that I could hear the chomping and lip smacking from across the room! I can't remember the last time he's eaten that enthusiastically. What the heck is in this stuff???
