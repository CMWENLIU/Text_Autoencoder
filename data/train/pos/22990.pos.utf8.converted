I have two Jack Russell terriers who have different dietary challenges. One has a grain allergy and the other digestive issues with bloat. Since using this food, both dogs are looking more lean, have more energy and their alertness has improved. They can both eat this food and really love the taste. I am almost done with the 26 pound bag and they still look forward to mealtime with zest. I have tried Wellness Core and Buffalo and neither can compare. My dogs had gas with the Buffalo and they really do not like the Wellness Core. Try this food, you will not be disappointed. I am so glad Amazon is selling this food as I have not found it in my area except for one grocery store and the smaller sizes are only available.
