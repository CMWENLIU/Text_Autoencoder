I came across this one time in my mom's cupboard when I ran out of milk and needed it for a recipe.  I whipped some up and had some left over, so I decided to drink it.  It tasted GREAT...just like milk!!!  I drink it regularly now.  It mixes/dissolves so easily and is so much more convenient than milk since it won't spoil!!
