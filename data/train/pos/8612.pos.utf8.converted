This is both a wonderful fish sauce with multiple possible uses, and a wonderful seller. I had a question about the "use by" date, and they responded quickly and completely. So, I feel I am able to both recommend the product and recommend the seller, Viet Phu Fish Sauce, without reservation. PS Try it instead of salt when you make a traditional chicken noodle soup. It adds an amazing depth of flavor. Yum!
