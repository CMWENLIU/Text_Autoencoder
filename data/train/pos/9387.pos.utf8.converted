My Akita loves these Raw hide sticks!  The Pet Time Rawhide Munchy stick is very good treat.  Since 2005 when we first bought these she loved them.  We tried other sticks but our dog refused to eat them.  So, we like buying them over Amazon as it saves money and you get a better product then in the stores. This Amazon merchant processed our order quickly and with care.  We will purchase from them again.
