This is my favorite gum.  I suffered terribly from aspartame poisoning and it was good to find a gum that I could still chew.  Beware consumers - aspartame is in almost all gum - gum does not need to be sugar free to contain aspartame.  If you want to have good gum and still be healthy - this is a great gum.
