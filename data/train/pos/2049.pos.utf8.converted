I discovered these oils years ago, bought one of each flavor, and was thunderstruck at the quality. I use these in place of vegetable or olive oil whenever a dish calls for a similar flavor ingredient (to give it the extra flavor &quot;kick&quot;), but I found myself using them sparingly since I didn't know where to find more when they're gone! I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon! The Lemon oil makes a wonderful Greek Saganaki (flamed Feta or Kaseri cheese), the Lime oil is fantastic for Thai cooking and it's many lime-based dishes, and the Orange oil I use in Salmon marinades, as well as with Oriental stir-fry &amp; Chinese duck--I may even try it in making Duck a L'Orange! I don't recall what I paid when I initially purchased them, but as gourmet oils are pricey to begin with, I would consider this a reasonable price, especially considering Amazon's free shipping &amp; the convenience of to-your-door delivery! The bottles are also attractive to display, &amp; are so tall &amp; slim that they take up very little space on your counter. Treat yourself to these oils!
