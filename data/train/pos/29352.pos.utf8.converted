ATTENTION MOKA POT USERS: If you are looking for an illy espresso for your moka pot, this is NOT it.  Despite what other reviewers are saying, this "fine grind" is so very wrong for your Bialetti and it simply will not work.  The coffee will fall through the holes into the bottom reservoir and you'll end up with something that you really won't want to drink.  Learn from my mistake and go get yourself an illy Moka Grind or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYTO">illy Caffe Normale Whole Bean</a> to grind yourself.<br /><br />With that said, this is great espresso.  I just don't know if my palate is sophisticated enough to make this worth the 2x premium over Lavazza.  If you're a die-hard espresso connoisseur, you'll probably feel like this is worth every penny.
