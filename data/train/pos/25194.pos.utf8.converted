I have four cats, two of which have pretty sensitive stomachs, and all four of them love these foil pouch meals. I feed these to the cats as special treats. Their regular diet consists of Science Diet dry sensitive stomach formula, which they all tolerate well and enjoy, but they love this stuff. I have purchased other brands of the foil pouch meals and either they won't eat it, or if they do, ultimately end up throwing up somewhere in the house. The cats go nuts when I open the cupboard and pull a couple of pouches out. I use two pouches to feed the four cats and since this is their treat, and not their regular food, I can afford to add this to their diet. They like this much better than the canned Friskies.
