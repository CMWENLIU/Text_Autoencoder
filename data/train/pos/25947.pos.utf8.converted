This summer a fellow gardener/foodie/food blogger made a tomato cobbler from cherry tomatoes from her garden. I was dazzled by the rich, sun-drenched flavor. One of the key seasonings was fennel pollen. I was hooked!<br /><br />Never had fennel before? You probably have and didn't know what it was. Fennel is the small ribbed seed that gives Italian sausage its unique flavor. Fresh fennel bulb (available in almost all groceries) is terrific added to marinara sauces where you need a little extra flavor. Fennel pollen, however, takes the flavor to a new level. Just a pinch added to dishes with pork, chicken or tomatoes gives you an deep rich taste of fennel. Fennel pollen pairs exceptionally well with hard Italian cheeses such as Romano or Parmesan, and with dishes made with dry red wines. I've really just begun to experiment with its uses. I'm sure it would be great in some Indian dishes and even tossed into scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the flavor of the pollen is much more concentrated than the seeds or the fresh bulbs. Start with just a pinch and taste before adding more. Nine dollars may seem like a lot of money for a tin of spice, but fennel pollen is so strong that this tin will last a long time. It's really a bargain when you consider how little you use.
