Hans Riegel was not only one of the most prominent manufacturer's of sweets, he introduced a product to the world that's far more addictive than crack or heroine.  These sweet little gummies are some of the tastiest bits of candy on the market.  Unfortunately they're addictive as well...my son foams at the mouth, begging for gummies at all hours.  At times this works to our advantage...bribery, a la the Scooby Snack. However, we know these are not the most nutritious snacks on the market.<br /><br />Curse you Hans Riegel!
