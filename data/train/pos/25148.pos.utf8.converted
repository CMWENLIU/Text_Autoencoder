I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, "unnatural," or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of "nutritional bars" available. The apple pie version is nicely chewy, with a taste of rolled oats, cinnamon, raisin, and, of course, apple, though it's not as intense or satisfying a fruit flavor as their Cherry Pie bar.  The apple hits you especially in the aftertaste, which is very satisfying.  Perhaps a bit on the dry side, but neither boring or cloying, and without that awful artificial taste mentioned above.<br /><br />The ingredient list is all one needs to read to discover the "secret" of Lara's natural taste:<br />Dates, almonds, unsweetened apples, walnuts, raisins, cinnamon. That's it! This is absolutely unheard of in type of food! Go to any comparable product (e.g., Cliff, Balance, Promax, South Beach, etc.) and you will find a veritable mine of vitamin and mineral additives.  For that reason alone (OK, and the concomitant wonderfully natural taste), these stand leagues above the competition.<br /><br />Does this reliance on natural foods cost you in nutrition?  I don't know--that's one for doctors and dietitians. However, I can list the nutritional values here:<br /><br />In one bar, you ingest the following:<br /><br />One serving (45 grams) provides 180 Calories--90 of them from fat;  10 g, Total Fat, of which only 1 gram is saturated fat,  4 grams are monounsaturated, and 4.5 grams are polyunsaturated (no trans fat, although, interesting enough, those grams add only to 9.5);  NO Cholesterol; 5mg of Sodium: 280mg, Potassium; 23 grams, Total Carbohydrate. Of which 4 grams are fiber and 17 grams, sugar (all that fruit), and 4 grams of protein. IT also provides 1 gram of Omega-3 and 4 grams of Omega 6 fatty acids. The fruit content sums to 1 serving of fruit according to the USDA food guide pyramid (I'm reading all this off the wrapper).<br /><br />Vitamins: Vitamins A and C --0% (of the percent daily values, based on a 2,0000 calorie diet), Vitamin E -10%,  Calcium--6%, Iron--8%, Thiamin (B1) --4%, Riboflavin (B2)-8%, Niacin (B3)--4%, Vitamin B6--4% Folate--4%, Zinc--4%, Copper--15%, Magnesium--10%.<br /><br />Some additional information can be found at--where-else--larabar.com, a nice little website where interested foodies can read about the company philosophy. For those not so inclined to visit, I offer an excerpt:<br /><br />"Humm Foods, the creator of L&Auml;RABAR, firmly believes that the foundation of a healthy mind, body and spirit is derived from what you eat. And what you eat is healthiest and most satisfying when it's in a whole, natural state...<br /><br />HUMM FOODS [note: this is contrasted with "junk foods"] ... resonate with energy in a whole, natural state. When consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive when consumed, they cause you to feel vibrant and alive.<br /><br />You can expect an unmistakable urge to humm after every L&Auml;RABAR  you eat.<br /><br />Let the humming begin!"<br /><br />Writing like that tells me these people are--and I hate using this overused word--PASSIONATE about their product. Give it a try!
