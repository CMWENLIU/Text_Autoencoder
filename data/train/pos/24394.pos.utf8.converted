These are great.  Better than Mounds bars as they are not as sweet, no corn syrup or other unnecessary ingredients.  The chocolate on them is not bitter, not sweet.  Its just right.  I like them in the afternoon as that dreaded 3:00 snack.  My husband loves them all the time.  He "discovered" the box of them and I had to order more just a few days later.
