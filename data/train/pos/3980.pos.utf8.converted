Ann's House Soy Energy Blend is fantastic. First, a word about price: Costco carries Ann's at the moment, but you know Costco- that could change, however, at Costco, I think it's cheaper by about half over some of the sites I've seen. Secondly- this stuff is dynamite! I bought Ann's for work precisely because I didn't want something that tastes "too good", i.e. trail mixes or candy that are full of fat, sugars, salts, and chocolate. Ann's is not sweet, but the cranberries, pumpkin seeds and occasional almond adds ample taste-appeal to the protein-packed soy. When in a captive environment like work, nibbling Ann's Energy Mix is good for you and super satisfying for the deep hunger that usually only meats, or peanut butter can fix. And, you will not even be aware of the benefit until 5 minutes after eating a handful or two. The satisfaction overcomes hunger and there is no guilt. Men may trip about soy and phytoestrogens, but the amount you're likely to eat will not affect any man. Hey- do they have a problem making babies in Asian countries where soy is their staple? Right! Get on with it then!
