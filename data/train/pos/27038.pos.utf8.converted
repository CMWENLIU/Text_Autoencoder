This is a very nice, versatile item in Jyoti's lineup. I had this for lunch today with a peas/carrot/corn organic veggie combo mixed in, and it was tasty and filling.<br /><br />Here's my opinion: The heat/hotness level (ie, the heat) is about mediumish. Maybe a bit to the mild side of medium. But it does have some heat, so know that. It's got good spicing, so it packs a flavor punch. There is a lovely creaminess, a thick creaminess, so you can water it down (as I do) to make soup or you can leave it thick to pour over rice or use naan to sop it up.<br /><br />My only critique is that the dumplings are not very dumplingey as I have previously experienced "dumplingness". They are, if I had to describe the texture/taste, like tiny baked potatoes. As if you cooked dumpling sized potatoes to a nice soft-firmness. But that's it. Like chunks of potato, not like dumplings (which I've had as airy and as chewy, depending).<br /><br />Since this is essentially just the potatoes and spiced milky-creamy base,  you can vary this in many ways by adding meats, veggies, thinning with milk or water, or topping with crispy bits (baked pita, croutons, etc) or bacon or cheese. Very versatile. This would totally rock with chicken pieces and peas, which is what I'll be making next with the Karhi. I will also try with spinach mixed in.<br /><br />For those watching their weight, this whole can is less than 300 calories worth of damage. :) And each serving has 70 calories (a can is four servings).<br /><br />This is the second Jyoti product offered on Amazon that I've tried. I think both are quite nice, and I will try their lentils with vegetables next. A high quality canned/convenience food for those who like Indian cuisine.
