The noodle may smell fishy when you open it and after you wash a few times,  but just mix it up with some canned soup and voilaa you have your dinner right there!  I can't believe how this noodle just fill you up.  I can usually eat 1-2 canned soup and still need to eat some snacks,  but wew with this noodle in the soup,  I can barely finish a can.<br /><br />Just a warning.  Some people might not like how it smells at first,  and how the texture is like... (somewhat like eating jelly-fish,  chewy and almost tasteless)  but it's a great way to be healthy (I mean come on... 0 calorie?  soy free?  gluten free?) or when you are on a budget...  (eat it with whatever with sauce and it will fill you up!!)<br /><br />I am sure if you can cook,  you can probably make this noodle tastes so much better,  but for someone like me who can't cook,  heating up canned soup is as far as I can go.  Obviously not something that can fulfill your daily nutrition or something but this is just a point of view from a poor college student u know.  Survival and not being hungry is the priority :)<br /><br />So,  don't starve,  eat your vitamins,  and proteins!!!  :)
