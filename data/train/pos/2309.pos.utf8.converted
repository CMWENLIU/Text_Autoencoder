Gustaf's Wine Gums have all the things I like about Gummis and none of what I don't.<br /><br />I like fruit flavors and chewy snacks. Wine gums are chewy and they have a fruit flavor that is not quite as sweet as Gummi snacks.<br /><br />I don't care for things that make my fingers sticky. Wine Gums have a texture like Swedish Fish.
