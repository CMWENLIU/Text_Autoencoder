My female cat who just was turning 12 this summer lost the fuction/strength of her back legs and she was hopping around (think bunny rabbit); I took her to the vet expecting to be told horrible news and have to put her down...nope. She had diabetes!  I had no idea that was a symptom of high blood sugar and high triglycerides in cats.  She was put on Insulin injections 2 x a day and I was told to stay away from dry cat food (the Vet also told me that diabetes in cats is a MAN CAUSED DISEASE! with all the by products, and grains and junk they put in those foods as fillers) and stick with a high protein low carb canned food twice a day.<br />We have another cat, a 5 yr old non diabetic male...so this meant his diet had to change as well. He was not happy when I took away all dry food.  And slowly over time, my 12 yr old started to sit at the dish more looking at me as to be saying..."sure i can walk but i'm starving lady!"<br /><br />After about a month of insulin injections and their new food routine, my 12 yr old started to regain strength in her back legs and was back up to walking on her toes most of the time, but still had a very hard time jumping on furniture or on the window sill.  I decided to add back the dry food just a small amt. a day and leave it out so they could graze when they were used to. My mom told me about this brand, she feeds it to her dogs, and said she thought they had a cat brand that didn't have any grains in it.<br /><br />I was hesitant b/c of the price and some of the feedback on other petfood sites suggested their cats hated it or it was "too strong" for them, whatever that means. Well, let me tell you...2 days later, my 12 yr old diabetic cat was RUNNING! I am not kidding.  She is 100% up on her toes all of the time, running, jumping back up on the couch and bed like she always used to as a younger cat, loves to play "fight" with her younger brother cat.  The difference is amazing.  My 5 yr old male cat enjoys the food very much, and while I did try the canned variety that Blue Buffalo has to offer, they were not diggin it at all, so we returned back to the cheaper canned food they like and they get a 1/2 cup of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Dry in a bowl each morning and they just have a nibble here and there which keeps them both very  happy.  Their coats have never been fluffier and softer.  My female cat has never had soft or fun to pet fur; but suddenly I have noticed over the past week her hair seems fluffy and full and the softest it has ever been. My male cat has always been soft and fluffy, I didn't think his could get any softer, but it has!<br /><br />I'm not saying that Blue Buffalo was a miracle that suddenly made my 12 yr old diabetic cat walk again, I realize that a change in food and insulin was a big part of that, but this definatly made a difference in her quality of life and it happened fast!  It is pricey, but have you ever looked at the back of the ingredients list of other dry cat foods???  RIDICULOUS! THis brand is totally worth it.  ESp since they are getting such a little amt. each day, the large bag will last at least a month.<br /><br />I cannot say enough good things about this brand of food and the fact they actually sell something without grain and gluten. Cats do not need that junk!!!!!!<br /><br />I should also add that both cats seem to have nice soft, thick coats and are maintaining their weight.  My diabetic has always been obese topping off at 14 lbs, she lost 2 lbs over the past few years the Vet says prob the first symptom of her diabetes; she has went up to 13 1/2 lbs and has stayed there; which was a little of a concern when adding in this food; it is high in calories, but with all that running she now is doing up our 17 steps daily, she must be burning it off :)  Shop around for the price, I buy it in a certain well known pet store for about half of this price.
