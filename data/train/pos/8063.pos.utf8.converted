Yes, when you open them they have a little fishy smell to them but once you wash them you no longer smell it. Do not try to eat them plain...they have no taste and have a strange texture. BUT if you cook them in some broth they are yummy! I have done all kinds of things with them...mostly adding them to a stir fry. Try them if you are trying to eat a low cal diet...you don't have to starve...they fill you up!! I'm happy with them just don't expect them to be like a reg noodle...the have more of the texture of seaweed...but hey, I love seaweed salad:)
