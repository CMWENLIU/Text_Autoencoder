I debated getting one of these in a gourmet kitchen store but declined because I thought the price tag was too steep at fifty bucks. However, I just received one as an early birthday present to go with my new Tassimo coffee maker and, in doing my review, find it's far cheaper as of the time of my review here.<br /><br />This is made very well...heavy shiny metal but it flows very easily. So much so that you could spin it fast and keep it twirling. I only say that, not because you'd need to do that, but so you can visualize that there is no tipping or hard pushing when selecting your coffee, tea, or cocoa.<br /><br />We had the self-dispenser boxes on our conter but, let's face it, it's not so attractive to do that and I like to keep a clean and organized countertop.  This is ideal if you have guests or if you like switching up your drinking choices. While it has 4 slots for drinks, you can actually have 8 different selections because you can pull from both the bottom and the top of the dispenser so we fill the dispenser slots with 2 different choices so we have 8 choices total. If you entertain or have frequent guests as we do, you can have some lighter coffees and heavier ones, tea, cocoa, espresso, etc and each guest can pick their choice to make their brew. But we like this for our choice variations equally.  I love green tea for the health benefits and taste, I like Nabob Columbian coffee for a smaller cup that's smooth, and Starbucks for a large cup, we like to keep the Milka hot chocolate on hand for a low cal decadent treat, etc. With an easy turn you can make your choice and it takes up very little room on the counter while matching our stainless appliances so it seems to fit well without looking unsightly.<br /><br />I usually list negatives in my reviews to give a balanced picture but I really don't have any for this one. It's a good size and works well.  Happy I got it.<br /><br />Note: This is similar to the cream dispensers or jelly dispensers you might see at a breakfast restaurant if that helps visualize it. This is for the Tassimo brand coffees.
