Thank God they still make this stuff, the huge MSG scare that happened way back seems to have maintained its brainwash effect on people.<br />MSG was never actually proved to be harmful, but people went on such a nutso crazy about it (try searching "chinese restaurant syndrome" instead of MSG in google) that the FDA made everyone who puts it in everything label it. You can find the same basic components in food items like chicken stock and soy sauce.<br />Five stars for making good food even more delicious!
