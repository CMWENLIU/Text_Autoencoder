This has to be one of, if not THE, favoriate coffees for the Keurig brewer.<br />(Loved the Equinox blend but it is no more)<br />The fact that there is a lot less plastic is the icing on the cake. Organic just seals the deal.<br />The manufacturer does note on the package that once you open the sealed bag, it needs to be re-sealed with a clip or band to keep the pods fresh.<br />I just moved the remaining pods to an air tight glass jar.<br />Hope Amazon.com keep these in stock.
