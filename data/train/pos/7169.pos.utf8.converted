I use these beans with my LeLit pl53 grinder and Rancilio Silvia espresso machine. I am definitely an amateur barista, but with these nice beans in hand I was able to really up the quality of my shots. They just seem a little more forgiving than other beans I have tried. I get nice zebra-striping during the shot, and a fair amount of crema. However, crema is not the end-all of a shot for me, I mostly just want it to taste good! Other beans may deliver a larger amount of crema, but shots of this bean are mild and smooth without bitterness. Enjoy!
