We purchased this in addition to the Red Vines Black Licorice Twists.<br /><br />Red Vines provide excellent value; you will not find four pounds of candy at this price that is so popular with kids and adults. Red Vines are Star-K kosher-certified with no fat and only 140 calories per serving (five pieces/vines).<br /><br />The licorice is also versatile for many occasions. I use Red Vines licorice for Halloween, birthday parties and I keep a tub at the office to fend off co-workers who roam around in the afternoon, looking for a snack.<br /><br />Licorice requires tender, loving care. Unlike hard candy, which can (and often does) sit for months in the bottom of your grandmother's purse, licorice tastes best soft and fresh. Storage should be airtight and at room temperature. Lucky for us, this order arrives in a plastic tub with a nine-month shelf life.<br /><br />According to the Red Vines web site, "many fans heat Red Vines candy in their microwaves for 5-7 seconds or until the candy reaches the desired softness." I tried this trick and it works great, softening the licorice into a delectable treat.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.
