I've used this Savory Choice product for over a year and can recommend it highly. It is delicious and easy. Inside each individual packet is a thick liquid: just add it to a cup of water to make the broth. This is not like the low-salt, low-fat powders or the canned products but more like broth you've cooked from scratch. Comes in beef, chicken, and turkey flavors. I keep it handy on my RV as well as in my kitchen.<br />Update 2010: I'm still ordering and using the chicken broth and the beef broth as staples in my pantry and on the RV. I've given packets away to friends so they can enjoy these excellent products. While cooking, you can squeeze the packet into your food and add the cup of water, then stir. Easy and a big saving in shelf space over cans.
