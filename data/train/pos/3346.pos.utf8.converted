On a trivial note, the bag is beautiful, but difficult to open.<br />The coffee smells and tastes wonderful.  It brews to the color of a medium or medium - dark roast (closer to medium).  It is bright without being overly acidic (it retains a smoothness, but not so smooth as to be mellow; it is still bright).  It is rich and good mouth feel.  It retains it's flavor for the whole pot without changing (I'm assuming it would if you left it in glass carafe on hot plate).<br />I brought a thermal carafe to work right after brewing and honestly, it could have been a coffee commercial:<br />Eyes opening widely, "Omg, this is really good coffee."<br />Big grin, "This is delicious!  This is the best coffee I've ever had!  I love you, and I mean it this time!"<br />Satisfied smile, "This is really good coffee, delightful.  It tastes like coffee from when I grew up (in Central America)."<br />When I first brewed and tasted it I thought to myself, this may be the only coffee I ever buy again.<br />Usually I purchase:  Starbucks, Gevalia, and Illy.<br />The price really is pretty good for 12 oz bags of ORGANIC coffee!
