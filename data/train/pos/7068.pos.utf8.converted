Hi,  we own two pups.  The previous owner gave us a bag of Purina food when we bought them.  They were so itchy that I though they had fleas.  I bought fleas medicine, but it didn't help.  I went to petsmart, and they recommended me to buy this brand.  Nutro Natural Choice Wheat free helped them.  It eliminated their itch about 85 to 90%  with the first bag.  I never going to change the brand.  The price is a bit expensive comparing with other brands, so I recommend to buy in ebay coupons for this food.  I buy get $3.00 off for any bag.  Petsmart sells a 5 lbs. bag @ $9.29, but Aubuchon sells their @ $7.99.  Check your local distributors for prices.  They also have a frequent buyer program (buy 10 and get 1 free).  Register in their, and they will send you coupons.
