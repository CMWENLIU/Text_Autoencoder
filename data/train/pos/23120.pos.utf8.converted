My Shih Tzu (Hampshire), Shihkanese (Darby), & Amer. Eskimo (London) absolutely love this dog food.  It's their special treat for when we travel both short & long distances.  My Vet calls it doggie McDonalds.  I get it at Sams Club for 16.98 + 6.5% tax--thought Amazon would be cheaper ($24.00, plus tax, & ship/hand)
