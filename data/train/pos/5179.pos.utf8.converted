My husband is an expat from the UK, and had been missing the traditional "fry-up" he could get for breakfast there. I ordered this as a surprise for him.  When he tucked into his fry up, he raved about the "proper bacon" and the "proper sausage" - just like he would have gotten for himself back home.<br /><br />Everything was well packed, and the order arrived promptly, with a little brochure about Irish food products and info on how to cook a fry up, for those who need some help.<br /><br />I am sure we'll be ordering this again, to combat future bouts of homesickness.
