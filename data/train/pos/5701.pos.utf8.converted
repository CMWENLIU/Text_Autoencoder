I am now on my third package of Himilayan dog chews from Amazon.  They are amazing and you can't beat the free shipping from the suppliers on Amazon!  My search for a long lasting chew started when our lab/doberman puppy was only about 3-4 months old.  I had read so many good things about bully sticks so I ordered them and then just about threw up when I smelled them!  I tried to look over it, gave it to our pup (who loved it) but then not only did it smell while he was eating it, but his breath was stinky for a while afterwards!  Plus, I'd say the bully stick didn't seem to last much longer than a regular (non-stinky) rawhide.  Then I ordered the Himilayan dog chew.  He wasn't sure how to approach it since it is literally rock hard.  But, then he started scrapping it with his teeth.  He isn't the type of dog to take big bites so he's never gotten any big hunks off of it.  One chew last weeks since we usually save it for an after dinner snack/entertainment (1-2 hours at a time).  Not only does the Himalyan dog chew last a really long time, it also barely smells at all unless you hold it to your nose!  And, at that, it's just a smoked gouda type smell so it's not repulsive like a bully stick.  Plus, it seems to keep our pups breath smelling much better than if he doesn't have it!  We had actually taken a Himalayan dog chew with us on a road trip to my parents house and their dog (9 year old lab mix) actually snuck into our bag and stole the cheese!  This is actually a very surprising thing because their dog has NEVER been a chewer.  If given something hard, she actually just hides it and never eats it.  So, to see her take the cheese and bite small pieces off, I knew she must have loved it!  On our next visit I made sure to have an extra piece of cheese just for her.  Needless to say, I cannot recommend trying this out enough!  If it ends up your dog didn't like it, you just tried one more item in an attempt to make them happy.  If they love it though, you will have found a great investment in your dogs health and happiness!  Our pup LOVES his cheese!
