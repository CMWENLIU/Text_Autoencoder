One of my favorite stores has carried Twinings Darjeeling Tea in loose leaf form for years. Suddenly it has disappeared from all stores.  The product is great. Tea bags are every where, but loose leaf is difficult to find.  The only problem with the tea from Amazon is that the shipping charges are about the same price as the tea.  I am still looking for an affordable version of the tea.
