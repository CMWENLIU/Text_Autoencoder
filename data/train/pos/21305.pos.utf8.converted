This is one of the COOLEST baby gadgets I've found, I feel like shouting it from the rooftops.<br /><br />If you buy organic baby food for your little one, these spoons are a MUST!  They make feeding on-the-go so easy and make clean-up a cinch.  No bowls for your baby to put their hands in (or for you to wash).  These spoons screw onto the top of pouch baby food that has the screw-top.  It works with Plum Organics, Ella, HappyBaby, Peter Rabbit and Revolution Foods.  I have also used the Boon Spoons which are cool but do require more cleanup as you have the spoon, tip and silicone base to clean up.  These are also MUCH smaller and more portable for travel, I slip the case of spoons and 1-2 pouches of baby food in the diaper bag.  You can feed her solid food in the car and it's relatively neat!<br /><br />If you don't buy organic food (normally) for your little one, but are interested in this product for travel / eating out, I'd still recommend it.  You may be able to find a pack of 2 for a fraction of the price sold here (which is a 4-pack).  So do check your local baby food store as well.<br /><br />We use the Gerber Organic plastic tubs at home, too, as they are cheaper than the pouch foods.  The nice thing about the spoons is that it doesn't contaminate the food so you can reseal and reuse it later if the feeding was not very productive.  (I'd say within 24 hours or whatever the manufacturer of the food recommends).  My husband is guilty of opening the Gerber tub food, not putting it in a bowl, feeding our daughter two bites and then the rest goes to waste.  So this system is a lot more efficient despite the higher cost of the 'pouch' food.
