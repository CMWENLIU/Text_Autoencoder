I use the regular Sleepytime frequently in the evenings, but on those nights when you need a little something extra, this stuff is amazing. Its very nice when travelling and you are having a hard time sleeping in a strange bed.  I don't like taking medications (no Lunestra for me) but with this, don't need to.
