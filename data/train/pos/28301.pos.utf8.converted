This product is every bit the rave of other reviewers. With the stand alone recipe the product is relatively dense and rich in flavor. I have found the following additions to the mix, make this cake EXCEPTIONAL.  1/4-1/3 cup ground almonds/walnuts/mixed; 3-4 tablespoons of good quality Coco Mix; 1-2 extra tablespoons of water; and turn down the oven temperature to 335 F. after 15 minutes and extend the bake time 10 minutes [40 total min.].  The basic mix has great potential for nut and berry combinations that are compatible with rich chocolate. Ice with Coco-whipped cream, refrigerate.
