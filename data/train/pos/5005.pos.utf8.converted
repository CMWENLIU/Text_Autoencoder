The jerky tastes good, the texture is good, taste is good, not oily, not dry.  The pepper taste is very light - I have had some pepper jerky that almost made me choke on the pepper (I like pepper) and this jerky just tastes good - the taste of pepper is there but very mild.  This is well worth trying.
