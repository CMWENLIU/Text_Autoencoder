The title pretty much sums it up.  :)  Not too sweet, and just absolutely delicious.  Every time I have a different cereal, I wish I was eating this instead.  I don't even know why I bother with the other kinds now that I've found this stuff...and it's good for you, too!<br /><br />"Can life get any better?  I submit that it cannot!"  ;)
