I bought this to try, as my daughter is a vegetarian.  We both love it!  Very tasty and filling; it hits the spot at lunch.  I mix up a box at a time and keep the made up mix in a baggie in the fridge, ready to whip out and fry at a moment's notice.  I just spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray and use a little olive oil as well.  I will be buying this again when we run out.  I also buy the taco "meat" from this company.
