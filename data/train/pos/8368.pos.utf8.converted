After my husband had a heart attack I started looking for healthy, low-fat, low-sugar snacks... that he would actually eat.  In Cooks Illustrated I read about the healthy snack of nutritional yeast flakes sprinkled onto popcorn.  I bought some to try and can happily report it is delicious!  Hubby was even licking his finger to get the last bits off the bottom of the popcorn bowl.  Nutritional yeast has many other uses which can now be explored since it passed the critical taste test with hubby.<br />Being unable to find this product at health food stores I bought through Amazon.  The price was fair and shipping was FREE.<br />We highly recommend this product.
