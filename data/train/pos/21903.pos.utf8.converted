Tired of those insipid supermarket hot cocoa mixes? Waiting for the taste of real deep, dark, rich chocolate? Well, then you will not be disappointed with Godiva's Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa. Definitely made for serious chocoholics. I am now totally addicted. Once you've tried it, you will never go back to Swiss Miss, Nestle's or any other whimpy imitations.
