We have tried four other coffee direct blends, and this by far, is my favorite.  Very deep flavor without the acid and oils to spoil the enjoyment....  It is not as good as the house blend which is always  freshly roasted from Full City in Eugene... but it is half the price...and as Yogi said, a nickles just not worth a dime anymore.  If you like it very strong try 6 mins in  a French Press...if not, drip is just fine.  I would not freeze beans to store as others have advised.
