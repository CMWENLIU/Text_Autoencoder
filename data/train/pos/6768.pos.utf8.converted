I'm on my second order of tea (having already gone through 12 boxes) and I've come to really enjoy this tea. It's light enough that I can drink two cups everyday and the flavor never gets old.<br /><br />The brown rice is the real winner here. It compliments the green tea perfectly. This tea seems to have a settling effect on my stomach and has enough caffeine to give you a little boost without giving me a headache (which I almost always get from drinking coffee).
