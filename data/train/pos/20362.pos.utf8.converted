I love dark chocolate and I don't eat sugar, grains or starches (Paleo Diet).  This is awesome dark chocolate.  Two small squares will satisfy my craving.  You need to be a dark chocolate lover for this chocolate; it is 98% dark chocolate.  This may be pricier than a Hershey bar but it lasts a long, long time.  I keep it in the freezer and break off two little squares when I want something to satisfy a craving.  In the past, I have had very high percentages of dark chocolate that was sweetened with sugar and it wasn't near as good as this dark chocolate.  If you are a funk food junkie, eat a lot of processed sugar and don't like dark chocolate, this would not be for you.  If you are a real dark chocolate lover then this would be for you.
