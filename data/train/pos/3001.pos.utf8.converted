Eden Organic makes amazing products, including beans in BPA-free cans.  They're careful with their sources and with their packaging, so I don't mind paying a little extra for products that I trust.<br /><br />But the price still seemed like a lot to me for beans, so I went to my local food coop to see what they charged for organic beans.  It was the same price per pound for loose organic red beans, and that was the only kind of organic beans they had.<br /><br />The beans themselves are good quality and cook up deliciously.
