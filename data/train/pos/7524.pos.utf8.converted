This is a great book about fortune cookies and their messages. When a Mei Mei's family finished dinner here come the fortune cookies. Everyone reads their fortune and Mei Mei wonders if these fortunes will really do come true. As the story unfolds you get to see each family member and their fortune! I really like Grace Lin's books!
