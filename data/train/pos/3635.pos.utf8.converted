This powder has a refreshingly subtle, confection-like aroma; it is thinly ground. I've used it to make my own solid chocolate bars - it worked very well, the chocolate tastes creamier and less bitter, then with my usual organic brand. I think this cocoa can be used specifically for making solid candy bars. Food allergy sufferers can appreciate it: soy free chocolate.  I found myself allergic to any factory or specialty gourmet chocolate bars even if they swore in written "never use emulsifyers" "soy free" "100% chocolate" etc (some of those "cheater" brands later started indicating soy lecithin in their ingredients).  Well, you can use this powder to make your own chocolate. It's a simple process. Just get good quality cocoa butter, use boiling water bath to melt it in, mix in enough cocoa powder to thicken the liquid a bit, add sweetener of your choice,  maybe powdered milk  - taste it and adjust any flavoring - and here the magic starts - heat the mixture up in the boiling water bath till it gets more liquidy (about 5 min) and cool it off while stirring till it thickens somewhat (about 2-3 min). Repeat at least 3-4 times; after the last heating pour it in a non-stick container (or any container laid with non-stick foil) and put it in the freezer until completely solid (an hour maybe). You can take it out of the freezer later and just keep is in the frigde. Depending on the air temperature you can keep it out of the fridge. P.S.: The more times you change the mixtures' temperature and the better you stir it when cooling, the solider  chocolate bar comes out of it. Practice makes perfect and Navitas Naturals Cacao helps!
