This is an excellent vialone nano rice - which is my favorite for making risotto - vialone nana allows for a softer creamer rice (ie slightly more cooking) without degrading and losing its form and texture as some other "risotto rices" can do if cooked beyone al dente. Excellent quality and reasonable price.
