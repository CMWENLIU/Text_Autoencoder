This is a great product.  If you dislike plain water, as I do, you'll find this item makes drinking water a breeze.  It is also good as a sweetner for coffee or tea.  While I like Vanilla Creme best, all the flavors are excellent.  It is really just a question of preferred taste.  I also enjoyed chocolate raspberry and english toffee.
