I wanted to try a recipe which called for Nutritional Yeast - something I had never heard of before.  I did a little research to find out more about nutritional yeast and I was intrigued. It is very tasty.  I sprinkle it on my fruit breakfast every morning. I have used it in soups, sprinkled on vegetables, on pasta. It adds a unique flavor, which I like very much.  I have to trick my boyfriend into eating well and this is a great way to add Vitamin B12 to any dish.
