This rice blend is the best tasting rice i have ever experienced. I use a zoji rice cooker with fuzzy logic set on the brown rice setting. Iuse canned swanson chicken stock instead of water and put butter in the bowl before cooking.  The net result is a mind blowing goodness that is nutty and extremely flavorful. The texture is also very pleasing. This is a great blend. If you want great reviews on your dinner presentation then this should be part of your dinner plate. Raves are guaranteed if you make it this way. I have not tried to cook it any other way as i have found gourmet perfection and there is no need to modify or mess with this good thing.
