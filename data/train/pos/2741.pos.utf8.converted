The way I like to eat it is dip my finger in it. May be I'll use a bread once a while with some unfiltered olive oil. May be sometimes as a glaze on a venison tenderloin cooked rare. I think a great balsamico makes a huge difference. Try this one side by side with a $3 bottle of cheap vinegar and you'll know what I'm talking about. This balsamico is not at all acidic like the junk you buy from the supermarkets. Its mildly acidic, sweet, nutty and rich with a hint of oak. This is not labeled D.O.P and its not aged for 12 years. But don't let that fool you. You can find 15 year aged vinegar at Sam's club that tastes like sauerkraut juice. What I like most about this is the balance between the sweetness and acidity. Little more acidic and this will become a regular vinegar. Little less acidic this will taste like reduced grape juice. Its a perfect balance of thickness, sweet and sour and I was not able to give it any negatives on the taste. Is it the world's best balsamico ? Probably not. This vinegar is sufficiently aged but in order for it to be the best more aging is required. But do I care about 25 years aging on a vinegar and pay 100 dollar a bottle so that I can get a more prominent oak flavor ? Certainly not. So this is what I'll be buying from now on.
