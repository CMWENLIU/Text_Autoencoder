Old School cinnamon toothpics in bulk quantity, Yay!  The concept is simple but effective--These are made of a wood slightly softer (and much more absorbant) than the regular plain boxes of round toothpicks, and soaked in STRONG cinnamon oil.  The resulting flavor is VERY strong cinnamon often resulting in numb tongue/lips, DO NOT confuse these with those wimpy so-called "flavored" round toothpicks passed out in fancy-schmancy resteraunts.<br /><br />We used to buy these at the liquor store across from school in 5-piece packs (I lived in a terrific neighborhood).  I vividly remember chewing on these in High School during certain classes to stay awake.  For some reason, a toothpick was tolerated where gum or a tootsie pop was not.  The flavor was so good (STRONG) for so long, I would often end up chewing these things to a nice, woody pulp. MMMmmm!  Against my nature, I am going to resist commenting on cinnamon toothpicks as a source of dietary fiber.  For those saddled with droning teachers or co-workers, know that it is simply not possible to fall asleep with something as hot as these toothpicks in your mouth.  In college, I found them useful in finally breaking my nail biting habit.  Wood pulp, thankfully, is non-addictive.  Offer one to a non-suspecting friend and watch their eyes light up along with their tongue! :)
