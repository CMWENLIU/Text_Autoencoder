Arrived squashed flat but you could see pockets of yeast breath air.Added the small amount of dechlorinated water into the pouch it comes in(easier to get out).mixed the flour and starter/water in an opaque crock. the next morning it was bubbling away with a sharp sourness that was missing from my homemade starter(RIP).I made two separate starters right off the bat, in case one of them gets dropped or gets swine flu.I haven't got to make bread yet but everything looks good... can't wait to share it.
