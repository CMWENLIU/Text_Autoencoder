Have enjoyed this for years (before the low carb bubble burst)! Would not even consider trying the newer brands sweetened with aspartame. Splenda may not be good for me, but it is lesser of my three evils. (Sugar's the other, of course). Have tried most of the Baja Bob line and this one is my favorite. Took me a while to find this flavor after the name change from Desert Lime. BTW-We use this for more than margaritas. Add a splash to Crystal Clear (Splenda-sweetened) or water sans tequila for a lite adult flavored beverage. Or make key lime salad dressing with mayo or kefir (fresh ginger is a good addition, too) or a marinade with a little oil and chipotle powder added.<br /><br />If you are really serious about your sugars, carry this to your next party or favorite restaurant. If you are generous enough to share I bet your friends won't taste that it's sugar-free!
