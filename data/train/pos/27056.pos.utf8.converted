These crackers are AMAZING.  I tried them as a free sample, topped with a small piece of brie cheese, at a Sam's Club store.  I expected them to taste like any other multigrain cracker, but was blown away by how good the sample was.  I immediately bought a box, and literally crave and look forward to eating them, which is not something I thought I would ever say about a cracker.<br /><br />Saying that they taste like corn nuts, as the previous reviewer did, might turn some people off.  They're not really like corn nuts, but they have a pleasant savory non-wheat grain/seed flavor, as do corn nuts.  The base is brown rice meal, which is mixed with a variety of seeds (sesame, quinoa, amaranth, flax) and tamari soy sauce powder.  The soy sauce is almost imperceptible and complements the other flavors well - it gives the cracker just a slight savory flavor, not a noticeable "soy sauce" flavor.  Other multigrain crackers, even high quality crackers, lose their flavor as they are chewed, and end up tasting bland or even doughy.  These keep their flavor - a deep grainy, savory flavor.  I am pretty sure they would appeal to both cracker lovers and those who like to snack on chips.<br /><br />These crackers are excellent topped with brie cheese, dipped in salsa, or eaten plain.  The brown rice meal base means that the crackers are crunchy and hold up to liquids better than wheat crackers do.  They're low sodium, gluten-free, and low calorie - you can eat 15 for 140 calories, and 15 of these makes a satisfying snack.  What's not to love?  I do not make a point to eat gluten-free items, but these are absolutely delicious for anyone.<br /><br />Just a snack idea - for 240 calories, you can eat 1 ounce of brie, and 15 crackers.  Believe it or not, 1 ounce of brie can be divided among 15 crackers and each bite is satisfying.<br /><br />By the way, I only paid $7 or $8 for this size box at Sam's Club.  I love these crackers so much and find them to be so unusual in flavor that I plan to buy boxes for several family members.  They make a wonderful "go to" healthy snack for anyone who is trying to lose weight, gluten-free diet or not.<br /><br />Note - these are FULFILLED by Amazon, NOT SOLD by Amazon.  The beef about the price should be taken up with the actual seller.
