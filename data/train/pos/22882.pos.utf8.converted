Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Deluxe Dinner rates five stars for taste and convenience. It's the perfect comfort food or go-to meal when you need something delicious and satisfying. I always keep it in the house. Sometimes I toss in a little left-over ham or chicken. With a little veggie on the side, it's a wonderful, fast meal and a total crowd-pleaser. If you're feeling inventive, toss some toasted bread crumbs over the top!<br /><br />Love it!
