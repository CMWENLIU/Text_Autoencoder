Stumbled across this product after discovering my son has a horrible peanut allergy.  He can now have 'sun butter and jelly' sandwiches kind of like a normal kid!  This has completely replaced peanut butter in my house and tastes much better in my opinion.  We like the creamy style.  I have heard others complain about the texture of sunbutter, but I don't think they realize that there are multiple textures (creamy, natural, crunchy).
