Up until about 2 months ago, I was able to get the glass and PET plastic red VOSS bottles at the local grocery. I'm glad I found this online. For me, the taste was very clean, crisp, and clear. I don't like water in the first place and many of the other bottled waters taste like minerals to me. Voss was very refreshing and seemed to be "tasteless" and odorless. I like it ice cold, straight from the bottle. I highly recommend it. I'll only drink this or Dasani when possible. I tend to prefer San Pellegrino over all other sparkling waters as well. I have been fortunate enough to have never had issues with delivery and/or broken bottles.
