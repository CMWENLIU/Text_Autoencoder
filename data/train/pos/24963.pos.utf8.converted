saw this at my local grocery store and thought i would give it a try. was a little iffy about it but thought it was an interesting product. like that package says it doest have a rather offensive smell right out of the package but rinse it for a good minute and it completely goes away. now if oyu arent a person who likes vegan and organic type foods this might not be your cup of tea but i personally think its wonderful, mainly due to its very low calorie count. the taste of it is very mild and just like tofu it pretty much absorbs the taste of whatever to put it with. i would say its taste is a cross between a pasta, tofu and the canned bean sprouts often found in the chines foods section. unlike some of the other reviews i didnt find the texture to be rubbery at all, thought it was almost identical to a real speghetti noodle
