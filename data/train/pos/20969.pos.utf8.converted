As someone who has gone from cooking for 4 to now cooking for 1-2 I'm having to adjust recipes to make smaller portions.  Chicken broth is a grocery item that I use in many recipes but small (8oz) portions are not available at any of the local grocery stores in my hometown. I ordered this because of the convenience of being able to open only what I need but I will continue to purchase not only because of size but taste.  The taste is awesome compared to Swanson's, Campbells, Sweet Sue, etc.  This broth has no clumps of fat floating as with previously mentioned brands and it's not high in sodium.  It is organic, healthy, gluten free and tastes GREAT!
