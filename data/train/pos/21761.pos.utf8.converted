Makes you feel alert without making your heart pound out of your chest.  Doesn't make you feel hyper-alert, it just makes you feel normally awake.  I've taken this on the brink of exhaustion late at night it definitely makes me feel 10 AM awake, without feeling obnoxious.  I'm a regular coffee drinker but this stuff is alot more effective with no jitters.  Works for about 3 hours for me but the 'no crash' thing is a bunch of hooey.  It just means no sugar crash.  If you were tired when you took it, you obviously better be near a couch when it wears off.  Once your body remembers how tired you really are you'll pass right out when it wears off.  Definitely the best out of all the energy drinks out there when used sparingly.  Tastes horrible but it does what it claims to do.  I only use this stuff sparingly, as-needed but has yet to let me down.
