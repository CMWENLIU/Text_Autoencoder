Theo's milk chocolate coconut curry bar is not for everyone -- it is very spicy and the sting of curry powder is the highest note in the taste, at least initially.  But this is my favorite of Theo bars, not just for the spiciness, but also because the spice quickly dissipates as the chocolate melts on the tongue, and the sting is soothed by one of the best milk chocolates I've ever tasted -- silky as it dissolves.  The coconut adds a bit of crunch to the texture.  This is a highly unique bar, and very rewarding if you like sophisticated taste combinations.
