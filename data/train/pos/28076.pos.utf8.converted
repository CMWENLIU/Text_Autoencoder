I must say that for me Bob's Red Mill Coconut Flour has been my latest<br /><br />favorite find. Overall, I am a stickler for quality and this brand<br /><br />has that base covered.<br /><br />I have added this Coconut Flour into my smoothies with fab results.<br /><br />My intial reason for purchasing this product was not as a "sub" flour to use as baking, but rather as an easy, quick and hopefully nice tasting fiber boost. Heck, it doesn't add any sugar. Carb level is fine, fat level is fine (for my purposes).  Well, nice tasting it certainly is!<br /><br />The texture is as fine as baby powder. Blends in seamlessly to my smoothies and now I have started to add to my homemade sauces and dressings. It adds to the smooth texture & consistency, nice subtle flavor<br /><br />and for the fiber boost.<br /><br />This product does not have a "bowl you over" coconut flavor.<br /><br />In fact, when I use quite a bit of it in my smooties, it has a slight<br /><br />hint of coconut ... not even enough to register on my boyfriend's unsuspecting palette.<br /><br />Don't rely on published recipes to harness the value of this product.<br /><br />Explore and do what you want.<br /><br />NOTE about the fiber boost:  My latest research points to 35g of fiber<br /><br />being a target amount for daily consumption. I add a fiber boost here and there and it adds up
