I actually don't even own a peppergrinder because I found that my marble mortar and pestle worked better. When I want pepper, I pour a few of the corns into the mortar. A careful push of the pestle gives me coarse pepper. Mulling the pestle around gives me finely ground, and the aroma is amazing. I use it for all kinds of herbs. I like a second mortar set because if you make pounded garlic or herb butter, it flavors the somewhat porous stone.<br /><br />If you like cloves, allspice, or any whole spices that are so much more flavorful, this is a fantastic tool and it makes your kitchen counter look like something from the old country.
