Like everything else in this world is the old saying..... "if it tastes good its not good for you" sooooooo go ahead and live a little and enjoy the wonderful taste this gives coffee or espresso....whats good especially is the "sugar free" then goes back to the world of eating right.....which means bland bland bland.....(except vegetables)Hmmmmmmm coffee bean??? vegetable??? (HaHaHa)
