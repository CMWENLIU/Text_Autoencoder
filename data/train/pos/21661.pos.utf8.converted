I hate veggies...REALLY have veggies, so I used frozen wheat grass juice in smoothies, until this product was recommended to me by a colleague.  I'd be lying if I said I've ever consumed this on it's own, so I can't comment on flavor.  After my workouts, I typically make a smoothie with a few greens, a slew of fruit, and protein powder.  I dumped the trays of wheat grass, and now simply add a scoop of Amazing Grass to my amazing concoction.  Whole Foods charges over $30 for the same size container; great pricing here!
