I wasn't sure what to expect with this flour, and assumed I was going to have to mix it with whole wheat flour to make a more substantial loaf of artisan bread. It turns out, it is like nothing I have ever bought before, being more like a light whole wheat that gives you some of the properties of a white flour but still has the nutty branny flavor and texture. I am definitely sticking with this flour and telling my friends about it. It's like a hybrid mix of white and whole wheat flour and makes an excellent loaf of bread.
