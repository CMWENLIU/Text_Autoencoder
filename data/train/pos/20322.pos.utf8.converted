I know this some very pricey coffee, but it was as good, if not better than,  I remember from many years ago.  This is a medium roast and it brews a wonderfully smooth, flavorful beverage that is low in acidity.  Both of us thought it was the best coffee we had brewed in a very long time, if not ever.<br />I wish I could afford to drink it all the time, but enjoying it a few times a year will make it seem even better.
