I started by buying the Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker here on Amazon. We experimented with the Presto and Epicurious recipes and cooking times. Three keys with the Presto:<br /><br />1) Use cooking spray on the griddles, not butter or oil, which cause mottling. [EDIT- now that my Presto is "seasoned" a bit, I don't wash it more than necessary and I often skip the cooking spray altogether]<br />2) Ideal cooking time is 3:15. I don't see why others complained about the timer feature.<br />3) Don't try to be healthy and use egg whites or substitutes...it doesn't work as well.<br /><br />What DOES work is this Carbon's Malted. I think what's sold here is the same as they sell at a fancy cooking store known as W-S. We've been trying to find a malted recipe like you find in hotels and restaurants. With some Googling, you might find ideas about going to home brewing stores to source liquid malt. Well, consider the value of your time and just get this. Add butter, water and eggs, cook for 3 minutes 15 seconds and enjoy.<br /><br />Don't forget- splurge on real maple syrup...life is short and how often do you have great waffles?
