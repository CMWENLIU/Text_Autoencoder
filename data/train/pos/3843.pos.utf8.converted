I had just gotten home from my weekly bowling league to find my fiancee in bed with our neighbor.  You know how they say that a mother has so much adrenaline pumping through her system when her child is in danger that she can just about lift a car off of it?  When I saw those two desecrating my queen-sized air mattress in the corner, I got so worked up that I could have taken that mother and her child, locked them up in the trunk of that car, and tossed it onto the roof of of the self-storage facility around the corner, the one with the orange hangar-style doors.  That's three stories high.  Anyway, the two fled out the back door and I went into a rage.  I broke everything in the house that reminded me of her.  The toaster-oven she used to make me pepperoni bagel-bites for breakfast each morning, the ironing board that we trimmed the legs down on so that it could double as a coffee table during that Pawn Stars marathon last July.  After about 45 minutes, I was totally drained from breaking stuff.  I took the truck down the road to the Citgo station to refuel and got a sleeve of those mini-powdered donuts and a Redbull Zero because my doctor says that too much sugar will make my Diabetes flare up.  It's a lot less syrupy than the regular Redbulls, but it definitely perked me back up.  On the way home, that Mr. Mister song about Broken Wings came on and I knew it was a sign because my heart was broken and Redbull gives you wings.  At that point, I knew I had to forgive her.  We've been happily married for 8-months now with a little one on the way, and I can honestly say that without Redbull Zero, I may have never gotten up the courage to patch things up.  I highly recommend this product to anyone going through a rough patch in their relationship.
