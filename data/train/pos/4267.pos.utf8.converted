While variety packs sound like a good idea, you should be aware that there is a reason you usually aren't told exactly what's in it. It's because almost always, the vendor throws in a bunch of flavors, blends, teas, and decafs that are not usually what you want. It can be a waste of money for most.<br /><br />A much better solution, besides sampling a friends K-cup favorites, is to go onto the Keurig site ( http://www.keurig.com/KCupResults.asp?AllProducts=AllProducts&mscsid=HGR8G81WMFQB9NS0DN0EH4MKJREN8UAF ) and buy their low cost 5 packs. They usually cost under $3 and give you enough coffee to help decide what you might like. Plus, you'll know exactly what's in the smapler before you buy it.<br /><br />It is also a great idea to visit the K-Cup Exchange on Yahoo http://groups.yahoo.com/group/K-CUP/  This site is an excellent source of K-Cup info and allows you to trade unwanted k-cups, and talk to others to find the best deals and brewing tips.
