My husband luvs chocolate chip cookies and has been hinting real hard for me to make them for him. Well I got a 4 month old right now & don't have the time or inclination to make them from scratch. I have tried other mixes in the past but they where just so-so in taste. These cookies came out tasting like the kind you pay extra for fresh from the bakery! Perfect amount of chocolates and the texture is just right.<br /><br />The Hubsster was pleasantly surprised when he saw these babies cooling on the stove during the week. He made groceries this weekend and bought me extra flower and eggs.. uh,oh!! I just don't have the heart to tell him they aren't 100% homemade.. Oh well, I'll make a pie or something with the extra ingredients this weekend but for the time being, his weekly backed cookies are coming out of this awesome box!
