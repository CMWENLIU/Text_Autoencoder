These are fantastic.  Not dry or bland like some granola bars.  They're very chewy (kind of like Rice Krispy Treats!!) with lots of flavor.  I have these for a mid-day snack.  My 3 and 4 yr old love them too.  I also have tried the peanut butter version and found them to be equally as good.  I had been buying these bars at our local health food store.  Not only was I paying more money than Amazon sells them for, but they were not as fresh as the bars I got from Amazon.
