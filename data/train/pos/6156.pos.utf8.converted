Just in case you're new to White Tea a little background might be helpful...<br /><br />...in a nutshell, White Tea comes from the same plant (Camellia sinesis) that all other tea comes from (e.g. black, green, etc.) but what makes it "White Tea" has to do with when the leaf is harvested and how and to what degree it is processed to yield the final product.  In the case of White Tea, harvest occurs very early in the leaf's life cycle after which it undergoes very minimal processing.  At this early stage the leaf still has a white fur-like coating, hence the "white" moniker.  Also, due to these factors, White Tea also has by far the highest antioxidant content of any other tea and remains superior to all others in terms of healthful qualities.  If you haven't ever researched the health-promoting qualities of tea it's really amazing and worth some research when you have the time.  Tea - especially White Tea - positively impacts everything from cardiovascular disease to cancer to eyesight.  I would definitely rank White Tea (and Green Tea as well) in the "superfood" category on the same level as things like berries, garlic, tomatoes, or salmon. White Tea comes in four primary categories.  From highest grade to lowest they are:  1. Silver Needle White Tea (Bai Hao Yinzhen), 2. White Peony (Bai Mu Dan), 3.  Tribute Eyebrow (Gong Mei), 4. Noble, Long Life Eyebrow (Shou Mei).  White Tea is known for its mellow and delicate mildly-sweet flavor and pale-golden color.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Octavia Organic Silver Needle Tea certainly exemplifies the above qualities.  It isn't bitter or "grassy" in the least and represents a very solid and high quality White Tea. Is it the very best? No.  But then again, some White Teas considered the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me fetch hundreds of dollars and ounce (!!) so considering the cost trade-off this is a great choice. It's very mild and lightly-sweet and tastes wonderful simply plain. The tea comes in a nice resealable air-tight tin.  The leaves themselves are of obvious high quality (whole leaves with  only minimal breakage or other "parts" of the leaf) and smell wonderful.  I should mention here that I also drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E1W8">Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Loose Tea, 1.4-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a> another very good tea that I would recommend and bought through Amazon as well, although I slightly prefer the Octavia.<br /><br />...<br /><br />While I'm here I thought I might as well speak briefly about a few related issues that will prove very helpful if you're new to tea, especially high quality loose leaf tea:<br /><br />1.  It's all about the water. Bad water = bad tea.  If you really want to do it right, consider buying some really good water such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A38Y">Volvic Natural Spring Water, 500ml- Bottles (Pack of 24)</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTN6QS">Glacia Norwegian Spring Water, 5 litre Box</a><br /><br />2.  Water temperature.  It's really important to get the water temperature right because if the water is too hot the tea will get bitter and if it's not hot enough the flavor will be weak and less complex.  It's a matter of taste of course but most recommend about 185 degrees for White Tea.  A thermometer such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GE2XF8">RT600C Superfast Waterproof Pocket Thermometer by ThermoWorks</a> will make getting the right temperature a cinch.<br /><br />3.  Brew time.  How long you steep tea profoundly impacts the flavor.  If you brew it too long it will get bitter.  Again, it's all a matter of taste but most recommend 3-5 minutes for White Tea.<br /><br />4. Amount of tea used.  This too is totally a matter of taste, but I mention it only to point out that the robustness and strength of the tea has as much to do with how much you use as your brew method or how long you steep.  For example, say you wanted a stronger flavor.  You could always steep it longer, but you can also simply use more tea, which will yield a totally different end product.  Yeah, both ways will make the tea taste "stronger" but in a completely different way.<br /><br />5.  Brew method.  Of all the issues involved this seems the most confusing.  There are many ways to effectively brew tea.  You may wish to do a little research to find which way works best for you.  But I would offer a few methods that have worked very well for me.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LM0S">Bodum Chambord Coffee Press</a> has become my favorite method of brewing because of ease, simplicity, and efficiency.  Simply throw some tea in the empty press container, boil your water on the stove preferably in a glass stove-top safe vessel such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5X826">Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I7FCMO">GROSCHE GLASGOW Glass Teapot and Kettle with Infuser - Stovetop Safe , 1000 ml 34 Fl Oz capacity</a>, let it cool slightly to the correct temperature, pour over the tea in the press, cover with the press top, let it steep the desired amount of time, press and pour.  Wha-la! Great cup of tea.  If you're on the go I would definitely recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1CV">Thermos Nissan 12-Ounce Stainless-Steel Tea Tumbler with Infuser</a>. This thing is bullet proof, very high quality, will keep your tea smoking hot for hours, and will never spill or leak.  You can also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G8XORG">Adagio Teas Paper Filters</a>. Although not ideal it's certainly better than missing your tea!<br /><br />And just in case you don't know you can brew high quality loose leaf tea multiple times which contributes a lot to this Tea's price-value ratio.  Expect about 50 cups of tea (depending on how strong you like to brew your tea) per container.  Multiply by two and you can see where the price is more than reasonable (about 20 cents/cup).  Plus, it's organic which is always a huge plus.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I'm very surprised at how much I've come to enjoy drinking tea.  It may in part have something to do with the ritual aspect of it, the fact that it's so good for you, or maybe the excuse it gives you in the middle of a busy day to slow down for a second, breathe, and think.  However, I'm convinced tea has real and perceivable benefits beyond just psychology.  My diet tends toward the healthy side, I exercise regularly, and am very aware from day to day what my body and mind feel like, and since I started drinking tea regularly (about 2-4 cups a day) I've noticed a difference in overall energy and alertness. I have more focus ability and I don't get drowsy or "dull" in the middle of the afternoon.  It's subtle but sustained and obvious, and the "boost" (for lack of a better term) that tea gives me doesn't feel like caffeine, energy drink, or other "induced" or "artificial" energy but rather a nice below-the-surface sort of "I feel good" sort of thing, similar to the way you feel after a good night's sleep.<br /><br />It's extremely healthy, tastes great, and may even give you a few moments of peace in your day.  I can't think of a higher compliment to give any food or drink.
