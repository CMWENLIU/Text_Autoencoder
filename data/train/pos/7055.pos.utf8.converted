Great Espresso Pod.  I use it with my Breville 800.  Good flavor, and its quick and easy to dispose.  At first I was running into problems with the pod but followed anothers advice and now it works great.  You need to wet the pod filter first, then put the pod in and tamp it down.  The moisture on the filter helps hold the pod down.  Other than that it works great.  Buy with subscribtion and save...
