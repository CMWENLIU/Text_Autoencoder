I was extremely happy to chance upon these in a health food store shortly before I was going camping. Like many of the other reviewers before me, I haven't had marshmallows in a long time because of my commitment to vegetarianism. These marshmallows can toast in the fire just like gelatin marshmallows do! Personally, I think they taste better because I always found gelatin marshmallows a little chalky. These seem less prone to becoming stale--I stored mine for a month after opening them, and they always tasted fine. You do pay more for these marshmallows, but the $11.99 I see on Amazon right now is even steeper than the price I paid. They were $4 or $5 at the health food store.
