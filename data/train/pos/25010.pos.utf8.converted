I use a lot of this stuff for bread baking & was buying it at the market, where it was about $5.70 for a 12-ounce canister or something like 47 cents an ounce. What an incredible deal I got from Amazon! Total of 48 ounces for 26 cents an ounce. One of those screaming deals you can't say enough good things about.
