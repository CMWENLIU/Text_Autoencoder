Someone has produced bottled lime and lemon juice that taste like fresh juice! These juices are truly delicious, with none of that skunky quality of the junk you see everywhere, and can be used in baking, sauces, on fish, etc. Throw out those plastic squeeze fruits and get yourself one of these in each flavor. Keeps about a year after opening. Would make a great stocking stuffer--hopefully I'll remember that next year!
