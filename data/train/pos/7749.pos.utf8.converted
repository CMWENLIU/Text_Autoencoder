This hot cereal is great. I've been eating it for years. Bob's Red Mill is the only vendor that I know of. They are local, but I'm glad they have it on Amazon now so I don't have to make the 1 1/2 hour round trip. It has an almost nutty taste. It is high in protein and fiber, and is fantastic with dates and milk.
