I would say that these are just as good, if not better, than Teddy Grahams. Even better, they are trans-fat free (Teddy Grahams are not). I'd highly recommend these delicious snack cookies!!<br /><br />FYI: my local Target carries them for 1.99 a box (on sale) or ~2.39 regular priced...that's cheaper than what Amazon has here (currently 19 something dollars for 6 boxes). Check your local stores to see what their prices are first!
