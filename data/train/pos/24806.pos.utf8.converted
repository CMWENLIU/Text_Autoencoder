This is a tea based on rooibos (red bush), a plant native to South Africa. The leaves are like little needles, rather like cedar shavings, and the flavor is naturally sweet and a bit aromatic, like vanilla or nuts but not exactly.<br /><br />The tea is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants and when adding the dried blueberries, the aroma is absolutely delightful and the taste is naturally sweet and appealing. There is not even a hint of bitterness. Rooibos lends itself to a lot of flavor additives such as vanilla, chocolate, fruit, rum and spice but blueberry has to be my favorite way to enjoy it. If you are looking to cut down on caffeine and want a good hot beverage, try this one.
