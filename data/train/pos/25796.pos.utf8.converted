This sauce is so good! I too grew up with it in New Hampshire.  I just wanted to share that I LOVE it with mashed potatoes.  In fact, I won't eat them without it.  "Bull dog" sauce also tastes really good with chicken.  I don't know how to describe the flavor, and I can't seem to find anyone else that likes it. I however, really recommend this sauce :)
