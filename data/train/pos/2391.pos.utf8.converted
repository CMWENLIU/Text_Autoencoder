The biggest impediments to me buying this product for the first time were the price and whether my cat would actually eat it.  I have a 3 year old Siamese cat who has been eating Orijen (15.4 lbs @ $[...]) for over a year now, previously she had been on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DFU8">Pro Plan Indoor Care Turkey and Rice Formula Dry Cat Food</a> (7 lbs @ $23.59) which I always considered to be a "premium" cat food until I began doing some research.  As you can see, Orijen ($3.44/lb) is slightly more expensive than Purina Pro Plan ($3.37/lb).  The big difference in price, however, comes from the ingredients.  Orijen is lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein which has resulted in my cat eating approximately 1/3 less food than she had been before.  I love that her new diet is better for her health, but also easier on my pocket.<br /><br />My concerns about whether she would like the new "health food" were completely unfounded.  Of course, when I first began mixing Orijen with her old food she would eat around the new food and save it for last, but that stopped after about the fourth bowl.  She has always been picky about the treats she will eat, but recently I've been experimenting with grain-free treats and she has been taking to them without hesitation.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who is shopping for foods to compare the ingredient labels.  I was shocked to find that Purina's Pro Plan looks more like something that would be concocted by a chemistry lab than a food producer.  For example, Purina Pro Plan contains ONLY Vitamin E, A, B-12, and D-3 supplements instead of the actual sweet potatoes, kelp, pumpkin, carrots, spinach, turnip greens, apples, and cranberries found along with the supplements in Orijen.<br /><br />Finally, the last big difference that I have noticed in my cat is the number of hairballs.  When she was on Purina's Pro Plan Indoor Care, my cat would spit up at least once a month if not every couple of weeks.  Now she spits up approximately 3 or 4 times a year and only when I leave for a decent length of time, such as during the holidays or a vacation.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be any happier with this cat food and I can't recommend it highly enough.
