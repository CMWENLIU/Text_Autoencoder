Tazo Chai tea in the filter bag has an aroma and taste I love.  I also drink Stash Chai, but I prefer Tazo Chai because it adds a small and pleasant bite.  That may be because its spices include pepper and anise.  I fix it every morning, 14 oz. at a time, using one or two tea bags (depending on how sparky I feel at the time).  I add two bags of Splenda and two ounces of skim milk.  The result is 16 oz. of pure, low-calorie pleasure.
