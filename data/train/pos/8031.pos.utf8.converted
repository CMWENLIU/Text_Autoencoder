This is hands down the best dog food we have ever found.  I have 2 Boston Terriers who, putting it mildly, have issues.  One throws up when given anything out of the ordinary, the other has skin problems and allergies.  Normally we find a dry food that may work for one and not the other.  At the end of the firt bag of Nutrisca, both dogs were remarkably improved.  There were no digestive issues, both had stopped the constant need for scratching, both had regrown the missing fur in hot spot areas, both were energetic, happy, and healthy.<br />There was a time when we were unable to find Nutrisca and so tried other foods that came very highly recommended by our local hippie doggie boutique, but where one dog might do well, the other suffered (not to mention the huge price difference).
