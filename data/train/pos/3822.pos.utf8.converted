At first I didn't care for this because I tried to just add the scoop to a little water and gulp it down. This does not work as it is too gritty. However, now I mix it into a morning smoothie and I love it. It gives me noticeable energy and I just feel better on the days I have it. FYI, here is my smoothie recipe that I think tastes great:<br /><br />4 oz water<br />1 scoop Amazing Grass<br />1/2 cup frozen organic berries<br />1 Tbs flaxseeds<br />1 Tbs organic coconut oil<br />2 cups fresh organic spinach<br />4 oz organic juice (POM, acai, etc)<br /><br />I listed the ingredients in exactly the order I put them into my blender to get it to blend properly.
