*****<br />This Izze Pomegranate Sparkling Juice isn't a soda and isn't a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It comes in a small can (8.4 oz) that I enjoy in a wine glass (it's about the amount of liquid in a very large glass of wine).<br /><br />Some pomegranate juices are sour, but this one is tasty and sweeter than most...actually it tastes like real pomegranate pieces (arils) do---perfect! It is a sparkling juice, and sweetened just with real fruit. Technically, pomegranates are considered a "superfood", so this is a healthy way of improving your diet via beverage choice. It's also fortified with vitamins C and B6 and niacin as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
