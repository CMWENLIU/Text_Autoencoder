These are simply the best instant mashed potatoes I have ever had. What's even better is that there are only 3 ingredients..potatoes and little bit of butter and salt. If you look at other brands you'll see an ingredient list list of 10-20 different things..including preservatives. I have been buying them at Costco for the last year now all of a sudden they are gone. I would think this prodict would be hugely popular..they are really that good.
