I have used just about every type of sprouter over the years, but the sprout master is the one for me.  It makes perfect sprouts every time.  Drainage and air circulation is excellent.  The level of difficulty is: EASY.  They work well when stacked.  I like my sprouts growing vertically I have learned.  I prefer greening them up before eating, so this makes the perfect design.  Plus the sprouts look absolutely gorgeous in the sproutmaster, unlike Easy Sprout, or jar sprouting where they are all bunched together.  Make sure you sterilize the tray with vinegar and water soaks before sprouting new sprouts. If you do that, you should have no problems with mold.
