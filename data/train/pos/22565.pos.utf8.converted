This is the most magical beef jerky I ever ate. It came in many a paper like sheet, and everyone at work loved it.  Right after eating aforementioned jerky, I turned into a cow, and spent the rest of the day having a crazy adventure, during witch I stopped a swarm of evil grass from taking over the world.  It began when I over herd a rouge blade of grass discussing it with a clover, who he had been shagging.  I followed him, and finding their hide out, located under the upside down kiddy pool in my yard, I devoured the lot of them.  After saving the world, I turned back into a human, and had another piece.  It did not happen again, but it must be like Narnia, and when the world needs the cool cow again, I will be ready, watching, and waiting.  Oh, and ordering more of this jerky.<br />Review guidelines:<br />Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action?
