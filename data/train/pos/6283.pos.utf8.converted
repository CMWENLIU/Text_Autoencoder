For a start, I am a raging coffee addict, so there will be no surprises in this review. Kopiko coffee candy is simply a divine combination of a coffee lover's relationship with the world's greatest drink and sugar.<br /><br />The candy is reasonably sweet, though not to the degree that one misses the coffee taste, as in some coffee candies. These have the taste of a reasonably strong, but sweet, cup of coffee. They are perfect if you like sweets and like coffee.<br /><br />There is only one disadvantage: packaging. With each candy in its individudal little bag, the efficiency of having a serious binge session with them is limited to some degree. The time taken to get into the said bags reduces the number you can suck on, chew, crunch up or swallow whole in a set amount of time. Swallowing whole is not recommended.<br /><br />These would have to be the perfect companion to a good book. They taste great!
