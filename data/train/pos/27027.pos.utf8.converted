This is the tastiest, freshest-tasting canned crab I've ever had. It is every bit as good as the much more expensive frozen crab that I've bought at specialty grocery stores, and more convenient to store and use. I make simple crab cakes with one can, one egg, a little mayonnaise and some panko bread crumbs, browned in butter, that is the quickest and most luxurious meal for one imaginable. What a treat!<br /><br />I have also purchased the Miller's Jumbo Select crab meat, and it's great for recipes that require big lovely chunks of meat--but I have found that this shredded crab is every bit as tasty, and I actually prefer it for crab cakes, as it holds together better. It's also great for dips and other recipes that have crab meat stirred in.
