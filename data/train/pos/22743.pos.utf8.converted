You can tell by the color that this teriyaki sauce is a little different from what you're used to in the teriyaki sauces that have gluten. However, in this case Different Is Better! I have used this sauce in recipes that call for teriyaki, always great in every recipe. The surprise is, this sauce can be used as a stand-alone -- by itself, without any other ingredients, it makes a great marinade. Granted, it's a little thicker than traditional teriyaki sauces, so if you need it thinner you might want to add a little water. But this stuff really ROCKS. My very picky hubby who does not have to avoid gluten and typically turns his nose up at gluten-free stuff actually prefers this teriyaki sauce over all others.
