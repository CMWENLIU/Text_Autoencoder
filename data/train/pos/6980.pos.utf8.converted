These are very delicious yummy jelly cakes. I remember enjoying them as a child. My korean mother would give us kids something really similar and they bring back really good memories. They might be a little strange to someone who isn't used to the consistancy, but its worth trying. They're all pretty sweet and nice to nibble one. I usually just have half of a bar at a time, unless I'm hungry
