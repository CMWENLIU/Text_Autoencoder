Ordering live grains (or anything else "live") online was a new experience.  I only hoped they would grow and produce a fine product; some of the reviews made me wonder.  Now that I've been using them for several weeks I am so pleased.  Since our milk kefir grew prodigiously I expected the same from the water grains.  When they didn't, I contacted the seller who personally answered questions, gave very detailed instructions, wanted feedback, and was very helpful.  For instance, the water kefir wants warmth -- a heating pad on the lowest setting works perfectly -- do not let the water get cold and I had done that. The process may take several days, longer than I thought -- using the taste test(often 5-6 days for our liking)works every time!  At this point I am able to keep two jars going; patience has been rewarded. Adding fruit, as apricots or strawberries, during or after gives a delicate and delicious flavor. The grains thrive and multiply, giving us a healthy and tasty beverage that also makes great smoothies.  Our thanks!  Kudos to the seller for excellent service and delivering a fine product.
