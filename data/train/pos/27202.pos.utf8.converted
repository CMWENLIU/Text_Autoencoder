THERE IS ONE OTHER CEREAL ON THE MARKET THAT IS VERY SIMILAR IN<br /><br />CRUNCHY...TASTEFUL CEREAL!! I HAD BOTH IN MY PANTRY AND TRIED EACH INDEPENDENTLY AND THEN, TOGETHER. THIS THE ONE CEREAL THAT IS GOOD ON ANY OUTING FOR BREAKFAST WITH MILK, CAN OF CREAM OR<br /><br />JUST PLAIN WATER ON A CAMPING OUTING. OUTFIT YOUR BACKPACK WITH<br /><br />HEALTHY GOODIES. NO SPOILAGE EITHER. I WAS HIKING FOR FOUR DAYS WITH KASHI, DRIED FRUIT, SEVERAL CANS OF JUICES.  IT IS JUST THE BEST APPROACH FOR HIKING WITH THE MINNIMUM LAGER ON BOARD!
