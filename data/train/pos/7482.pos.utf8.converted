I prefer shelled & unsalted pistachios, which are harder to find than salted, unshelled pistachios. These are as good as they get, though salt-lovers might should try unsalted pistachios before they actually make a purchase (5 lbs. will last quite a while even if you like them as much as I do). This is no-frills packaging, which is probably why the price per pound is less than store-bought pistachios. The entire 5 lbs. comes double-bagged (in 2 sturdy clear plastic bags cushioned with packing material) inside a plain cardboard shipping box... no fancy packaging, just very good shelled unsalted pistachios (exactly what I ordered).
