Recently, after speaking with the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, I inquired about their outrageously HOT mustard served only upon request.  I was curious to find out if and where I could purchase this condiment to enjoy at home.  The owner explained that the mustard was prepared daily from a powder simply mixed with water to the desired consistency.  Having been repeatedly disappointed with the mainstream bottled grocery varieties labelled as "hot", a little online research certainly paid off! This ISN'T that lame packet mustard you commonly find in the bottom of your take out bag.  S&B oriental mustard ROCKS!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Nice 3oz quantity for personal home use for dipping, sauces, etc. [A little will go a very long way]<br />* Sturdy and airtight canister for storage<br />* "Scald Your Sinuses Hot" [Assuming you enjoy this trait--sure hope you do]<br />* Flexibility to freshly prepare only the amount needed at a given time--prepared mustard will lose potency/heat if stored over time.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Powder should be handled with care--seriously potent and cannot imagine getting powder directly into eyes, cuts, etc. Children and novices beware!<br /><br />Would certainly recommend to any and all of those folks [you know who you are] like myself who derive pleasure from a truly HOT mustard for dipping, egg rolls, spicy Chex mix, and other creative recipe ideas. CANNOT BEAT IT! :)
