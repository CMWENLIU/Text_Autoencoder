I was shocked and saddened to see the two negative reviews posted below for Natural Value here on Amazon - but then I actually read the "reviews".<br /><br />To "Mamakitty" - most ALL meat/seafood used in pet food comes from Asia; and seafood products in particular typically come from Thailand. Even certain other high-end pet foods source their seafood from Thailand. Most of the seafood (fish/squid in particular) YOU buy for your own consumption at the grocery store is usually from Thailand!! Your concerns stem from product coming from China (which is not "Asia" or "Thailand" FYI). Natural Value has high standards of processing/manufacturing as listed on their website and they stand behind it. I trust them 100%.<br /><br />To "happyhalloween" - well yes, it is unfortunate to pay that much for shipping - but what exactly does the shipping cost from Amazon have to do with the product itself?? Nothing. Perhaps next time you would be better suited to actually base your rating on the quality of the food instead of leaving a one-star review that has nothing to do with the product in question.<br /><br />Now - onto my review - I have been buying Natural Value tuna n' toppings for my cats for about five years now. This is a very healthy and affordable cat food! Even after all this time - my cats still gulp it down no questions asked - they actually prefer this over anything. I have bought just about every type of  high-end cat food out there. My cats love this food above all of them.<br /><br />The ingredients are self-explanatory - it's free of rice, grains, "meals", and all those other fillers put in just about every other big name cat food.<br /><br />When you open the can - it looks just like what it is supposed to be - tuna meat with an additional "topping". The can is filled to the brim with chunks of red meat tuna with no watery liquids (the jelly used to hold the meat together is very effective). It's solid meat, solid food and its definitely affordable for all consumers.<br /><br />You know you are buying the right food for your cats when you are the only one you know who doesn't have a "fat" cat. All of my felines have maintained a healthy weight and a soft, shiny coat while eating this food. I also never find myself complaining about finicky eaters when I have a supply of Natural Value in my kitchen.<br /><br />Do yourself and your cat a favor and try this food instead of the grocery store junk. Natural Value has a great balance of nutritional additives and a good supply of taurine (a very important part of a cats diet). I cannot recommend this food enough! I am very thankful I discovered it in my local corner store (of all places) way back when.<br /><br />Also - the price here on Amazon is fantastic - I just picked up two cases with free shipping (50 cans) for under $30.00!
