I'm so glad to have found this product on Amazon. I have been using flax seed for 12 years. I was grinding my own in a coffee grinder.  Then I found Spectrum Cold Milled Organic Ground Premium Flaxseed.  I sprinkle a tablespoon full on my morning oatmeal every day. When I make smoothies, I add a tablespoon or two to my blender.  My husband has recently started adding flaxseed to his oatmeal because he takes pain meds which are constipating. Flaxseeds help with constipation as they provide an excellent source of fiber.  Flaxseeds can be added to many foods. They have a very slight nutty flavor if you taste it out of the bag. Personally, I cannot taste them at all when I add them to food. I love the convenience of having my flaxseeds ready to add to my food without having to drag out the grinder and clean it afterward.  I keep my flaxseed in the freezer and use it directly from there. Omega3 oils are prone to becoming rancid and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer once opened. I love the fact that these flaxseeds are organic. I also love that these flaxseeds are cold milled, which means they are not exposed to heat which would promote rancidity and destroy the nutritive value. I have read grinding your own flaxseeds subject the seeds to more heat than seeds which are commercially cold milled.I should add that my HDL cholesterol is double the norm. HDL is the good cholesterol. Most people average 40. My HDL is 86. Flaxseeds are the highest vegetarian source of Omega3 essential fatty acids and are attributed to many health benefits including heart health, diabetes, cancer, inflammation, pms, menopause and constipation. Amazon is offering this product at an excellent price. It is a staple in my house and I plan to order this on a regular basis.
