I had this ice cream once. It was the best ice cream I had ever had in my life. Its so smooth and creamy. Everyone I made it for enjoyed it a lot. I can't believe they don't sell this in more stores. I would really enjoy purchasing many of these, but it seems amazon has  made a mistake in the shipping weight. This error will cause your shipping to be just as much if not more than the ice cream itself. I have tried calling and emailing with no response. They say the package of 12 boxes is 10lbs. Well, as you can see, each box is approximately 4oz each. About 1/4 of a pound. So 12 boxes would only be about 3lbs. Not 10lbs.Hopefully writing this review will get the problem solved. I would really love to purchase this ice cream soon.
