These are great and for a gluten-free snack that is not full of additives, corn, etc. this really helps keep those cravings to crunch and eat breads and chips away... I have been eating healthy for many years now though & could see how if you think you eat healthy, but still haven't cut out preservatives, sugars, corn, etc. you might not be ready for this healthier treat... although with soy still included I wouldn't consider it super healthy, but we're getting closer :)
