Despite what the picture shows, you do not get ground mustard powder, it is the seeds. Each pound comes in a foil bag that should last for years if stored in a cool place.<br /><br />I only opened one bag, but I didn't see any "extras" in the bag - just mustard seed. This is so much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. I was paying  $2.50 for 1.5 oz there. Here it's not even $4/lb.
