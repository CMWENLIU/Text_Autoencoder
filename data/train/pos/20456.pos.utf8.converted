This is not your typical cinnamon! It is incredibly flavorful and fresh. It has a lovely hint of spice, with a depth of flavor and aroma that is very different to the cinnamon found in the grocery store. I was very surprised at how very delicious it is! I am using it on all sorts of food,(which I had never done before) from coffee to applesauce and beyond, yummy!<br />  The shipment arrived well packaged, and in a timely fashion. I am extremely pleased!
