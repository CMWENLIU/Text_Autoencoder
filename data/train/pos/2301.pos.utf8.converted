That's the best way to describe it.  You pop it in your mouth, and the sensation is similar to chewing on beef jerky, only much better.  The flavor starts to come through very quickly - creamy and aromatic.<br /><br />It's certainly the easiest way to get the full mango flavor experience without the mess.  The quality is consistent - you don't get the odd funny-tasting piece like you do with other dried fruits.<br /><br />This is a terrific snack.  The chewiness makes each bite last, and the flavor just keeps coming.  You can easily make a single serving size last 5 minutes, and there aren't many snack foods that can match that!
