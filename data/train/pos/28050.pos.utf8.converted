This is great.  I brought it to the office for sugar.  People are intrigued by the shape and the taste is a little different than refined white sugar. I like putting it in iced tea.  It does not disolve instantly and so I get little sweet crystals floating around as I drink.  Works great for a party at the coffee and tea service area.
