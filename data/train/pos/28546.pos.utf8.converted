So happy I can get these on Amazon as sometimes they are hard to find in my neighborhood.  Even though they are not "all butter" I love them even more than Walker's stem ginger shortbread which is also delicious.  They have a chewy texture and are studded with luscious chewy bits of ginger - they are great with tea or coffee.  I usually don't like "bought" cookies but these are an exception.
