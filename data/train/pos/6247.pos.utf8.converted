Who could ever imagine being transported back to a Halloween long ago when the hit of the neighborhood was the lady in the green house who always gave out caramel popcorn balls?!?  When I opened my box, I was greeted by the delicious odor of these old-fashioned treats.  I dove right in  and WOW!!!! you got the recipe exactly right!  I've tried to limit myself to 2 a day so I can stretch the box out...a difficult proposition when each sweet and crunchy bite takes me back to childhood. I recommend these highly - just save some for me!
