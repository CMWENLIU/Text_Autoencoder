The product in the packaging is excellent to be sure but I find the squeeze bottle packaging to be vastly superior to the cans in which sweetened condensed milk is usually sold. Once they're empty, I use them to hold my home-made dark chocolate syrup. Win, win as far as I'm concerned.<br />The only drawback to the packaging is that one can't cook it into dulche de leche but since that's available in cans from Amazon (saving one the trouble of cooking it), I don't think it's any problem at all.
