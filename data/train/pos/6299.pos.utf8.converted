Having learned much about cat nutrition from my previous job, when I was finally able to own cats - there was no question about what I would feed them. Cats are designed to be carnivores - unlike dogs which are omnivores. Cats do not need (nor should they be fed) grains. Not only does this food contain no grains, it also contains no by-products, and is full of great de-boned meats, fish, and natural flavor. It also contains micro-organisms to aid in digestion. Many cat foods now claim to have pre and or pro-biotics, but they are baked in with the kibble (essentially killing the organisms), Wellness sprays it on after the baking process meaning your cat gets the benefits! Both of my cats love this food, and are always very excited when it's meal time.<br /><br />As a side note: I also like that this comes packaged in a re-sealable (zip-lock) bag for maintaining freshness.
