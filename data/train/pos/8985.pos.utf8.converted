I recently went gluten free and I tried another brownie mix that cost $7 or $8 and wasn't impressed. I learned about the new Betty Crocker mixes right at the beginning of June before they were available, and kept checking in the grocery stores around here to see if they had them. I found them at Price Chopper last Friday and made them today, and the batter tastes like regular batter, even though it's a lot thicker. Once I baked them, the whole house smelled like chocolate, which didn't happen with the other mix. They taste SO good. They're really chocolatey, and a little bit chewy and are just like regular brownies. The Amazon price is a deal - I paid $4.49 at the store, and I would pay that much again, but with the Amazon price SO much lower... I'd rather buy them here. DEFINITELY worth the money.
