Purchased this pasta online after seeing it in a gift shop at a winery in Napa.  I was throwing a wedding shower for friend's of mine and knew this would be the perfect pasta since the bride's colors were black, white, and red.  I cooked the pasta according to the directions on the package and it turned out fantastic!  All of my guests were impressed (with the taste and look of the pasta) and a homemade red sauce made the dish perfect!!  Amazon was the only place I could find this type of pasta - thank you Amazon.com!!!
