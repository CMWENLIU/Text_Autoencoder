My 12 year old cat had seemingly developed some stomach issues and was vomiting nearly every day.  I suspected they were from an intolerance to dyes and other unnecessary stuff they put in mass market cat foods.  Since she's been on this,she hasn't gotten sick once!  Hallelujah! If your cat has a sensitive belly, try this!  Also, I will say that she really likes this food...I did try a few others along the way (Blue Buffalo, By Nature) but she didn't  love them.  This food smells fresh and is very very tiny...little balls smaller than a pea.  It's easy for her to eat and digest.
