I decided to grind my own flour because in our two person household, the bags of flour go stale before I can use it all.  I also store grain now for long term storage because the economy in our area has declined, as a hedge against inflation and unemployment.  I was very impressed with Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Wheat and Soft White Wheat berries.  I called the customer service number before purchasing the grain to ask about issues related to long term storage - when the grain was harvested and how long it had been in storage - so that I could put proper dating for use on it when it arrived.  All the grain was the new crop grain, having been harvested August, 2011.  I had also ordered rye berries, and was concerned how long rye could be stored, using "superpails" with mylar bags/oxygenators/dessicants.  They answered all my questions thoroughly.  They even told me the best days to place my order so that I would have the best selection and price on Amazon!  I was very impressed with their customer service department.  I also had concerns that the grain be clean and free of bad kernels or any mold, mildew, or extraneous matter, as my husband was on the heart transplant list and after transplant suppressed immune response is an issue.  The rye and wheat was absolutely beautiful.  I saw no broken or bad grains at all, no chaff or foreign matter, and the products were essentially dust free.  All in all, I was very happy with the rye and wheat I purchased. Great River Organic Milling normally has free super saver shipping for their products on Amazon. Shipping was easy to track and extremely fast:  I ordered my grain on a Friday evening around 7PM, and by Saturday 4PM the next day I had my grain, even though I had been told it may take 5-7 days to get the shipment.  Great job!  I will be ordering more!
