Very few convenience or grocery stores seem to sell these anymore.  Think "peanut bar" with a sugar-corn syrup binder and a touch of milk and butter in the glace.  A low glycemic snack, if that matters. All natural ingredients.  If you had them as a child, get reaquainted with the Munch Bar.  If you like peanuts and have't tried them, give them a shot.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
