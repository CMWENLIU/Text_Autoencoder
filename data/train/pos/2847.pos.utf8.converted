This was the first time I've purchased a product from Lana's Little House, and I will definitely be a regular customer in the future. I was searching for a good jasmine tea, but when I read the reviews for Paris I couldn't resist adding a tin to my shopping cart.  It has quickly become my "go-to" tea.  The flavor is smooth and lovely--I'm typically more a fan of green tea, but this black tea has become a favorite.  A perfect winter day is coming in from the slopes to enjoy an evening with a pot of Paris (just a touch of honey and lemon!), a good book, and my husband napping on the couch with the cat curled up on his chest.  The bonus is that the shop owner, Lana, provides excellent service.  I received my package in the mail very quickly, she included a sweet little handwritten note and free sample in the package, and when I had a question for her she answered promptly. Additionally, her prices are very competitive for a good tea.  Not only can you feel good about purchasing a high quality product, but you can feel great about supporting an excellent small business!
