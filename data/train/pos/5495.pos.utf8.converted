I had my 6 yr old son's birthday party at the movie theater watching Mr. Popper's Penguins and gave these in the goodie bags the kids got to bring home. The hardest part was not eating them all myself. I was a little skeptical with a peach flavor, but they were wonderful! The gummies were very soft when they arrived and stayed that way; they didn't dry out or harden.
