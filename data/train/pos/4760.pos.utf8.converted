I have used Solo Almond Paste many times in the past.  We move frequently, sometimes living in large cities, sometimes small towns.  I can usually find it on the shelf in large cities.  However, this Christmastime, we find ourselves in a small town and I could not find the almond paste anywhere.  I was grateful to find it on Amazon...and at a very good price.  I have paid nearly twice the price from some specialty stores in the past.  My one complaint about the cans of paste I ordered:  the contents were a little dry.  There are no dates on the cans, so the product may not have been as fresh as others I've purchased in the past. However, my cakes still came out perfectly, so the dryness did not affect the final product.  I will definitely look to Amazon again for the almond paste. Great value!
