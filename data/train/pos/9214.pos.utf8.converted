You are probably asking, "Why would you review Diet Coke?"  It's a damn soda. It costs almost nothing! We've all had it and are probably already addicted and strung out to D.C.  Well, the truth is that I am a true Coke connoisseur.  I have spent many hours discussing a good coca-cola versus a crap coca-cola. This is a drink that can draw out the flavors of a good meal, just like a fine bottle of wine or cold glass of milk.<br /><br />Originally I only drank regular Coke. But there is no need to have all that high fructose corn syrup. It will ultimately lead to your demise.  So make the switch to Diet Coke. You may need to do some 50/50 blends for a while, but in a couple of weeks you won't go back to regular Coke (it tastes way too sugary now).  In general, any soda from a can actually can taste pretty bad due to changes in carbonation, flavor of the can, etc.  But a soda from a bottle (glass or plastic) is the best.  You know the batch is good when there is a major burn in your mouth after a big gulp.  Pepsi won't do this the same, the pH is different and it has a different sugar content.  Diet Coke has the perfect burn.  Fountain soda almost universally sucks, so don't even go there.<br /><br />I recommend that D.C. accompany any rich, flavorful meal.  It may overpower meals that have subtle flavors (for example, some French cuisine is quite subtle in flavor to me, and D.C. may wash it away).  You already know D.C. will enhance the flavors of beef, fried food, pizza, potato chips (and most other snacks), most sandwiches, Italian foods of almost any variety, and greasy chili cheese dogs.<br /><br />So go buy a 2 liter, chill (4 degrees celsius at the lowest, preferably a degree or two warmer), go work off all that high fructose corn syrup you ate earlier in the day, and then getcha pull of D.C.<br /><br />If you don't like my review, you must be a Pepsi fan.  So be it.  Your teeth will rot sooner, it's got a lower pH.
