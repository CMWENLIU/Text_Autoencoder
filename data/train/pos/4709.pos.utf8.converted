I was worried about ordering these online. I thought they might arrive in a melted mess due to sitting in a warehouse and arriving via the Brown Truck. Boy was I wrong! They were just like the ones you buy pre-made at the store. The kids love them and I must admit, I did too! I will definitely order them from Amazon again.
