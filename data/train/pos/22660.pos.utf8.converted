This is the only brand of boxed macaroni and cheese that I will serve to my five year old and this is the only one she will eat. First of all, the ingredient list speaks for itself. It's made from only a small handful of all natural ingredients (none of those obscure, unpronounceable ingredients!) and you can feel good about giving it to your children (and to yourself as well!). Not only is it a much healthier choice than most other boxed mac and cheese dinners, but it tastes great, too! Perfectly cheesy and delicious. Our little girl just loves it and so do we! It's not too difficult to prepare either and it's one of those last minute, throw-togethers on busy days that you can count on. Stock your pantry shelf with Annie's..you won't be sorry.
