"A perfect finishing touch for your, tacos, Mexican salads, and sandwich wraps." - from the label<br /><br />The Food Police will undoubtedly squeal when confronted by Taco Bell's "Home Originals" BOLD & CREAMY CHIPOTLE SAUCE. Is the home not sacred? Do the fast-food purveyors of unhealthy meals have to invade Man's last refuge? That provocation in itself makes the condiment endearing to me in addition to the fact that it's a striking radioactive-orange color (especially after being dispensed from the plastic squeeze bottle that will probably persist in a landfill until the Sun goes supernova - another endearing goad of the politically correct).<br /><br />For the chipotle experience, I've heretofore relied on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037505AK">Kraft Sandwich Shop Mayo Chipotle, 12-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>). Compared to this, the Taco Bell offering has a bit more intense smoky chipotle bite to it, and there's an undertone of cheese to the flavor perhaps imparted by the dried buttermilk in the ingredients. In any case, I've so far tried this sauce on chicken, beef, cheese sandwiches, eggs, and tater tots and licked drips off my fingers. To the extent used, I prefer it to the Kraft product and would preferentially buy it.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this product contains (per 2 Tbsp serving) 110 calories, 11g total fat, 1.5g saturated fat, and 300mg sodium - all of which means that my health and nutrition-conscious wife will likely leave it all for me; I won't have to share.
