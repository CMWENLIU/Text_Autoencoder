I bought the 2.2 lb bag for a quoted price of 6.83.  I thought the shipping was free, but turns out the shipping was $7.70.  The shipping was more than the food.  I would have never purchased the food had I known the shipping was not free.  I contacted the distributor and they said they could do nothing.  Beware and don't get ripped off like I was.
