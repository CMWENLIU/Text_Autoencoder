I was alarmed when I suddenly became unable to find this product in any local grocery store. I visited Amazon and was relieved to find it available here, but was troubled by the multiple reviews complaining that the packaging was poor and that the jars arrived broken. So I wrote to Amazon Customer Service to inquire about the situation. I received a prompt, courteous reply saying that the packaging problem had been corrected and that I could order with confidence. So I did. The six jars arrived the other day, IMPECCABLY packaged--each jar individually wrapped in bubble wrap, the six jars carefully packed in a box with additional cushioning, that box packed in a second box with cushioning. All six jars were in perfect condition.<br /><br />As for the product, I have relied on Nestea Unsweetened 100% Instant for years. It is the only instant iced tea I have ever been able to find that is absolutely pure, without any sweeteners, flavorings, or additives. That may not be everyone's cup of tea (so to speak), but if you like your iced tea straight, or if you prefer to add your own sweetener or lemon, this is the product to buy. (BTW, when I'm feeling like a bit of sweetness and tartness in my iced tea, I add a spoonful of all-natural frozen limeade concentrate. It's terrific.)
