When you think of what you could spend on junk for snacks at work, this is really quite a bargain. My own "research" tells me that soup helps cut the munchies. Bring a couple of them to work, and you just might be able to stay out of the cookie jar or vending machine.<br /><br />Of course it's not the same as home-made, but as a close second, Healthy Choice has the added benefit of great packaging that allows you to stockpile for those days when you've forgotten to bring other food and can't get out to pick something up.<br /><br />Healthy Choice soup is definitely worth trying.
