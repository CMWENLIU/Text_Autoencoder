This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.<br /><br />I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months.
