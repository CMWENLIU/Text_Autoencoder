This formula has done wonders for our two month old daughter.  I breastfeed her, but supplement with formula.  We started out with Similac, but she would fight the bottle and she would get really gassy.  We switched her over to Good Start and what a difference.  She gobbles it down with no problems.  I just wish I switched sooner so that she wouldn't have to deal with the gas every night.
