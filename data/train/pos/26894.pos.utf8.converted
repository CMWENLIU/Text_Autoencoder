It's too bad Mr Somma has little appreciation for Marmite and a naive, propaganda-inspired understanding of history.  Marmite is an acquired taste and has to be used properly (sparingly).  Used with a light hand, it is a savory delight, working equally well in soups or on bread and toast.  It will be an absolute disaster if one tries to use it like peanut butter or jam.  One only needs a little of the best things in life!
