I purchased the SF Bay "OneCup" without paying much attention to the use of the phrase "...for Keurig K-Cup Brewers," so I was surprised upon opening the first box of SF Bay OneCups. I didn't connect with the carefully chosen description which never called the product "K-Cups".  They probably would have liked to call them K-Pods, if it weren't for potential trademark issues.  Another reviewer remarked that they are a cross between K-Cups and pods.  I echo that.<br /><br />The pod units fit perfectly in our Cuisinart K-Cup, and are dimensionally similar, with the top being pretty much a K-Cup twin, and the pod material provides the filtration.  No post-brew drip issues either.  Since they aren't hermetically sealed, you will find a zip lock bag or other airtight container handy.  I'm guessing that the pod material is more biodegradable than a real K-Cup, and probably worth the trade-off, requiring more care to preserve freshness.<br /><br />If you are looking for a medium bold blend, try the SF Bay Rainforest Blend. Funky pod brews a nice 8 oz. cup.  I will be ordering again.
