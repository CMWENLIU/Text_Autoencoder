I ordered & received exactly what I wanted, which was the "ReaLemon" brand lemon juice packets.  To ensure you get the right one, you need to order from the correct seller/vendor.  That seller is "Great Gifts For You To Give".<br /><br />I mention this because some reviews indicate people received a different brand/product then expected.  I think this happens because people simply click "add to cart" when ordering the product. Instead of doing that, look for & click on the link that shows other sellers.  This will read something like "2 new from $8.49".  There you will find the seller mentioned above.  The overall cost is a few dollars more, but if you want the "ReaLemon" brand, I recommend ordering from that vendor.<br /><br />Note: I did not try ordering from the Amazon default seller, so I do not know for sure what brand you will/would get if you order that way.  Hope this review helps.
