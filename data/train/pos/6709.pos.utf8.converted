I just recieved this coffee and I have brewed about 20 cups of coffee so far. I use a burr grinder and a very nice Starbucks drip coffee maker. In fact, I am enjoying a cup of the cofffe right now after dragging my lazy behind out of bed at 9am&lt;g>.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this roast. The beans arrived fresh and well packed with a valve on the heavy poly bag. The beans are of a uniform roast with a nice oily sheen throughout. There is no chaff mixed in with the beans. I do some home roasting of my own beans so I have an idea of what the process is and I can state confidently that these are well roasted, cleaned of chaff and that the roast is in fact a dark roast.<br /><br />The coffee tastes just as I like it, a full rich flavor without that acidic slightly burned flavor of a French roast. The taste is very smooth and rich, the main traits that attracted me to Starbucks coffee, craft roasters and eventually home roasting.<br /><br />I get free shipping from Amazon and I bought this on their subscription program, so it cost me $31 plus tax. I think this is a very good price and I would gladly make this roast my daily brew.<br /><br />I recommend this roast without reservation.<br /><br />-Mike
