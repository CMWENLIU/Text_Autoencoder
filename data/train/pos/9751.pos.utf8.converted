Please don't believe the review that this soup is yucky, it is delicious and I am absolutely flabbergasted that anyone wouldn't like it.  There are chunks of tamale and soft corn chips in there, beans, corn, all the good stuff.  It is a super thick soup and is SO filling.  I am going to stop ordering all the other flavors and stick to this one and the tortilla soup (that one is also very good).
