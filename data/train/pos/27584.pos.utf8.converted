I remember growing up in Brooklyn in the late 70's, happy and carefree--a perfect childhood in every way but one: my parents would not let me or my brother eat Kellogg's Apple Jacks.<br /><br />Saturday mornings were the happiest times for me any my brother. We woke early, rushed down to the living room to watch cartoons, and munched on our favorite cereals--but never Apple Jacks. Every time that commercial came on with its snappy, rhythmic jingle, my brother and I would sing along:<br /><br />"A is for apple,<br /><br />J is for jacks--<br /><br />cinnamon, toasty Apple Jacks.<br /><br />You need a good breakfast,<br /><br />that's a fact.<br /><br />Start it out with Apple Jacks!<br /><br />Apple Jacks! Apple Jacks!<br /><br />10 vitamins and minerals,<br /><br />that's what it packs!<br /><br />Apple-y, tasty, crunchy, too<br /><br />Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!"<br /><br />And always on those final words, "Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!" my brother and I would punch each other in the face and fall down on the floor, laughing our heads off.<br /><br />We begged our parents for Apple Jacks, but they never got them for us. We ate a bowl once, at a friend's house, and got so pumped up and full of apple-y goodness that we not only punched each other in the face, but we also punched our friend's mother in the face as well. She told our mother, and from then on, we were never again allowed to eat Apple Jacks.<br /><br />It's been a long time since then and I'd forgotten all about Apple Jacks until I saw an Apple Jacks commercial one day while my kids were watching cartoons. Suddenly the memory of my childhood hit me like a ton of bricks and I immediately put my mother in an old-folks home and then went out and bought some Apple Jacks. As soon as I paid for them I ripped open the box and began munching down great big handfuls of Apple Jacks in the supermarket. Some pimply-faced bagger mumbled something about not being allowed to eat in the store, but I punched him in the face and laughed. I was filled with apple-y goodness!<br /><br />Imagine my overflowing joy, then, when I found I could get an entire case of Apple Jacks, packaged into convenient, ready-to-eat individual cups, shipped right to my door! Now Apple Jacks are the only thing I eat, and even my pee smells like Apple Jacks! I called my brother, and he also got a case. We also put our father in a nursing home, but not the same one as our mother's.
