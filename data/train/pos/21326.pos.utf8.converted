If you expect it to taste like fried chicken, you will be disappointed as the other reviewer was. BUT..........if you just enjoy it for how it tastes it is great! Quick meals galore, add to rice, stuffing, or pasta. You can even clean off the gravy and BBQ it! I think it is one of the better tasting "fake" meats around.
