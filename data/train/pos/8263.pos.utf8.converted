The beans were of great quailty.  They arrived promptly, and were moist and pliable (as vanilla beans should be).  Have made amazing ice cream and cheesecakes with my beans. I also can't believe how inexpensive these were.  I had purchased some at my local supermarket and they weren't even as fresh as these, but had charged me $14 for 2 beans.  I highly recommend this product, and would buy it again myself.
