My nine month old son loves these in all flavors -- original, vegetable, and strawberry.  They are easy for him to hold and bite; and they dissolve easily in his mouth.  The strawberry flavor is much sweeter than the others.  He started with the Baby crackers at about 6 months and recently switched to the the toddler variety, but there is actually very little difference in the texture.
