Something odd happened after 2- 3 months. I started to notice small changes that happen/not happen. First my blood flow in my legs had improved and the numbness in my toes went away. Next the small fat pocket around my waist got smaller. My joints feel better. I still use olive but less and less and never for cooking any more. I now use it on my toast in the morning. Loving it! Not going back to butter! Most of all... this one is the best value.
