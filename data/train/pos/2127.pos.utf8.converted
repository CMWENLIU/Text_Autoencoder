Does ganoderma do all it's said to do?  Heck, I don't know.  I do know that when I drink it in the morning, I seem to think more clearly throughout the day.  At 60, this is a good thing.  I also doubt it's the placebo effect, or the green tea I drank for years would have done the same thing.  So I think it must have at least some of the health benefits it's touted to have.<br /><br />That said, even without the ganoderma, this is just plain good coffee and for far less than running through the local Starbucks (more convenient too).  So there's really not much to lose in trying it.<br /><br />This vendor is very fast and attentive.  Nice job!
