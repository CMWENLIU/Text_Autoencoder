I have Marmite on toast every morning. Although I have been told by an Australian friend that Marmite is not up to the standards of Vegemite, I cannot tell the difference. An English friend tells me Marmite is better. Go figure.:) I love it and make certain to never run out of Marmite. This is one of those: you either love it or hate it, things perhaps. I've been even told it's healthy for me *gasp*. Regardless, it's a good way to start my day.
