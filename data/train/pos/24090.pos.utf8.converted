I've tried a lot of meatless products out there and this sloppy joe mix is by far my favorite vegetarian meat alternative out there. EASY to make and we easily made seven good size sandwiches out of one box.  Even if a person isn't vegetarian, the cost savings alone (versus ground beef) makes it worth it.  Yum!!!
