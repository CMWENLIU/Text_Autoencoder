My father-in-law has been looking for Underwood sardines in tomato sauce since I married his daughter over 15 years ago.  I've looked everywhere for them.  He was always going on about how he wished he could find them.  Consumer Reports indicated they were the highest rated sardines, yadda, yadda, yadda.  You get the picture.  So in desperation I took a chance and had a case of these sent to his house.  Well long story short (believe it or not this is the short version, did I mention 15 years) he loves them.  Haven't heard one da... uh one darn thing about Underwood sardines in tomato sauce since then.  Worth EVERY penny.
