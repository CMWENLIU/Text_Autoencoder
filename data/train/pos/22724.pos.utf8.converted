I loved this sauce as a kid and have recently rediscovered and fallen in love with it again.  It is the the tangiest, tastiest sweet and sour sauce, and has the perfect consistency. It sticks to whatever you dip it in and you really 'taste' the wonderful flavor. It is spectacular on pork chops, but you can use it for whatever you might like a sweet and sour sauce on. It is also terrific on broccoli. I recommend this sauce highly!
