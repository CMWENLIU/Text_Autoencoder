I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.  It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm.<br /><br />Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I give it 5 stars.
