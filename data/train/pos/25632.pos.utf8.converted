I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWNIUI">Simply Organic Carrot Cake Mix, Certified Organic, Fair Trade Certified(tm), 11.60 Ounce Boxes  (Pack of 3)</a> mix at my local grocer for $4.99/box less $1 off coupon I got from the Simply Organic website.  It had an expiration date of over one year out on it.  It is fair trade certified as well as USDA organic.  The mix makes either two 8" or 9" round cakes or one 11" x 7" cake.  The directions call for 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup water, and 1 cup grated carrots.  It offers an alternate vegan recipe option by substituting 1/4 cup applesauce for the 2 eggs with no change in cooking times or temperature. There is also a bonus recipe on the box for pumpkin cake that adds 3/4 cup pumpkin filling to the other ingredients.  It also suggests that you can make a spice cake by omitting the carrots and adding 2 tablespoons of additional water.  It suggests topping the cake with either cream cheese frosting or dusting with powdered sugar.  I thought the flavor and texture were wonderful but that the cake was a little thin.  I made a delicious icing out of goat milk butter, goat milk cream cheese, vanilla, and confectioner's sugar.  I think next time, I would try making a one layer cake with the batter.  I would purchase again. Another good choice if you want already made gluten-free carrot muffins is Kinnikinnick frozen and you can add icing/frosting if you want.
