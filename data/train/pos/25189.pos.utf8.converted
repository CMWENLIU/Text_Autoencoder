two pounds is an awful lot of brazil nuts, let me tell you.  but i'm TOTALLY happy that i have them.<br /><br />i'm really enjoying the flavour of these nuts.  i got them because, with thyroid disease, one is supposed to have selenium, and i have problems with selenium in tablet form.  so i found the most natural way to get selenium into my life each day -- and that's via eating brazil nuts.<br /><br />for those who may be wondering HOW MANY brazil nuts -- it's about one and a half brazil nuts a day -- one ounce.  each brazil nut weighs about .6 ounces, so one and a half a day should be fine.
