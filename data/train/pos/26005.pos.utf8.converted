This is one of the tastiest brands of ramen ever.  There quick and easy to make, no prep work needed, just boiling water.  The noodles are thicker then those card board cup o noodle and so much more tastier.  The sauce is spicy so it'll get you sweating on a cold night.  I recommend eating these while watching your favorite TV show or if you need a quick noodle fix.
