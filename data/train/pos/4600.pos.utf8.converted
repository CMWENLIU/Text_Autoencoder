You need to try this cereal in order to form your own opinion.  I eat this cereal every single day for breakfast.  It is my favorite cereal and I absolutely love it!  I have never thought the chocolate tasted waxy.. I make sure to eat every last chocolately piece in my bowl.  My husband doesn't like it, and I buy the Vanilla Almond for him, and I've talked to other people who don't like it, but my personal opinion is that it is absolutely yummy.  They usually have it on sale at Rite-Aid for 2 for $5 every couple weeks or so, and that is when I stock up on it.
