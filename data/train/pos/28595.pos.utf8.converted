Yeah. Toothpicks. For $7 no less. What a bargain!!! And they are flavored? No way. That's so cool. Why didn't anyone think of this - well besides Joe in Middle School - with flavoring for next to nothing. But still, a seven dollar tooth pick is my idea of fun. And even better - if you get sick of them you can sell them on ebay as pieces of the crucifix that Jesus was hanged on (or the guy that played him in The Passion)
