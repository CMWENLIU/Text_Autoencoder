When I received this product I thought the boxes were really little, but I've made several cream pies with just  one box, and there's still enough to make something else..  I love how creamy, rich and silky smooth this cornstarch makes the puddings and pie fillings.  I didn't realize what a difference there is in corn starches.  I would definitely recommend this brand to anyone who is trying to decide which one to use.  This shipment arrived in a timely manner. I put this on a regular rotation--once a month with no shipping.
