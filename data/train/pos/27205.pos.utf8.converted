Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Creamy delicious organic refried beans. Great for bean burritos or nachos. Just put a dollop on a tortilla with some organic salsa for a quick and easy snack or meal. Wonderful for tacos with fresh tomatos and lettuce. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CPZQ">Amy's Organic Medium Chili, 14.7 Ounces (Pack of 12)</a>. Six star company. Another vegan wonder from Amy's kitchen! This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.
