I was trying to find a source for hot-smoked, shelf-stable salmon. Several brands are available through Amazon and its affiliates and I ordered a range of them to test. This is the superior product (though I gather that the King Salmon in this brand is even one step higher). It is a beautiful orange/red colour and has moist flesh with a rich and lively flavour (without excessive smoke penetration). Other brands (which had 5-star ratings) were much drier and paler (more like pink than red salmon).
