I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises. I also have had problems with constipation for most of my life ( I'm sure it's because of my terrible diet which includes lots of sugar) and it also totally solved that problem. I would like you to know that I own no stock in the company, I do not know anyone in the company,I do not sell this product, and I do not have a dog in the fight however I would hate to think that I could no longer be able to get this product. After using several different types of magnesium I proclaim this to be the very best with no one in close 2nd place. I will tell you it takes a small amount of effort to figure out how much your body needs, I usually take about a teaspoonfull a day mixed in a bottle of plain water and I drink it though out the day and I do this about 3 times a day. This product has litterally changed my life and I think I could write a small book about it. I've told numerous people about it and it's a shame there are so many scams in the world that we as a people are so sceptical and that when a great product comes along we sometimes ignore it..
