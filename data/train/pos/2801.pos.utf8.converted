The iced tea K-cups are more expensive than the coffee, but even so, the convenience has made them a winner with me.  The effort to make a single glass of freshly brewed iced tea is sufficiently daunting that I was never inspired to do it.  I'm not a fan of the bottled or instant versions and don't drink enough to warrant making a whole pitcher so I rarely drank iced tea at all even though I like it, particularly with lemon, until I discovered this stuff.  When I tried the sample pack of iced teas I received with an order of coffees, this lemon appealed to me the most and I've been reordering it ever since.  It suits my need for speed and ease and I find the flavor as good as fresh brewed.<br /><br />I use a pint Mason jar since I don't have a proper 16 oz glass that can withstand the initial heat.  It's a bit rustic, but it works fine.  You fill the glass with ice cubes and using one of the lower volume settings on your brewer, you let the hot tea fall directly into the ice filled glass.  Within a few seconds, it's chilled and ready to drink.<br /><br />Even though this is supposed to be pre-sweetened tea, it's not sweet enough for me and I add more sugar or Stevia.  To me it tastes fresh brewed with just the right amount of lemon and is done in seconds.  Since there are other teas I'm very fond of in K-cups, I tried the same method to make iced tea from those, but it doesn't work because they get too diluted.  This type is stronger and stands up to the extra dilution from the ice.  It provides me just the cooling pick-me-up I need during these super hot days.  Recommended to those who enjoy iced tea and appreciate a quick and effective preparation method.
