My cat had been vomiting every morning for years and we blamed it on separation anxiety. We called an animal behaviorist and our vet recommended that we put her on kitty zoloft. We tried this cat food instead and immediately the vomiting stopped, she stopped coughing up hairballs, and she finally started having regular bowel movements. Her hair is shiny and she has put on a healthy amount of weight. She is no longer anxious and seems so much happier! We are so grateful!
