The Jaipur Avenue Chai Tea mix is a perfect blend of tea, spice, and sweetness. Each packet of powder makes appriximately eight ounces of scrumptious tea. However, I like my chai on the strong side so I put two packets in about twelve ounces of water. It is super fast, easy, and mixes well. Just add a bit of hot water, then the packet contents, mix it up a bit, then add more water. Delicious!
