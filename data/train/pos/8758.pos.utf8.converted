I'm pleased to see another one of the big companies jumping into the natural sweetener ring with this offering.  Meant, I'm certain, as direct competition for Truvia, this is a really nice product.  Monk fruit is the primary sweetening force in these little packets as opposed to stevia in Truvia.  Monk fruit (also known as luo han guo in China where it originates) and stevia have a lot of molecular properties in common.  They are kissing cousins in the natural sweetener world, with monk fruit offering a slightly more positively robust flavor profile with tasters offering descriptors like:  honey, fruity, molasses, brown sugar.<br /><br />The best products containing stevia, by comparison, have a stronger more streamlined flavor that just screams:  sweet! for the most part, yet there is high variability between stevia strains which you will quickly learn if you start tasting all the various products in the marketplace.  The cleanest stevia flavor is to be found in a single ingredient, pure stevia product made by KAL.  Others tend to have some off flavors like licorice or bitter notes and lingering unpleasant aftertastes.  Yet, for me, it's been a long time since I've partaken in any of those, having found the KAL product years ago, I began mixing my own blend with Erythritol, Xylitol, KAL's stevia and pure glucose to round out the flavor profile.  I occasionally use truvia or splenda when away from home.<br /><br />Extracts like stevia and monk fruit offer some interesting problems for the manufacturers.  The sweetness factor is incredibly high--miniscule amounts approximate a couple of teaspoons of sugar--something like 1/128 of a teaspoon or the like.  How do they deliver that in a packet?  Well, they have to mix it up with something else that adds bulk, of course.  A sugar alcohol is the obvious choice because it tastes so much like sugar yet delivers very few to zero practical calories.  The manufacturers lean toward erythritol because it results in zero net calories in such small amounts.  They might be better served by combining it with xylitol and/or something else like pure glucose or fructose because anyone with sensitive, um, digestive functions are going to find that using a lot of this product is going to send them running for the bathroom--though they probably won't make the connection.  The sugar alcohols (as those who have partaken of diabetic candies quickly learn) can wreak havoc with the gut.<br /><br />That said, this product contains 2 grams of erythritol per packet, while Truvia contains 3 grams per packet.  That's a significant difference if you are a heavy coffee drinker.  And, in addition, Nectresse is a far superior product taste-wise.<br /><br />Artificial sweeteners tend to hit one 'note' of sweetness and clang that single note with gusto which tends to fall flat.  The problem is real sugar is a clamor of notes--thousands of little sweet notes of varying degrees and ranges that culminate in one mental rapport--satisfying sweetness.  Monk fruit naturally hits more of those notes and the additional ingredients the manufacturer has added tinkle a few more in the background which is why this is really a superior product.  I have always found that a more satisfying approach is to combine many sweeteners in smaller amounts, trying to hit as many notes as possible.  I can't go back to sugar--my body just doesn't process it properly and I'm working hard to avoid the genetic tendency toward diabetes that runs in my family by eating a low glycemic index diet.<br /><br />So, all that said,  I was truly impressed with this product and its clean, simple, sweet flavor.  If I could only use one commercial product, this one would be it.
