I have tried both of the other Rice Dream flavors, vanilla and original. This one came in the 32 ounce size so I thought I would give it a try. It makes a high fiber bowl of cereal a taste treat. It's a mild cinnamon taste. It's like the difference between oatmeal plain and oatmeal with cinnamon. And thanks to it being lactose free, no bloating and no tummy troubles.
