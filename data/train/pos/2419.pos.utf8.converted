I am a tea addict and I have different teas that I drink at different times of day/night. I drink this particular tea almost exclusively when I'm at my computer writing in the evening. It's a rich black tea with a very comforting  and tasty quality. It is not "fruity" the way that herbal teas are--not at all overpowering and sweet and it's a shame that people might think it's an overly-flavored tea, it's not (Twinings should kill the word "flavored" on the box). This is probably my favorite bagged black tea and I have a hard time finding it at the local grocery stores (but there are always 97,000 kinds of berry teas from the herbal companies--blehhh!). OK, it's only tea, I'll calm down :).
