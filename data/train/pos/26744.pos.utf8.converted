I've been a microwave oven user since 1986, and I've tried all sorts of tricks for cooking meat in them.  For the most part, I have it all down pat - but cooking bacon without mess or fuss or stuck-to-the-paper-towel bacon has eluded me.  Not any more!<br /><br />I got a Bacon Genie about a month ago and since then I've found that I can cook both regular and turkey bacon to exactly the desired doneness and crispyness I want.  For my health I tend more towards turkey bacon than regular bacon and I've found that the Bacon Genie makes it easy to cook eight slices in just four-and-a-half (chewy) to five (crispy) minutes - just right for two people for breakfast.  (I place three strips on each outer side and two on the middle bar.)<br /><br />And cleanup?  Not a problem.  The bacon's fat drips straight down to the collector in the bottom with no splatter.  Once I'm done, I pour the drippings straight into my grease jar (What?  You don't have a grease jar?  For shame!  You can always re-use for other cooking or throw the full jar away, saving you sink from grease clogs.) for disposal.<br /><br />Also, the Bacon Genie comes with a nice pair of tongs for removing the bacon without getting your fingers burned or greasy.<br /><br />Yes.  I cannot recommend the Bacon Genie strongly enough!
