Have been using this in my morning chai for several months now and it is absolutely incredible.  The only "bad" thing I can say about it is that it can be a little addictive :)<br /><br />Follow up: We usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends (half-nhalf - what's that??).  The other day we were out so I used the Santini condensed milk instead.  All I can say is, wow!  Actually enjoyed it more than cream - and then I compared the labels.  The condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream.  We're never going back!
