My husband and I have tried several brands of instant decaf, none to our liking until we found this.  Since we only drink decaf in the evenings we finally gave up wasting our money until my husband came across Mount Hagen in a grocery store.  To our surprise it made the best cup of decaf we ever had (including ground.)  It is a deep, rich smooth and satisfying cup of coffee.  Very flavorful.  If having a supply of great tasting decaf on hand is useful to you, you can't find better.
