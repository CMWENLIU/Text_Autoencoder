My husband loved receiving this package in front of his co-workers. There was hardly anything left when he came home from work. The packaging was beautifully done and everything was delicious that he received. All of his co-workers wanted to know who the company was. I e-mailed them the name of the company so I am so sure they will probably order for Easter, I know I will. You should too for friends,relatives retirement homes and anyone you can think of. The company is very responsive and takes care of its customers down to the last detail.
