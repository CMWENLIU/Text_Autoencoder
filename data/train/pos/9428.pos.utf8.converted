I wasn't expecting a real Blue Mountain taste for such an inexpensive price. I like Blue Mountain coffee but that preference just doesn't justify it's ridiculous price. This pre-ground blend must have undergone some serious testing to produce the final product. It really tastes great. While I ususlly grind my own beans and ocasionally buy a blend of ground. This Magnum blend was like finding a diamond in the rough. Of course you may not find it as good; we all have different likes and dislikes according to our taste buds.
