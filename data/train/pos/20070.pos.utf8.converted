Now, I have not yet purchased these online here at Amazon. BUT I have gotten them at the store. I have three shepherds and they LOVE these (in both the small and the large sizes).  These bones help keep their teeth healthy and keep them occupied without creating a mess.  Long after the filling is gone they still gnaw on the bones with delight.<br /><br />Makes me happy that these are made in the USA. I think these are great. Try them out for your pup!
