I love chocolate, and these Guylian chocolates are awesome, the hazelnuts are so finely ground and it's a heavenly flavor when combined with the soft marbled chocolate.  These chocolates are best consumed by nibbling away at them.  I've moved on to the Guylian Praline Twists, they're the same thing as the seashells but in individually wrapped form.  At my local store, the twists are less expensive than the boxed seashells, between 30-50% cheaper when looking at the price per ounce.  Since they're for me, I don't need the fancy gift packaging that the seashells have.  :)
