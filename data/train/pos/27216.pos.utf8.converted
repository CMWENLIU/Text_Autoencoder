Really an outstanding coffee. Consistently good flavor from bag to bag. We have been enjoying this for over a year and have not been disappointed with the Sumatran Dark. The roast is optimal -- luscious and aromatic, like espresso, not over-roasted and burnt. Love the fact that it is organic and fair-trade also. The value is excellent, especially with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />I can't say the same of other varieties of Altura that I've tried; I've only been really pleased with the Sumatran, not others. Also, this coffee blows away competing (and much more expensive) offerings from Jeremiah's and Appassionato which lacked freshness and full flavor.<br /><br />Truly a quality buy! Full 5 Stars - Highly recommend!
