If you like lemon you will love "I Love Lemon"!  I have been drinking this tea for years and have never lost my taste for it.  If you make a second cup of tea from the same tea bag it has a more lemony flavor as the Rose Hips dissolved out in the first cup.  Two different teas in the same tea bag!!!
