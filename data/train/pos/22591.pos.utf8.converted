This pasta sells for around $4.99 a box in our local Italian store so the price here at amazon is a real deal. I've been enjoying the De Cecco spaghetti for years and think it is possibly the best pasta in the world. It is perfect with butter and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese or will work with any sauce you wish to invent. Tonight I made a tomato sauce with olives. I'd like to try the recipe on the box - "Spaghetti Exotica with Truffles" Sometimes in life you come across a 100-star item and this is it! Off to look for truffles.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
