Over the years I've done bulk buying for a housing cooperative and have dealt with wholesome sweeteners before - they sell everything from sucanat to organic corn syrup (blech). A lot of the other agave stuff on the market right now is simply from resellers trying to make a buck moving high margin natural foods products - this stuff is from a company that specializes in selling sweeteners and has a reputation for quality. You can't really beat it.<br /><br />Uses: This stuff is perfect for tea - just a little bit takes the bitter edge off most black / green teas without overwhelming the flavor - and for making raw sweets. A lot of people like to use this stuff for baking, but I find it a bit expensive for this use - honey is cheaper and more readily available. This stuff is really healthy, but has to travel a lot of miles and uses a lot of packaging where both honey and maple syrup can be found locally in gallon jugs depending on where you live. Our coop actually buys honey in 60lb jugs :)<br /><br />Note: Different companies advertise widely ranging glycemic index values for their agave syrups - enough so to make your head spin at how they could be so widely different for what appears to be the same product. Wholesome Sweeteners advertises 39 or less on their site, which is believable, where some companies advertise values as low as 21 with no analysis to back their claims up. To give you an idea of how this stuff compares glycemic index wise both honey & maple syrup have glycemic indexes around 55, corn syrup's is around 100, and white sugar's is around 110(!).
