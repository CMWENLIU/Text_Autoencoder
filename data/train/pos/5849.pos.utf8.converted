By way of comparison I have only tried a few, but this is good miso. If I find better I will modify this review to reflect that, but so far this is the best I've tried.<br /><br />I've had miso soup at many restaurants and bistros and the Japanese Tea Garden in San Fransisco serves the best I've tasted. With hon dashi, red miso, tofu and green onions it is fast and easy to make a bowl of soup on par with theirs.
