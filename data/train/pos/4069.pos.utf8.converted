First, Luzianne makes the best classic brewed iced tea, hands down.  The family sized bags make 1 quart per bag, 48 quarts per box, 12 gallons of iced tea x 6 boxes @ $4.72 a box, thats 72 gallons of iced tea, certainly enough for the summer season and then some, plus free shipping if you play your cards right and order something else; you just can't beat that.  You can't get Luzianne cheaper anywhere else.<br /><br />So stop buying the instant iced tea mix crap, get some of these bags and brew your own.
