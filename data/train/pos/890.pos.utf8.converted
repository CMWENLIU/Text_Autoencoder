You know I love my English Breakfast (see my earlier 5 star review of Twinings English Breakfast) -- but my greatest delight is Earl Grey tea -- with its deep, smokey, heavy (but not burdensome) mysterious wonderful flavors that linger hauntingly on the tongue and bring sublime moments of joy into a grey day (no pun intended). Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a "Chai presence"!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again.<br /><br />Lady Grey was new to me, and yes it is a bit lighter and not as intense as the Earl himself, but Lady Grey is still very very good -- notably so.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast is a tea that may make you break out in song -- it is robust and delightful, clearing up "morning fog" in a hearty way.<br /><br />This is a very good variety pack, IMHO, to keep on hand at the office when having panel meetings or board meetings -- or just in the "break kitchen" for folks to enjoy when they are want a tea break!! Wonderful flavors and aromas like these can't but help to make people sit up and notice, and make a sometimes dull work-day (or...ahem...meeting) more enjoyable.
