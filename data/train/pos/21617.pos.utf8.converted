Have no idea why, but all our local supermarkets have discontinued Kellogg's Product 19. So... walked into the kitchen, saw the stuff the kids were eating and decided to go on a hunger strike... at least till lunchtime. THANK GOD FOR AMAZON!!!  Back to breakfast again (as soon as my product19 arrives.) Thanks, guys  :-)
