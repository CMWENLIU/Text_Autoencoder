We've owned this machine for 11 months and therefore can provide a longer term review. Please note we bought this on sale at Costco for $350, but it's worth more.<br /><br />Ease of use: while this is a superautomatic, don't assume you can brew a perfect cup of coffee/espresso with no experimentation. This isn't a Keurig. The advantage of superautomatics is ease of use and consistency once you've optimized brewing. Similar to semi-automatic espresso machines, you do have control over your final product. You still have to find the correct coffee grind setting/amount, etc. You still need to aim for a 25 second extraction time. Once you do, though, you'll have great results each and every time.<br /><br />Maintenance: this machine requires minimal daily maintenance. The water reservoir is small so have a water pitcher handy. Fresh water is ideal for brewing anyway. Ditto for the coffee bean hopper. But again, who wants beans sitting out going stale? Weekly maintenance involves cleaning the brew group. This is easy. Every 2-3 months the machine should be descaled. This does require time.<br /><br />Taste: we are big fans of french press coffee for its richness of flavor. This is the first "coffee machine" that can best a french press with less effort, less cleanup, and more consistency. The coffee is makes is excellent (termed coffee crema as it retains crema on the top), and I find it difficult to drink coffee outside the home now. The espresso it makes is equally excellent. It surpasses Starbuck's with ease, and is equivalent to espresso you'll get from most cafes. However, it's not as good as you'll find at an Intelligentsia, or similar quality cafe. But it's quite consistent. Don't forget that beans are an important variable. Try black cat espresso from Intelligentsia, preferably roasted only a few weeks in advance.<br /><br />Milk frothing: anywhere from adequate to very good. Definitely depends on type of milk and skill. I can usually make quite good foam, but it can't do true microfoam.<br /><br />Quality/workmanship: plastic outer casing and plastic brew group. Looks flimsy, but has held up over the past year. It makes a strange high pitched noise while brewing, probably from the where the coffee comes out (likely just our machine) but we've otherwise not had problems. Also, it's the same brew group used in their other machines, so taste should be equivalent to more expensive machines.<br /><br />Features: this is bare bone. No timer, no computer presets. But this is also why the price point is so good. You get a great espresso maker and decent grinder for a relatively low price.<br /><br />Speed: warms up from turn on in 2-3 minutes. Then takes (with grinding) from about 35-40 sec for espresso to a bit longer for a cup of coffee (can make a full american sized cup). Warm up for steaming is quick. To then brew after steaming takes only about 15 seconds as long as you purge hot water. So getting to know how the machine works is important.<br /><br />Summary: fantastic consistent coffee, excellent espresso with nice crema, and very good steaming at a great price. A great barista with a high end grinder and high end semi-automatic can probably make better espresso, but this is great for the rest of us. And early in the morning this is what you want.
