I have been using Colavita for years. It is one of the finest all around X-Virgin olive oils on the market. Its extremely fruity and works very well in salads and pasta dishes. I have been struggling with olive oils since I can not find it in the stores where I now live. Now I get it shipped to my door, with free freight, and at a lower price than I used to pay in the grocery store.
