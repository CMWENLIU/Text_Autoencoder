From Parma,Italy comes two famous food products.<br /><br /> Parmigiano Reggiano and prosciutto (which translates into something like dried meat.If you're ever in Bologna,I'd recommend a stop at Tamburini, which has stood in its place for as long as I can remember.<br /><br /> This cheese is worth every cent.<br /><br />When you buy it, don't have it ground at the store, buy the block and grate it at home or it will lose it's strength of flavor.<br /><br />I recommend this with a 100% guarantee of falling in love with the product, so buy it for St. Valentine's Day if you're single.
