Being white peaches, the flavor is muted but it is still delicious!  Each can has about ~4 whole peaches sliced in half.  They are packed in light syrup which is not great but may be necessary to preserve the terrific really ripe yet firm peach quality.  This is a great way to spice up a cake topping or ice cream or just to eat by themselves.  Roland does a great job preserving their fruit (forget their vegetables though) with all their great flavors.  The cans sit in your cabinet waiting for when you need them, not for when they sit rotting in your refrigerator because you did not use them within their limited time span.  I will be buying these again......they truly are delicious!
