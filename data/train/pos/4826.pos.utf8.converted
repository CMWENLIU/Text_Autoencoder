I am a daily drinker of coffee, I put 3-4 scoops per day. Local sales are for $10.99 a canister.  People hoard, fight, and snatch up all that they can when they see if for that price.  THIS IS CHEAPER, and I don't have to get into a scuffle to buy it.  product is fresh, within sell by date. I bought 2 sets.
