I have been purchasing this product for a while, and have always had consistent and yummy oil. I like the bottle because it comes with its own spout! It isn't overly bitter, or overly harsh, it works well for saute' and use in a vinaigrette, or a simple finishing oil. I will continue to buy this product... 2 very big thumbs up!
