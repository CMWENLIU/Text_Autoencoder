I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend Organic Arabica onecup a try this morning.<br />When I open the box I notice a similar smell as the Fog Chaser blend but not nearly as strong.<br />Oddly I find the description on the Box exactly the same as that of Fog Chaser.<br />Their Website shows this as Reguler Full city Roast and describes it as follows :<br />Our certified organic, Rainforest Blend is an artful mix of coffees from Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, and Indonesia that produces a smooth, yet full-bodied taste with lively acidic notes.<br />The onecup brews perfectly in my B70 and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed.<br />Maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter?<br />The wife and I tend to favor the Dark Roast extra bold Kcups and on occasion Medium roasts as well.<br />This Rainforest Blend is alittle light for me but it's really flavorful and wins me over all the same.<br />So far I'm really liking these offerings from Rogers Family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to Kcups.<br />I was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness.<br />The wife and I normally drink 2 cups a day so we can polish off a box of 12 in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness.<br />The downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with Kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible.
