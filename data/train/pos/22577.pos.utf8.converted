I don't usually write reviews but I feel compelled to do so based on a misconception going around about this product. This is not another snake oil fix-it-all.<br />It contains grounded corn with herbs, not processed sugar. Yes it is full of carbohydrates and natural sugars, but it is not candy or a magical elixir. The Tarahumara Indians use it to fuel their ultra-runs, but that does not mean that you should gobble it up for a quick pick-me-up in the morning. You wouldn't eat running gels, protein shakes or Michael Phelps's lunch and then not do the work. If you want an alternative to GU or energy bars try this, if you are trying to get healthy by simply ingesting something; don't.
