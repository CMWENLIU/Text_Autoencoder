We recently purchased a Keurig coffee maker and it has well over a hundred choices for coffee.  We sampled quite a few and I've chosen Newman's Own Organic Extra Bold for my morning cup.  If you like a bold, robust cup of coffee first thing in the morning then this is the one for you.  It's rich and smooth but not harsh, as well as organic.  Of all the "bold" coffees I tried, this was without a doubt my favorite.  Give Neuman's a try, it's really good!
