I have been drinking hot tea since childhood, which is a fairly common thing for children in rural Maine. I've been faithful to Red Rose for years, until a British co-worker introduced me to PG Tips. There's no turning back for me now! The strong, robust cup of tea I get from one bag of the PG Tips has spoiled me for anything else.
