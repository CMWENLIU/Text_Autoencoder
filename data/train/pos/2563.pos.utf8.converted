This is an excellent deal!  If you like Nutella, and your local grocer doesn't carry it (or even if they do, in some cases), this is a very good buy even with shipping costs included.  There are a number of reviews for Nutella available on Amazon -- it's a decadently rich chocolate/hazelnut spread that needs no refrigeration, and is wonderful on everything from croissants to graham crackers to fruit.  This 6-pack ensures that you'll have plenty on hand!  The cost per jar (including the shipping charges) is actually less than my local grocer charges.
