I recently treated myself to a keurig single serve machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> and was anxious to experiment with different coffees.  I am not a fan of strong coffee so I use the travel mug size to make this blueberry coffee.  This green mountain blueberry coffee is THE best coffee ever for someone who loves the treat of a light flavored coffee and the aroma is to die for.  I am not a coffee purist and do not claim to be an expert; however I do know the difference between a good and bad cup of Joe and this gets my vote for great flavored coffee.  Please try to buy fair trade coffee - take a few minutes to read up on the subject, it is worth it!
