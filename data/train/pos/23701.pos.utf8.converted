My local Whole Foods sells Nature's Path products for $3.79 a box, so this Amazon.com price is an excellent deal.<br /><br />The cereal is hearty and crunchy, although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk. I sometimes add a little sweetner, as sugar is not added artificially. My housemate (who grew up in France & Italy), loves this cereal, as he says it reminds him of his European 'grainy' musli-style cereals. However, I am not a big fan of what is sold as 'Musli' or 'Muslix' in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this.<br /><br />Think Chex style bites and crunch, without the Chex fake crunch, slimy coating, preservatives and sugars.
