I am trying my best to eliminate plastic from my purchases, especially when it comes to food products. I think this is only one of two brands I've come across in my search that packages hemp oil in glass bottles.<br /><br />I had another brand of hemp oil sold in a plastic container. There is a definite difference in taste, compared to the hemp oil in a glass bottle.  I much prefer the taste of the hemp oil in a glass bottle.<br /><br />Keep this organic oil refrigerated after you open the bottle.<br /><br />I use it on salads.  I do not use it for frying or sauteing.<br /><br />I've learned that any oil at high heat becomes a transfat...yes, that evil transfat. I now only use ghee (clarified butter) or organic coconut oil for any frying or any baking.  Every other oil I use, (hemp, olive, walnut, avocado) I use only for seasoning or in salads.<br /><br />This product was shipped to me exceptionally well-packaged and securely wrapped.  Each bottle was individually wrapped and cushioned in bubble wrap, within a box that was additionally cushioned all around in more bubble wrap. Perfect.<br /><br />When I run out, I will certainly buy this product from the same Seller who gave excellent customer service.
