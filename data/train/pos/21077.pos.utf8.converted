When I asked what the main ingrediant in this product was I was told it was vinegar.  My grandmother used to use vinegar to clean fruits and it works great, but it has a strong smell and often that smell can stick to the surface of the fruit.  Fit has no unpleasant scent and it does a great job.  You can see how much more dirt comes off than when just using water.  Plus it's kosher which is a plus for the times when I have my 2 modern orthodox jewish friends and their kids over.<br /><br />One reviewer says the plastic bowl has BPA.  As someone who tries to avoid BPA plastics for anything that handles my food I tried to verify this.  The bottom of the white bowl has a 5 recycling number so it looks like this collander is BPA free.
