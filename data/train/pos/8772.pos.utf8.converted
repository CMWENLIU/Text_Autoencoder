Coca tea needs to be kept away from heat, light, air and moisture, it is not coffee, so please don't put it in the freezer or it will turn Grey!<br />The tin can keeps your tea fresh for long, it is convenient, solid and you can refill them over time from the air tight bags.<br />You only need a bit to prepare a good cup of strong tea.<br />McMate Gold is very crisp, I like McMate Caranavi better but it's no longer in stock and only Gold comes in tin cans.<br />I learned that only small, new shade-grown coca tea leaves give a bright green powder otherwise the color is grayish or yellowish. Brighter the green color means that the leaves dried outside in the shade and were not exposed to direct sunlight what makes a high grade coca flour.<br />McMate is clearly bright Green!
