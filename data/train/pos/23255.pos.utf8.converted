I purchased this from Hometown Fvorites and all I can say is WOW. If you love coconut, this is the way to go... Along with the white coconut icing you're in for a real treat. For some reason, they don't sell it anywhere locally, so I'm forced to mail order, but yum.<br /><br />I kind of wish they sold it in quantities of 6, since I'm not likely to make more than that in one year... But its still great... Light and fluffy. A real treat.
