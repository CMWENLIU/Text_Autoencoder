I began using Xylitol as a replacement for sugar about two months ago.  Since then I have not consciously used table sugar in anything I have eaten or drank.  As it was I was only using it for coffee in the morning, and tea in the evenings.  Now I don't use table sugar at all.  Xylitol is as sweet as sugar, and has a vastly different impact on your blood chemistry.  I'll spare you the biochemical details, and suffice to say that if you are on a low-carb lifestyle, Xylitol fits right in.<br />That having been said, make sure you are willing to make a commitment to this product.  Xylitol is not digested, but rather is consumed in part by the bacteria in your stomach.  There is an adjustment period while you build up the suitable level of bacteria (good bacteria, mind you) in your intestines to consume this stuff.  Until that time (and if you go on antibiotics you will experience this again), Xylitol can give you the runs, and gas.  Once you are fully adjusted (takes a couple of weeks), then you will be fine.<br />As to this particular brand of Xylitol, it was very conveniently packaged in single-serving packs (4g) which makes monitoring your intake of this particular stuff very easy.  I have to say that the shipping is very good.  I had the product in hand about 4 days after ordering it.  The retailer has brick-and-mortar locations local to me, but they didn't carry this product there.  I have since ordered again via Amazon, with the same great shipping results.
