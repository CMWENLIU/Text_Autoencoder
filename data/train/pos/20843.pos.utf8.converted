These really are great beans. Though they say no prep is necessary for these .... I still do some. I bring them to boil, turn off the heat. Let them sit for an hour or more. I then drain them, rinse them well 2 or 3 times. Then, add whatever you add to cook them in..... and the cook very quickly.... 30-45 minutes.<br /><br />While I like these very much, I am seeking other sources as the prices on these are rising quickly. [..]<br /><br />My local natural food store is getting some, and I encourage anyone to ask their's to get some as they are available in bulk for much less. As with all bulk items, the benefits of less packaging and delivery costs are tangible.<br />[...]<br /><br />Try these beans :)
