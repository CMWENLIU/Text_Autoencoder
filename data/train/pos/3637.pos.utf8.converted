The first time I used this brand of raw cacao I made raw chocolates with it.  When I licked the "batter" off a spoon before the candies hardened, I did a little dance in my kitchen.  It was so good I couldn't believe it.  I definitely had a brain chemical reaction from it.<br /><br />Raw chocolate is a totally different experience from cooked chocolate or cocoa.  If you have never tried it, DO!  You will never look at cooked chocolate the same way again.  I make raw chocolate candies for friends and package them up and pretty little wooden boxes.  I always use this brand and people rave about them.  And the fact that they are organic is a big plus for me since I buy organic whenever I can.<br /><br />I love the way this raw chocolate makes me feel, energetic, happy and high.  And with all the health benefits, too many to list here, you can't feel bad about eating it at all. I also use it in banana or coconut smoothies and make some really great raw almond milkshakes with it.<br /><br />And if you know any women with PMS, raw chocolate far surpasses regular chocolate.  It has more of the nutrients in tact because it is raw and not exposed to heat.  Most importantly for women, the magnesium content is through the roof, which helps to relax muscles and overall body tension.  This is reportedly one of the main reasons why women with PMS crave chocolate.  And it definitely takes the edge off of menstrual cramps.<br /><br />Healthy decadence!
