These are truly a life saver product.  I have a cat, Blackie, who is needing to take two pills a day.  But, she is beyond expert at taking a pill that is all the way in the back of her throat and managing to spit it back up, even with a water chaser, at which point it gets soggy and I have to start over.  Plus, I had to hold her down each day to do this, twice (once for each pill).  Not fun for her or me.<br /><br />Then my vet, listening to my tale of woe about getting the appropriate amount of medicine into her, suggested I give these (the salmon flavored ones) a try and gave me 4 of them to try out.<br /><br />They are incredible.  Sort of like a soft playdough in consistency, with a small pocket.  I stuffed the two pills inside, molded the stuff around them so there was no sign, and simply placed the pill in front of Blackie.  She did her usual suspicious sniffing, then a lick, then she took the whole thing and scarfed it down and looked up and meowed for "more please!!".  OK, I was beyond impressed.  But, it wasn't until she repeated this over the next 3 days where I was convinced.<br /><br />Thank you *so* much whoever invented these!!
