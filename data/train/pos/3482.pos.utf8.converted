I'm an avid cook and experimenter with commercial and homemade spice mixes.  I came across this spice rub in a gourmet food shop in Los Gatos, CA.  Hands down, the most flavorful and versatile spice 'rub' out there.<br /><br />Generously coating your fish with this mix adds a light crust and a slightly zingy, sweet flavor.  Additionally, the large amount of smoked paprika in the mix gives the food a wonderful red color.<br /><br />If you have guests that like a little more heat in their food without overpowering your fish, add a couple pinches of fine - not coarse! - ground pepper to the mix.  Your taste buds will thank you!<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this mix also works well on catfish, chilean sea bass, and orange roughy.  Of the Rub with Love mixes, this and their companion mix: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are by far the best.
