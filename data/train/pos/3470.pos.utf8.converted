In about 3 minutes, this machine grinds the beans (no separate appliance needed for that!),<br />tamps down the grind (no separate tool for that!)and produces foamy hot espresso. Plus, the<br />steam is strong enough to foam up 2% milk!  Everything cleans up in a flash...second cup, no<br />long wait.  If you like strong coffee set the grind about four clicks from the maximum setting<br />and the setting for amount of coffee for each use at the max.  Lovely.
