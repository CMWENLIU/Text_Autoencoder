Kitty loves it! Happily eats 1/2 can in one setting (13.5 lbs cat), 2-3 times a day. His fur does look fluffier after 2 months on this food and he seems more content and alert. Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch "Organix;" he likes "Evo" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.
