I needed to severely cut down on my sugar intake, and also want to stay away from artificial/chemical sweeteners. Stevia is ok but still gives me that aftertaste that I don't find appealing. It's good for some things, but not everything. This product is amazing! I'm so glad to have found something that is sold in its natural, organic, raw state that is low-glycemic and actually good for you!
