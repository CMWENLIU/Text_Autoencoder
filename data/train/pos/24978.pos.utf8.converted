I have been searching for a mix for vegetarian gravy with a beef type flavor.  This is the best I have found.  The mock chicken version by Hain is not to my liking so if you have tried that one don't let it prevent you from enjoying the brown gravy mix.  Whole Foods used to carry in bulk mix for chicken broth/gravy that was very good but seems to have discontinued it.  The only vegetarian gravy better than this brown gravy mix comes with a tofurkey that is mushroom gravy that is prepared and frozen.  This is simple and handy and relatively inexpensive and as tasty as any meat based gravy mix.
