After reading the reviews of this product I was slightly reluctant to spend so much on chocolates, but after buying them I have nothing but good things to say.  The package shipped almost immediately after the order was placed, everything arrived in great shape, and the Galliano bottles are absolutely awesome!  The only slightly yucky flavor was the tequila, but only because tequila and dark chocolate are not a wise combination.  I would definitely buy these again for a special occasion.
