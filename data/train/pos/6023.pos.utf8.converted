This adds wheat protein which helps your bread rise.  I started putting this in all my yeast breads and the results were fantastic.<br /><br />If you make whole wheat bread in a Bread Machine this stuff is a must.<br /><br />If you use cheap (low protein) flour this stuff is a must.<br /><br />A little goes a long way.<br /><br />You don't have to be exact.<br /><br />Once you open the box it needs to be refrigerated to keep it fresh but it's best used at room temperature.  (Although I used it cold and I got decent results.)<br /><br />I not going to buy this thru Amazon 'cause I can't use 8 packs of wheat gluten.  You have to look for this in flour section of your supermarket or in a health food store.  Unfortunately, It is not carried everywhere.
