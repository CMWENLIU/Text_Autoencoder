For casual dining, the kind most of us do most of the time, here is a marvelous item for the table or breakfast bar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M6EP1W">Tone's Spice Islands Disposable Grinder Indian Malabar Peppercorns (Black Pepper Seasoning) Net Weight 6.5 oz</a><br /><br />I love this!  The pepper is fresh with a slight bite.  My friend found this for me, and I was delighted to receive it for a gift. I believe he paid less than this in the store. Although we enjoy many other seasonings, freshly ground black pepper remains our favorite.  It is the perfect spice for white potatoes.  It is great mixed with crushed red pepper. The grinder can be adjusted for fine or coarse texture.<br /><br />These peppercorns are from India's Malabar region and are "noted for superior aroma and robust flavor," as the label says.  The peppercorns are large and uiniform so that they will grind well.<br /><br />If you plan to use a large amount of black pepper in your food, you'll have to work a bit, but if you leave the cap on you can grind pepper and collect a large amount of pepper to be measured and added as you follow recipes.<br /><br />This tall attractive pepper grinder.  is ideal for the table or the kitchen. The grinder is brown, and the bottle is hard clear plastic.<br /><br />I believe you will enjoy using this pepper grinder.
