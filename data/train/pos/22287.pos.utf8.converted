This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a hot (cayenne?) pepper delivery device. A few drops add a considerable amount of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a heavy dose of vinegar - this sauce has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle amount of sweetness to this sauce along with faint garlic notes. While Tabasco can taste quite harsh if you add too much to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato was simply the "sun ripened chilies" and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />While I really like this product and certainly recommend its purchase --------- I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem TRULY exceptional - only VERY GOOD.  There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic certainly beats (by a very wide margin) --- the heavy vinegar aftertaste as evidenced in Tabasco and many other hot sauces.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to always have it on hand and it is a true staple.<br /><br />Amazon prices the 17oz at $5.19 and the 27oz at $5.89. It is a true no-brainer to purchase the 28oz size.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably ONLY want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh and sweeter note
