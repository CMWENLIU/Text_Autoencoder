<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F5RRSC">Primula Products Flowering Tea Set</a>I'm a big Green Tea drinker. I usually made my tea with the loose tea leaves, but then a friend told me about blooming teas. I wasn't really expecting much but I liked the looks of the Tea Pot and figured I'd give it a try. Boy was I surprised!I dropped my Tea bulb in the Primula Tea Pot. I chose Camellia Joy which is Green Tea with Acaiberry. I poured hot water over the bulb and couldn't believe the beautiful flower that began to unfold in the Pot. It reminded me of watching those nature movies in Biology class so many years ago when they'd speed up the timed pictures to show a seed blossoming in fast motion! It was incredible to watch it bloom! I then poured myself a cup of the healthy steaming hot green tea and was pleasantly surprised at the aroma and light but flavorful taste. I poured hot water over the flower 3 more times and each cup tasted as delicious as the first. I've decided this will make a fabulous birthday present for my Mom and a great present for my mother in law come Christmas time.<br />But the best part is the  Tea Pot itself. It is made of a special glass that is able to withstand boiling hot water on the stove, or holding cold tea in the fridge.It doesn't crack with temperature change, it's light-weight yet sturdy, and I love the classic design and feel of it in my hand. I leave it out with the blooming flower still in in it as a centerpiece when my friends come over. It never fails that they notice it and ask me to demonstrate how it works. I love entertaining with it and make sure I keep plenty of the flowering bulbs on hand for those drop-ins.  And the glass infuser that comes with it is great as well. It sits down inside the Tea Pot and is perfect for making a cup of loose tea for a change. It brews right inside the Tea Pot and makes a perfect blend every time, without the loose tea leaves getting into my cup. Needless to say, if you love Tea, want to start trying Tea, or know of a Tea lover, this is the perfect gift for yourself or friends. I highly recommend it. The price is right and the value is extraordinary!
