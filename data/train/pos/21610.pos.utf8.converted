I only drink whole-bean, grind-it-youself coffees. Sorry, I just couldn't go back to those other hot dark liquids that other people call coffee. No, once you get used to grinding your own you're hooked. The question might be, where do you get good whole bean coffees at a reasonable price? Grocery store prices for one-pound bags tend to be high. Likewise, specialty shops can be very high. I've found two good sources: Trader Joe's and Costco, plus a wide variety can be found online. For the past few years I have switched almost entirely over to my local Costco. A problem with Costco is that they may have only two different kinds, but the kinds may change every other time you go there.You just don't have much choice unless you work at it a bit. However, every bag I've bought has been excellent. Well, it better be because you can only buy it in three pound bags.<br /><br />My latest acquisition is a three-pound bag of Jose's 100% Columbia Supremo. Mmmmmm. Nice aroma! It's a medium roast, soft and mellow. No harsh aftertaste. It reminds me of Trader Joe's Columbia Supremo, and I understand that is just the government's grade for Columbia's finest. In any case, it's a nice coffee and I'll have no trouble getting through it. I might add, that I like to switch types from bag to bag and I've now tried coffees from all major growing areas of the world.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
