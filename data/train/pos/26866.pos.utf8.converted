I thought I'd have trouble going through a case of wild rice so I split it with a friend of mine.  I have a couple of recipes that use it and I was having trouble finding wild rice in my local grocery store.  This stuff is great.  I've got on the internet looking for new wild rice recipes for an excuse to use it some more.  The package size is nice so you don't have to open a big honking bag and hope it doesn't spill all over.  I won't have any problems using up a case when this one is gone.
