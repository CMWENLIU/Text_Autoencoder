LOVE this soup!  It is very rich and creamy, with only 80 calories per cup and 1 gram of fat.  It has no added MSG, it is non-dairy, preservative free, and it tastes as good as a gourmet soup from a five-star restaurant.  It is also specifically labeled "Gluten-free," which I need.<br /><br />Note:  Not all Imagine soups are gluten-free, so if you need gluten-free, check the individual labels.<br /><br />Enjoy!
