I switched to this food about 2 months ago because of the quality ingredients, but my cats have benifitted by by their new and healthy bodies! My fat cat has almost completely lost his giggly belly and my scrawny little boy has bulked up! I'm pretty sure it's the food, unless maybe they've started working out while I'm at work.
