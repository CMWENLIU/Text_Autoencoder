I've tried about every sun dried tomato product I can find locally. And these are by far the best.<br /><br />Far better than the imported brand at the big box store.<br /><br />For a different twist, make your own sun dried tomato in olive oil recipe, don't buy the pre-mixed variety at stores. Simply mix these with a little Newman's own olive oil and vinegar dressing, place in a container in the fridge and apply to pasta, salads, etc.. for a tangy tomato taste you'll rarely get with just pasta sauce alone.<br /><br />But then they are also wholly adequate, moist and tender right out of the package.
