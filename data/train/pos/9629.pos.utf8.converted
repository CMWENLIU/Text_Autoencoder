I bought two jars of this cayenne pepper for my grandpa, who uses cayenne pepper to make a squirrel-repellant blend of bird seed.  Works just as well as the overpriced retail brands from the supermarket.  This is the best price for bulk cayenne pepper I've seen, and it shipped exceptionally quickly.
