Around three years ago me, my college room mate Kenny, and my girlfriend went on a cross-country roadtrip to hang out in Kenny's uncle's condo at a ski resort during the summer.  Now, Kenny's uncle Rodney is a weird dude to be sure, and in retrospect we should have known something was up when he invited three college students to stay with him in the wilderness for a week, but at the time we were just excited for an adventure and a free place to stay.  It took us almost a whole day to find the play when we got nearby; it was in the middle of podunk nowhere and there was nobody to ask directions of because the ski resort was deserted during the summer.  By the time we got there it was already dark, but Rodney welcomed us and provided us with booze.  We were content until we realized that we were starving, that Rodney's condo was out of food, and we were all too smashed to go get any.  I was distraught until he assured me that "there would be plenty of food tomorrow," while discreetly watching Angela (my girlfriend) out of the corner of his eye.  Soon, we were all passed out in Rodney's guest rooms.  I distinctly remember Angela getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom (I assumed), and thought no more of it until I awoke at 4:00AM alone, and the bathroom was empty.  I went and found Kenny, and hungover and starving we went in search of the two missing members of our party.  It was dawn when we smelled it: an unearthly aroma wafting through the house and tempting our taste buds.  The smell got stronger as we approached the boiler room door in the basement.  We began to open the door when Suddenly Pasta Salad! The entire room was filled with it!<br /><br />We never saw Rodney or Angela again, but we visit that condo for the pasta salad in that delicious room every summer.
