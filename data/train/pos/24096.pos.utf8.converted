You might want to consider this wonderful product.  It is identical to the orange can except that it does not gel, which is perfect if you want to use in any beverage and not have it congeal.  I only bought one can, but noticed the results of less pain in my joints and stronger nails.  I just ordered it in bulk from the website because it's something we plan on taking forever.  The only downside is that you have to cut your nails more often.
