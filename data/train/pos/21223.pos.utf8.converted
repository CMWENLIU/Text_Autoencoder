I just bought this thai tea mix in hopes of using it for thai iced tea, and I am extremely thrilled with the results! I steeped a tablespoon of the tea in about 3/4 cup of water for quite a while (20ish minutes) to make it nice and strong, then mixed in a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk and a touch more sugar. I added in some ice and a bit of half and half and had a thai iced tea that was just as good as what I'd get in a restaurant! Truly delicious, and a pretty good deal too!
