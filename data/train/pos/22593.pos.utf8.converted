This is delicious - it's not like the usual "gourmet" kiwi jam where mostly you only taste a sugar gooyness with no hint of actual kiwi, this has the full texture and flavor of the yummy little fruits.  And trust me, I've tried MANY kiwi jams.  I am reordering these in large numbers because I tend to eat some of it straight from the jar - another plus is that it's not too sweet, but just right.  I think Barry Farms is really good at jams and preserves - all the ones I've tried have been fantastic and true to the fruit they actually contain.
