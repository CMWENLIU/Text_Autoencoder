I bought this to substitute for the cereal I loved because I wanted to lower my chlorestrol - and found it makes such good soft creamy oatmeal that it's my new favorite breakfast.  I sprinkle cinnamon in the bowl before adding the dry oatmeal, then add a handful of raisins or dried cranberries along with the oatmeal before pour water in and microwaving the whole thing (a little longer than recommended for a full serving - I find 2.22 minutes works best in my microwave).  Sprinkle on some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WKJW5Y">Ideal Brown No Calorie Sweetener</a> (xylitol-based and also gluten-free) or add a couple of squirts of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8WIAS">Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme Flavored Liquid Stevia, 2-Ounce Bottle</a> to the water you cook it in, and it makes a very healthy tasty breakfast.<br /><br />The oatmeal's great for cooking too - meatloaf, oatmeal cookies, etc.  This is the really good quick-cooking gluten-free oatmeal I've been looking for for a long time.  Nothing else I've tried comes close.<br /><br />P.S.  A year later, my chloresterol was down 35 points, too.
