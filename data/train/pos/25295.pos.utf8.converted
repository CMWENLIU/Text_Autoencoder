I had tasted these snacks for the first time in Nova Scotia and loved them so much that we brought some home with us. I found out that the company cannot sell them in the US so when I found these on Amazon I was delighted! They taste great, and are healthy for you, too! They were fresh and crisp and a very reasonable price.
