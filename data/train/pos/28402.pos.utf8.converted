I purchased this along with the Artisana Raw Organic Coconut Oil. After having tried about 4 other coconut oil/product brands, Artisana is BY FAR the BEST tasting. This butter is heavenly...it is hard so when you melt it you can spread it on apple slices, banana slices, on toast, or in between two cookies or two graham crackers...YUM! Plus, it offers the good fat from the coconut, along with fiber, amino acids, and minerals. Awesome. You will not be disappointed with this brand. P.S.- Artisana is an environmentally-friendly company, and uses only glass jars to store their oils and butters. Very important to purchase only glass jars with fats because they can oxidize quickly and can absorb things that leech out of plastic!
