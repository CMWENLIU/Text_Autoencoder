Have you ever been walking and heard a song on the radio and remembered something you thought long forgotten? Have you ever smelled something cooking that reminded you of growing up? Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind? Our five senses are the strongest triggers of memory that we as humans possess, and this Retro Candy basket from the 1970's takes full advantage of that to make a perfect gift for the person who has every gadget, trinket, and item they ever needed.<br /><br />Growing up in the 1970s (warning retro alert) I can remember going to the candy store and picking up some of the items in this basket. Laffy taffy, SO good, bubble gum cigs(probably not the best choice since I later smoked) Lemon and Cherry heads, and of course my personal favorite, Razzles! This basket has it all, and just reading the candy names sent me into a fit of nostalgia. Pixy Stix, Wonka Tart N Tiny, Sweetarts, Laffy Taffy, Bubble Gum Cigs, Candy Cigs, Apple Heads, Cherry Heads, Lemon Heads Small, Charms Sweet & Sour Pops, Sugar Daddy Pops, Atomic Fireballs, Boston Baked Beans, Tootsie Roll Midgees, Licorice Pipe, Necco Assorted Wafers, Bubble Gum Cigars, Wonka Runts, Fun Gum Wax Lips, Pop Rocks, Zotz, Reed's Root Beer Candy Rolls, Classic Now & Laters, Lemon Heads Large, Smile Pops, Jaw Breakers and Razzles Candy Gum. Everything the kid in you still desires, but never had enough dimes and nickles for.<br /><br />Be warned however, this cool box contains enough sugar to make a rhino hyper, and you run the risk of arousing your co-workers jealousy when you walk in the office with your Neccos and your Razzles. If you buy this for someone else, you will be highly tempted to devour the entire basket, and have to reorder more. There are several other sets in this product line, each with their own unique line-up, but for me, this is the one. What price do you put on memories? For this little trip down memory lane its $26.99, and the enjoyment is worth every penny. Now excuse me while I put in another order...<br /><br />A.G. Corwin<br />St.Louis, MO
