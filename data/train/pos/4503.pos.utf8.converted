I am a soda fan, and I order unique sodas from all over the place. I just love to try the neat regional sodas that you just can't get anywhere but a limited area. Moxie fits that bill, as it might not be found in the local grocery. Having heard about America's longest continually produced soda from 1884 for many years, I finally determined to try one. They say it takes nerve to drink a Moxie. I learned you can throw all of your normal conceptions of soda out the window when it comes to the taste of Moxie.<br /><br />It has less carbonation than most sodas, so some people think it goes flat fast. It is just that is has less fizz to begin with, and that is OK since too much fizz actually masks the flavor in many sodas. It also has much less sugar than most sodas, only 25 grams per 8 ounce serving rather than the 40 plus grams of most sodas. The flavor is spice, as in pepper - not Dr Pepper but peppery. It has a strong hot bite to it that some people say reminds them of medicine. It has a strong aftertaste. And that aftertaste stays with you for awhile, which is good if you like the flavor. I like Moxie better when I first taste it in my mouth as that is when the sweet part hits you, (it seems at first like Mr. Pibb) rather than a few seconds after I drink it until you get used to it. The taste is unusual enough that I hear New Englanders pride themselves on their ability to get used to the taste and like it. It is definitely an acquired taste. I myself noted that it tasted better the second day than the first, and the next day and so forth. Of course this is how we learn to like the taste of things like coffee. It is very dark like a cola, and it has caffeine. Today it is owned by Monarch in Atlanta, Georgia now. For another unusual but delicious regional soda at Amazon, try Cheerwine.
