I got this yesterday and so far it looks good, I've been using silica litter but even the cheap stuff is not that cheap and is fairly dusty, so I've been looking for an alternative and this seems to be it.  The silica works great for drying up odors until it gets pee saturated. I sprinkled at little of the old wet litter on the breeze litter and the cats used it right away.  The pee does drain through and the pads are good, they've used it quite a few times and the pad still feels dry.  I'm actually hoping they DON'T poop in it and continue to use the silica for that, then I'll have the best of both worlds, the poop will dry and the pee will be able to be gotten rid of so the expensive silica will last longer.<br /><br />After a week, still on the first pad and haven't noticed any odor problems.  Have 3 cats and left the silica so they are using both but they are using the breeze a lot.  Adding crystals or enzyme spray to the pad might stretch it's life out even longer.  They've pooped in the breeze too and I haven't noticed a smell but lots of pellets glue tight so I'm losing quite a few each time.  I'm used to the silica, which is much cleaner than clay or clumping and I haven't noticed any increased odor with the breeze.<br /><br />Changed the pad on the 8th day because, well really how far do you want to push it, and no sign of trouble.  It was HEAVY with no sign of leakage or deterioration  (I didn't really try to stress test it, but it came out of the tray and into the bag with no problem).
