The new Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger kit is fantastic! A one skillet meal that uses creamy Velveeta instead of powdered "cheese flavoring"? Awesome! I found this to be far superior to the similar Hamburger Helper flavor. While it IS rich, it makes a great, quick meal with a side salad.
