I have an iSi Twist and Sparkle Beverage Carbonating System and wanted to make a diet cola.  Most diet cola syrups on the market for home users use splenda and/or acesulfame K which I don't like the taste of.  I'm used to and prefer the aftertaste of aspartame or saccharine.  This was the only extract I could find that was unsweetened so I could try my own sweeteners.  I ordered the cola flavor from Jack's Country Store here on Amazon.<br /><br />I tried making the soda with both erythritol and saccharine (sugar twin).  I couldn't get the sweetness right with erythritol, but the Sugar Twin worked fine.  The extract flavor is between a cola and a rootbeer flavor.  I used the following mix: 3.5 cups water + 1 tsp cola extract + 1/4 cup Sugar Twin (if using erythritol use closer to 1/2 cup) and optionally, juice of a lime to boost the acidity and push the flavor closer to a cola and away from rootbeer.  You could also use a bit less extract and sugar twin, I like it a bit strong.
