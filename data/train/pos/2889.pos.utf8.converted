Breastmilk has sugar in it, it is why a lot of breastfed babies will refuse formula supplementing. Similic is a godsend for me as I can never feed exclusive breastmilk, I must supplement at least 2 oz. formula after each breastfeeding, even with pumping. We only drink organic milk b/c my husband is allergic to the pesticide they put in the feed of the cows and breaks out in a horrible rash when he drinks nonorganic milk, so for our baby we would not use any formula besides organic. That being said my son would not drink Earth's Best as it is not sweet like my milk is sweet, when we found Similac organic it was such a blessing as he finally would drink it no problem. Similac has put a lot of effort into helping Moms who cannot breastfeed, they listened and developed a product that tastes most like Moms milk. My son is 3 now and has no cavities at all.<br />We will use nothing else for baby girl coming soon and I came here to make sure I had some ordered this time before hand, I love the convenience of having formula, diapers and wipes delivered right to the door each month!
