ALL I CAN SAY IS OMG!THESE LITTLE TREATS ARE SO ADDICTIVE AND ONLY HAVE 10 GRAMS OF SUGAR IN NINE WAFERS!THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST TASTING WAFER COOKIES I HAVE EVER HAD AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME BEING ON A DIET, WOULD EAT THE WHOLE BAG IN ONE SITTING!I CAN'T QUITE DESCRIBE THE FLAVOR EXCEPT TO SAY IT IS LIGHT, RICH AND NOT TOO SWEET.I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON, JUST FROM MY LOCAL HEALTH FOOD MARKET.BUT THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS CHEAPER COMPARED TO BUYING IT LOCALLY WHERE I AM.
