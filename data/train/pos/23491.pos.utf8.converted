I've been buying these at Sams for years. Was at Sams today to get more and they no longer carry them - just some cheap version that my dog will devour in minutes.  My dog loves these, last several days as he only chews in them in the evening when bored and they don't end up all over the floor in pieces like the cheap dollar store kind. I won't buy these here because of the high cost. 5 stars because of the quality but this price is unreal.
