If you're looking for a sweet hot cocoa this probably isn't the product for you.  If you are a true dark chocolate lover in a every sense of the word this is a must have!  I wasn't sure what to expect at first and I must admit I still wasn't sure about it taking my first few sips but it didn't take long before I was hooked!  I drink it unsweetened but you can add sugar or substitute if you'd like.  The best part about it is that it kills my chocolate cravings!!  I'm such a junk-food-aholic at night so I drink a cup or two after dinner and late at night and have NO desire to shove candy bars and cupcakes down my throat.  It's extremely high in antioxidants and very low in calories. It's pure chocolate and it just makes you feel good.
