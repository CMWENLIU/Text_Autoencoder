This is the product you will find on the grocery shelves in the supermarkets in South Africa.  Having lived there for a number of years and traveling there frequently, I always try to bring back a couple of boxes of this.  If you haven't tried Rooibos tea, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.  It is a robust tea with no caffeine.  Most people drink it hot with a little sweetner and maybe a little lemon, but it also makes a great iced tea.
