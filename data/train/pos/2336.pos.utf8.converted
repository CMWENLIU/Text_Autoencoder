I was prepared to hate this kit as a gimmick.  But I was blown away and have to consider it to produce something superior to other kits and even to most restaurants.<br />As I was eating the butter chicken, I noted more flavor than I am used to, almost an overuse of cloves...which is not exactly a bad thing.  The result was butter chicken at home, at basically half the cost of going to the restaurant.  The texture was spot on, unlike the goopy or stringy stuff other at home kits produced.<br />As an indian food enthusiast who is normally competent in the kitchen but out of his league cooking the stuff, I can only imagine how good it will be for someone who can hack the recipe (like coconut milk instead of half and half? adding something to counteract the clove?)While the rice could have been spiced up too, it was a good amount of rice and therefore an appropriate addition to the kit.<br />The trick is that instead of one tub of goop added to the meat, there's three different stages of flavor insertion.<br />So yeah, I am going to be trying other products from these people.
