Because it has MSG.  People are vastly over-concerned about MSG: it's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff, apparently.  Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food, and it's all over our food too (anything made with bouillon, for example).<br /><br />This is the best mayo.  It makes everything it touches delicious.  Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything, and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo (ie, for fat and cholesterol reasons, but msg concerns).<br /><br />Try this, you'll be hooked.
