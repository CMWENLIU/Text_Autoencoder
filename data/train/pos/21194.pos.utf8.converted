I love this soup so much, that I used my gift cards to get it.  And for those of you on weight watcher's, it's only 1 delicious point. I like to eat it with a grilled cheese sandwich or good tasting crackers.  I love the taste and the fact that I don't have to feel guilty when I eat it.  Make sure to simmer it on the stove, verses the microwave. I think it taste's better simmered.
