I've been using Vacu Vin's previous model for years and have been happy with it.  The one downside of the earlier offering was that wine lovers never knew when a vacuum was achieved.  I used to overpump just to make sure the wine-damaging oxygen was out of the bottle.<p>I got this model in Napa a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.  It's a nice refinement.<p>The only downside over the previous model is that it won't work with the marinating device sold separately because the bottom is configured differently from the earlier model.
