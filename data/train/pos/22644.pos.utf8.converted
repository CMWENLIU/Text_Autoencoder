My daughter gasped so loudly when I opened the box of Angry Birds Fruit Snacks that I thought she had gotten a large paper cut.  She then held the box up to better see these wonders of modern molded fruit goodness, and said, "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"<br /><br />After opening a package and tasting them, she declared them delicious and immediately started sharing them with her (equally dramatic) group of tween friends... which means I need to order another box.  The fruit snacks are soft and flavored well, but the real genius was marketing them with the adorable Angry Birds.  :)<br /><br />Since my daughter and her friends enjoyed these snacks so much, I will recommend them to others!
