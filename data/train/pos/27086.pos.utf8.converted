Someone served this at a dinner party long before I knew I should be eating gluten-free, and it was delicious - the same great taste as regular pasta but without the starchy fullness.  Now it's all I serve, even to guests, and some of them have begun eating it, although they could eat regular pasta if they desired.  This just tastes so good!  For those of us who DO have to eat gluten-free, it's a God-send.  All the pastas in this brand are just as good.  Try them!
