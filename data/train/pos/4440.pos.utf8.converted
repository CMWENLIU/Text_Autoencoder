Our family has started to dig into various Cheesy Skillet meals by Velveeta, and this one has become our favorite.<br /><br />The preparation for this meal couldn't have been any simpler...just follow the instructions on the box and you're good to go. Within 15 minutes, your senses will be on cheese overload.<br /><br />I've uploaded some pictures into the "Customer Images" section - not an easy task, because I wanted to dive right into this meal instead of taking pictures of it!<br /><br />The cheese was delicious, there were noodles aplenty, and it provided a very hearty meal. I could only finish 2 servings before I was stuffed.<br /><br />If you serve this with a side dish of vegetables, you'll have yourself one smiling family.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
