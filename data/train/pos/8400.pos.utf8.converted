Although the cocoa powder itself makes wonderful chocolate desserts with a superior chocolate taste, it is not worth the price. For the same price, you can get almost three lbs of ghirardhelli cocoa powder, which tastes decent enough. Valrhona is nice to have but I just don't feel like it was worth the hassle and expense. Ghirardhelli works good enough for me. Other than cost, Valrhona is very good! If you can justify the cost it is delicious.
