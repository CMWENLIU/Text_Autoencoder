Years ago,I was introduced to Barry's Gold Blend Tea by a priest from Ireland. Members of his family would ship it to him and he made some for me. It is simply the best tea in the world. This was before you could get a lot of products online and when I went off to college I had to live without it. I am delighted to now be able to have it shipped right to my door.
