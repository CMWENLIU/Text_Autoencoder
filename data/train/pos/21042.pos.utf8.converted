I picked this tea up just out of curiosity at my local supermarket in the international foods section.  Wow!  I'm not a major tea afficianado or anything but this tea is superb.  I have never tasted an "over the counter" supermarket tea like this before.  Celestial Seasonings, Twinnings, Nestea ... all crap compared to this!  Nice smooth, mellow yet bold taste.  A nice deep golden color.  I drink mine straight, but with milk its good too.<br /><br />I had my mother try some and she laughed at my astonishment about how good this tea is.  She said, "well you know how the British are about their tea, don't you?"  I guess I didn't know -- I sure know now!!<br /><br />Great great tea!  Superb, really.
