I have a son with multiple life threatening food allergies, and these cookies are a life-saver. I don't know how many times I've pulled out this mix to make cookies to decorate at school parties, etc. Actually, last year I used multiple boxes to make over 200 cut-out Christmas cookies for a school and church party. No one knew or could tell that these were "special" cookies, and we used Cherrybrook Kitchen Vanilla icing (colored) and sprinkles to do the whole "Christmas Cookie" thing. These are perfect!
