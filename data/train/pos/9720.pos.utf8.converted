Agave is very sweet and very mild, like corn syrup. If I have fruit that is a little bitter, I cut it up and put it in a bowl and then use 1/2 tbsp of agave for the whole bowl - stir well. The fruit loses the bitterness.<br /><br />The best about agave is that it will dissolve in cold liquids. So, if your iced tea is not sweet enough, a squirt of agave will dissolve in it. No stirring forever trying to get sugar or honey to dissolve.<br /><br />I use this instead of corn syrup in my cooking. I make sweet tea with it. It is very sweet and you don't need to use a lot. This is an excellent sweetener.
