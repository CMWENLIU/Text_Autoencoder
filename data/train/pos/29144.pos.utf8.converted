PRE-PRE-REVIEW WARNING:<br /><br />This is a serious review, unlike some of my recent spoof efforts.<br /><br />PRE-REVIEW WARNING:<br /><br />Don't order this here. While it has apparently been a regional release, many large retailers (including Target) have carried it on and off since 2009. And from recent accounts, Pepsi is going to leave it on the shelves even longer now (see article in Comments section below.) So check locally first. My Super Target carries exactly this 12-pack for three to four dollars. Compare with the thirty-five bucks (including exorbitant shipping) some Amazon merchants are trying to get!<br /><br />On to the review. I will keep it short, because the important thing is that old fashioned Mountain Dew (labeled "Throwback" just like "Heritage" for Dr. Pepper) tastes much better with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Less harsh and more enjoyable. If you drank Mountain Dew prior to the sugar switch back in the mid 1980s, you will almost surely prefer this. For younger drinkers only accustomed to fake sugar, who knows? Their taste buds may have been irreparably harmed. LOL<br /><br />It doesn't come in moonshine jugs, but at least you get Willy the Hillbilly on the cans. One recent tweak is that orange juice concentrate is back in the formula. I didn't catch the initial 2009 Throwback release but evidently it was missing the OJ. I would be curious to try this retro brew in glass bottles, but since I don't recall doing so even when I was younger, it's not a dealbreaker like it might have been for Coke (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GIZRY">Coca Cola, 11.5 oz.</a>).
