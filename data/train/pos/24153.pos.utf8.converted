The effects of Trivedi Water continue to amaze me. My son contracted "pink eye" and also complained that his eye was hurting.  I had him put some of the water on his eye several times throughout the day and had him drink a full bottle as well. By the next morning, the pain had gone away and the eye had cleared up considerably.  By night time, the "pink eye" had completely cleared up.<br />Also, my son had accidently poured a half bottle of Trivedi Water in one of our house plants.  That plant has been growing like crazy - I've had it for years and it had never grown like this!
