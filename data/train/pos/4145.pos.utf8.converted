This is pricey but hard-to-find these days.  It used to be possible to buy inexpensive edible gold and silver leaf (vark) in Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays with importing it.  So I was very happy to find this on Amazon.  Great for making a big impression by gilding a whole cake!  It's not hard and you don't need too many leaves.  Just carefully slide them off the paper leaves onto the cake, then smooth using a brush (a cosmetic type brush works well).  It won't be perfectly smooth, but good enough, and it'll wow whomever you're serving the cake to!  They're not likely to have seen something like this before.  Obviously this would be great for a golden wedding anniversary cake!!!
