My cat is 13 years old and didn't move around as well as he used to. A friend of mine had great results taking human glucosamine and chondroitin supplements. We looked at the natural supplements available- and there was no way that my cat was going to let me give him pills everyday, unless I wanted to be shredded and bit(he is a bit feisty about meds). These treats, given only 3 small ones a day are the perfect answer. He will jump on my lap to get to these, he loves them (and he is kinda picky). He does seem to be moving a lot better these days.
