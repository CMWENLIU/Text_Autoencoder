I can still remember drinking Sioux City Sarsaparilla as a kid, and its just as good as I remember it. I miss the original bottles with the bas relief cowboy on his horse, but I can live without that as long as I get that original taste. Its hard to get a hold of, but if  you grew up with it, its worth tracking some down.
