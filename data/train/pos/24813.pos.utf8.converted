We, too, have had a difficult time finding this outstanding soup.<br />In the hopes of increasing product demand, we are willing to share our recipe for the best scalloped potatoes you will EVER eat.  Cream of Onion is a vital ingredient.  There is NO substitute.<br /><br />1 Can - Campbells Cream of Onion Soup<br />7 - Large White Potatoes (Peeled and Sliced)<br />*Note:  Potatoes should not be sliced uniformly.  Some should be significantly thicker than others, with the thickest being about 1/4 of an inch.<br />1 - 12 oz. Can - Evaporated Milk<br />9 to 12 slices of WHITE American Cheese<br />*Note:  This cheese should be purchased at your grocer's deli counter.<br />Do not use pre-packaged "singles."  Also, do not use orange American cheese.  Clearfield, Land O Lakes, or ShurFine brands work nicely.<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Position rack in center of oven.<br />Line bottom of oven with oven liner or tin foil in case of dripping.<br /><br />Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 3 or 4 quart casserole or baking pan.<br /><br />In large measuring cup or bowl, whisk together the soup and the evaporated milk.<br /><br />Layer ingredients into greased pan as follows:<br /><br />Small amount of milk/soup mixture - just enough to coat bottom of pan.<br /><br />1/3 of Potatoes in a single layer<br />3 or 4 slices of White American Cheese<br />1/3 of remaining milk/soup mixture<br /><br />Repeat layers until all ingredients are used.<br />Cover tightly with aluminum foil.  (I use "release" non-stick foil, but any will do.)<br />Bake for 1 hour.  Remove foil and return to oven for approximately 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly on top.<br /><br />Potatoes will need to sit about 15 minutes before serving.<br /><br />Enjoy!  And please share this recipe.  We'd like to keep this soup on the market!
