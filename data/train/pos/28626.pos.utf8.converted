I bought this sugar to use in my water kefir sodas and it makes my kefir grains so happy. They are going crazy!!!  They are reproducing like crazy and bouncing all over the jar!!!  They did not even get close to soda fizzy with other sugar but it is so fizzy I have to watch the fermenting time to be sure there are no explosions.  Great stuff and great on cream of wheat and grits. Kids even like it.
