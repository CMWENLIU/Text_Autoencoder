I can't believe I am the first to review this great product.<br /><br />We have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM4JLC">Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula with Iron, 25.75-Ounce Canister</a> (which is also a great product) up until our little started showing signs of lactose intolerance. After consulting with the pediatrician, we started searching for a suitable alternative.<br /><br />Whilst Soy formulas are being offered as the "lactose free" alternative by many, our first preference was "non-soy" alternative. We also wanted a natural & organic product, free of those nasty chemicals and ingredients. After a considerable amount of research and shopping around, we found this was the best choice out in the market that was both lactose free and natural/organic.<br /><br />Our little one also took to this formula very well and doing a lot better on this formula.
