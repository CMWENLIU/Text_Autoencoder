In April of last year our cat was diagnosed with diabetes.  Our vet started him on insulin twice a day and asked that we bring him in for testing once a month.  This didn't sound right to me because a human diabetic tests almost every day.  We asked permission to self test.  We started testing him in the morning and at night before feeding him. By using the Wellness Core Cat food with its lack of grain and high protein content his blood sugar readings began to come down.  We found that we slowly had to reduce his insulin.  He has now been off of insulin for three months.  We still test him once a week but he is now a good weight, he has no dandruff and his coat is glossy.  He also has far more energy.<br />Winnie's Mom
