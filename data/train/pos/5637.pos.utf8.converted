My cat had been diagnosed as diabetic. After freaking out and learning how to home test blood glucose levels, a vet recommended that I switch his diet to all wet food and if possible a grain free (low carb) one. Most over the counter food has lots of starchy fillers and grains, particularly dry food. I decided on Wellness. A month and a half later, my cat is off insulin. He loves this stuff. His coat is like silk and he has the agility and mood of a cat much younger than his 13 years. He's gained back 2.25 of the pounds he lost at the height of his diabetes and is doing well. It's pricier than I'd like, but the health of my furry friend is worth it.
