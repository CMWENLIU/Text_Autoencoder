In the past this product was only sold through health food stores at around 7.00 a can. As soon as you open it - the mild delicate aroma, even color and an all around sense of freshness. Other companies make premium tuna's - they are better than the regular issue but this product is beyond the usual premium. This is among the best. Often our animals sense quality - my Cat will only eat this tuna. He turns down the 'Gold' cans from the other famous brands.
