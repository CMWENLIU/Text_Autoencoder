I had heard of gelato, but had never tried it, so when I saw it was available on Amazon I thought I would give it a shot.  They offer free overnight shipping since it's frozen, and it arrived in a styrofoam cooler packed with chunks of dry ice. I've tried plenty of different kinds of ice cream over the years, but this stuff is by far the best I have ever had.  Every flavor was great, but my favorites were the dark chocolate and vanilla bean. I will definitely be buying more!
