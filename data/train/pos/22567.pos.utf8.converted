Kernel Seasons products are terrific. They have both sweet and savory flavors, and Caramel is the best of the sweet flavors. Try mixing it with their Apple Cinnamon flavor- its like a candy apple! Glad that that Caramel and White Cheddar (which is wonderful on vegetables as well as popcorn) are available with Amazon Prime shipping, which makes this an unbeatable deal. You can get all the flavors at the Kernel Seasons site 10 for $30 with free shipping, so don't pay the unbelievably high prices for some of the other flavors I saw here on Amazon.
