I read the label and it seemed to be a healthy and nutritious food , especially in that it is an organic food. Figuring organic food is pretty scarce when it comes to pets.<br /><br />I had originally bought this after the wheat gluten poison scare on the news.<br /><br />Anyway, my cat (one who will not eat dry foods) got very excited just by the smell of it. She loved it and since then I still buy it. Since it costs more and I have more than one cat and its pricier than other canned cat foods, I do alternate with other brands.
