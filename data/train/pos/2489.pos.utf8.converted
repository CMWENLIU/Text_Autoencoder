Grapeseed oil is high in mono-unsaturated fats.  It's almost tasteless (which is a good thing sometimes) and has a high smoke point.  This oil lends itself to flavoring with other ingredients (like chili pepper, truffles or spices).  Overall, I'm a big fan of grapeseed oil because of it's neutral flavor and this product does not disappoint me.
