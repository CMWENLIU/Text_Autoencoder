The chocolate is smooth and rich, the ginger bits are crunchy and lively-tasting - what more would one want from a bar named as this is?  For me, I'd actually give it 4.8 stars, because the ginger could be a little more potent - but that is indeed a minor quibble.  Note the bar is labeled for 3 servings - I've been able to limit myself to 1/4 of one each day.
