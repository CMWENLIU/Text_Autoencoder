I do quite a bit of baking, and when a recipe calls for milk, I usually add dry milk powder to the dry ingredients and then add water for the liquid. Over the years, I've tried many different dry/instant milks. This is the best!<br /><br />The convenient pouch is resealable, and easy to open wide enough to insert a measuring cup. To me, that is preferable for measuring over a small pour spout. The milk powder itself is silky in texture, and dissolves quickly. It doesn't seeem to lump and clump like many do. The flavor is excellent, like all Organic Valley products.<br /><br />While I don't personally reconstitute dry milk for drinking by the glass, for those who do, this could be a good choice due to the ease in dissolving and the fine flavor.<br /><br />Because the seal is quite secure, it is also more shelf stable than most. This has earned an ongoing place in my pantry.
