This is a new hobby for me and it has been fun roasting my own coffee beans with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BLIDD8">Toastess TCP-388 Hot-Air Popcorn Maker</a>. I have tried just a few deferent types but so far I think this is one of my favorite so far. I have been experimenting with roasting times leaning toward dark French roast 13.5min/sec @ 497
