VELVEETA CHEESE has been around a long time.  I'm a "baby boomer", and<br />I can't remember a time when it wasn't on store shelves.  I suppose that's one big bonus that comes along with this yummy cheese....it bridges generations, and allows two...or maybe even three, (or more!) generations of a family to talk about what THEY did with, and used, Velveeta for, when they were growing up...and in various stages of growing up!<br /><br />The taste hasn't changed....at least, not that I can tell.  Looking at the ingredients, though, I notice that colby cheese -- which I do remember once being listed amongst the ingredients -- is no longer there. Also, (and this is from Velveeta I got in the supermarket, where I believe<br />the turnover is faster than at Amazon.com....although I can't be sure) -- anyway, the Velveeta I got from the supermarket seems a bit less yellow, a bit more white-ish, than the Velveeta I got previously from Amazon....and the Velveeta I had as a child.  I suspect from this that perhaps Kraft Foods -- makers of Velveeta -- are now adding more milk to the cheese, to keep the price as low as it is?  Looking at the ingredients, I can't see where adding more milk, (or more of something else that makes the cheese whiter), would lower the production costs....but then what do I know?  All I DO know is that Velveeta Cheese...though it tastes the same, is a bit whiter than before.  The pretty orangy-yellow colour is still there....but lighter...  The cheese also seems the teensiest bit less firm than it used to be....  I surely hope that Kraft returns to at least the last previous version of Velveeta, (firmer, yellower, but without Colby), before the newer version I detected in the supermarket reaches Amazon.  (Or could it be that Kraft makes two versions...one for supermarkets, and one for Amazon?)  Whatever the situation, I would like strongly to entreat Kraft to make a "Deluxe Velveeta" version -- the original Velveeta as I remember it from the 1950s: very yellow, much, much firmer, and using Colby cheese as one of the ingredients!  With a price midway between "modern" Velveeta, and "natural" cheeses, (perhaps on a par price with Kraft Deluxe American Cheese....or perhaps even a LITTLE higher -- and the words "ORIGINAL Velveeta Cheese Formula" on the package....it is sure to be a hit with all 21st century Velveeta fans...as well as those, like me, who remember it from the 1950s.  (Maybe there was even a version before the 1950s?  If so, please let THAT version be labeled "The Original Velveeta Cheese"....I know I'd be very eager to try it!<br /><br />That aside, it still tastes exactly the same as always -- at least to my palate, which remembers only as far back as the 1950s.  I have recently  heard from a friend,  that many people are "down" on Velveeta cheese --saying it's not real cheese.  OK -- it's not 100% natural cheese...additives have been, er...added.  But then the same is true of "Kraft Cheese", and many cheeses of Bordon and other manuacturers as well.  To get "natural" cheese, one always must pay a premium...and to get "organic natural" cheese, one finds it more expensive still.  (To get a middle-price, I bought "Kraft Deluxe American" Cheese from Amazon, recently. It was firmer, and had more natural ingredients.  But that wonderful, Velveeta TASTE was not there.  The Kraft Deluxe American Cheese, for all it's other virtues, had a flat taste, compared with the slightly-tangy, delicious flavour of Velveeta.  Although I might buy Kraft Deluxe American Cheese in the future, I will probably buy a LOT more Velveeta!<br /><br />And yes...Velveeta still melts...wonderfully! Just cut it in a few pieces, (no tiresome grating, as with other cheeses), and it will melt almost instantly!  (But the decreased firmness in the cheese, now, makes grating it -- for the "purists" who want even Velveeta to melt as fast as possible -- somewhat too easy: it falls apart too quickly during the grating process!<br /><br />I notice, on the end of the Velveeta package, an invitation to try two other varieties of the cheese: Velveeta 2% Milk, and Velveeta Pepper Jack.<br />Is the Pepper Jack variety the same as the "Mexican" variety was a few years ago?  I see no mention o "Mexican" Velveeta on the package, and do remmber having it once, and finding it delicious -- but it was a while back, and I don't remember the flavour, exactly.  Is the new "Pepper Jack" variety the same, or different?<br /><br />Velveeta Cheese, I find, is great for sandwiches!  And it makes a pretty good 'macaroni and cheese' dish, too.  However, I must here admit that the BEST 'mac and cheese' I ever had was when I used 'Kraft Cracker Barrel' Cheddar Cheese with macaroni.  (Just like Velveeta, the Kraft Cracker Barrel Cheese comes wrapped in foil. This is perhaps more imporant with 100% natural cheddar cheese, (as Cracker Barrel Cheese is), because cheddar cheese dries up a LOT faster, even in the refrigerator, than Velveeta does.)  But for everyday sandwhiches....and even for fondu...Kraft Velveeta Cheese is more than adequate...and more than totally yummy!<br /><br />It is also better, and more economical, I think, to buy Velveeta, or any other cheese, (or anything else), by itself, and NOT in a combination -- such as "Velvetta Cheese and Shells Dinner", (or ready-made, canned or foil-bagged tuna salad, for that matter.)  Even if one is REALLY pressed for time in the morning, it's still cheaper to make mac-and-cheese, or anything else, by one's self, and not have it pre-packaged. (Healthier, too.)  Some great memories can be made by making all the sandwiches, or mac-and-cheese portions, the family needs, on Saturdays and Sundays.  Then -- if a surprise is wanted -- wrap up each sandwich in aluminum foil, WITHOUT labeling them, (except for maybe people's names, so everyone will get their favouriteS).  I like Velveeta and tomato, and also salmon, and also tuna sandwiches.  So, I pick one of the aluminum foil wrapped sandwhiches from the freezer, (with only my name on it) in the morning.  By lunchtime, the sandwich has thawed out...and I'm delightfully surprized by what it is!  (The Velveeta package says, "For best results, avoid freezing"...but, wrapped in aluminum foil, for only 24-hours, to at most, a week, I have found the flavour doesn't vary very much at all.)<br /><br />The ingredients in Velveeta are:<br />  Milk<br />  Water  Salt<br />  Whey  Calcium Phosphate<br />  Milk Protein Concentrate  Lactic Acid<br />  Milkfat  Sorbic Acid as a preservative<br />  Whey Protein Concentrate  Sodium Alginate<br />  Sodium Phosphate  Sodium Citrate<br /><br />CONTAINS 2% OR LESS OF<br />  Salt<br />  Calcium Phosphate<br />  Lactic Acid<br />  Sorbic Acid as a preservative<br />  Sodium Alginate<br />  Sodium Citrate<br />  Enzymes<br />  Apocaratenal (Colour)<br />  Annato (Colour)<br />  Cheese Culture<br /><br />A "chemical feast"?  Not quite -- many natural ingredients, as you can see, are (also) included.<br /><br />(These ingredients are from a package of Velveeta I recently bought in the Supermarket.  The ingredients in the Velveeta boght from Amazon JUST MIGHT differ...slightly. Because, as I've mentioned, I suspect that this product, and most others, more more quickly off store-shelves than they do here at Amazon -- because many people either haven't discovered the wonderful convenience of shopping at Amazon, or don't yet have their own personal computers, and so the time to make careful shopping choices, (rather difficult when limited to 20 minutes at a library's computer.)  So, buy the "older" version at Amazon, if you can...I may be wrong, but I suspect that the formula for Velveeta has changed once again....and the newer one, (now mostly at supermarkets), is less firm, and less yellow in color, than the one I bought here, online.....<br /><br />But all in all, Velveeta -- any Velveeta -- with it's penchant for bringing generations together, its delicious, slightly piquant. taste, its wonderful, (and perhaps too good) quality of 'meltability', and 'spreadability'...all add up to a true "American Classic".  It would be great, as I have said for KRAFT to bring back "Original" formula Velveeta, (including the Colby Cheese)....but even now, Velveeta tastes JUST as I remember it.  So, one needn't go to a memorabilia store, and spend hundreds, and perhaps thousands of dollars, in an attempt to bring back the "good old days".<br />Just go to your local supermarket, (and/or go to Amazon.com!), and buy and eat VELVEETA Cheese!  Your taste-buds will remember...and so will you!<br /><br />5 stars....and 100 yum-yums, (or as many yum-yums as the number of eyars Velveeta has been around!)  : )'
