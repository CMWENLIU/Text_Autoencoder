I had been interested in acquiring an ibrik ever since my first cup of Turkish coffee at Dilettante in Seattle. For some reason I never got around to making the purchase. Well, this was the year I treated myself, and I'm pretty happy with my purchase. This set includes everything that you need to start developing your skill with the ibrik. (And it does take a few tries to get it right.)<br /><br />The ibrik that comes with the set is a nice size for making coffee for one or two, and has a nice brass finish. The coffee samples are fun to play with and a nice introduction to the different ways in which this style of coffee is prepared (and here I mean the different spices or flavors which might be ground with the coffee beans). Finally, the cups are a nice way to serve it and match the size of the ibrik very well.<br /><br />Tip: I found that I needed to scrub the inside of the ibrik to get it clean before its first use, which would have been very difficult if I hadn't had an old baby bottle brush laying around.
