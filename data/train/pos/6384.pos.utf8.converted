This was an impulse buy after fruitlessly searching my local organic food stores (and non-organic stores too) for many weeks trying to find affordable dark (at least 70% cocoa), sugar-free chocolate. Not an easy task! Saw this item on Amazon, whom I always turn to when solutions seem slim, and ordered it immediately... the previous reviews looked good...<br /><br />The "tiny tabs" are just the right bite-size so I don't have to whack a big bar into smithereens to have a small portion. The 3-pound size lasts for a good while in the fridge. The mouth-feel is excellent and the taste is just as good as sugary chocolate. I'm happy! Gotta have my dark chocolate! When can I order some more, Amazon! Don't fail me now!!!!
