I buy K-Cups for my office place, and was so tired of hearing my co-workers complain about lack of variety and flavor choices. I have tried many sampler pack and was dissappointed that i ended up with many of the same flavors. Finally i spotted this little gem of a product. I am able to pick which K-Cups I want from an extensive list. I got a box of Flavor/Teas & a box of Regular Joe and I couldnt be happier. No longer will i have to hear "I dont like this flavor... why do we have 10 of them". I will let everyone of my co-workers and any one I know who has a Keurig machine about this product. It came well packed, fast, and was exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />MUST BUY!!!!!
