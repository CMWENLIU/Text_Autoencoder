First off, I am not going to compare this with "fresh" or block cheese: that would be, at once, disingenuous and arrogant.<br /><br />This is grated Parmesan in a cannister. I use it in any number of pasta, pizza, salad, soup, sauce, (spaghetti, pizza, Mornay, e.g.) meatloaf, vegetable, and any other recipe/dish to which I want to add Parmesan. Does it work for me? Yes! Does it's $3.50 a pound cost beat paying anywhere from 3-10 times the cost (depending on the quality) for block Parmesan? It does for me. Am I able to differentiate between the taste of different qualities of Parmesan in a pizza or spaghetti sauce? Of course not: there are too many competing spices. (I also would not use Dom P&eacute;rignon to make mimosas for the same reason.)<br /><br />I should think that Kraft Grated Parmesan would satisfy any humble palate and purse.<br /><br />Ed<br /><br />01/11/2012 UPDATE: When I wrote my review, this item cost $21.00 or $3.50 a pound; it's now $60 or $10.00 a pound. My local WalMart sells the pound canister for $5.50 so I cannot imagine why anyone would purchase this from Amazon at the current price.
