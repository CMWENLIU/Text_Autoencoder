I'm a repeat customer. After the success I had with the first round of fortune cookies last year, I decided to order more cookies for the night of the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympics. A representative of Greenfire and I worked together and came up with 60 different Olympics-related fortunes and I ordered three pounds of them. My staff loved them. I brought them to a meeting at the start of the day, and we spent almost as much time reading the fortunes to each other as we spent working. After the meeting, I left them out for the staff go nibble away at, and by the end of the night, all three pounds were gone. I got a kick out of hearing my staff laughing at the fortunes we came up with. Two successful rounds of fortunes, and I plan on being back for a third round.
