the quality  of the product is great! The metallic wrapping will keep it fresh forever.<br />I suffer from migraines, and this has been the only thing that helps, it beats any over the counter<br />and prescription meds. I take one teaspoon with 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper and within 15 minutes my pain is gone<br />also works wonders on my joints and muscle pain.<br />now I'm a believer on natural remedies, I was by far the most skeptical person, and had long arguments with my brother about it! I will only believe in what the doctor will prescribe, and was I wrong!!!<br />if you suffer from headaches or arthritis give this a try!! it does not taste bad at all.
