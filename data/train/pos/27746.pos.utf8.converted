I purchase Merrick Flossies regularly for my two Westies as well share them with my "dog park friends" of various sizes, breeds! I have not known one dog who refused such addicting treat! Larger breeds would normally woof this size of Flossie down in a few minutes while the smaller breeds much longer.
