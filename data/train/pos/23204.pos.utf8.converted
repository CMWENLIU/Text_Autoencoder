I first tasted this bouillon when I was in the hospital in December.  I was hospitalized for dehydration after surgical complications.  I had been unable to eat any solid food.  When the nurse brought in this hot broth, it was like pure ambrosia!  The aroma is delightful.  The bouillon reconstitutes into a savory, rich broth - not watery or flavorless.  I was unable to find it at stores around here so found it on Amazon!  YAY!!  I have since used not only as a wonderful beverage, but in soups, gravies and cooking.  It adds wonderful flavor and dimension to my cooking.  This will be the ONLY bouillon I will be using from now on.  You will love this product!
