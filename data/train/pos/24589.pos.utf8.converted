If you're reading this, you're like me: you've got an ant problem. I've tried all the slow-acting poisons designed to "kill the entire colony" and met with varying degrees of success, but if you really want to keep ants out of your house to begin with, this is a great start. I'm a little wary of using it indoors, especially if you have pets, but trust me, it will kill almost instantly, and it will keep killing for a long time. Spread just a thin layer of this stuff around the perimeter of your house, and those ants will not be crossing that line of dust. It's just that simple. You may still need to take other measures if you have an infestation inside (I had decent success with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQT5IG">Combat Ant Killing Gel 27grams</a>), but this product is a very good first step.
