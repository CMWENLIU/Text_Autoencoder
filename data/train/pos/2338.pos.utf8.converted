I took a chance; it was the first time I tried a kit wine ( I make mine from fuit etc.).  This wine is sooo good my wife and I were constantly testing it before it was finished clarifing.  It makes 6 gallons but after all the tasting we only were able to bottle about 4 gallons.  This is great fruity tasting and refreshing wine.  If you don't want your kit I'll buy it from you.  Our stock is running low.
