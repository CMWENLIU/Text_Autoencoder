I like almost everything about this product, so I'll start with the positives. Firstly, the packaging is pretty, even the can and the salt/pepper packets. It's a good size if you're not super duper hungry - it's the exact size I prefer my lunches to be. It's also a good size for a late-night snack. It tastes GREAT. Seriously, it's weird that something with so few ingredients could have this much flavor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fat and calories for this product make it something I can't enjoy very often. I imagine a lot of the fat comes from the olive oil, which does taste lovely but is too much for me. For one very small serving you get 5g of fat and 170 calories. You're likely to eat the entire thing as it's quite small, so that's 10g of fat and 340 calories which is just too much for this amount of food.<br /><br />But - if you're not concerned about that, I say try it...you'll probably love it.
