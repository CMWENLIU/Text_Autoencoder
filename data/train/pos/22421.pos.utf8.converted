I purchased 2 sets of 36 to use for a movie package with Secret Santa gifts. These popcorn packets come individually wrapped with the Orville Redenbacher's box picture/logo on the celophane. They also have nutritional information on each packet. They are a 3.3 oz package. I am very impressed. They look like something you would buy out of a vending machine or at a convenience store. Great gifting product!
