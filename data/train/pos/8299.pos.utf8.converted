I tried this at a demo and it was awesome but when I made it myself it was watered down tasting. I called Dolce Gusto to complain and it turns out that the glass they show on the side of the box to make it in isn't the latte glass it looks like. That's a 7 oz. glass, and the latte glass that ships with the machine is 8 oz. The other glass isn't available as yet. That's why it tasted watered down. If you use the latte glass just add about a 1/2" or so less of each capsule and it should be fine.<br /><br />The Dolce Gusto folks should have mentioned this on the box as I'm sure many have made the same error not knowing it's a different glass. It does look like the latte glass but if you look closer it's not as tall. Since it's an easy error to make I wanted to mention it here.
