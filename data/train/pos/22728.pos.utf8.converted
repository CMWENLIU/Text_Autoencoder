I have a hectic job that doesn't often allow me a lunch break so Dr. McDougall's products work out great for me. I follow a high protein diet and this Black Bean soup is loaded with both fiber and protein without sacrificing taste. Just add boiling or very hot water and you can easily eat it at your desk as it takes up about as much space as a large coffee mug. Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet. There is minimal flavor change and a decrease (even though it may be slight) in sodium. I heartily recommend this soup for not only those on the go, but also for those who enjoy great soups.
