How can you not love the Twinkie?  It's compact, delicious, and aerodynamic.  If you actually look at the ingredients, Twinkies are made of flour, water, shortening, eggs, sugar... sound familiar?  It's cake.  There are some preservatives added to increase shelf life, but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat.  The air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie.  Let us face facts; if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients, that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on Twinkies.  Twinkies, like anything, in moderation are just fine.
