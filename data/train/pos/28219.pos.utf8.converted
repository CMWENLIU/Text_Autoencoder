I bought these chews because our dogs were getting tired of the same old Beefeater chews every evening, and I needed to spend five dollars more to get free shipping. All the previous positive reviews also nudged me in this direction.<br /><br />From day one our two dogs, a senior bichon and a middle aged shih tzu, have greeted these chew snacks enthusiastically. We like their small length and thinness of being. They break into small pieces for easier consumption by the dogs. Be careful when presenting very hard chews to your dogs. We learned the hard way after discovering that poor Piper had four broken teeth. The doggie dentist advised us not to give the dogs any chew that does not bend. These oral hygiene chews fit the bill. I wish there were more chews in a package, but because our dogs have received these so well, I'll be ordering again.
