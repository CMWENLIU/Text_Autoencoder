These crackers are great, especially for people who cannot tolerate wheat, but they good for everyone.  My friends like them a lot, too!  They stay crunchy.  AND buying in quantity saves money over buying individual packages in the stores.  I cannot always find them in stores, so I am really happy to have them on hand!
