I really don't know how to describe <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V33ZNM">Kay's Naturals Cookie Bites, Cinnamon, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>.  They are extremely tasty but don't really compare to other foods.  They are somewhat like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but not as sugary and the texture is all wrong.  They are light and crispy, but not crunchy.<br /><br />I love that these are available in snack pack sizes.  I sometimes go on autopilot when eating so it is really helpful to not have to think about portion control. The temptation to binge on delicious food like this is best avoided.  I just eat what is in the bag because that is a reasonable amount of food.<br /><br />In any case, I think these are fantastic; the nutrition content makes you feel good about what you are putting in your body, and the taste makes you want to put them in your mouth!  This is healthy food that you can eat for the taste, rather than in spite of the taste.
