I have been using sugar alternatives for many years. I have tried many of them. I loved Splenda(sucralose), but recently discovered that it is not properly digestible, with as much as 40% left for the body to process. I went back to stevia based sweeteners, but quickly grew tired of the bitter after taste. This product is also based in  plant-like, natural ingredients. The taste closely rivals table sugar! I am already on my second large order. I add it to my coffee and iced tea with a teaspoon just as if it was sugar.
