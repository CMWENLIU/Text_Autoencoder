I don't think you can beat the value of this coffee, especially with the Subscribe and Save program! It is also a great French Roast with a full, deep flavor. It does not taste burnt like some of the Starbucks varieties, but is smooth and a little smokey. I like strong coffee, and so this is definitely the way to go for me. I've had compliments from visitors to our house on how good the coffee is, as well. I'm completely satisfied!
