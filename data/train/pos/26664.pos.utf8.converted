All the men in my family give me positive feedback on this smoked salmon as a gift.  For years, gifts would be sent and not much said until I began to send this Naturally Wild Smoked Salmon.  Now they all make a point to tell me how much they appreciate it.  I am fortunate enough to live in a area where I can find it in the stores, so keep a supply handy.  It does not need refrigeration until the foil packet has been opened, but once opened, does not stay on the plate long until eaten.  The only other smoked salmon I like as much is from Fresh Foods at Pike Place Market in Seattle, but it has to be constantly refrigerated, and when shipped, you have to make sure someone is home to take delivery.  The Naturally Wild Smoked Salmon costs less, can sit in the mailbox, and can store in the cabinet until you're ready to eat it.
