First off, you must know that a 30 pack of these lollis at Whole Foods is $4.99, so this is a steal. I love that they have added Vit C., because I only let my children have lollis if they do something REALLY special, or when they're sick.<br />My middle son has ADHD and we've had wild success following the Feingold Diet for him. That being said, finding candy that has zero artificial food coloring and no processed sugar is really hard to do. Enter Yummy Earth, and they save the day!<br />Also, the fact that they are labeled VEGAN is a big deal, as now I know that they do not have Castoreum in them for the cherry/strawberry flavoring. Castoreum is beaver anal gland juice, and it is considered a "natural flavor" according to the USDA.  It's nasty, and the only way you know for sure you're not eating anal juice is if the product is labeled VEGAN.  I am not opposed to eating meat at all - but anal juice? Really? Why not use the real berry or vanilla bean for the flavoring? Who thought of tasting and then using anal gland juice?<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of what we received:<br />326 lollis (well, 327, but one did not have a wrapper on it, so it went to the trash).<br />Apple -25<br />Cherry - 35<br />Pomegranate - 41<br />Grape -46<br />Blueberry - 50<br />Strawberry - 48<br />Watermelon - 41<br />Mango - 40<br /><br />My husband doesn't like the watermelon, but my kids & I enjoy them all!
