I bought a pound of this and it was good, but kind of expensive. so I bought a couple of dwarf coffee plants, a civet cat, and a litter box, but it didn't work out so well. The cat won't eat the coffee berries and won't use the litter box. I have to say though, even without the coffee beans the cat crap makes a nice cuppa joe.
