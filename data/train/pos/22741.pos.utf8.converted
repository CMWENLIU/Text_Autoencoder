I conducted a taste test of malted milk balls so you don't have to wonder. All are superior to bulk malted milk balls of uncertain origin.<br /><br />Ghirardelli: Best balance of chocolate with crispy malt inside<br /><br />Double Chocolate Malted Milk Balls: More chocolate, slightly less malt. My favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's: Clearly superior ingredients, the most malt flavor. My husband's favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's Pumpkin:  Very good but not what I expected. Instead of using pumpkin pie spices they use real pumpkin.<br /><br />All arrived carefully packed with cold packs (shipping is expensive).<br /><br />Enjoy!
