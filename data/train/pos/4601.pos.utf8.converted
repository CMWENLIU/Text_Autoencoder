I realize that many people don't like this cereal because the chocolate is too "waxy" -- and I agree that it does have a waxier consistency than regular chocolate. But for some reason, I absolutely love this cereal and buy it constantly. I don't mind the consistency of the chocolate pieces when I'm eating it all together with the flakes and milk. I've really been hooked on this cereal for more than a year now, though I realize that it's not for everyone.
