I am a large man and I love to eat. Especially chicken and dumplings,<br />pies and cobblers.  Problem is, my wife hates to cook.  She thinks<br />I need to lose a few pounds, too. McLibs has been a blessing.<br />Not only are they easy to prepare but they don't seem to "stick to<br />your ribs" like most dumplings.  Best of all they are mighty tasty.<br /><br />Bubba
