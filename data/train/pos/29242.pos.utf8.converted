I work with a 501(c)3 non-profit cat rescue (fostering sick cats until they are well enough to go to forever homes).  I recently took in a kitty that someone had locked in their basement without food or water and left to die.  You could see every bone in her body.  While she was totally starving, convincing her to eat, or move, or drink, or clean herself was difficult.  I tried a variety of cat foods, but the only thing I could get her to eat was really expensive tuna from whole foods.  Then I tried Tiki Cat.  She loves it.  And I love it because it has the nutrition she needs (which plain tuna doesn't).  It is on the pricey side, but it is worth it for nutritious food that will save this kitties life.  I just ordered a 72-pack on Amazon - because buying it one can at a time at my local cat food store was getting pricey.
