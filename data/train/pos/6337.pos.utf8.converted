I am very pleased with this product. The shipping was super fast and the glass bottle was sealed and in perfect condition. Of course with the awful heat wave we're still in, the oil had liquified but I put some on my hair immediately. My hair was incredibly soft for the next THREE days!!! I will continue to purchase from this seller one, because there's not a Whole Foods for miles where I live and two, I'm so satisfied with their business.
