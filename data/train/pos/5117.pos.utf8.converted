This gelatin tastes NOTHING like the Knox or other varieties you can find in the grocery stores and this is a good thing since those taste like sludge for the most part, to be polite.<br /><br />I drink one tablespoon dissolved in hot water to make a tea, twice a day. The taste is somewhere between neutral and pleasantly rich but in an extremely subtle way. I really enjoy drinking it in my teas unsweetened, although my housemates think I'm a freak for doing it, not that me filling the freezer with animal bones and organs and bee pollen and fermenting random stuff on the counter doesn't make me a freak already.<br /><br />I originally bought this as a way to get more protein after reading what I now know was a quite quackery-laden blog post. Gelatin is NOT a complete protein. It's pretty much just proline and glycine, and has no tryptophan. So don't order for this purpose. However, if you're ordering to help your joints, skin, hair, cellulite, nails, etc. I think that this is the best you can buy.<br /><br />I've been using it to get rid of cellulite (since it runs in my family) and it's a lot easier than constantly boiling bones and less gross than drinking bone broth at 7 am in the middle of the summer. And after doing this for a few weeks, my booty/thighs are looking shaa-weet! It's pretty crazy actually; I love this stuff.
