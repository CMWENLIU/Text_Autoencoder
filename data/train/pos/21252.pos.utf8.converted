Really do love this coffee!  It has a rich, full bodied taste, not at all bitter despite its darkness but delicious!<br /><br /> As we're a bit new at using the T-discs, (we have a Bosch Tassimo, which by the way we really like) we were surprised to find that the Starbucks disc was twice as thick as our Carte Noire disc.  But, no problem whatsoever, the Starbucks disc was easily punctured and fit quite easily into the brewing unit.<br /><br /> As we're a two person household with only one often drinking coffee, the ability to brew only one cup of really good coffee is important to us.  On the other hand, the brewing is so speedy that if we want two cups or more it can be accomplished in a jif.<br /><br /> We will be looking forward to trying the other Starbucks flavors available in discs.<br /><br /> - Gail Cooke
