I first stumbled upon this mix a good ten years ago when I was a more strict vegetarian. I have since become a little more lenient in my diet but this is an old favorite. I do the beginning as suggested, boil 2.5c water and then add the chili mix (1 box) but from there, I do my own thing. They suggest using 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of beans but I find that I get a much more mellow but still hearty, flavorful chili and it either feeds several more or leaves a good bit leftover by adding the following: 1 can of Great Northern beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a bit of powdered garlic (I picked the different beans for flavor/color/texture variation and the garlic is based on your personal tastes). If it's too thick for you, add up to 1 can of stewed tomatoes so that it thins it without diluting the flavor.<br /><br />Anyways, it tastes great fresh out of the pot with cheese and sour cream or on top of a baked potato. Unless I am serving others, my son and I always have leftovers but they freeze well if we don't want to eat them in the next couple of days. The real taste test was serving this to both my grandfather and my dad...they are big meat eaters who would have refused to eat it if I had told them up front it was vegetarian. Both liked it enough to ask for seconds and I've since made it for them and others on multiple occasions. :)
