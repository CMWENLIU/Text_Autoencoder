When I heard about IZZE drinks, I went looking.  The way I figured it, in my small town, I'd be lucky to find anything other than the highly advertised, obligatory sodas I stopped drinking several years back.  I found IZZE in only one store, but, happily, it was on sale.  It seems that nobody around here has heard much about IZZE so the store wasn't selling a lot.<br /><br />I predict that's about to change.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1. IZZE products contain 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water.  Period.  No added sugar, no artificial flavors, no artificial colors to send your kids up the wall.  Just the good stuff, just the real stuff!<br /><br />2. IZZE's delicious.  I tried blackberry, pomegranate, and clementine - all great tasting!<br /><br />3. IZZE comes in cans containing only 8.4 oz, so you don't load up on sugar and carbonation. Think portion control.<br /><br />4. IZZE (in cans) is fortified with vitamin C, niacin, and B6 in small amounts.  At least you're getting a dab of nutrition along with the taste of a very good soda.<br /><br />5. IZZE flavors vary in sweetness.  Blackberry is very sweet, but pomegranate is more on the tart side.  There's something to suit most tastes without the cloying sweetness of kids' juice drinks.<br /><br />I predict IZZE will soon appear on the shelves of my regular grocery store.  It's that good!
