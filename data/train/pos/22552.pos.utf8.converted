When i use some other deodorants, especially those super scented ones, my arm pits tend to get itchy and irritated.  I tried this deodorant specifically because of the non-irritating aloe claim.  Their claim is accurate, I love this deodorant because it keeps me dry with NO irritation.  It also smells pretty good, if i want to load up on scents i'll just add some cologne.
