We have a mixed breed dog; likely a Walker Coonhound/Great Dane mix. He's a 85-90lb lanky, goofy, lovable example of a canine, but he has a digestive system that is more temperamental than my own weak stomach. As a pup, we had continued him on the original shelter's choice of food for the sake of consistency: Purina Pro Plan, but that food is a misleading, expensive upgrade to a standard grocery store food, which I wanted to get him off of as quickly as possible. From research, and experience, I've found that you either pay for your dog's health through your dog food bill, or through the vet bills that you'll inevitably get from feeding them junk food. We chose the former. We had tried other high quality foods like Wolf King, Solid Gold, and some samples of Wellness.<br /><br />Nature's Variety Prairie, although not their highest level kibble (Instinct), is an affordable and healthy alternative to the low grade grocery store brands. I was unbelievably happy to find this on Amazon now, after feeding this to our dog, Toby, for the past 6 months - and at anywhere from $10 to $5 cheaper than the few pet supply stores near us that sell this brand.<br /><br />I'm not quite as scientific about our choice of food for him as some other reviewers/owners out there, but I did want to keep his diet free of low quality grains/wheat, and disgusting, bottom-of-the-barrel, meat and protein sources. With this food, I know the meat and protein is a primary ingredient (as it should be) and is complimented with healthy fruits, vegetables, minerals, and oils that would theoretically be found in the wild. I would love to begin rotating the food at some point soon to explore his interest in the other meats, specifically lamb.<br /><br />To be blunt for a moment, his stool is now dense, dark, and smaller in quantity than it was with the low grade food he was started on, since the majority of the food is healthy and absorbed through digestion. When he goes, it's not the gamble that it once was when his stomach was being bothered by the junk food full of fillers and unnatural ingredients. His coat is shiny, his energy level is high (maybe too high, haha), and he continues to be the happy, healthy dog that he should be. I owe a lot of this to Nature's Variety, and I'll continue to purchase their food (now through Amazon Prime with two day shipping) as well as their treats, which I bought for the first time yesterday.<br /><br />This food is worth every penny, and it's still cheaper than many of the other high quality holistic foods out there.
