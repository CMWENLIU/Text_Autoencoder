I have been buying this marzipan regularly for the past few years.  I use it in our weekly strudels (see strudel recipe and tutorial at [...]-  [...] for pictures of this marzipan in use), and it is a joy to work with.  It is always delivered quickly, fresh and delicious.<br /><br />This product is kosher: It is supervised by the OU, and pareve.<br /><br />I have tried ordering in larger amounts, but 5lbs stays fresh without getting dried out.  10lbs. dried out after a two months, despite being kept in an air-tight container.  Smaller amounts weren't cost-effective, due to the price of shipping.
