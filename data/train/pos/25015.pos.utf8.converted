After having to modify yet another recipe because I didn't have buttermilk on hand I decided to give this a try.  Since that time I have ordered it several times from Amazon who consistently has it for the best price.  I mix the powder with my dry ingredients and then combine it with the wet for less lumps. I love this product and use it weekly in my waffle recipe. It does have a good taste. My last order arrived with no issues or defects in packaging.
