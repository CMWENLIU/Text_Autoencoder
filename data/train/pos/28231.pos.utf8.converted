This is truely delicious stuff. A mild but still very tasty soup broth, lots of noodles; includes 3 packets: some dried vegitables, a soup powder base, and a soup paste you add at the last minute.<br /><br />Fine by itself, but I add in a few frozen vegitables right at the start (spinach or mustard greens, green beans, or peas) and often add frozen shrimp, or mussels.  If I liked tofu I would add that near the end.<br /><br />Finish it off with a spash of sesame oil. YUM!  Addictive stuff.
