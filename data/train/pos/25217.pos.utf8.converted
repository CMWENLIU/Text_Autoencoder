Please don't waste your time taking the typical grocery-store brands like Heinz - you know, the vinegars that you would normally clean with.  When those types of vinegars are processed, they lose many of the health benefits that taking a swig or two of a good organic vinegar provides.  Taking a dose of a GOOD apple cider vinegar daily such as this brand will help get rid of the toxins as well as help fight certain illnesses.<br /><br />This Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar tastes the best and it contains the MOTHER.  I use this on fried red cabbage, and daily on my salad I eat for lunch.<br /><br />Sometimes I even take a tablespoon straight out of the bottle.  I always make sure I have a drink handy when I do this, because sometimes it feels like it's going to take your breath away.
