I have tried many of the K cups from Coffee People and they all have their strengths. I drink them everyday and find myself always coming back to the black tiger. It is coffee with rich earthy flavors and mild acid finish in excellent balance. A little early morning time alone with a cup of fresh brewed black tiger K-cup is what makes the start of the day a real treat for me. I have seen some compare jet fuel to black tiger and think that you will have a challenge telling the difference. It probably does not matter too much, because if you like or dislike the one, the other will likely be the same result. What a great find. Thanks coffee people!
