Was very impressed with this cereal.  The 25 grams of protein are amazing and I get it at my local Whole Foods.  The smaller health food stores should stock it too.  I eat a bowl at 9:00am and I don't get hungry until 3:00pm!<br /><br />Read a report that whole soy helps to absorb fats and cholesterol in the small intestine so it literally soaks up fat before your body can absorb it!
