...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class.
