Wonderful product. "Instantly" puts all "instant oatmeal" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the "Tupperware" you don't mind losing!). Into each container ("bowl") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 "ready to heat and serve" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs.
