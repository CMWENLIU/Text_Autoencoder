After scouring the web, this offering from Amazon was about the cheapest for one pound of cardamom powder shipped from a trustworthy source. Very fragrant even before I cut open the packet fully. It comes in a sealed plastic bag covered all over by silver lining. Storing it in the freezer.<br /><br />I bought this large a quantity because I add a few pinches of a spice mix that includes this powder for making indian milk tea. The spice mix contains this powder along with ginger, cinnamon, and clover powders in 3:3:1:0.5 proportion. To make indian milk tea use a 1:1 proportion for water:2% milk (for 1 cup of tea, add 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup milk). Add this mix to water prior to boiling then just when it begins to boil add 1 teaspoon (mounted) black tea power and bring it to a boil for 1 minute. Pre-heat the milk in the microwave and then add to the boiled tea liquid. Mix well and filter the entire mixture using a tea filter. Add sugar if desired. I make tea about 3-4 times a day for 2 or more people, a 1 lb caradamom usually lasts a year to make my spice mix.
