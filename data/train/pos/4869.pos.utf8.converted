My vet recommended Evo. I ordered it even though it seemed it bit pricey. It came quickly. My dog loves it. From the moment it came out of the box, he went nuts just smelling the bag. Honestly -- I am not exaggerating one bit. He used to walk away bored when I put his dish down with the previous brand he ate, come back later, and then eat it. Well no more -- he's like a different dog at mealtime. Happy and satisfied. Enough said!
