Although this is an herbal tea (from the South African red bush), it is full-bodied and rich enough to serve as a substitute for black tea. It is not as bitter, which is both a pro and a con. The pro being that you can steep it as long as you like to bring out the flavors. The con, however, is that it will never have that astringent bitter taste that is characteristic of black tea.<br /><br />The best way to enjoy this tea is to steep it for at least five minutes with freshly boiled water. You can steep up to ten minutes and it will only make the tea stronger without ruining the flavor.<br /><br />In the summer, rooibos is excellent brewed double-strength and poured over ice. Add a little vanilla and milk for a smooth iced drink.<br /><br />Happy sipping!
