I saw this product on the Food Network. I went on a cruise about 2-3 weeks later and ended up sharing a dinner table with an older couple from Jamaica. We discussed jerk seasonings and they mentioned this product since they now live in Jersey. I decided to purchase once I returned home.<br />I ordered on a Monday, it shipped on Tuesday and to my surprise I received on Thursday. I have since made 2 dishes and I am so happy. I feel like I can enjoy the Caribbean whenever I want in my own kitchen.<br />My next order I'm getting multiple bottles.
