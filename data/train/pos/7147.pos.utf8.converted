This NIDO dry whole milk is so great to have on hand! This is the BEST in mashed potatoes - gives them all that creamy whole milk flavor WITHOUT thinning the potatoes too much. Just use 1/2 cup powder (for a mixer bowl full of potatoes) and margarine, or butter, to taste. Awesome! We also keep Nido in our "preparedness/emergency stockpile," and in the kitchen, for those times when you need a little milk but are OUT. We also use the powder in baking, especially bread. Tasty and easy to use, and all the convenience of shelf stable. Each can makes 3 1/4 quarts of whole milk, or you can make only a cup at a time. Recommended!
