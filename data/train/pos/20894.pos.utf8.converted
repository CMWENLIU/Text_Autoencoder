This product is really great. It has a good texture, light color and flavor and very high in fiber and nutrition. I use this for muffins, pancakes, breads, etc. and find it helpful for a low carb diet as well as to boost the total nutrition of my diet. I even make a flat bread style bread and even my own version of tortilla! It's been wonderful and very tasty! I love the price too - I haven't been able to beat it anywhere.
