My search for a good all-purpose decaffeinated tea ended with Twinings English Breakfast Decaf. Twinings English Breakfast is a blend of Ceylon, Kenyan, and Indian teas with a crisp, full-bodied flavor that isn't heavy or bitter. It's a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called "decaffeinated", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. It will keep a few days in the refrigerator.<br /><br />*Lemongrass Tea*<br />This has a smooth, mellow lemon flavor without the acidity of lemon tea: Bring about 3 quarts water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/3 cup powdered sugar cane juice (Sucanat, Florida Crystals, or substitute sugar), and half a stalk of lemongrass, thickly sliced, to a boil in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes. Let cool, then strain. Serve chilled or over ice.
