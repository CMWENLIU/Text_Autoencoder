This is a convenience--to have flax seeds ground for baking. We use whole seeds for texture in breads and in cereals, but the ground seeds go right into breads and cookies or hot cereal. You have to keep this product in the fridge because the oils can go rancid (normal for oily seeds and nuts.)<br /><br />We use this in an oatmeal bread recipe that calls for molasses. The dark color goes well with the seeds and the extra fiber and omega-3 oil makes this a healthy bread.
