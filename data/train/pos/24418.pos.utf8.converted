After reading some of the negative reviews for this product, I had to contribute my experience.  I am a hypoglycemic, which means that I have to severely restrict my consumption of breads, sugars, and carbohydrates including pastas and starches.  This week I was able to enjoy noodles again.  This product is fantastic.  I tried it in a Pad Thai dish and it perfectly resembled real noodles, in texture as well as flavor.  I have not tried it plain with a pasta sauce, for example, so I cannot vouch for how it tastes on its own.  It is VERY IMPORTANT, however, that when you prepare Shirataki you have to first strain the liquid from the bag out, soak in fresh water, then boil for two minutes.  After that you can add it to any dish you like! This eliminates any of the "chewy-ness" or gummi-ness that some other customers were complaining about.  All in all, the process does not take any longer than you would normally experience in boiling some raw pasta noodles...and if you ask me, it is well worth it.  Just to be able to enjoy eating noodles again without throwing my blood sugar off is a miracle!
