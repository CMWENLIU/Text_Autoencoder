I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that this Teriyaki rice is not a boring "industrial food" flavor. It is rich and complex, and has some nice touches, like some little bits of leeks. The ingredient list includes some really tasty stuff, like: ginger, sesame oil, tamarind, and Worchestershire sauce. The only critique I have is the sodium content, which is sadly the case with most sides like this. When will they learn to put less salt in these things??? This one isn't the worst I have seen, the labels states 730mg sodium per 1 cup prepared serving, which is 30% of the RDV. As far as shipping, the pouches come packaged in the manufacturers unit packaging box, the envelopes are not loose in the Amazon box, so there is no problem with damage or tearing.
