Plenty of folk have praised Carbon's magical waffle mix so I won't tread in their tracks.  What I can offer is a delicious alternative using Carbon's magical mix.<br /><br />I'm from Texas and we put pecans in almost everything.  Here is a Pecan Waffle version using the Carbon GM mix:<br /><br />1 cup CGM mix<br />1 cup fresh chopped pecans<br />3/4 cup milk<br />3 tbsp butter<br />1 large egg<br /><br />Beat egg then add milk and melted butter.  Follow with waffle mix and pecans.  Don't under cook, it should be a little crunchy.  Also, don't insult by using anything but real maple syrup and butter.  Count calories at some other meal.
