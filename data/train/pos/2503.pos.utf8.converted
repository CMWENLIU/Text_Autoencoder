I've always loved tea in general and prefer to drink tea over most other things.  My story starts last year when I vacationed in Hawaii.  I stayed at my buddies house and we made a trip to Costco.  One of the items that he picked up was a case of Ito En Green Tea in a can, yes I said can.  Being that it is always hot in Hawaii I was excited about trying this drink.<br /><br />We left the tea in his fridge over night and the next morning I opened my first can.  It was surprisingly good.  I would say it has a medium bodied taste that is very, very smooth.  The colder it is, the better.  I liked it so much, that's all I drank on my 2 week vacation.  I actually drank so much, I had to keep going back to Costco to buy more.<br /><br />Anyway, I come back to California and the first thing I do is go to Costco hoping they have this tea.  Sadly, they don't carry any non-sweetened teas in the store.  It became painfully obvious how much soda, juice and sweetened drinks everyone drinks around here.  Since I am a huge Amazon user, I searched and found this version of the tea in a bottle.  No cans to be found on Amazon.  I was worried it might not taste as good, but ordered the case anyway.<br /><br />To my relief, the plastic bottled version tastes just about as good as the can version.  I've always preferred aluminum cans over plastic bottles, but I'll take what I can get.  If the can version is a 10, then the plastic bottled version is a 9.5.  I would say it has a very slight bitterness to it in the bottle.<br /><br />Bottom line is, this is some really good tea and it's healthy for you.  If you want an alternative to sodas, I would definitely recommend this product.
