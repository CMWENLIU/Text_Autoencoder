My two sons have a host of food allergies. These Super Chips meet their allergen criteria, and being raw, they are very healthy. Most importantly, my sons love them! The chips are bite sized and crunchy. It makes for a great snack food or meal treat. The name is also fun. I think my boys enjoy the fact that "super" is in the name and associate the name with pretending that they are super heros! I'm thankful to have found these on Amazon as they're less expensive here than in health food stores. Yay!
