Diamond Whole Almonds are some of the best almonds out there! These come in a see through plastic bag and they're at their best until the expiration date printed on the rear of the package. In addition, you may want to keep these refrigerated so that they stay fresh as long as possible.<br /><br />Almonds contain fat; in fact 140 of each 170 calorie serving comes from fat. On the brighter side, there are no trans fats, no cholesterol and no sodium. The lack of sodium is important since some companies package their almonds with a fair amount of salt. A serving has 4 grams of dietary fiber; and they are certified kosher as well.<br /><br />Almonds may indeed be an important part of a healthy diet. Dr Mehmet Oz, a famous and accomplished heart surgeon, believes that a handful of almonds before eating could help people feel "full" sooner than later; and almonds appear to reduce levels of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol while giving you vitamin E--but don't overdo it! One fistful of almonds per day is one way to eat these almonds as part of a healthy diet.<br /><br />If you have ANY questions or concerns about almonds, allergies to nuts or how to use almonds in a diet properly, ask your doctor before eating these.<br /><br />Overall, these are excellent, tasty almonds by Diamond Foods. I highly recommend this brand of almonds for people who want almonds to snack on, to cook with or to eat as part of a diet.<br /><br />Enjoy!
