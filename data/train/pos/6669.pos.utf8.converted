My doctor is such a supporter of this product that he sells it out of his office.<br /><br />It is not cheap but is definitely worth it.  A 1 lb bag lasts me a few years so the price is not a problem.<br /><br />I am a food scientist and super taster and think this salt tastes great.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
