A friend from Georgia brought me a bag as a friendship gift and I began using it and loving it! I soon found out it wasnt available where I do my grocery shopping so on a whim I checked Amazon. I found not only was available but I could set up a regular delivery and at a cheaper price than I was often paying for Folgers at the store. The best thing though is it is the best coffee I have ever made at home.I would give both the coffee and the delivery 50 stars if it were a choice!
