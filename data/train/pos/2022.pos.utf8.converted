As soon as I received the rhubarb pie filling, I refrigerated it. I made the dough for the crust from a recipe from the Pie and Pastry Bible by Rose Levy Beranbaum. I used the cream cheese based pastry for a two crust 9 inch pie. I prebaked the shell for 15 minutes at 425F. Then I added the rhubarb pie filling. I put a few tabs of butter on top. I then made a lattice with the leftover dough. Then I baked it for half an hour at 390F. I did not have to add anything to the pie filling. It tasted delicious as is. The result was a very tasty and easy to make rhubarb pie. It will certainly be comforting to eat rhubarb pie during these cold winter nights.
