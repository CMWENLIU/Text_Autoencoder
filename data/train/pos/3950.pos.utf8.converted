The idea of boiling grain to make a tea never occurred to me.  Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage.  Most of my Korean colleagues love it.  It is a kind of cultural icon.  Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for.  My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.<br /><br />Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador.  Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.<br /><br />The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer.  Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural.  I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons.  Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable.  You must try some.
