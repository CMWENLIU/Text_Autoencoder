My cat is almost 8 years old. Being the runt, she has always been a small cat, weighing about 7 or 8 lbs on average. I notice she just wasnt her happy little self and to my horror was down to just 5 1/2 lbs. Like everyone else here, the prognosis was kidney failure. There was absolutely nothing I could do to get her to eat the prescription canned food. Mixing with the old to wean her to the new didnt work. Adding water, making it warm, trying every kind available from my vet, I was at my wits end. She was getting sicker by the day eating just the dry food. Then after much reading of blogs, kidney failure webpages, etc, everyone raved about the Hi-tor food. I was afraid to purchase 24 cans of something she wouldnt end up eating, and my vet did not carry it nor did the yever hear of it. I figured my cats life was worth $25.00 and gave it a try. WOW, is all I can say! She IMMEDIATELY ran to the bowl, gobbled it up and asked for more! I have now began to feed her the canned food as often as she asks for it. She looks better, has had less vomiting, and has gone back to playing with toys and pestering her sister kitty, so I KNOW she feels better. If this only helps prolong her life for a little while, I know it was well worth the money to special order it. I plan on taking a few cans to my vet so they can consider carrying it in the future. Thank you Hi-Tor! Now please make a dry kidney food!
