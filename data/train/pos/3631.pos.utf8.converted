My son (18) uses this in his breakfast smoothie every morning instead of having a cup of coffee to get him going.  Together with some protein powder and maca, fruit and milk.  He's slightly ADD and the cacao helps to boost his dopamine levels in drug-free way.<br />The brand is always fresh, full flavored and the price is really good on Amazon - and it's organic!
