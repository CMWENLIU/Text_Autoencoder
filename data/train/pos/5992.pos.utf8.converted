I had ordered both fresh white truffles<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BIOE40">Fresh White Truffles 1 ounce ( White Alba Truffle)</a> and some caviar close to a holiday weekend (on the Thursday before Christmas on Sunday) and I had done so without anticipation of getting them except in time for New Years. Shipping was noted as $6 for each of the 2 items I'd ordered.<br /><br />Not only did the seller notice the 2 orders shipping to the same location and consolidated the shipping cost to $8 for both. But they obtained my phone number from Amazon, called me to tell me that normally they overnight these types of items in any event, but while they would happily upgrade for Saturday Delivery at no charge to me so I would have the order for Christmas, they had worries that there was possibly no Saturday delivery in rural area (I live in Bridgehampton NY and they were correct, there is no Saturday deliver here even from Fed-X) and so, to avoid the order sitting around unrefrigerated from Friday till Tuesday, they were calling to ask if they should hold the order and instead ship Tuesday for Wednesday.<br /><br />Since I did not pick up my calls Thursday eve or Friday AM rather than just leave a voice-mail a call their job done, when I finally answered a call at 5:20 Friday, it was from a seller employee's cell phone, who had my order with him, in order to be able keep it freshest, pending an instruction from me, and so as to make absolutely sure they were following my wishes.<br /><br />As you can imagine the items received were commensurate with that service, and when they arrived Wednesday morning they were perfect IN EVERY WAY.<br /><br />And no matter how expensive the items (and they were the cheapest of their kind I found this season), this kind of service, while certainly also rare as the items themselves, is in my estimation, priceless.
