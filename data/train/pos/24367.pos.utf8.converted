I got turned on to Douwe Egbert's coffee when one stay at the Bellagio Resort in Vegas. I was having breakfast, and loved the coffee, so I asked the server who made it. She brought out a package and showed me that it was a commercial container of European Dark frozen coffee from Douwe Egbert (which I had never heard of). So once i got home, I ordered a variety of the Douwe Egberts coffee and loved them all, but the Intense is the closest to the Bellagio joe.  Discerning coffee friends also loved it when they had some, and asked what it was.  You have to try this. Yes, it's ground, but it is vacuum sealed into a hard block, and seems to lose no aroma or flavor being pre-ground.
