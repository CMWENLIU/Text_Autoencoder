I'm so glad to finally see that Amazon is selling and fulfilling this product themselves.  I've been buying this at Albertsons lately and getting it 2 for $3.00 which is roughly about the same price on Amazon but of course now I won't have to pay the sales tax and I get it shipped to me via UPS 2nd Day Air for FREE since I'm an Amazon Prime member.  I just hope Amazon lowers the price as well as making this one of their Subscribe & Save products.  I just ordered 4 of the 12 packs - (1) Lemon, (1) Chocolate, and (2) Spearmint.  I'll be so happy if they lower this to around $1.00 or less per bottle.  I would then order this stuff like crazy as I hate drinking regular water and am seriously trying to get off diet sodas.<br /><br />P.S. - If you're wondering about the Chocolate flavor - it's awesome.  It sounds nasty but is actually good.  It taste a bit like your drinking water with one of those green Andes candies in your mouth.  If you're trying to cut down or even get off of sweets - this is a good water to drink as it actually satisfies your sweet cravings!!
