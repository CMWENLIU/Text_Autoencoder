Mother used to give me Cream of Rice when I was ill, as a child, and I was ill a *lot*.<br />Now, I'm nearly end-stage with ulcerating Crohn's disease, but still find that Cream of Rice can be digested without pain, and quickly alleviates nausea which accompanies Crohn's flares.<br />However, illness aside, I would still recommend it as an outstanding hot breakfast food. I'm also glad to see it here as the world-wide "Bigmart" has chased most other groceries out of our small town, and now does not consistently carry this product, nor will they respond to requests for products. Thanks, Amazon.
