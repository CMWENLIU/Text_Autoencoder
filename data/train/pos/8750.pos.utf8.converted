I decided to try wheat grass about a year ago as part of an effort to improve my overall health. I would mix 1 packet in a bottle of water and just chug it every morning. It doesn't taste great, but in my opinion its much more tolerable than fresh juiced wheat grass. The taste can change quite a bit based on my own body alkalinity and what I've been eating recently. Its really not bad at all, and the benefits are truly amazing. As long as I was drinking wheat grass, I was immune to every illness floating around. I never got sick once while on this stuff. My boyfriend also tried it with me and also never got sick while his co-workers were out consistently catching each others colds. He uses the loose power in the large container but I prefer the individual packets because they are so easy to carry around with me. I've eased up on it over the summer but I plan to start using it again daily as the fall/winter cold and flu season approaches. After a few months of using it, I didn't even have to worry about people sneezing on me or missing the hand sanitizer one time because I was simply immune to everyone's germs.
