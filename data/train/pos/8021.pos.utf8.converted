You can use this old fashioned product to make your own "knock your socks off" Canadian style Bacon. It's really simple, even though it takes 6 days and a little room in you fridge.  First requirement is, you must have a smoker/grill.  I use a large Big Green Egg. The recipe and instructions follow: For each one pound of Pork Loin (boneless) 1 tbs of Morton Sugar Cure,  1 tsp of white granulated sugar,  1 tsp of Dark Brown Sugar.  Add sugars to a small bowl and mix well by hand. Don't use the smoke flavored cure as it can be awfully tricky to get it right. The regular cure is a great product and easy to use.<br />Prep the Pork loin: most pork loins average 9-10 lbs, this is good size to use.  I like to cut them into thirds, approximately 3 lbs or so each as this size fits perfectly into 1 gallon freezer bags.  Cut, rinse under running water, then pat dry using paper towles and place one pc in a bag.<br />Back to cure mix, I like to mix the sugars for 3 lbs each in smaLL bowls and mix, this way I'm sure I get the right amount on each pc of meat.  Pour the cure mix into the bags, then using one hand reach into each bag and knead the mix into and all over the meat. When finished mixing the bags, wash hands and fold over top of bag squeezing out all air, then zip close.  Place bags flat on a shelf in your fridge. Once every 24 hoursflip the bags ( keeping closure folded over the top)The cure will draw moisture and create a brine (this is good, do not drain)  Do the flip routine for 5 days. On the 6th day remove from fidge, rinse off, then place the meat in a bowl of clean cool water and let soak for an hour to remove part of the salt. Will be too salty if you don't do this.  Dry meat put meat back into fridge, covered to chill down while you prep your smoker/grill.  Get your smoker to 225-250 degrees, steady,throw in a pc of hickory wood, then place the 3 pcs of cured loin into your smoker with a temp. probe in one pc.  Slow cook until the temp. of the meat reaches 160-165, then remove immedialtely.  Any higher will dry out the meat (160 is best).  Let meat cool down, then wrap and put in fridge over night.  Remove next day, slice about 1/8" thick and enjoy the best darn Canadian Bacon you ever eaten.  Canadian bacon in the stores is $8-$10 a lb and nowhere near this good.<br />If you enjoy grilling/smoking, you'll enjoy this.  A little time consuming but by no means is it hard to do.  This Morton's Sugar Cure is a great product that makes it all easy.
