Make no mistake...there is a HUGE difference between Crown Prince canned clams and Crown Prince Natural Smoked canned clams.  I'm pretty sure that when it comes to the nutritional powerhouse that clams just happen to be, most people either are unaware or just don't care how many key nutrients are provided by these little mollusks.  One little 3 oz. tin has 130% of the iron we need in a day and although it isn't listed on the nutritional label, clams are the best source of vitamin b12 on the planet at over 1000% per serving. Certainly not recommending to eat a whole tin everyday for health but half a tin every other day(refrigerate leftovers of course) will do the body good. Simply, put some good old clams = anemia's worst enemy.  Now back to how these clams packed in olive oil annihilate all other canned clams out there. Canned clams, even other Crown Prince canned clams have a knack for providing more SAND than clam. That's right, it's usually a grainy experience.  But not with these CP Natural in Olive Oil. Delicious and actually does this healthy treat some justice. Being a huge fan of the CP Natural canned oysters in olive oil, I just had to try these. It's safe to say those delicious oysters have some new competition breathing down their necks(9 out of ten oysters don't have necks but you get the idea).
