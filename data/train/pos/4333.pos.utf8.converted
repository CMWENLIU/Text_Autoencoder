I love Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, especially on a hot day. It is the best "sports drink" you can get, because it does "hydrate every cell in your body." It is a pure, unadulterated, unmanipulated healthy drink, that perks you up. The 17oz. size is handy to take along in the car or pack for lunch. Great for leg cramps cuz of the high potasium content. Better than a banana and less calories. Better than water - totally quenches thirst!!!
