This stuff is good enough to eat by the spoonful.<br />But seriously, unless you're a butt masochist, don't eat too much.<br /><br />My favorite use:<br /><br />Mix 1 part Chili Garlic Sauce with 2-3 parts Sabra Hummus<br />Add a freshly cooked veggie like green beans or brussels sprouts<br />Toss<br />Yum<br /><br />Also great for marinating a steak.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Same great taste with fewer calories than Sriracha<br />No sugar added - diabetic safe<br />Tastes like the devil's ambrosia. Does that exist? It does now.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Unable to consume via straw<br />Over-consumption will inflame your butt sphincter
