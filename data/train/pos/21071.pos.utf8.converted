Since I'm prone to kidney stones, I've had to cut back on milk.  I thought I'd give chocolate soymilk a try since it isn't as thick as regular chocolate milk. Even though I wasn't used to drinking soymilk, and got teased about drinking soy, it wasn't hard to get used to it. Silk has been the best tasting chocolate soymilk that I have ran across.  It is even good for baking, such as in German chocolate cake. :)
