I'm not a coffee snob, other than I like to grind my beans fresh and use a French press.  I'm generally on a budget, but I haven't been completely happy with what's available at the supermarket - either quality or price.  I decided to give this a shot because of the price and reviews, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />First, this coffee smells incredible - it's almost reminiscent of popcorn, in a way. But I can't really describe the earthy, toasty smell other than it's the best smelling coffee I've ever encountered.  I'm not too familiar with low acidity coffee, but this brews up with great, complex flavor, but it's also incredibly smooth and has good strength.  After brewing this several times I'm finding that I like it more and more with time.  It's just a wonderful, satisfying cup of coffee to have at home.  To me it's much, much  better than anything I can find at the supermarket, and you can't beat the price.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
