I am originally from Yankee land and now live in Houston.  As far as I am concerned, if you are out of anchovies, you are out of Pizza!  I like a little pizza with my anchovies.  Here in the South, they look at you like you are crazy for wanting anchovies with your pizza.  Also, I love them on Greek Salads.<br /><br />I was very frustrated trying to buy anchovies in this part of the country until I realized I could buy them from [...] by the case.  Crown Prince Flat Anchovies are a first class product and I could not ask for better anchovies.  I happen to like them packed in Olive Oil as crown Prince packs them and their 2 ounce cans are a perfect size.  I just take one of the tins out of the pantry when I need anchovies.<br /><br />After ordering my first case of crown Prince Anchovies, they arrived in a timely fashion, free freight and the tins were in perfect condition.  From now on I will be a steady buyer of these great tasting and well packed anchovies. I could not ask for a better product.<br /><br />Lee<br />Houston, TX
