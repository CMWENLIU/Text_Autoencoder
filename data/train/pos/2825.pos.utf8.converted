We've been looking for a vegetarian rawhide for our dogs and this is the best yet. Sure it doesn't last hours, but it gives them a good 10-15 minutes of hardcore chewing. My dogs love them and get excited at just the site of the bag. I just wish some local stores carried these so I didn't have to order them all the time.
