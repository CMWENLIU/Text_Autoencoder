As a bodybuilder, I have been looking for a cheaper alternative to the Twin Labs Liquid Amino Fuel. I was considering the Bragg. I have not tried the Bragg. However, there is one major flag with the Bragg. The nutritional label. Even on the Bragg web site it confirms 110 mg of sodium. 110 per serving. That is a ton of salt. Compare to the Twin Labs that has on 10.<br /><br />So this product is definitely not recommended as a chug down amino supplement for bodybuilders.<br /><br />But to spritz on salads or whatever, it's great.<br /><br />UPDATE: June 2011<br />I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. I did indeed purchase the Bragg Liquid Aminos thinking it would be a more cost effective amino supplement, compared to the price for Twinlabs Liquid Aminos. This product is not to be used in that context, which I learned. I'm glad my review will clarify the usability of the product for "those seeking an amino supplement while undergoing strenuous workout regiments and training". I believe Bragg should consider a clarification on the label. It's an excellent product as a selective, minor boost of amino supplementation in accordance to recipe augmentation and flavoring. But, not in terms of dosing. I'm sorry for any confusion my review may have caused. My perspective came from a different interpretation based off Braggs label description which actually motivated me to purchase the product because my dietary and monthly supplementary costs are staggering since I'm natural, and this product is affordable. I actually do use the product. But only as a flavoring enhancer that provides an additional boost toward my daily protein intake. For those working out, I hope that helps.
