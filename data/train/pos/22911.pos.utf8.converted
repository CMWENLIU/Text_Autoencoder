This was the first time I'd ever made my own sausage, but after reading some brief online guides, and following the advice from other Amazon reviewers, I cranked out (literally) 3 dozen brats in about an hour, and felt like a professional sausage maker. The casings were first rate, neatly packaged, and the unused part of the package zips up for re-storage, and I used them a week later for 10 pounds of turkey sausage. I enjoyed doing it so much, and was so proud of the finished product, I am now looking to buy a smoker to expand my new sausage making hobby.
