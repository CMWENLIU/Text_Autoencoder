The best thing about this hot mustard other than the taste is that there are no preservatives or fillers, it's just straight mustard and turmeric. Another great thing is that it's a powder that can be mixed with other sauces like soy, teriyaki, mayonnaise, you name it! whatever you want! This mustard is HOT! be careful because it will blow your nose membranes to china! unless you already live there :D WANH WANH WAAANH! seriously though, this hot mustard is king!
