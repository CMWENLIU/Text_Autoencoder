Safflower Oil has a very high "smoke-point", so that burning has to be intentional on the part of the cook. I keep my cooking temperature well within<br />the limit of zero temperature and the smoke-point temperature.<br /><br />This oil is versatile also: excellent on salads, in bread/cake mixes; an all around pal in the kitchen when an oil is needed. A-N-D, Safflower Oil is Nutritious, as well. I hope that this review is helpful;
