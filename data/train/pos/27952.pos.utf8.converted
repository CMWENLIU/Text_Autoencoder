I was frightened by my breakfast today. Vegemite on buttered toast. Yes, I had researched the traditional way to eat it. But still... I was scared. I faced my fear. I opened the jar. I stared down the thick, dark, brown, gooey goo. I took a spoon and took control. I spooned out a tiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnny bit. Tiny. I put it on the edge of my toast. I made a face. I took a bite. I smiled. In dismay. In pleasure. I picked up the spoon again and commanded the brown goo to give me more more more. Well, still sparingly, but, nevertheless... more. I used no more than 1/2 teaspoon on my slice of toast. I had a second slice with another almost 1/2 teaspoon. I updated my Facebook status. People replied in curiosity, in fellowship or in disgust. Or all of the above. About an hour later I craved it again, and I indulged again. Between waking and dinnertime, three slices with that just-less-than-one-half-teaspoonful of Vegemite was all I consumed, and, I swear, I was pleasantly satiated all day and full of energy. Can't wait until breakfast tomorrow! :) (Standard disclaimer: I've been vegetarian for almost 18 years. This had an almost beefy taste. Salty, beefy, vegan, lots of B vitamins. Yum.)
