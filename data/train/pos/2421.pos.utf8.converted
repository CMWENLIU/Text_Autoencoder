Chocolate makes otherwise normal people melt into strange states of ecstasy. ~John West<br /><br />To taste 72% Pure Origin Sao Tome is to enter chocolate connoisseur heaven where chocolate squares become poetry. The delicate snap of the chocolate when you take the first bite, the smooth melting of delicious fine chocolate as you only feel the smoothest of chocolate melting on your tongue in a buttery bliss. These are not bitter or overly sour, as you would expect from a dark chocolate.<br /><br />The taste is more refined and the chocolate is made from the premium cocoa beans found on the island of Sao Tome. This distinctive flavor is a rare bliss for chocolate connoisseurs who wish to taste a pure chocolate without any flavorings or fillers. This is just pure, pure chocolate made with 72 % cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter and soya lecithin.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of tea or coffee. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own. Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Chocolate Oblivion where each nuance becomes a journey into pleasure.<br /><br />The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the silkiest chocolate you have ever tasted. If there is a better chocolate, I haven't tasted it. Such perfection! These are chocolates you must eat slowly, letting them melt in your mouth as the superior richness fills your mouth with chocolate bliss.<br /><br />You can also melt 8 squares into 11 ounces of milk to make hot chocolate or you can take pleasure in the superior flavor of one piece of chocolate as a delectable luxury.<br /><br />The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior. My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold ballotin with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping.<br /><br />The Orange and Cinnamon varieties contain natural cinnamon and orange flavorings. The Cinnamon Napolitains or squares have a unique cinnamon flavor that is especially delicious. If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties.<br /><br />While I am in love with the quality of Leonidas chocolates, the customer service and shipping speed is equally impressive. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />Leonidas chocolates are a thoughtful gift for friends or you may just want to order them for your own chocolate pleasure. I can guarantee that once you taste these chocolates, you will never be fully satisfied by less than the best. When you long for the purity of chocolate in its most refined state, then these are the chocolates to order!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
