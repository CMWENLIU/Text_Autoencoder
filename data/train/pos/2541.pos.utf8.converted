This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.
