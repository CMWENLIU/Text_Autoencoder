I love this product! For those that find the taste bland, but are eating this for fiber, here is my suggestion: Mix small amounts (less than 1/4 cup) of each of the following in a bowl: this cereal, Fiber One cereal, Wheat and Bran Shredded Wheat cereal, raw almonds, raw walnuts, and raw pecans. Pour on your favorite soy milk. It tastes great! I eat this every morning. No more trouble with getting my daily fiber intake!
