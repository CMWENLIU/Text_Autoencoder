The non-organic version of this chicken base (available for around $4 at Wegmans' grocery stores in NY/NJ/PA) is a staple in my kitchen. I also use the beef, clam, and (vegetarian) vegetable bases and will never, ever go back to bouillon cubes.  The taste is less salty than bouillon cubes and free of either the oxidized off-flavor of bouillon cubes and low salt bouillon powder packets, or the metallic "tin can" off-flavor of canned broths.  Is one bouillon cube too little and two too much? With these you can add exactly what you need.  The bases are very good on their own and especially good for extending, salting and "filling out" the fresh but uncomplicated taste of homemade stocks. Note, refrigerate after opening.
