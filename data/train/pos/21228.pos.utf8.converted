I really like this product. When sprinkled on moist foods, it tastes very rich and buttery. Contains NO FAT, NO CHOLESTEROL and is low carb for those who are watchful of their carb intake. I prefer an ultra low-fat diet and the Butter Buds are great for my lifestyle. I put them on potatoes, oatmeal, rice dishes etc...<br />Highly recommended!
