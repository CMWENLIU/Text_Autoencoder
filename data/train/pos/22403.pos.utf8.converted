I've just eaten my first batch of alfalfa sprouts from this sprouter.  I never knew what REAL/FRESH sprouts were supposed to taste like! They're delicious and they only took 4 days!  This is such an easy way to make your own sprouts.  The only gripe I have is that I bought it for DOUBLE the price at Whole Foods.  Next time, I'll do my research before buying elsewhere!
