Years ago, I began to eat a hot red oil condiment similar to this, putting a little on rice. Eventually, I found it delightful and was heartbroken when the restaurant serving it went out of business. After a multi-year search for similar taste, I finally settled on Lee Kum Kee Chiu Chow Chili Oil! This stuff has an infinite shelf life, brilliant and powerful flavor, without being too burning hot! I had been hunting for sources; now I am happy to see Amazon brings it to my door!
