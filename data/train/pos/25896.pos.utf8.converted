These are great tomatoes, from Italy, in a box. They are chopped just right for all kinds of sauces, soups, and everything. Great flavor. These are a basic in my pantry. With these, olive oil, garlic, and some cans of beans you are prepared. A great basis for a puttanesca sauce (this plus garlic, black olives, hot pepper flakes, anchovy paste, and capers) or just about anything else.
