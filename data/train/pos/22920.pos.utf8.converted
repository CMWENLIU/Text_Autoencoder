I purchased a house about 9 months ago that had very little TLC done for the landscaping.  Many of the shrubs were not prunned and were looking very unhealthy.  After prunning them, I noticed that it didn't take much to reveal the dry brown dead material beneath the healthy vegetation...and I didn't remove much of the healthy stuff.  I planted about 2-3 spikes per shrub around about 2 feet away from the trunk, and after a few months, the shrubs have really come back to a very natural and healthy appearance.  Many of the sparce sections have filled in, and they have become noticeably more dense.  I would suggest taking something rigid to make a hole with before putting these into the ground.  Depending on the time of year and the hardness of your soil, enough pressure can cause them to snap in half.  Not that it is a problem...you just make a 3-4 inch hold and put both halves back in.  I'll definately be using these next year.
