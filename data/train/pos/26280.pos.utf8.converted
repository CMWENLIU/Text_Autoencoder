To those of you spending way too much on prescription food; give this a try. My dog is highly allergic to just about everything. Prior to feeding her Wellness Core; I tried every other brand out there no matter how expensive (Nutro, Blue Buffalo), you name it! Nothing has worked as well as this. Even the slightest change in her diet would cause yeast problems in her ears, reddness and irritation of the skin, chewing her feet, and itchy gums. I have been feeding it for almost a year and have seen total improvement. Not too sure about the mold problem the other person has mentioned. I buy this religiously and have not had any problems with the quality of the food. The only negative I have is that my dog seems a bit more gassy than usual but I'll deal with that as long as all those other syptoms have gone away.
