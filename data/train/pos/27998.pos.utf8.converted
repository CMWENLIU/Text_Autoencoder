I have been buying this at the grocery since they started making it and love it! I'm a diabetic and have to watch my sugars. When i want something sweet this makes a great low carb sweet snack! This price was almost shocking it was so low! I was paying $6.00 a can IF i could find it. Now i have enough for the rest of my life and i'm a happy camper!! Thank you Amazon for your wonderful offerings and prices!!
