I stumbled across this item, and was intrigued enough to try it. Canned bread..who would have thought!<br />I had never heard of this product, but do like a good dark bread on occasion.<br />The label says to open both ends of the can and push it out..we found this to be a must, as it somewhat<br />appears to have been baked in the can;this was easy to do.<br />Very tasty, B&M Brown Bread has a very dense texture and is nicely moist.Quite filling also. We tried it plain, and with some peanut butter<br />and no complaints from my taste test panel :)<br />The long term storage was a key point in my purchase, as I did not have any other options really for bread,<br />so this is quite nice. Cans have a best by date of 26 months away from my delivery date, so it appears<br />that they are shipping a good fresh product.<br />This is a good product, and one I can recommend if you like or want such things.
