We use it to make Frappuccino. It works great! But Beware! Our recipe called for a teaspoon of the Xanthan gum. Not a good Idea. This stuff is a great thickener but a tablespoon turned my Frappuccino into bread dough. Now we use a pinch. It ought last us forever at those increments! Really great buy!
