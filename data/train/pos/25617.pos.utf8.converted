I was on Sanibel Island, Florida and I tried this for the first time in my life this past summer.  It just made my mouth explode in flavor...it is the best drink I have ever had in my life, hands down.  I don't even like cherry flavored anything, but with the black cherry flavor mixed with the lemonade, I couldn't get enough.  The price here on amazon is a little high, but I can not find a store around my house (illinois) that carries it.
