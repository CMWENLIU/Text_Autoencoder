Brought to us by cereal giant General Mills, Golden Grahams is a delectable, yet simple, cereal that inspired such General Mills products as Cinnamon Toast Crunch and French Toast Crunch. Golden Graham squares are relatively the same size as other square cereals, though the pieces tend to be thinner and crunchier than those of Golden Grahams' aforementioned cousins. The taste is basic but delicious, utilizing a honey and cinnamon mixture that is highly addictive. I recall with much fondness eating half a box of these every Saturday as a kid, restraining myself from finishing the entire box only so I would have some left for Sunday.<br /><br />Though taste is obviously the most important feature of any cereal, its ability to hold up against the penetrating and destructive power of milk is a close second. It is my pleasure to tell you that Golden Grahams hold up commendably. Though they lose their crunch fairly quickly, they remain in one piece and retain all of their flavor even after many minutes in the bowl. Furthermore, Golden Grahams has a bonus feature one might not expect: it can be eaten dry with bare hands without fear of getting one's fingers (overly) sticky or tracking sugar-coating all over the house afterwards (I am glaring at you, Cinnamon Toast Crunch).<br /><br />But how healthy is Golden Grahams, you ask. Will my child be safe eating Golden Grahams? I'm really not the guy to ask. I will tell you right now that I am not concerned with this information, nor is it my job to type up all the fine print on the side of the box regarding how many calories each serving contains and how many vitamins are present in each cereal to include it in my review. All you need to know is that Golden Grahams is a healthy option and details regarding potential lethal dosage exist at the General Mills website.<br /><br />The only other area of interest to cereal eaters I have yet to cover is the state of the milk left over after complete annihilation of every Graham in the bowl. Unfortunately, it's also the only area in which this cereal is lacking. The leftover milk is quite average and definitely nothing to get worked up about. However, the fact remains: Golden Grahams is a hell of a breakfast cereal, so go classic. Go Golden Grahams.
