I'm so pleased to find an online source for this mustard.  It is not available in my area at all anymore.  I have enjoyed this mustard (the hot) for years.  It used to be "Durkee's Mister Mustard," then "Frank's Mister Mustard." I remember it being called a dijon-style hot mustard, probably referring to its coarser grind.  Now is made by a small manufacturer in NJ who probably isn't doing enough to distribute it nationwide.<br /><br />BUT it a great mustard, unique, hot in a different way than many hot mustards, just the right burn, just the right texture.<br /><br />Can you tell I really like this mustard?
