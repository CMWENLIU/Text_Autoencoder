Jelly Belly jelly beans have been my favorite candy since I was a kid.  I love the variety of flavors and the quality of flavor and texture.  In fact, the only flavors I don't like are licorice and sizzling cinnamon!  The one thing I don't love about Jelly Bellies is the price.  I was really excited to learn about Belly Flops, especially available on Amazon.<br /><br />I've now ordered several bags of Belly Flops, and every one has been fresh and tasty.  I find that all of the bags have had a wide variety of flavors, though of course the flavor distribution varies by batch.  The last batch was heavy on the kiwi and tangerine, which are two of my favorites.  Another batch had quite a few of the Coldstone flavors, which I had not tried, but enjoyed.  Each bag had some of the sours included, and one had some of the super fruit blend.  I love the differences in each bag, it's fun to see what you end up with.  I wish they would screw up more caramel corn beans, though... they're my favorite and I've only found a few in my Belly Flops so far. :)<br /><br />The beans taste just as good as regular jelly bellies. Many are double beans, which are my favorite...others are just slightly misshapen or don't have the jelly belly stamp. I have had a few that were the wrong color - like the wrong coating was put on a batch of fillings.  The result was still good and fun to eat.  I will continue to buy Belly Flops to keep my candy jar filled. They're not only a great value, but they're fun and interesting and a great conversation starter!
