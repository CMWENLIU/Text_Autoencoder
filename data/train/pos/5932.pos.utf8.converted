Francesco Illy started the business in 1933 in Triest/Italy<br />He wanted perfection. Arabica coffee beans of the highest order, treated with the utmost respect, delivering the finest taste.<br />Today, with the third Illy generation leading the family business nothing has changed.<br />Arabica beans have less than 1,5% caffeine. Since they grow mainly in the mountain climate they are sensitive and more difficult to grow/harvest but they are the only ones that can guarantee outstanding flavor and taste.<br />That is what you get when you open the can. And once again after grinding them: a moment of aaah when you inhale the wonderful scent of the freshly ground coffee beans.<br />Please forget about the price and don't compare this with any of the mixed blends. They give me headaches. 100% Arabica are the only beans I drink and love. You want flavor, get Illy. It's one of the best.<br />Enjoy! (f.e. together with Neuhaus chocolate or Sapori Amaretti)
