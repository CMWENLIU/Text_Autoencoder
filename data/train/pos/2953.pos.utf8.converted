I have the Italian Garden and have been using this on everything from: chicken salad, steaks, chicken & potatoes and even fish!! It is sooo awesome and works on everything....hardly any salt.....just some great flavor!! It is so "clean" and flavorful! I recommend this to EVERYone who wants to add flavor without alot of sodium and added "junk".
