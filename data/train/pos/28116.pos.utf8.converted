Date Molasses is an awesome substitute for processed sugar in lots of recipes. According to the label, the only thing in the jar is dates! Regardless, I love using this product in my kitchen and was very disappointed when it was unavailable for a certain time (and I was out!). I am very happy to see that it is available again. And as I continue to use it, I will continue to replace my stock. It has become one of my kitchen essentials!
