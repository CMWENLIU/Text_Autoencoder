Purchase them directly from the manufacturer and look for an online coupon.<br />Btw, I Love these. . . .  maybe its because I lived in Japan for 3 years .. . the ones at the grocery are made from soy/tofu (not good for me) so they are not an option.<br /><br />The customer service from this company is sterling.  And the price is great for the 30 pack bought directly from them esp. with the online coupon.
