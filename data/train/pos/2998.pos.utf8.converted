I have fond memories of making a cream cake with my grandmother using these wafers. Simply stack them in a row, putting creme between each cookie and covering the finished row of cookies with cream, so that it looks like a huge cream log. Make sure they are stacked sideways ///// like this, so that when you cut the cake it has a beautiful design in the middle. Cool the cake in the fridge for several hours, then cut and eat. Very delicious, simple, and light!
