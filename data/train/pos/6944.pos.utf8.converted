we don't have peanut flour in Australia; have to source it from overseas sellers, and this seller had the lowest international shipping and handling. What a product!; I prefer it over peanut butter, as I can make it with a moisture level of my choosing. I add almond milk, nutrasweet, and a pinch of salt. Very addictive stuff.
