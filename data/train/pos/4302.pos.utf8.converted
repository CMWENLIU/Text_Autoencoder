Whoa nelly I love this stuff! WOW.<br /><br />I made myself some shrimp cocktail and devoured an entire can the first day... drank the remaining yummy juice...mmmmm!<br /><br />Now I'm addicted to a shrimp cocktail appetizer and then I dump the rest of these guys into a rice/cream-of-shroom/lemonjuice concoction that's out of this world. The remaining shrimp broth is perfect for drinking but I like to spice up my cat's meals with it since she seems to like it too :p<br /><br />I did not expect to love this that much... not sure what I expected but I thought it would be difficult, at a minimum, to make it through a can per meal. Nope... there's plenty per can but I can't stop myself. I think it will refrigerate well (not sure for how long) especially when prepared in other dishes.<br /><br />But I've already caught myself doing the math on how I'll afford to eat this every day or every other day -- at least for as long as my obsession lasts. O' Wild Planet wild shrimp: I CAN'T QUIT YOU.<br /><br />I am so very happy with this product!<br /><br />THANK YOU!
