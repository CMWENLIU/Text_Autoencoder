Do you like ginger? Are you aware of it's health-giving qualities?  Ginger has been shown to settle the digestion, to act as an anti-inflammatory, and may even shrink tumors and inhibit cancer cells. I've seen this specific product recommended in various articles on Naturopathic health. It TASTES healthy. It tastes great, too.<br /><br />Ginger Beer (as opposed to Ginger Ale) is loaded with ginger. And it's rarely more loaded with ginger than here in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW---At 26 grams per bottle, you can practically SEE the ginger in it. It has a lot of ginger "bite."<br /><br />Unlike the soft drink megacorporations which produce a tasteless and overly fizzy sugar water they label as "Ginger Ale", Reed's microbrews it's soft drinks in a process similar to that used by a beer microbrewery. There is no alcohol in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW. 25% of REED's EXTRA is fruit juice, part of which contributes to the sugar content, which is comparable to other sodas. REED'S should be a treat, not a substitute for water.<br /><br />REED'S GINGER BREW comes in three varieties, ORIGINAL, PREMIUM, and EXTRA. The amount of ginger increases with each variety (It's a little odd that PREMIUM has less ginger than EXTRA). The labels are similar so check carefully to decide which variety you want.
