My son has a life threatening allergy to peanuts and tree nuts.  Tried other soybutter - YUCK!  This product really lives up to it's name, and my son is so excited to be able to eat a sandwich that is as close to a PBJ as he'll get.  It has a soy aftertaste, but on a sandwich, it really lives up to it's name!  Yippee!  We are going to tell all our friends about this product.
