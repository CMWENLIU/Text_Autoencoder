... and these do!!<br /><br />Wow!  I was really surprised at how good these chips are.  These light crisp tortilla chips have a subtle flavor of green olives with just a hint of garlic -- nothing at all overpowering, but you know it's there.  The flavor combination -- the brininess of the olives with the garlic -- is just right.<br /><br />They're not too salty, either -- a major complaint I have with a lot of chips.  Seems as if other manufacturers feel that in order to get flavor, you have to go heavy on the salt.  Not these.  An entire bag has just 80 mg of sodium.<br /><br />For folks on Weight Watchers, an entire snack-size bag comes to 3 pts.  Add some nice fresh salsa (tomatoes, onions, garlic, cilantro, lime juice, jalapenos, salt/pepper to taste), and you have a filling healthy snack.  Or how about some light semi-soft cheese, the kind that comes in the little individually-wrapped wedges?  These chips are sturdy enough to serve as light crackers.  Yum!!<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing these from Amazon -- I've never seen them in the stores, and I simply must have more of them!
