This is by far the best price I've seen for Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour.  I really like the fact that it comes in 4 1 lb. packages instead of one LARGE bag; I keep an opened bag in my fridge and the rest in my freezer for longer storage.  The flour is very fine, and I've had great success with adding it to recipes for flax muffins and protein pancakes.  Using it all by itself has been somewhat less successful, but I'll keep experimenting.
