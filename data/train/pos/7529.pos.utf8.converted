<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILIHA6">Blue Dog Bakery Premium Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Peanut Butter & Molasses, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />These are an excellent product.  I first started buying them for my two large dogs, and both love their treats.  Unfortunately, they are both slightly overweight.  These are perfect, as they are low fat and made from natural ingredients.  They must taste great, as my dogs always want them at treat time.<br />I highly recommend Blue Dog Bakery Premium Natual Low Fat Dog Treats to anyone who is looking for a healthy, low fat, appealing dog treat for their dogs.
