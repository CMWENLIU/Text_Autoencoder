I suffer from Fibromyalgia as well as other Auto-Immune Problems and decided to give this a try to see if the potassium might help with some of my muscle pain.  I have tried all of the flavors and the Vita Coco Coconut Water with Acai & Pomegranate is my favorite! (The plain is my second favorite.)  It's like a mini-treat to break up my day and I have seen a difference in the amount of pain I have been experiencing as well as it helping me with the "dry mouth" effects that my medication causes.<br />  I am not a medical doctor - but as someone that suffers from chronic pain - I would highly recommend at least giving this a try if you are in the same boat as I am.<br />  It takes a little while to get used to the taste - but once you do - you actually look forward to having it each day. *Hint: I have found that by putting it into the freezer for a little bit it turns into a tasty slushy that is AWESOME!
