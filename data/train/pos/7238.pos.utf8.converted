Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.
