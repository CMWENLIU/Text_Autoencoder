Ok so I am a Hellman's mayo man. However clearly something has changed in their recipe; while they're hardly terrible, that classic taste is MIA.<br /><br />I, a Blue Plate virgin, decided to give it a try based solely off the few reviews here. After some delay thanks to shipping issues with lazy Fed-Ex, the mayo arrived yesterday. I decided to test it out on something I've not had in quite a long while: a great NYC cold roast beef sandwich. I told the deli to hold the mayo, because I've got that taken care of!<br /><br />Let me tell you it was, bar none, the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. Now credit must go to great slices of rare beef, fresh lettuce, and my own personal addition, avocado, but the mayo was the scene stealer here. It seduces you to the point where you literally have to force yourself from drowning the sandwich in it's alluring goodness.<br /><br />When mayonnaise dreams of being reincarnated as a higher being, this is the stuff it longs to be. As I type I am chowing down on a bowl of tuna, egg, and broccoli salad and the mayo has just turned the whole thing on it's ear.<br /><br />Get this mayo now. It just does not get better than this.
