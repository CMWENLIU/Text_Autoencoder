This is the #1 seller Tea in Japan while there are tons of tea options. so i think it says a lot.  It's realllllyyy good tea, from a tea drinker's point of view.  It has the good green tea flavors w every gulp of it, you can enjoy that.  Since I love green tea's flavor so much, now I am so happy to see they now offer a "darker" Oi Ocha version, stronger little bitter flavor.  It has a darker green packaging.  i hope you enjoy this and would love to see this tea more places!
