Shin Ramen is by no means a healthy snack. For those without a degree in Food Science (with an emphasis in Junk), I'll summarize the ingredients for you:<br />1. Salt<br />2. Spicey<br />3. Freeze dried vegetables, etc.<br />4. More salt<br />5. Noodles<br />6. MOAR SALT<br />7. MOAR SPICEY<br /><br />Why then would a competing combat athlete and full-time professional such as myself subject their body to the gauntlet of toxins that this delectable soup has to offer? Well, dear reader, this competing combat athlete and full-time professional fancies himself an alcoholic beverage to take the edge of the next 14 alcoholic beverages. You see, I am also a competing combat boozer and although I am Terminator in most regards, even the mightiest of us fall - and how hard do we fall.<br /><br />Now, one could drink water and tea, rehydrate and re-electrolite'ilyze themselves back to health, but that takes too long. Sometimes a dedicated combat boozer has to go all Barry Bonds and take that "vitamin b shot" that makes them hit the ball farther and run faster even though they're ten years older. In this case, Shin Ramen would be the dodgey supplement in question and I recommend the bowl because if you drink like I drink, you will be in no mood to muss with a bag and will want to get directly to fighting past regretting every decision you made for the past 18 hours, which is nearly impossible to do with your gut threatening to evacuate your body through your mouth.
