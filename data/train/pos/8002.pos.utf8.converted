The glass mug is excellent, sturdy, thick enough not to transfer too much heat when it's full of hot tea, and you can see the color of the tea inside, easily.<br /><br />The infusor is big enough to allow even the boldest of teas to unfurl completely.  The white plastic of the mesh is surprisingly impervious to staining, and the plastic structure is strong and flexible. It's not the finest mesh I've come across so some dust will end up in your tea, but it's as good as most of the commercial filters.<br /><br />The lid that helps keep steeping heat in the infusor when steeping doubles as a holder for the infusor when you take it out of the tea.  It's very useful for the office and anywhere you can't get to a dish for holding the filter easily.<br /><br />I like it a lot.
