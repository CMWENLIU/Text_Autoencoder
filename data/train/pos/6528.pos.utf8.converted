Since the last review here is over 2 years old and since just 2 weeks ago (March 2010)I received a Brussel's Nursery Chinese Elm, I thought it timely to add my $.02 worth. I received my Brussel's Chinese Elm and it was packed very, very well. In fact it was a bit of a task to extract it from the tight fitting packing box. The tree and pot were undamaged and beautiful. One reviewer complained the tree did not look like the picture...well..of course not. Such living products are represented with a typical sample. My Brussel's Bonsai was a gift so I cannot truly say what the other reviewer saw beforehand or in their mind felt they would receive. I have spoken to Brussel's on the phone and IMHO they are a first rate Bonsai nursery (in Olive Branch,Mississippi) and are very dedicated to the Bonsai art form. My Chinese Elm is now 2 weeks old (even though it is a 10 yr old tree)and is doing well..no complaints here. I plan to grow it indoors under T5 bulbs...
