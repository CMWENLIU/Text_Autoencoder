I bought this because I wanted to try using it for some new frozen and dessert treats (using raw agave and fruit). But the first thing I made after getting it a couple days ago is hot cocoa, and it was marvelous. When I opened the reclosable pouch, the scent was heavenly. It mixes beautifully (no floating gobs). Tastes richly chocolatey. I also made an organic chocolate dipping sauce with some organic virgin coconut oil. YUM!<br /><br />Now that I have two pouches of this lovely, fine powder, I am eager to try it in recipes (including smoothies, shakes, raw pies and frozen treats that I've gotten used to from a delivery service here in Miami).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this for chocolate lovers who want something less processed, organic, and very tasty for assorted uses (and I really like that it's reclosable).
