Having lived in Germany, I've always loved this type of dumpling, which is a bit different from other (usually drier) types.  The slipperiness is not for everyone, but I love them.  My sister-in-law makes the best dumplings, and though I've tried using her recipe, I end up with either very slimy dumplings or they fall apart and make the water thick and nasty.  I gave up.  I went back to Panni, which I had used many, many years before, and was sooo relieved that they were as close to my SIL's dumplings as one can get.  Yum!  Bon Apetit!<br /><br />P.S., I cook them in water, so that my son can add them to stew or chicken noodle soup, and I add mine to either vegetarian broth or smother with vegetarian gravy.
