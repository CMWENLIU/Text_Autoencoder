The lifting ring must never be used to tighten or loosen the top of the coddler. The ring should be used only to lift coddlers out of the water bath, or lower them into the water bath. Any torque (rotational force) placed on the ring may cause it to separatefrom the lid.<br /><br />When cooking with the coddler, do not screw the lid on very tightly. A loose turn is sufficient.<br /><br />When storing coddlers for extended periods of time, it is best to keep the lid attached to the coddler as loosely as possible ... this will help avoid fusing if there is much humidity in the air.
