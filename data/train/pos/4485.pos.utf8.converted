I must say, I was concerned.  I had purchased the smaller boxes, and was pleased with that, however I was worried that the large 80 cup package wouldn't be packaged to preserve the flavor, but I was wrong!! There are 10 sealed packages inside the box with 8 cups in each!  Excellent idea!! Less plastic!!<br /><br />The flavor is phenomenal, probably one of my favorites!! Nice and bold without bitterness!!<br /><br />May 29, 2012 --- edited to add, I love this so much I just put it on auto ship!! Love love love it!!
