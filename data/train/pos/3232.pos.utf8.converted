The best tasting cup noodle soup I ever had and it's so easy.  just add hot water and about 1 minute (I'm impatient and it's still so hot) it's ready to eat.  I usually get an unpleasant aftertaste with cup noodles, too salty or msg, not this one.  just tasting good and I think it's low fat, low cal too.  very good.  I am recommending to all my friends and family to try.
