I have generally purchased loose teas at one of the brick and mortar specialty stores.  I took a chance on this selection as I've enjoyed Boston Tea's bagged selections in the past.  They did not disappoint.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored, black tea this is a KEEPER; mild, yet fruity and flavorful with just enough ginger to tantalize.  Black tea can be strong and sometimes bitter if brewed incorrectly.  However, this tea hasn't been bitter through my first whole pound!  The black tea has never overpowered the subtle added flavorings and vice versa; an absolutely perfect blending for an absolutely satisfying cuppa either on its own or with a little something.  I suggest a little sweetener of your choice and you're ready to sit back for that "Ahhh!" moment.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommend.
