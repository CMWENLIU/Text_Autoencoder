We adopted our border collie, Molly from the local humane society.  You'd think given her past she would eat anything.  Well, that was not the case.  We have tried over 50 brands of dog food with no luck - until we found this gem.  Molly eats this!!!!!  Need I say more?  Thank you, Dogswell for such a great, healthy product!
