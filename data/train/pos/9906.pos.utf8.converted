Vegan. Organic. Kosher parve. Fat Free. High protein. Great bean mixture. Very tasty & pleasing. Great as a chili or bean soup base, add water and your favorite veggies and simmer. Or heat and serve as a bean side dish or 'dal' right from the can. Try as a topping on your favorite crispbread. Made with organic pinto beans, organic kidney beans, organic black beans, and sea salt. 300 calories, 0g fat, and 21g protein per can. Labeled "vegetarian," but is vegan also.
