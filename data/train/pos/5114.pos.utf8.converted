I bought this because I saw something similar on Iron Chef.  You can serve food on it and wipe it with a damp rag for reuse.  This shape isn't as usefull as the 8"x8"x1" but it's still pretty cool.  I figure that I'll use them (as in 6 bricks) for a while as serving plates and the recycle them in my mortar and pestle.  I've purchased rough-chopped pink salt for more than the per pound price of these bricks.  This salt compliments foods like Sushi or Sashimi.  I put this in the nice-to-have category.  If you have a few dollars extar to spend than get rid of that iodized (cyanide) table salt and switch over to 100% sea salt.  If you eat anything that isn't 100% home made, chances are you get enough iodine in prepared foods.  Do some research and see how conventional table salt in mined using presurized potassium cyanide - yummy.
