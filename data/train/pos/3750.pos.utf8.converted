When I learned about "good fats vs bad fats" I went on a quest to find the best olive oil.  I wanted one that would be both good for cooking and taste great on it's own.  After much research (and buying in local supermarkets) I came upon Bariani's web site.  I have been ordering this olive oil now for four years and it is a staple in my home.  I couldn't imagine cooking without it.
