I'm a popcorn lover!  I have diverticulitis and really shouldn't eat popcorn at all but these little kernels have a hull that almost disappears when it pops. I have very little to no trouble eating this popcorn.<br />NOW the best part.  It has a wonderful flavor and texture.  This jar has a lot of popcorn in it and is well worth the money.<br />I recommend popping your popcorn in a Whirlypop corn popper.
