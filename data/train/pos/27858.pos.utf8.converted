I can not really tell you too much about the flavor because this burned all the taste buds off my tounge. Before I tried it, I thought it smelled good. I could smell the pinapple juice in it. It made me think of the tropics. <p>Now to put the taste in context. I eat Dave's Insanity Sauce and have no problem with the heat, as a matter of fact I asked the salesperson for something hotter because I was getting used to eating very hot foods. I eat Blair's Sudden Death Sauce and think it has good heat. But Da Bomb was easily so much hotter than those two it burned my tounge like nothing else I have tried. I found myself by the kitchen sink washing my mouth with water. For those who eat tobasco, move on, this is like asking for car battery acid. But for those who are eating habanero's and think Dave's is mild, then this might be what you are looking for.
