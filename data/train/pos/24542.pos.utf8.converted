This is the best and best-tasting organic cocoa powder available for the price. That said, it can be found at a better price than Amazon is currently asking. This is NOT hot chocolate. It is pure organic cocoa powder without added sweetener of any kind which means you can add your own sweetener of choice in the amount you like. This cocoa powder is also great for baking.<br /><br />It mixes easily with water and other liquids if you go about it in the right way: place the desired amount of cocoa powder in a glass or cup, then add a small amount of liquid, hot or cold, stir well till smooth, then add the rest of the liquid and stir again. I use protein drinks daily and prefer chocolate to vanilla but no longer purchase the chocolate flavored protein powders. I get better results by using vanilla protein powder, adding 1 or 2 tsp of NOW Cocoa Powder to the protein powder and then adding liquid and mixing as described above. I trust this brand over whatever generic cocoa powder the chocolate protein powders contain. The protein drink can be improved even more by adding a teaspoon or so of Udo's Choice Wholesome Fast Food <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBERI">Udo's Choice Wholesome Fast Food 16-Ounces</a> before mixing with liquid. That product has almost no taste of its own but is a great way of adding much needed fiber to one's diet and as a bonus makes mixing of the protein powder with liquid much easier - - - no blender required, just mix as above, wait about 5 minutes then drink and enjoy.<br /><br />Update 05/20/2011:<br /><br />Since I wrote this review Amazon.com has increased its price on this item even more, to the point that it is outrageous. Almost all my purchases are made on Amazon.com, but I refuse to pay almost $9 for 12 oz of this excellent brand of organic cocoa powder when it is available elsewhere for $5.50 or less if you take the time and trouble to search for it. And to Amazon.com I inquire, "Why, why why are you doing this?"
