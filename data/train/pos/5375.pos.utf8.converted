I stopped using mustard because of the salt content and the fact that I could not use just a teaspoon as recommended for the serving size.(Who uses just a teaspoon of mustard?) Now I get a great tasting mustard and can use as much as I want. The fact that it organic is a bunus. The mustard has a spicy flavor, much like Guldens spicy brown mustard, but without the salt.
