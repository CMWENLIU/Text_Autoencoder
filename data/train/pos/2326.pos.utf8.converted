These bars are quite good actually.  They are chocolatey and you can taste the coconut and nuts, but they are not sickeningly sweet like most coconut & chocolate bars.  Plus they are moist and the size of the bar is just right. If you are expecting a candy bar type item you will be disappointed - this is not dipped in chocolate, rather the chocolate is mixed right in.  But if you're looking for a healthy snack that energizes you without the sugar burnout you get from other 'energy' bars then these are worth a try. I am quite pleased with them and am going to order some more.
