I grew up on Big Franks, so I admit they are an acquired taste. They don't taste like regular hot dogs. The texture is softer, and more chewy. But they are flavorful, and I think the flavor grows on you--although others in my family object entirely, and they find the aroma very disagreeable. But my youngest--and pickiest--child lives on them! They are her main source of protein. Fortunately they are basically healthful, and they are a great source of B vitamins. Plus, they are so convenient. You can eat them straight from the can. Start with the one in the middle so you can wiggle the others out that are stuck to the side of the can. ;)
