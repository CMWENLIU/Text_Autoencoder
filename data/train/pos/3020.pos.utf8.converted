I am usually somewhat reluctant to try new Bloody Mary mixes because I am so frequently disappointed.  Not this time.  Zing Zang is an outstanding Bloody Mary mix and already contains Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce and Tabasco sauce, which for me are two must haves in any Bloody Mary concoction.<br /><br />This mix has a nice tomato base and leans toward a strong peppery flavor, which becomes even stronger if you add in additional Tabasco, which I often do because I like my Bloody Mary's fiery.<br />If you are a Bloody Mary fan, this mix is a real winner.
