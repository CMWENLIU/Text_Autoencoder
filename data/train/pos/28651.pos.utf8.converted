My mother contracted MRSA through a pressure sore at a hospital. No antibiotic can ever get rid of MRSA, it kept coming back and the bedsore getting worse. We bought the MGO 400 Manuka honey, started putting in the wound and in all MRSA sores, the next day there was a significant improvement over all. Now, it's been 5 days, the pressure sore is almost completely healed and the MRSA has not come back like it did on a daily basis, there is nothing but beautiful skin, no sores, no redness. IT'S A MIRACLE! Praise God for the Manuka plant, for honey bees and for this wonderful discovery. Now I read it's also good for arthritis so I am going to start using it on my mother's knees which have very bad pain from arthritis. I recommend this as a miracle honey for many uses, it is also USDA approved for wound care, any kind of wound.
