It's gatorade, what more is there to say.  It replaces lost electrolytes during exertion for a quicker recovery and better performance during activity.  Way better than water alone.  I find that the mix recommendation on the packaging is a little bit strong and sweet, so I mix it a little watery.  It's gatorade.
