I agree with everything Harry says... you *do* have to be careful how you use this sauce.  Best to mix it into something else and spread it around sparingly.  I also use Dave's Insanity Sauce, Possible Side Effects, and MadDog 357 regularly... and a couple of those claim to be hotter than Da Bomb Ground Zero.  But my tastebuds tell me otherwise!  This is far and away hotter than any of those.  Tastes good, yes it does, just be careful how much of it you use.
