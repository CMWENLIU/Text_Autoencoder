i recently bought some of this at a gun show.  the seller said it was basically 5lbs of cooked bacon and put in a can.  the seller had pieces out on a plate.  i already owned a case and was hesitant due to one scathing 2008(?) review on the net of this product.  so i tried the pieces and was shocked that it was the same product that came from the can.  i then bought a case and later opened a can.  the bacon was only slightly greasy but man was it good!  i then proceeded to eat the entire can over the period of the day.  and of course, it goes great with eggs.  one more thing.  i paid $5 more at the gun show for this product,so this price will have me ordering from amazon.
