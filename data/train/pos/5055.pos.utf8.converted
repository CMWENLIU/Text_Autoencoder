Have used 8:00 since the late '70. Every bag very consistent. Buy at Wal-Mart supercenters for [...] a bag. Buy at high turnover stores and you will find the expire date is always a year in the future. Smooth, flavorable and consistent. What more could you ask for. Go to [...] and earn rewards..<br /><br />Update Mar 20, 2010<br /><br />Had 8 O'Clock unblended for the first time in about 3 months today. Lately I have been buying speciality and micro-lot beans and mixing them with the red bag 8 O'Clock. Many micro roasters have been selling full pounds for $8, normally $13. It was real nice to have it pure again. I had forgotten how good of a overall coffee it is. And this from a 36 oz bag of beans ground at the store, that have been in the freezer for 3 months or so, and is about half used up. It is one of the better averaged priced coffee's that makes a good blending base. JMO<br /><br />Update: 5-28-2012<br />Still my "go to" coffee 85% of the time. I like variey, but I always come back to Eight O'Clock Original.
