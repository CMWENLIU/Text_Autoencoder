My family loves this marmalade and it is hard to find in stores, even ones that carry other Bonne Maman products. It is not the sweet mush that could be jam of any flavor.  It tastes like orange and actually has plenty of orange zest/rind in it.  Very flavorful.  I was thrilled to see it on Amazon.  The price was hardly more than in the stores including shipping.  It was carefully packed with each jar surrounded by bubble wrap and whipped promptly.  As I buy more and more items on the internet (probably 40% of my purchases) I am thrilled to find I can get the special foods we love.
