Love this gel. I have tried all others, and I do like this the best. It gives me the energy output needed to keep going. The extra caffeine gives me a mental edge. The expresso flavor is great tasting even though I don't like expresso drinks.<br /><br />I tried it for the first time during the 2004 Columbus Marathon when they were handing it out. It helped me finish my first marathon.<br /><br />-unluckyrunner
