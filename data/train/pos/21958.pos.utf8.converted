I have tried a number of hot chocolate cups in the past. All of them have had the same, soy-like aftertaste that always ruined the experience.<br /><br />The Swiss Miss cups have no soy (I just double-checked the label), only milk (powdered). The taste is quite chocolatey with a pleasant aftertaste. On the six-ounce brew setting, the flavor is quite rich.<br /><br />If you have been looking for a good hot chocolate for your Keurig, and found others wanting, you may want to give these a try.
