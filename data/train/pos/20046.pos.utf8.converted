This is a great product.  We had been drinking Vitamin Water (which we still love) but needed to reduce the amount of sugar.  This product does just that without losing the flavor.  Unfortunately Amazon has priced itself out of the market by raising the case price by $6 overnight.  You can buy it cheaper at Whole Foods individually.  What a bummer!
