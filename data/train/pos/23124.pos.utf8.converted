For some reason, plain old fizzy water is very hard to find, at least for me. Our local QFC had it, but they just closed. Safeway used to have it, but now they only carry the flavored varieties. I could get the snooty variety that comes in a green bottle, but I can't justify the price. It is only water for crying out loud! Everyone just told me to get club soda, but that has way too much carbonation to use as a drink. Club soda is meant to be mixed with other non-carbonated drinks. So I found this on Amazon and could not be happier. Talking rain is one of the better brands. The price is right and it tastes great. Thank you Amazon!
