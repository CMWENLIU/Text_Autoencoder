Aight, y'all. This stuff is EXACTLY the same as the Earth's Best formula. What EB doesn't want you to know is that it also contains corn syrup. EB's ingredient list includes "glucose syrup solids" instead of "corn syrup solids." BUT what they don't want you to know is that it is indeed corn syrup. (I researched and researched to find that this is true.)<br /><br />So, folks, don't get your panties in a wad over corn syrup. "Corn syrup solids" is NOT the same as "high fructose corn syrup." It is a sweetener (dextrose), and it is questionable as to whether or not it is better for you than sucrose (table sugar found in Similac Organic). Why do O and EB contain corn syrup? Well, it is to make formula sweet, like breast milk. What do other formulas use? Similac uses table sugar, and a lot of other brands use lactose -- a naturally derived sweetener from milk. Lactose is arguably worse for babies, since NO HUMAN processes lactose as well as dextrose or sucrose. Most folks are actually lactose intolerant to some extent, so it's real rough for little babies. So the organic formulas just don't use it, and if they do, it's not in the quantities that it is in Enfamil, etc. (Nature's Best Baby's Only is the only odd man out -- they use brown rice syrup -- which is great (?) but hasn't been thoroughly researched as a sugar like additive.)<br /><br />The other advantage to the organic formulas like EB and O is that they have a more similar whey and casein ratio to human milk than does Similac or Enfamil. The first ingredient in those formulas is "non fat milk", whereas the first ingredient in EB and O is "whey." It's broken down more so babies can digest it better.<br /><br />So yeah. We didn't have success with Baby's Only. We LURVE O and EB and Parent's Choice Organic from Walmark -- whichever is on sale, y'all!
