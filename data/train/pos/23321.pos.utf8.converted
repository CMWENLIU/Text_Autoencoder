I am always skeptical of high fiber bars, fearing they will be tasteless and hard to swallow.  These Kellogg's bars were a nice surprise.  Good chocolate flavor, nice blend of crunchy and sweet.  Quite filling.  Though a little high in fat (5 g/bar), the fact that they have only 130 calories and 9 g of fiber helped. I will be buying these again.
