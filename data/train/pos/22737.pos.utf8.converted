This is a great help with my reduced-carb diet plan, and more. I use this about half-and-half with cornstarch, or sometimes by itself, to thicken sauces. (Note: By itself, it only takes about one-half the amount to thicken as cornstarch, but when used alone, it has a tendency to "flatten" the flavor of the liquid it's thickening.) I also sometimes use arrowroot powder to thicken fruit-based sauces -- unlike cornstarch, arrowroot powder doesn't cloud whatever liquid is used. And, buying this form, in bulk, is far less expensive than those little bottles in the spice section of the grocery store -- compared to this product, those are an extreme ripoff in price. The company is always great to order from too.
