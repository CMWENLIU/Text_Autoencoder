I've been using the powdered Gatorade mix for a while now for post workout and post wild night on the town recovery for a couple years now.  I haven't ever been able to find the Low Cal Gatorade in a powdered mix so I started looking elsewhere.<br /><br />The Propel Zero has been great! I usually mix up a Gallon at a time to I just put 6 packets / gal.  One packet is usually for 16.7 oz of water. Going by that there's 128oz in a gallon to get a perfect mixture you would want to use around 7.6 packets / Gallon of water.  I haven't had any problem mixing 6 packets / gallon; it's actually a little on the sweet side to me so anything more than 6 packs and it would probably be way to sweet.<br /><br />Using sex at a time leaves you with 6 gallons of goodness which is actually a good bit cheaper than the gatorade mix and less calories too!
