recently diagnosed with celiac, I've had to restructure my whole vision of food and snacks and how to stay healthy.  I've never had luck with nutrition/meal replacement bars in the past (can we say cardboard?), so I was leery when those on the celiac support boards kept singing the praises of Larabars.<br /><br />I picked up my first one at Whole Foods, and was worried with the high nut content -- I'm not known to be fond of nuts.  but after one bite, I discovered I LOVE nuts -- if they are in a Larabar.  the cherry bars are sweet and sure at the same time, just like fresh cherries.  the dates and nuts balance out the flavor experience.<br /><br />unlike other bars, these are soft and tasty, and beyond filling!  I can usually only nibble half at a time.  but now, I have something to keep in my purse or in my desk at work for emergency food.  everyone else can have a sandwich with their wheat filled bread, and I'm perfectly happy to munch away on my Larabar.
