This is the most versatile and flavorful seasoning I've ever used. It goes with virtually everything (well, except sweets of course...) and I use it in pretty much everything.<br /><br />It lends a richness and flavor that you absolutely cannot get with salt and individual spices alone. The richness of the flavor reminds me of when you sautee spices in butter which releases and enhances the flavors of the spices. That is what this seasoning is like.<br /><br />From what I understand they take veggies and spices & put them in salt water, it evaporates leaving the salt which has absorbed all the flavors of the veggies and spices. It is really really good!<br /><br />YUM!
