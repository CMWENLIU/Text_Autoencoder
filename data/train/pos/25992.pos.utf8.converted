I consider myself a connoisseur of the energy drink world, and by far the 5-Hour products have been the best of the best.  For various medical reasons, I can't drink coffee or tea because of irritants/acids that naturally occur in them.  However, thanks to many years of moderate insomnia (I wake up a lot, no problems falling asleep, just can't STAY asleep), and not having good reactions to prescription sleep medications, I often still need some caffeine and/or extra b-vitamins to help get me through the day.  I've tried living without it, but sadly all it takes is one bad night without enough sleep (which is at least once a week) and I'm nodding off at my desk at work.<br /><br />I used to drink Sugar Free Red Bull, sometimes as many as 3 in a day to help me stay alert.  However, Red Bull makes me CRASH!!! I loved the taste (even though many people think it's gross), and I liked Red Bull a lot more than the other can drinks (ie. Monster, etc). However, it was almost as bad as drinking nothing at all!<br /><br />Then one day, I tried a 5 Hour Energy drink.  Back then, there was only lemon-lime and maybe berry flavors.  I preferred the Lemon Lime, and I was shocked to find that this product didn't make me jittery, and definitely didn't make me crash!<br /><br />I've been using them ever since!  Amazon.com has a great price for 12 bottles (these can be as much as 3 or 4 dollars each in NYC, if purchased at a small grocer or deli), and they offer all the varieties.  I used to use the extra strength ones, but I am downgrading myself back to the regular ones to try and limit my dependency on them (I only use them now when I absolutely need them, usually around 1 or 2pm).  I drink the whole bottle, and rarely have I ever felt the need for a second bottle during the afternoon if I had my first in the AM.<br /><br />I just tried this new-er flavor, Pomegranate, and I must say, it ACTUALLY TASTES GREAT!!  I will be buying a few boxes of these for sure!!<br /><br />As a side note, I noticed my hair and nails have been growing a lot faster since I started drinking these daily.  I can't say for sure it's a related effect, but it's an interesting coincidence!
