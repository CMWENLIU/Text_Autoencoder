I remember dragees from my childhood, but these have a much better texture. Instead of the mini jawbreakers I remember, these provided a nice satisfying crunch that I would describe as being more like the texture of a miniature M&M Peanut (minus the peanut, of course). Plus, they look every bit as beautiful as I remembered--brilliant, shining silver. A really gorgeous, classy touch for decorating iced cakes, cookies and cupcakes.
