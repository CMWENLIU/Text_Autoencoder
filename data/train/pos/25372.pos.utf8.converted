Thank goodness, it's soup season again. The Alessi chicken noodle soup mix makes preparing a delicious soup a breeze. The mix is chock full of very good noodles and vegetables in an excellent broth. I added a generous cup of cubed, already cooked chicken strips to up the protein content for a full meal. Serve the soup plus a salad with some really good bread, and you're good to go. This mix puts the big name brands to shame.
