I usually purchase Newmans organic raisins and after years of eating the ones in the bright red box at the grocery store (all you raisin eaters know the brand I mean), thought Newmans were pretty tasty....that is, until I tried these. Sweet and plump...I signed up for a subscription. Mix them with raw almonds for a healthy snack the entire household will fight over (no kidding!).
