I've tried other brands of sun-dried tomatoes and these are definitely the best! They are moist and tender strips of tomato with a nice sun-dried taste. I use them in cold summer salads and as a tasty addition to pasta dishes and casseroles. The contents of one package is just the right amount for most recipes, but the resealable pouch allows you to use as much as you want and save the rest.
