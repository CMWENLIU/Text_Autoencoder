I discovered this coffee while on vacation; it is served at Two Cats Restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine.  I really enjoyed the flavor and smoothness of that first cup with my breakfast. The second cup seemed even more flavorful, robust without an acidic aftertaste.  When I got home, I ordered some online.  I have it daily now: fresh ground, hot, and black.  Finally, a dark roasted coffee with a smooth flavor that satisfies. And I like the fact that it is a product that is not only organic but also gurantees the growers a fair price. Over the years I've paid quite a bit more for premium coffee beans.  I consider this coffee to be moderately priced, which makes it a tremendous value.
