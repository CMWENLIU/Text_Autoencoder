I wanted to try the Miracle Noodles after seeing them on the Dr. Oz show.  I looked for them in health food stores and went to some major grocery stores, no one sold them.  I found them on Amazon and took a chance and purchased a 24 pack.  I was a little concerned about all the reviews that said they had a fish smell and taste.  Also I was concerned about the texture, having read that they are rubbery. When they arrived I was surprised that the packages are so small. One pack will satisfy one person if it is meant as the main dish, however as a side it will be alright for two people.  I found that if you follow the directions on the package(which I did) there is no fishy taste or smell.  The product gets its flavor from the sauce you put on it.  As for the texture it is definitlty different.  It is a little rubbery and difficult to eat or seperate into servings unless I cut them into smaller sizes first.  It does fill you up as it is soluable fiber, it has no other nutritional benefits.  However I will continue to use this product as it is a great way to get additional fiber into the diet.  Also once you get use to the texture it is nice to be able to eat a bowl full with no worries about calories, fat, or cholesterol.  I just put a little spaghetti sauce on it.
