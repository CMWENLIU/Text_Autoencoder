I needed to go Gluten Free recently and have found this product really made it much more enjoyable. Buckwheat is not a grain or cereal.It is a flower seed and has a lot of health benefits in addition to its great taste. So many flours like rice and tapioca are like baby powder and a lend a strange crumbly texture to baked goods. Adding this to the mix yielded dense moist flavorful breads, pancakes, waffles, muffins, cookies...<br /><br />I also purchased Bob's Redmill Creamy Buckwheat "Cereal" and the Raw Buckwheat Groats. While I have not yet found a good way to prepare the Groats, I can also highly Recommend stone ground Buckwheat cereal.
