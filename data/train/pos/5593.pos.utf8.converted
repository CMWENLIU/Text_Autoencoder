Bought these so I could eat them for breakfast when I'm really short on time or to eat during break time from work and wow, they are so good!!  Also brought a couple of them over to a trip to Europe and they were perfect!  I never got tired of these at all!  I haven't tried the other ones but this Caramel Apple breakfast cookie is so delicious!  The ingredients that are in here are the real thing: whole grain oats, dried apples, caramel bits and apple pie spice, to name a few.  No high-fructose corn syrup, trans-fats or artificial anything will you find in these, which is even more awesome.  Nice that they're individually wrapped and just the right size!  Since there's no preservatives, you may want to freeze them so they'll last longer - just heat them up in the microwave and they'll taste great!  I do not regret buying these at all - very happy to have bought these!!
