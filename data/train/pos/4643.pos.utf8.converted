We have been a Hellmann's family for decades but the reviews for this mayo were very good and the price and convenience with A. Prime made me give this a try. Not disappointed. I like it a bit better. It's a bit thicker and richer tasting than Hellmann's. Of course, as with any food, it's always a matter of taste.
