I am a chocoholic, but I am also a triathlete and have to be careful with my cholesterol, so I have to limit my chocolate consumption. In the past, trying to find alternative that satisfied me, I came across the Skinny Cow ice creams, especially the chocolate fudge cones, which I love. A few weeks ago, I was at the grocery store and these candies caught my eye and I decided to try them.<br /><br />The reason I bought them was that each pouch (which has 5 or 6 candies) was only 120 calories and the fat content was pretty low (6g of fat per pouch). When I tried them, I was in heaven, since they deliver the experience that I had come to expect based on previous purchases of this company's products. The chocolate flavor is full and rich, without making it overbearing, and the caramel softens the texture and add to the balance of the candy. The only drawback I can see is that every time I get a serving of these I fell like I could eat a couple of more servings! :)<br /><br />Highly recommended, try it, since you won't feel like you are eating "low fat" chocolate, it is just a great product even when compared to traditional chocolate candy.
