I just started using Flaxseed meal within the last month or so.  I was looking for some nutritious additives, to help put fiber and ingredients that might be good for the heart and the rest of the body, such as lots of omega-3.  Research led me to flax seed, so off I went, to the store and found some.  I started adding it to my cereal for breakfast, my Carnation Instant Breakfast when that's breakfast, my homemade yogurt for my lunch time dessert, my ice cream (OK, an occasional treat that I generally avoid).<br /><br />I found that I like the stuff.  So, when I was getting near to running out of my first pound, instead of buying it at what to me seemed to be inflated prices I decided it was time to check Amazon.com.<br /><br />Wow, am I glad I did.  Four 16 oz bags cost about $5 more than one 16 oz container at the store. I used the subscribe and save option (which I also use for my tea), and it's $13.75 for 64 oz compared to $8 + for 16 at the store.  And this is good stuff.<br /><br />Also, I really like getting Bob's Red Mill because I really respect owner Bob Moore's plans to sell the company to his employees using an employee stock ownership plan.  A really neat thing to do.<br /><br />So, would I recommend this flaxseed meal?  Let's put it this way, I'm giving one of the bags to my Mom, and when I go through the rest, it will be just about time that my subscription sends me more.  And if I'm going to use it, I will definately recommend it.
