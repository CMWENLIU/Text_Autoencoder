I've used this to combine all types of wild game and form it into delicious edible steaks.  It works best to marinade your wild game first to have the flavors evenly dispersed throughout the meat.  Do this overnight in the fridge, then simply mix the meat with the glue, wrap into a tube in plastic wrap.  Wait a while and cut into tasty steaks.  You can even freeze the tube and cut into steaks later.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
