We just love the flavor of this breading but don't always want it deep fried. What I do is first preheat the oven to 400 degrees and then spread about 4-6 tablespoons or so of peanut oil on a release foil lined cookie sheet, with low sides. Then wet and bread chicken with Sylvia's mix according to package directions. (I don't always use the egg though.) Place skin side of chicken pieces down onto the oiled cookie sheet and bake in oven for 30 minutes. Then turn chicken over and bake for another 30 minutes or until done. It tastes just as great as the deep fried, but without the added grease and mess. Easy cleanup and oh, so good!<br /><br />I won't use any other chicken breading except Sylvia's.
