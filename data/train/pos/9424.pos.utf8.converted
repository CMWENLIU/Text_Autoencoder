Considering that they come close to the lowest price for a 40W CFL six-pack and they can be had from Amazon with 'free shipping', these Earthmates are probably near the top of the 'value' pyramid. When it comes to quality, I've only had them for a couple of months when I am writing this and the fact that all 6 are still doing fine doesn't mean much but... see the last paragraph.<br /><br />Talking about the bulbs themselves:<br /><br />- unlike many CFLs, they come on almost instantly, maybe 1/10 second after flipping the switch<br />- once they're on, it takes a couple of minutes for them to warm up and reach full brightness<br />- contrary to what Earthmate claims, these bulbs are not exactly 'small' - see below for exact sizes<br />- they do NOT work well with a dimmer - they are either on or off<br />- the light is bright, so bright, I would not stare at it directly - I did once and I saw 'ghosts' for a few minutes after that<br />- the color of light is pretty close to what 'incandescents' deliver - 'soft white' is a fair description<br />- unlike neon lights, there's no flicker<br />- of course, they consumes less power when compared to an incandescent<br /><br />The above were my subjective comments. What follows are specs, as the manufacturer lists them plus some of my measurements:<br /><br />- Light output: 2900 lumens (bright)<br />- Energy used: 40W<br />- Color temperature: 2700K (emulate incandescent bulbs)<br />- Electric charge: 600mA<br />- Life: 6000 hrs. or 5 years<br />- Overall length - 5.75 in.<br />- Length from base to top (the glass spiral) - 3 in.<br />- Diameter - 2 in.<br />- Made in China<br /><br />Maybe I was lucky (read that many found broken bulbs), but my six-pack arrived nicely packed: a box holding the 6 individual bulbs each held inside its own recycled cardboard box, unbroken and undisturbed.<br /><br />It may be worth mentioning that the 5 year limited warranty statement(covers defects in materials and workmanship, whatever that means) promises to replace them if proof of purchase is provided. Since there is no mention of it, the buyer will likely cover the shipping so the warranty is by and large meaningless as it would cost more to ship the bulb out for replacement than buying a new one.<br /><br />The other claim is that each of these bulbs will save they buyer about $73 in energy costs over their lifetime. The assumption is that the kilowatt hour costs 11 cents and the bulb lasts for a little over 6000 hours.<br /><br />So far, I see no reason not to award these CFLs 5 stars but, if they begin dying on me before 5 years, it is likely that I will come back and update my review.
