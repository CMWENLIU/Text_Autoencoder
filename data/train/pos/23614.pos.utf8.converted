This is a very good value. The price has increased over the past year, but that seems to be true with most things. It is a far lower price than retail and the flavor is so much richer than the standard chocolate powders in the common supermarkets.<br /><br />In response to those who complained about the box containing a plastic bag with the plastic tie as the only closure, what do you expect from bulk purchases?  How do you think restaurants receive their bulk goods? It is something to be expected and I have no fear of contamination since it comes directly from the factory. I am quite happy with my purchase. This is real chocolate that must be mixed into milk...not water, as it does not contain powdered milk or artificial oily milk substitutes. I don't buy those as I like my chocolate made with real milk. This powder does not dissolve quickly in cold milk, but I make a syrup of it (1 part water to 1-2 parts chocolate powder) and keep a small jar of it in the fridge for summer days when I crave some cold chocolate milk.<br /><br />This is a good all purpose chocolate powder and can be used for baking when a sweetened chocolate powder is called for. When I want truly gourmet hot chocolate for special occasions, I dissolve pieces of dark solid chocolate in hot  milk and whisk vigorously while heating the milk on the stove. For normal use, Ghirardelli's is great.<br /><br />I did check the weight of my product and it was a full 10 pounds. I had not thought to check the weight on previous shipments.
