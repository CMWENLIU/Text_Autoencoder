This is the gelatin that is recommended in the WAPF Wise Traditions 2011 Shopping Guide.<br /><br />I ordered my first bottle of it a month or two ago, and have used it several times to up the nutritional content of homemade broths and soups. I haven't made "jello" with it yet (using fruit juice) but I can tell you that it smells WAY better than the cheap Knox brand gelatin.<br /><br />I made "jello" using Knox gelatin one time and it had an off taste, because the gelatin powder smelled weird. The Bernard Jensen gelatin smells good, so I imagine that fruit juice gelatin made with it would taste very good.<br /><br />Amazon's price is good, too. Radiant Life is currently selling the same size bottle for $15. If you can score free shipping by ordering something else at the same time then you've got yourself a great deal.
