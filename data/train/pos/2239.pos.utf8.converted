I'm not an "energy-shot" kind of person generally. You won't find me rappelling down mountainsides, kayaking over rapids, or hang-gliding over Death Valley. I have an office job, and my stimulant of choice is coffee or tea.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />There are times when I really need heightened concentration and I'm already exhausted. I can't just drink coffee indefinitely, because it makes me irritable and makes my heart race if I overindulge. That's when I use energy shots. I've been in the habit of using 5-hour Energy. But 5-hour Energy is... well, how shall I say this... yucky. I've tried every flavor, and they all taste metallic and leave an aftertaste reminiscent of boiled-down Diet Dr Pepper.<br /><br />Thankfully, Red Rain has the exact same effect on me as 5-hour Energy (the regular strength, not the extra strength), but tastes far better. What is the effect, you ask? For me, it's a very gentle lift. It's not so much a caffeine jolt as an improved ability to focus on creative or technically-demanding tasks. And it's a lot cheaper than 5-Hour Energy, too, even if you get your 5-Hour Energy at a warehouse store.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kick in the pants that helps you party all night long, I can't recommend Red Rain. If you're looking for a subtle pick-me-up that will help you get through the tasks at hand, this could be the one.
