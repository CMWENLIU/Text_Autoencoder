Without giving away too much information on my advancement in years, I may say that I was a child of the 70's and recall with great fondness and slight nausea the intemperate consumption of many of the candies contained within this gift basket.  At almost five pounds, this basket not only represents a good deal, but also the potential for hyperglycemic diabetic coma for the unaware and foolish.  Of course, most of those who would actually be nostalgic for 70's candy would be in their thirties and forties, and thus have sense enough to not indulge to the point of fatality.<br /><br />As I gleefully pulled out the contents of this basket I was struck by how many of these candies were either metaphors or candy copies of nonpharmaceutical and, in many cases, highly addictive and illegal drugs.  The most obvious examples are the cigarette candies.  Since when was cigarette smoking considered exemplary behavior to be modeled in candy form to encourage impressionable youngsters?  Granted, they may be novelty candies and claim innocent fun, but I'm sure the Surgeon General would not be overly pleased at the kid-targeted promotion of a habit that increases both mortality and morbidity for millions and incurs health care costs in the billions.  But that's not the worst of it.  Can anyone claim that candy buttons are anything other than practice in the consumption of LSD blotter paper?  Pixy Stix are long tubes filled with pixy dust, which in actuality is flavored sugar but metaphorically represents angel dust or PCP.  Like PCP, pixy dust can be sprinkled on other confections to enhance their effects.  Wax fangs are just softer versions of real fangs, and real fangs are used to pierce skin, just like hypodermic needles.  Likewise, licorice pipes are only one step away from both marijuana and crack pipes.<br /><br />Looking back at the candies of my youth I began to wonder of a possible conspiracy between confectioners and drug pushers (especially the tobacco companies).  I seem to recall a shredded bubblegum product called "Big League Chew" and a cooked extract from unripe poppy seed pods called "Opium Den Smoke"--more evidence of a possible conspiracy and the perfect opportunity for the FBI to step in and apply the RICO statutes to bust this putative criminal collusion wide open.
