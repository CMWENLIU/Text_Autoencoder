I pre-ordered this item for my office and just got it.  It's really cute and got a ton of attention.  It works great!  I filled it with dark chocolate M&Ms but I am going to try it with some other foods too when the M&Ms are gone.  Much better than having someone's dirty hands in my candy bowl!  I also like that it's green - you don't have to buy everything wrapped in plastic just to keep it clean.  I really like the look of it. It has three sizes - small hand, big hand, and bowl - so you can control how much candy comes out.  I'm going to let my daughter take it to school for show and tell, I think the kids will really get a kick out of it.  This is a great idea for gifts too!
