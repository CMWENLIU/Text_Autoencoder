I never tried the gourmet food section before. I wandered in here recently on a long shopping trip through the Amazon.com website.<br /><br />I thought these truffles looked to good to be true for the price and decided to try a small quantity, the half pound box.<br /><br />Delivery was very fast for standard shipping, ordered Saturday and they arrived today (Wednesday).<br /><br />There are 8 truffles in the half pound package. Yummy truffle fudge surrounded by terrific hard chocolate. If you like chocolate, you'll be satisfied. My four daughters and wife confirm that these are among the better truffles that they have had.<br /><br />I was not disapointed and expect to be sending more of these to my friends and family.
