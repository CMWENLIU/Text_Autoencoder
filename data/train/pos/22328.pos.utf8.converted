These brown rice snaps are my absolute favorite snack.  I'm even embarassed to admit that once I get started on them it's almost impossible for me to stop! (I used to have the same problem with potato chips in another life). But hey...these vegan, organic, gluten-free, lowfat crackers are so healthy and tastey that I can and do enjoy them to the fullest without guilt!  Purchasing the pack here at Amazon is really the way to go too; much less expensive than buying them at the health food store.
