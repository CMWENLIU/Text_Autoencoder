I bought this tree about 2 years ago, it lasted me for about a year and 2 months which is amazing considering how (unintentionally) poorly i treated it. Sometimes it would go for days without watering (I have terrible memory for little things like that), but I think where I really harmed it was because I didn't set it very close to a good light source. But I have to say it is a very resilient and beautiful tree, perfect for people like me who want a little life in their room but don't have the knack for gardening.
