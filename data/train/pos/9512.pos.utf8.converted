I am crazy for this product!!!!!  I know.  It sounds funny that a person would use this as you would vegetable or olive oil, but it is amazing.  I put a scoop in the pan and thought I would start slowly and try frying up some thin potato wedges to start and see what this oil was all about. It heated up quickly and the aroma was the beautiful smell of tropical coconuts.  My first concern after that was that the food would have a hint of coconut taste, but that was not the case at all.  The oil fried the potatoes perfectly.  I barely patted the potatoes. Didn't need to.  They were not greasy at all!!!!!!Nutiva organic coconut oil is my new favorite kitchen must have.  I am so impressed.
