I'm glad this comes in a two pack.  My wife and I have one bottle in the kitchen and one in the bathroom.  She uses it as a moisturizer after showering and I use it in my hair (I have black hair).  In the kitchen we use for cooking and flavoring.  I drop a dollop in my oatmeal in the morning (along with some hemp protein) to add some sweetness, but not too sweet.  I highly recommend this product.
