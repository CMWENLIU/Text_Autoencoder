This stuff is awesome. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, it's best when you dip fruit into it, but, if you freeze it for about a half-hour, it is delicious alone! I'm trying to figure out a way to mold it and freeze it in cute shapes, but for now, just little blobs will have to do. Add a little WF marshmallow cream on top for looks and taste. And there you have it: calorie-free chocolates!
