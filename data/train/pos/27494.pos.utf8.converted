Over the years we have tried fruit clubs from several different vendors.  Golden State is the best value for the money, hands down.  Fruit is ALWAYS of outstanding quality - superior to what can be purchased in the grocery store or even at the farmer's market.  Just bursting with juice and flavor.  Delivery has ALWAYS arrived timely and in excellent condition.  Fruit arrives either ripe and ready for immediate eating or just days away from being so.  Along with the fruit the company provides some information about the fruit and suggested recipes, as well as tips on how to keep the fruit in its prime condition so it can be enjoyed over several days' time.  Take it from someone who has tried three or four other vendors - Golden State is the best overall product, especially for the price!
