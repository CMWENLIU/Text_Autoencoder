The strong, fine mesh of these bags allows for a very nice filtered liquid. I use them mainly for nut milks and save the pulp to add to other raw vegetable pulp and dehydrate into dog biscuits. Bags can be used to filter no-pulp citrus juices, or any juice for that matter. If your juicer leaves a tad bit too much sediment in the liquid, put the juice through a nut milk bag.
