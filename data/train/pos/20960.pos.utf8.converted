This stuff is so good! My dogs go crazy for it. It smells like people food, and I believe it is made with human-grade food. I use 1/2 can per dog, mixed with premium, grain-free dry food. Awesome! Just look at the ingredients listed below!<br /><br />Dogswell Happy Hips Stew Canned Dog Food really is,  "Everything you want, nothing you don't."<br /><br />Happy Hips Stew Canned Dog Food is all natural and grain-free. It contains Glucosamine and Chondroitin to help maintain healthy hips and joints. Made with cage-free and antibiotic-free meat. Contains no soy, corn, rice, gluten, wheat, BHA/BHT, ethoxyquin, rendered poultry, added hormones, artifical colors, flavors or preservatives. Dogswell makes it easy to feel confident that you are feeding your pet natural healthy food.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water sufficient for processing, lamb, lamb liver, beef, beef liver, salmon, dried egg product, peas, potato starch, sweet potatoes, carrots, red peppers, guar gum, natural flavor, sodium phosphate, shrimp meal (source of Glucosamine), canola oil, spinach, garlic powder, flaxseed oil, squash, cranberries, blueberries, zucchini, potassium chloride, tricalcium phosphate, Chondroitin sulfate, taurine, iron amino acid chelate, vitamin E supplement, zinc amino acid chelate, choline chloride, cobalt amino acid chelate, copper amino acid chelate, manganese amino acid chelate, riboflavin supplement, sodium selenite, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, vitamin B-12 supplement, potassium iodide, biotin, vitamin D-3 supplement, Glucosamine hydrochloride.<br /><br />UPDATE: I vary the amount I use in their meals, and I also use other Dogswell Happy Hips and Vitality canned food (the lamb and the duck). Instead of 1/2 can per meal I will often add more dry food and use just 1/4 can per meal per dog mixed with dry (they love Wellness Core Reduced Fat dry food, which is highly palatable on its own as well) instead of a half can per dog, depending on how much of the dry food I'm giving them. With this stuff mixed in with the dry food and the wild salmon oil, they go crazy for it every time. They even love it cold. One of my dogs is supposed to drink a lot of water, so I started to add a little bit of hot water with the dry and wet mix sometimes, and they seem to really enjoy it like that as well.
