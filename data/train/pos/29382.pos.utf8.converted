I used buy kefir from the grocery store or make it from kefir powder starter.  I read about kefir grains and wow, what a difference making kefir with them makes.  They arrived right on time and in perfect condition.  The directions were easy to follow. I did go to "Cultures for Health" website to watch the video which was also very helpful.
