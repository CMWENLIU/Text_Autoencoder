Superior herbal tonics are among the best I've tried so far. I was introduced to this particular brand by a woman I dated years ago. She insisted that I have to be consistant with taking ginseng...instead of taking it once in a while (which is what I did before I met her). I followed her instructions and found that ginseng can affect not just basic energy levels but can also help fortify the immune system and boost the libido as well. I recommend drinking one of these packets daily for at least a week and you'll start to enjoy the benefits. I myself like to sweeten it with honey. I also like to mix it with another tonic called Shou Wu Chih. They make an incredible combination.<br /><br />NOTE: Some find that Korean ginseng is too harsh and can make a person overly aggressive and can cause restlessness. If that's the case try Chinese red ginseng instead. It's less "yang" in nature than Korean ginseng is.
