A high quality product which is super easy to prepare, and can be used like a pasta. Brown rice is a great source for carbohydrates. Cholesterol free, gluten free and fat free, soak for one minute and the vermicelli is ready for cooking - pan frying or adding to soup. I use vermicelli along with shredded bbq pork or shrimp and mushrooms as fillings for summer rolls too.<br /><br />Also try their brown rice spaghetti. Perfect if you're looking for gluten-free pasta.
