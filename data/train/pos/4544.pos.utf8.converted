I tried a sample of this at Costco today and was so thrilled at the results. I had been running errands all day and long overdue to eat. My stomach was starting to grumble and I had some extremely painful hunger pains starting. After I took the sample I headed to the check out and finished my shopping trip. By the time I got home the hunger was gone. I had forgotten all about it. In fact it was so effective, nothing sounded good and I had to force myself to eat something. That level of hunger and craving control lasted all day. I had great energy and my mood seemed lifted. Needless to say I went back before they closed and bought a bottle. So far, this stuff is awesome and I'll continue to use it as long as it works. I have been battling the last 10-15 pounds for years! All because I have uncontrollable cravings. I work out and they get even worse. This is my answer :)
