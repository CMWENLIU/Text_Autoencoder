I remembered these from my youth - but now so hard to find...my husband found a way to purchase them on Amazon and HAD TO HAVE THEM for Christmas. I ordered to 2 boxes not sure how they would be packaged.  Thankfully, the box contains individual packages that hold 24 Tootsie Pop Drops in each package.  Flavors included: cherry, grape, blue raspberry, and orange.  TAAAASTY.  Always a good snack, but now in a convienent little package! YUMMY.  BTW -- I have since found these being sold at Cracker Barrel!!  Who knew!
