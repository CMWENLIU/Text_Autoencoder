Review Update: 5/2/2012: Culinary Elite brand black garlic on Amazon is a better value than this one is now. You get 2.2 oz for $6.75 on Amazon and their shipping is cheaper and it comes peeled so you are not paying for the majority of the weight in stuff you throw out like the core and peels. You wind up getting twice as much black garlic for half the price by ordering Culinary Elite. This one is good too but it is unpeeled and comes in a bag rather than a  tub and the weight you pay for includes the cores and the peels and the stems in this brand.  I liked it, but Culinary Elite is a better value.<br /><br />Black garlic is super soft so it's very difficult to peel if you buy it unpeeled. No matter what brand you get, I suggest buying peeled only. It's a mess to peel and gets all under your nails if it's really fresh black garlic.<br /><br />Original review:<br />---------------------<br /><br />Black garlic may sound odd but one bite and you'll be an addict.<br /><br />You may have seen it on cooking shows by elite chefs; it's not easy to find unless you are in a very nice restaurant...or my kitchen. Because I'm a huge fan. And now, apparently, on Amazon too.<br /><br />Used in China for quite some time, it is used originally as a homeopathic cancer fighter due to it's richness in antioxidants and fighter of free radicals.<br /><br />But one taste and you'll be in heaven.<br /><br />It takes over a month to make one clove. Why? It is heated the ENTIRE time in a high humidity low temperature oven.  This acts like a balsamic vinegar reduction where you start with something a bit bitter and end up with something rich and sweet...in fact, it tastes much like a balsamic vinegar reduction/garlic fusion.<br /><br />Unlike regular garlic that exudes from your pores and is bitter, this is smooth and doesn't hang around long or emit a pore smell either! You can date and eat it! Woo Hoo! But it's so tender and sweet you can literally pop a clove in your mouth and chew and not grimace.  It's slightly jelly like and can be easily mixed in ANYTHING to make it better. I love it on pizza, in pasta, in green beans, mashed potatoes...my dad puts it on all steaks now.<br /><br />You can literally put a lot in anything and it wakes up the flavor beautifully and wonderfully...<br /><br />It is not mixed with anything...just pure garlic, cooked slowly for an exceptionally long time to make it rich, smooth, and molasses-like sweet.
