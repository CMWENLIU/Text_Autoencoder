I've been enjoying the delicious mellow flavor of Eight O'Clock Whole Bean Colombian coffee for years. Accordingly I don't normally right a review every time I order it but I was compelled by what seems to me to be a noticeable improvement in the packaging of this coffee. I ordered two packs of this 40 ounce package and they were delivered to me today. So, they've changed the color of the packaging from primarily brown to primarily white. But most importantly, the two bags I got were vacuum packed tighter than I've ever experienced before. This will undoubtedly assure that when I open that second bag a few weeks down the road, it will be every bit as fresh tasting as the first package that will be opened in about a week from now.<br /><br />It's always nice, because it's rare, to make a good thing better. Kudos to Eight O'Clock for the most excellent vacuum sealing of your product.<br /><br />By the way, do NOT buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NRD0DY">8 O' Clock Wholebean Coffee 100% Colombian - 42 oz. (Original)</a>. I and others have ordered this but the merchant shipping this ships, via fulfillment by Amazon, Eight O'Clock "Original" Whole Bean. It is not the Colombian and you will have to go through the hassle of returning it.
