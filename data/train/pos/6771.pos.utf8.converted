I'm not a very good baker, but I have been sooo craving cinnamon rolls.  I was worried when I read some of the reviews, but I didn't add anything special and they turned out fine.  Well, except for two things: #1, because the mix makes 11 rolls, I put water in the empty muffin holder.  That may have helped them to be so moist and almost slightly fluffy.  And #2, anything tastes good with a cream cheese glaze/frosting so I mixed together 4oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsps milk, and 1/2 tsp vanilla and generously frosted the rolls while they were still warm.  I had plenty of frosting left over, so I put it in a baggie and will use it for the next time I make rolls.  I'll just cut a corner of the baggie and squirt the frosting out.  Oh, wait, there's one more thing I did differently.  Before I rolled out the dough, I was going to flour the board (with gluten free flour) but decided instead to lightly sugar it instead.  I dusted the rolling pin now and then with it, and the dough didn't stick to anything.  I've eaten quite a few now and they were delicious straight out of the oven piping hot, slightly warm later on, and cold hours later. They were pretty easy to make, and I am so full now. (A note: my son is not gluten sensitive he's just allergic to wheat so I don't know if the frosting I made is gluten free or not. You'd have to check that out yourself.)
