I have a very picky, nervous cat that until this food came along had very bad problems with all other food given to her. She had a tendency to get sick a lot and groom herself bald on her belly and legs. She also had problems with stomach and mouth ulcers. All of that has gone with this new food. She has also grown a full fur coat back and put on 2 - 3 pounds. I am very happy and impressed.
