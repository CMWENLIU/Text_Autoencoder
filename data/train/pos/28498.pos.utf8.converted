I have filled all my salt shakers with Redmond's Real Salt. I learned about it when I was researching the pH Miracle Diet.  Dr. Young taught me how important natural sea salt is to the body. I've heard others say that sea salt tastes better than refined salt, but my taste buds aren't that discerning. I just know that Real Salt is healthier than table salt and I can't tell the difference in taste.
