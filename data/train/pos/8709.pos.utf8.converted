I've started eating a can of these for breakfast on many days.  There are typically only three per can because they are so plump, but the can is still packed full, and they have a distinctively mild taste when compared to other canned sardines I've had.  Sure, they smell fishy, but it's not the "slap in the face with a cold fish" kind of fishy.  In fact, dare I say they taste almost...uh...fresh?<br /><br />Well, almost, but these are the best canned sardines I've ever had.  Hurray for Spain!
