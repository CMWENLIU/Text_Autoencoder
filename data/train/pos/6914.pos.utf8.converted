I have been using Tropical Tradition Coconut Oil for years, primarily for saut&eacute;ing and home-made granola. I had never heard of Coconut Manna and was not quite sure what it was, but it sounded interesting to try it out.<br /><br /> MY EXPERIENCE: When I received it I wasn't quite sure what to think. It was very solid and obviously had melted, then re-solidified on its side. In addition, I could see there were 2 layers of different colors that had separated. The dark layer tasted pretty darn good and the lighter layer was oily. I was able to get on Nutiva's web site and get their 800-993-4367 x2 number and they had a very helpful guy on the phone that helped me understand the product. Let me share this with you:<br /><br />ABOUT THE PRODUCT: It is a whole-food product, meaning it is 100% coconut with very little processing. The difference between this and coconut oil is that coconut oil is put through a cold expresser process to get the oil out. Both are fresh-harvest coconuts that are dried, but the Manna is ground into a very fine powder right after drying. Then, they add some of their coconut oil (that's the light colored separate layer I saw when I opened my jar of Manna). In addition, Manna is lower in calories than coconut oil.<br /><br />PLEASE READ FOR CORRECT USE OF THE PRODUCT: According to the Nutiva guy on the phone, you really need to soften the product and mix thoroughly to truly appreciate the full spectrum of this amazing product. When I followed his instructions, I can assure you that this is an absolutely WONDERFUL coconut product!!!! It must be softened by achieving a temperature above 76 degrees and then mixed thoroughly. If you live in a warm climate, you won't have to worry about softening, but for my cool Oregon climate I need to soften before use. There were a couple suggestions the Nutiva guy had to soften the product, plus I've added my own recommendation listed on item #3:<br /><br />1. Run tap water to the very hottest setting, then fill a bowl and put the Manna container in the bowl for 10-15 minutes. After that time mix well before serving. (From my experiment, you need to refill with hot water several times and it takes more like 30-60 minutes to achieve softness.)<br /><br />2. Better way is if you have a gas oven. Place the Manna container in the oven without turning it on. With just the gas pilot, it will warm enough to soften the Manna, and then mix well before serving. You can actually store it in your gas oven, just remember to remove before turning the oven on or you'll have a disaster on your hands.<br /><br />3. If you have a food dehydrator, open the lid of the Manna container and put it in the dehydrator on a very low setting higher than 76 and below 100. After 15 minutes, stir the Manna, and then put back in for another 15 minutes, then mix well before serving.<br /><br />I absolutely love the taste and texture of this product and could eat it right out of the container. It's wonderful on crackers, sweets, or bread and adds a lovely taste to my green smoothies. This will not replace my regular coconut oil for saut&eacute;ing, but is a nice "special treat" that is both healthy and delicious.  I tried saut&eacute;ing in Manna, with mixed results: it tends to turn brown and add a burned flavor.<br /><br />MOST IMPORTANTLY: I would really like it if the product was distributed in glass rather than plastic. In my opinion, heating and eating products in plastic containers is questionable and I believe detrimental to this planet and our health. PLEASE Nutiva, switch over to glass containers!!! I will reuse the glass containers and it is the `right' thing to do for your customers. I have purchased coconut oil for years from Tropical Traditions web site and their pricing is comparable to yours, except they distribute in glass containers.<br /><br />HERE'S MY EVALUTATION ON NUTIVA'S PRICES VS.
