It tastes better than any other Stevia product I have tasted but it still is not as sweet as most artificial sweetners, which can be good or bad depending on your own tastes. I think it does not overpower things as Splenda does with the too sweet taste in things such as tea but for adding to cereal I will stick with Splenda. I guess the final is that it has it's place in line and it is definately right in line with Splenda in my book, each has it's uses that it is best at.<br /><br />Update.... As I have tried other stevia products now I have come to the realization that this is my favorite and I now use it daily. It is good as a sweetener in most anything but I still do my baking with Splenda since it tastes better in baked goods than the stevia. I will say that after you get used to using stevia nad you experiment with how much you really need to use then you won't have the aftertaste that many reviewers complain about, somtimes a whole packet can be a little too much and sometimes it is just not enough...
