This water tastes good, and after drinking it for a few weeks, it has most certainly helped with my indigestion and acid reflux.  I also feel like I can drink more of it without getting bloated than I did with Evian.  It tastes smooth and does well at quenching my thirst, better than some other bottled waters I have tried.<br /><br />I have now subscribed to a couple of cases of this direct from Amazon each month, as the price per liter works out less than I was paying for Evian from the store on a regular basis, and with a subcription, the shipping is always free.  Hard to beat that.<br /><br />Not sure why anyone would want to get same size bottles from the NutriCity listing for this on Amazon, as the price listed there is currently listed at $66.33, and no option to use amazon prime or to be able to subcribe and save.
