This review comes with a mild warning: Moxie is a decidedly acquired taste.<br /><br />I was introduced to this soda when I was about 7 years old, by a friend of my parents', and I'm sure I wasn't at all taken with it at the time; but I felt compelled on subsequent visits to request that 'Jack' give me another glass of the stuff. Over time, it became one of the foremost memories of growing up, and is now a big part of my Yankeeism. I search it out when I go home for visits; crow triumphantly if I find it in a chain grocery; and feel a little more happy and at home if I manage to have any in my abode out here, where nobody has even heard of it.<br /><br />I did a little research on it before writing this, and discovered that it was first developed (apparently without fizz) in 1876, modified later on as a bubbly soda, and heavily promoted in New England with the "Make Mine Moxie!" advertisement. As I said, it's an acquired taste; with a base of gentian root, it's rather like the Guinness Stout of colas, thick and dark, with a bitter undertaste that the novice might not care for at all. The adventurous and those looking for new soft-drink experiences will find it very different from Coke, while it remains a cola of sorts. Once you have been hooked, however, nothing else will quite fill the place of it. A friend shipped some out for me this year, and it was the best present I had under my tree.
