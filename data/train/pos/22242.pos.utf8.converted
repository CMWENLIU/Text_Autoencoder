Night and day difference from other brands I had used.  On LC diet, these work great with alittle taco meat and lettuce, taste great. I put them in a pan for few minutes, nothing but heat, and they come out with a great texture.  I also have made Chicken QUESADILLA with checking pieces and cheese, back to back, in pan.  Works and tast's great!!! Highly recommended, and lots of Fiber to add to my daily count.  Best I have tasted of the many, many types out there.  Glad I took the plunge, will never go back to the Safeway or other ones i've used in the past.
