I was very excited to find this item since Lipton changed it's recipe.  This product is from Canada, but is almost identical to the old Lipton Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup that used to be sold in the USA.  Unlike the new version, there are no hard carrot blocks to filter out of this soup. Great taste for a quick meal, or when you aren't feeling well.
