My 1 year old Siberian cat, Mimic, loves this stuff. He would prefer to eat only the dry Taste of the Wild for ever and ever. But I do worry about his urinary health, so I supplement with some wet food every day. He used to be on Merrick wet, but when my local store started carrying the Taste of the Wild wet, I gave it a try, and now it's the only wet food he'll eat.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of addictive substance they put in the food (my guess is it's the sweet potato, which is kind of an unusual cat food ingredient), but he loves it. I also know that his breeder uses it now, as do a few of my friends. And all of the cats seem to love the stuff.<br /><br />If you can find the canned, try it. It smells similar, so I'd bet that any cat who likes the dry would like the wet. It is a kind of chunky food in gravy, where the chunks are like tiny pieces of meatloaf.<br /><br />Ultimately, I have not found a better balance of price, quality of ingredients, and  palatability for Mimic.
