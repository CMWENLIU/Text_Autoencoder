I heard about this product, but I couldn't find it anywhere in my local store. I was glad to find it at the Amazon. It came quickly. It is so fine, I don't know wether I need to rinse it or not. Anyway, I rinsed it once, it is hard to get rid of rinsing water without loosing the grains. I cooked the Teff with millet or quinoa. It turned out very tasty with added flavor and a little gelatin texture. My kids doesn't like quinoa by itself, it has a special flavor they don't like, with teff, it covered the quinoa taste and made it taste better. If you cook millet by itself, it is too dry, with teff, it adds some gelatin texture to it. I also grind it to flour, and add it to baking. It was great. I already used up one bag.
