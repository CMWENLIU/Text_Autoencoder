I am a Chaga lover and was looking for a pure product to enjoy.  I stumbled upon this tea while looking for pure Chaga drops and decided to try a box. When it arrived I brewed a cup and noticed one tea bag was strong enough to easily make two cups of dark strong Chaga brew. If you have used the pure drops before you can tell that the tea is a rich deep color full of Chaga, a powerful antioxidant.  I have been enjoying Chaga in pure liquid form for years but now love the tea even more.  The price is right for me because I get 40 cups from 20 bags. It's also very versatile for me because I make iced tea and drink it throughout the day. A huge savings over the drops with the same amount of health benefits. My sister tried mine and had to have it, and so did my neighbor, so of course, I have already ordered several more.  The fast shipping and excellent communication from Sayan makes it an even sweeter deal.
