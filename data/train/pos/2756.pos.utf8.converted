Haribo's Gold Bears are the best gummy bears I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of different gummy bears.<br /><br />A lot of brands are way too sweet and way too soft - they're almost like slightly firmer Jello, but Haribo's are just right.  Not too sweet, not mushy-soft.  Just right.  The perfect bears.<br /><br />Haribo's flavors are yummy, mellow, and not so sickeningly sweet as cheap-o brands.  The crappy super-sweet bears are so sweet that my teeth feel funny after I chew them (like they're instantly rotting from the excess sugar), and they give me a stomachache.<br /><br />Haribo Gold Bears!  The perfect bears!
