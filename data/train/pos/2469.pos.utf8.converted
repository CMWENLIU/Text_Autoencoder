Dr Brown's Cel Ray soda is the pot of proverbial gold waiting at the end of the rainbow. My favorite part of drinking Celray soda is the fresh, slightly peppery, celery bouquet that greets you upon opening the can. For me, this is one of those rare culinary treats in the world, and I have traveled the world.<br /><br />Dr Brown's Cel Ray soda is best enjoyed freshly poured into a 12 oz glass filled with fresh dry ice cubes. Lifting the glass to your face to feel the tingle of the fine spray of escaping carbonation, you inhale the celery bouquet, as if tasting a fine wine. Unlike wines however, the refreshing bouquet and taste of Dr Brown's Cel Ray is always a dependable and repeatable experience. The increasingly difficult part is unfortunately, that it's becoming more and more difficult to find, even in New York. Someone needs to contact the company and find out why this is so.<br /><br />5 star product!
