This is THE best cup of tea I've found, after trying many other English Breakfast and Assam varieties looking for a hearty, strong brew.  It really is, as the advert says, rich and malty.  This entirely satisfying tea will restore strength to the weary and provide them with the fortitude they need to get on with tasks that ordinary tea drinkers would find daunting and which would leave coffee drinkers edgy and confused.
