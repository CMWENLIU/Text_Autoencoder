Believe it or not, I bought a case of unfrosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts as a Christmas gift! I couldn't find these in ANY grocery store in my area, so I was thrilled to see I could order these from Amazon grocery. There was a glitch with my order; instead of getting a whole case I only received one box. In a panic, I emailed customer service, and within a few days I had the other 11 boxes. The recipient of this gift was so happy! (she's not in to the frosted pop tarts). Thanks Amazon!
