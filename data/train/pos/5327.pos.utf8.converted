I heard about Mangosteen Juice from my daughter (a Reiki Master and massage therapist) and a friend who is involved in alternative medicines. I liked what I read about mangosteen100 by Genesis Today, so I decided to order some. I ordered 2 different brands to compare. mangosteen100 by Genesis Today arrived first. I took a 2oz dose before supper and 3 doses the next day. The following morning I was fixing breakfast and all of a sudden it dawned on me that my low back pain that I have had for about 40 years, was gone. That sold me! Everything else it fixes is gravy. The other brand, which I tried for the next 4 days lost whatever Genesis Today's Mangosteen100 had gained to eliminate my low back pain. The pain was back. There are a lot of imitations out there that play with adding flavor which dilutes the Mangosten and is in a smaler bottle--that means less medicinal benefit per dose and fewer doses per bottle. I think I found a winner. By the way, when I went back to the orginal (first) product, the pain was gone again unless I really overdue it.
