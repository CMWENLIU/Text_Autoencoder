I haven't actually made anything with it yet, but this saffron is definitely  fragrant and appears to be high quality. There's enough in the little box to last me for quite a while (if I had to guess, I'd say it's about 2 or 3 tablespoons, but that could be really inaccurate.) I had a few issues getting the box open without spilling the saffron everywhere, but I have a feeling that someone with a nice strong fingernail would be able to open it fairly easily.
