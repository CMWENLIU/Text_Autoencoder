Just wanted to follow up on the last post. Muir Glen recently announced that they no longer use BPA in their can lining, starting with the fall 2010 harvest! Cans without BPA are being shipped now, so cans you find in stores now may or may not contain it. I am so happy to see a brand that I can actually find in my grocery store commit to not using BPA. Plus, I really like their canned tomatoes and think the quality is better than Hunt's. Their crushed tomatoes with basil actually contain whole basil leaves, not just basil "flavor."
