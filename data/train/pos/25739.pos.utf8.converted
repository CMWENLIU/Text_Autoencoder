Hopefully, my title says it all.  I have a very high-strung 2.5 year old herding breed dog.  Last year he was fine with thunder and fireworks.  This year, he's a mess.<br /><br />Yesterday, when I left his new bottle of Pet Calm at home and went with him to my mom's, he was trying to dig through the drywall, climb into my t-shirt, was panting, drooling, wide-eyed, and I could feel his muscles bunching and clenching.  His whole body was shaking.  The 3rd of July fireworks were driving him crazy.<br /><br />Today, on the 4th, I gave him Pet Calm (3 droppers and he's 50 lbs.) and wrapped him in an Ace Wrap (google search TTouch Ace Wrap dog instructions).  The fireworks are going off in the park right behind my condo.  My dog is calm, laying in the middle of the floor, looking not too concerned.  He does get up and move when there's a strong boom, but otherwise, he looks very calm.  He does not look dopey or drugged.<br /><br />I was about to go to the vet's and get Acepromazine or Xanax for him, but I don't think it will be necessary.<br /><br />I used the Pet Calm late last night without the Ace Wrap, and had the same resulting calmness and he slept in his own bed instead of under mine.<br /><br />Great product!  I'm stocking up!<br /><br />Side note: I do not think this product will work to calm a generally hyper dog.  If you have a young herding or other active dog breed, you'll still have to walk him, to the tune of him running sometimes over 20 miles a day (that's what my dog needs). Sorry.  This product just won't change a dog's overall energy level or behavior problems relating to it! :0)
