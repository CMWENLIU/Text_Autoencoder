My sisters and I started the GFCF diet about 3 months ago for all six of our children. We each have two children. Anyway, my mother bought these for the children for a snack and I will tell you everyone in my family who has tasted these finds them absolutely addictive. My husband and my brother-in-law now both have to have a can of these every week. They won't even share with my sister and I so we, of course have to buy our own can. lol. Our children can't get enough of them. Seriously the best cookie ever. None of us even liked macaroons before Jennies. Buy them, try them and love them, just know there isn't a patch to get help when you become addicted, but there may be enough of us to start a meeting or two. lol.
