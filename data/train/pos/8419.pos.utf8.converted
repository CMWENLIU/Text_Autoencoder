The dieter who couldn't eat a whole package in a day must have been eating these tasty little gems one by one, with a break inbetween each bite. Not my family.  We would each take a handful for a snack, and before we knew it, the bag was empty.<br /><br />But enough about the bag.  These things are tasty and provide a concentrated strawberry punch of flavor which makes "strawberry flavored" items taste lame.  With these, you get the whole range of flavors in a strawberry, sweet without being too sweet, and none of the acidic taste that you sometimes get in an underripe berry.  The dried fruit is very crunchy, without any of the gumminess that shows the manufacturer removed them from the dehydrator too early.<br /><br />My only beef is the price, although I understand why they are so expensive.  When I dried fruit, it took many pints of cleaned, stemmed and sliced berries to come up with a respectable amount of food.  My family was always finished with one batch long before the next before the next was ready. When I consider the effort involved, these snacks are probably underpriced.  But it still hurts to see an expensive packet gone before the commercials are over!
