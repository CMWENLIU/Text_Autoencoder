I'm a baker with a child who must not eat gluten (ironic, I know). But as a baker, it's been really tough to come up with something GF that has the mouth feel and flavor of either home baked or store bought bread and muffin products. Udi's products have solved that issue. The bread tastes like real bread, and doesn't break when you make a sandwich or bite into it. The muffins are so good that you wouldn't guess they are gluten free (they actually have crumbs!)--particularly if you've been trying other gluten free products out there. I highly recommend Udi's products!
