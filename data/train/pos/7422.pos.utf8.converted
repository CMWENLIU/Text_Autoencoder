These licorice wheels are awesome! I love them, however, they may not be for everyone.  They dont have a traditional licorice taste, it is less dominant and more of a sweet flavor.<br /><br />They are a little "greasy" or "waxy" but I believe this is part of the preservatives.  These do not store or keep well for long periods of time, so make sure you buy them fresh, (they even have born on dates on the bags).<br /><br />I did not like these are first and thought they were weird, because they did not taste like every other licorice.  The taste grew on me and I like that you can eat them whole, bite off a piece, or unwind it into a long string. The green frogs and rainbow frogs are my favorite "traditional" gummi products but it is a tie overall.  Careful, they are addicting. :)
