I switched to Happy Baby after learning that Earth's Best and Gerber have bpa in their baby food lids.  These pouches are bpa free.  My daughter loves them.  I usually mix the mango in with oatmeal to sweeten the oatmeal naturally.  My daughter doesn't like to eat oatmeal plain.  I usually use one package over two or three days this way.  They are also great on the run.  I can throw a couple pouches in the diaper bag and take it out when needed.  She has eaten pouches on the subway, park benches, buses, etc.  She just sucks them up with no mess.
