Eden Ume Plum Vinegar is absolutely one of my favorite condiments.  It is a lovely balance of salty, sour and sweet which is pure delight on greens, salads and brown rice.  I go through a 10 oz bottle quickly because I use it so often instead of salt.  I wish I could purchase it at Amazon but for now I have to search for it at my local health food stores and stock up on it whenever I can find it.
