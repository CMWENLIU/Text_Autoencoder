My local stores (Giant, Safeway, and Whole Foods) no longer carry this great seasoning so I had to find it online.  I was glad to learn that Amazon had it, but they were only handling it for a third-party supplier.  The third-party supplier charged a reasonable price of $4.59 for a 3-ounce shaker of Knorr Aromatic Seasoning, but the shipping and handling charge of $8.64 for one shaker seemed silly.  I ordered two shakers for $8.87 in S&H costs, which felt a little better but still was a but much since the two items weighed only 6 ounces.  One would expect that if a clerk is going to gather one item for shipment he could just as quickly and easily gather and pack two of the same item with virtually no additional time or effort required.  Since I couldn't find a better source, however, I ordered it here and was glad to be able to obtain the product.
