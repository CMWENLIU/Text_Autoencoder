First I was shocked at the size.  A little bigger than advertised, actually . Second the quality of it was great - it didn't "stink" like some bones I've gotten in the past.  My dog is a little older now (10.5 years) so she doesn't go through bones as quickly as before, and this one lasted quite a while.  Very solid, no chips or sharp points to it and it doesn't snap apart like some more brittle bones have, either - it more or less grinds down with their chewing.  I highly recommend this product, and for only $5 you're getting more than you pay for in my opinion.
