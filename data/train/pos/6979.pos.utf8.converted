It's a shame that for some reason it says on the package that this shouldn't be eating entirely in one sitting because my dog loves these.  It is all I can do to get it away from him so that he doesn't devour it all right away.  They must put doggie crack in it, because he is crazy about this chew toy!  Just for the record, he DID eat one all at one time and had no ill effects.
