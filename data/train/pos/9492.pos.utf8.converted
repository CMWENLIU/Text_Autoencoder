These taste great. One thing I really like is that inside one package there are six smaller wrappings of the crackers, so I can eat just a few crackers without worrying about the others going stale if I don't eat them soon. These are gluten, lactose, soy and preservative free. They also have some calcium and iron. The ingredients are potato starch, rice flour, buckwheat flour, eggs, palm oil, modified corn starch, dextrose, salt, yeast, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sunflower lecithin, cream of tartar, ammonium bicarbonate, natural flavor.
