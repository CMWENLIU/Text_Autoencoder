i have been enjoying genova tuna for more than 40 years! as stores cut back on stock they have chosen to eliminate the small can ( perfect for lunch )of this tuna and only sell the large one.in searching for the small can i found it at a great price and available in a 24 count box at amazon.com .the service was fast and the shipping rate was hard to beat. without a doubt i will be purchasing another case of this great tuna ,from amazon .com
