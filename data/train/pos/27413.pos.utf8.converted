Purchased this bar along with the almond bars.  Both were amazing and I will purchase again. I have tried them all, but these are by far superior. Have liked the Pure De-lite Imported Pure Belgian Chocolate Bars in the past, but tried these and will not go back. Nothing comes close to the rich taste and texture in SugarFree and carb lite bars. At approximately $1/oz, a fair price for a great product! I also received an email from the company asking of I needed special cold shipping since I lived in Texas. I have purchased since and will buy again.
