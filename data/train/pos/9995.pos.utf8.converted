There are so many different kinds of bubble gum on the market today that I would be clueless as to how to list them all.  On the other hand, with a bubble gum such as Dubble Bubble, who cares?<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has a long and glorious history.  The gum traces its history back to a bubble gum called Blibber-Blubber developed by Frank Fleer in 1906.  That gum was never marketed.  Other people at Fleer's company continued to work on the bubble gum, with the formula finished by 1928.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest change from the original Dubble Bubble to today's Dubble Bubble are the variations in flavor.  Double Bubble retains the original flavor along with a variety of other flavors, though the flavors are relatively mild.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has two features that make it one of the superior bubble gums.  First, the gum gets softer as you chew it (more on that in a moment).  Second, the gum makes excellent bubbles.  I like the fact that the gum gets softer as you chew it, though it can be quite hard initially.  There are other brands that begin soft, but seem to get chewier and stiffer the longer you chew it.  I suppose the goal with those brands is to chew the flavor out and then toss the gum.  However, with Dubble Bubble you can chew the gum for a long time and the gum remains soft.<br /><br />I have made bubbles with Double Bubble gum a long time after I started chewing the gum.  Thus, the gum maintains its softness as well as its cohesiveness for making bubbles.  For even larger bubbles you can add a second gumball once the first one has been chewed for a while.  However, I recommend you abstain from a third gumball; the size of the gum becomes cumbersome at that point.<br /><br />In spite of the huge array of bubble gums on the market today, I continue to choose Dubble Bubble Gumballs as one of my favorites.  I suspect that I always will.<br /><br />Enjoy!
