The two little darlings at my home have been eating this particular cat food since we got them from the local shelter at the ripe young age of 6 months.  We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!
