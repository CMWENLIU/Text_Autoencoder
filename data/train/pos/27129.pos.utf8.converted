As a lacto-ovo vegetarian who tries to avoid gelatin, I haven't had any marshmallows in years since they usually have fish gelatin in the kosher ones and other gelatin in mainstream ones. I picked up a bag of these marshmallows at a natural food store when we were traveling and they were the BEST. I've been looking locally since then and haven't been able to find them so I hope Amazon gets them back in stock soon.
