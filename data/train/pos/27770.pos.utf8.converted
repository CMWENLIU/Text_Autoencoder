Living on the West Coast it has always mystified me why we cannot get Mallomars here. I have come to believe it is a East Coast prejudice about how nice it is to live without crowds and smog and traffic...lol.<br /><br />So it was gratifying to me to be able to go to the interent and buy them. For those of you who are craving your fix of Mallomars, you can get them within a few days after you put in your order on Amazon. Great, right!<br />Melinda
