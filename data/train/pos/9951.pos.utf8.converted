Not only does this make a great cup of coffee and fast, but it is also eco-friendly.  It isn't using a lot of electricity plus it's made of porceline so there is no plastic or metalic taste to my coffee. It also looks very nice on my counter top and takes up less room than a conventional coffee maker.
