I have been drinking Lavazza Rossa Expresso for 25 years.But I have been getting it directly from family members in Italy for the whole time.I was incredibly surprised that Amazon had it!My family is in Rome and they bring it by the dozen for me.It's so cool that now I don't have to wait for my family to go to Rome to get my expresso coffee.AMAZON RULES!
