Organic Valley Organic Nonfat Dry Milk Powder definitely sets the standard for other dry milks!  It does not have that "processed, cardboard" taste that supermarket milks have and the fact that it is organic only adds to the wholesome nature of this item.  I mainly use dry milk for baking and when I make yogurt, so a fresh taste is essential to the finished product.<br /><br />If you're considering purchasing dry milk, I would highly recommend that you try Organic Valley.
