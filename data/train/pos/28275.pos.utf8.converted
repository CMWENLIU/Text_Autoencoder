I love brown rice. The rest of my family, not so much. So I serve this and everyone eats it happily. It has a wonderful fragrance as it cooks, and when it's done cooking, the texture is more like white rice than brown rice. It absorbs flavorings beautifully. (I use it to make my own yellow rice, which is healthier than the msg- and sodium-filled boxes in the supermarket. Comment here if you want my easy recipe.)<br /><br />There are still occasions when I want "real" brown rice, such as when I am making a brown rice salad, but mostly I reach for this one.<br /><br />When I have bought the 4-pack from Amazon (which I have several times now), the expiration date has been about a year from when I bought it.
