This was such a find for me - I have trouble locating them at my local supermarket.  Plus the price can't be beat - with free shipping and no tax, I can't even get them on sale for less when I can find them.<br /><br />I use this with all types of pasta, add grilled chicken breast and peas and have a one dish meal.  Also, I use non or low fat milk and don't add any butter.
