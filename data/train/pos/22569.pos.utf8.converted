We mainly use this in conjuction with the 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatos to make the America's test kitchen Spaghetti Sauce. It was a top pick in the cookbook which is why I started buying it and I agree.  Also makes decent salsa in the winter if you really let the tomatos drain. (Another test kitchen tip).  They are canned within hours of being picked and the cannery is next to the fields so are super ripe when picked.  It shows in the flavor.  I just read on the Muir Glenn site they are moving to BPA free liners beginning the harvest of 2011?  There is no date on the News Article so maybe it was 2010.  I hope Amazon updates the title so we know if they are BPA free.
