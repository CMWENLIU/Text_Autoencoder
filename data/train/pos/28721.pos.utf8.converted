When our spontaneous triplets were born at 34.4 weeks gestation I was determined to breastfeed them and was able to do so for the first 7 weeks, supplementing with Enfamil Enfacare (22 calorie preemie formula), as directed by our pediatrician.  In the NICU they were getting as much milk as I could make enhanced with the Enfamil and when I stopped nursing we were told we should stick with the Enfamil due to the triplets' low birth weights (5 pounds each at birth).  Once they were no longer getting breast milk their poops became more solid and bulky and much more stinky.<br /><br />Our triplets just turned 5 months old and we were given the go-ahead from the pediatrician to switch their formula to a regular formula as long as we mixed it rich, using more than the recommended amount to bulk up the calories until they were 6 months old.  I was dying to switch them because there are many food allergies in my family and knowing all the new food-allergy research I wanted the kids to get the probiotics into their system before we started solids.  We started by using the Good Start for 1/3 of their bottles, Enfacare for 2/3, to make the switch gradual and less shocking on their tummies.  They have been a little cranky and gassy while their system adjusts to a new formula but the proof is in the diaper.  Since the switch, the kids' poops have gone back to that sweet(er) smelling, yellow mustard seed looking, classic breast milk poop.  I've also  noticed that they are pooping a lot less, which means that their bodies are using the food it gets more effectively and efficiently.  I am blown away by this.  I can not believe what a huge difference just a little of this formula has made just a few days.  I feel confident that my instinct to switch them to a better formula was correct all along.<br /><br />Yes, it might not mix as easily (invest in a Dr. Brown's Formula Pitcher!) but it does not produce all the bubbles the Enfamil did, nor does it smell as bad, and it won't stain like other formulas.  The comfort proteins and probiotics make this the perfect formula.  Breast milk may be best but this is the next best thing!
