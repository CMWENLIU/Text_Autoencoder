I've sampled several at-home, instant miso soups.  Miso-Cup has the best taste and is a reasonable price.  It tastes like it was made from dashi after lots more preparation than water coming from your kettle over the mix to make.  Ingredients have a healthy, natural taste.  I happen to prefer it to some restaurants.  Each pouch contains 3 soup meals (sizeable serving), and there are 6 pouches in one shipment.  18 servings total.  High heat the water in your kettle first, by the way.  That way you will enjoy a better taste of the vegetable pack, which is the part you stir in last.<br /><br />Update 2/13/12: The soup has changed.  The soup at one time looked like it does on the packaging.  It now is very red and has a different taste.  Although the star rating is stuck at 5 for my review, I significantly change it because of the new taste.  3 stars.  I preferred the taste before because it was a cleaner broth with wakame, green onions, and tofu floating visibly.  This very red miso tastes much thicker than before, also less appetizing.<br /><br />Return to the winning recipe, please.  This is not the same.
