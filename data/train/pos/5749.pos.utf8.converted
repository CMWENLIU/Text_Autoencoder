Not much to say here.  The barley is as advertised.  The shipping was slower than I expected, especially since the state of origin isn't all that far from my home, but the price was better than I could find anywhere else.<br /><br />This is hulled barley, which has the bran intact, unlike pearl barley.  It takes longer to cook, but it also keeps better and that is what I want in a grain.  Also, of course, having the bran intact means having the bran to eat, which is more fiber in our diets.  I have cooked this whole in a stew, and it was the same as pearl barley in appearance.  I cracked it in a Corona mill and it then cooked up like rice in a soup.<br /><br />When we poured it into the storage bucket, the grain appeared clean.  There was no dirt or foreign plant material.
