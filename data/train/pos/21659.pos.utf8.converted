I must say being new to this whole "green drink" and "whole food" thing I fully expected this to taste awful (like some of the reviews have said). However being a bodybuilder I have taken some NASTY stuff, so I figured if this stuff is as good for me as it says it is, I'm drinking it no-matter the taste. I am not sure how to even respond to the people that say the taste is awful because I thought it was so good I had 3 drinks my first day!!!! The taste is amazing considering what's all in it, it tastes a lot like a slightly sweetened tea and the texture is a lot like if say your tea bag broke open a little bit. I loved it so much I ordered the larger 60 serving size. As far as the effects (mind you this is still my first day using it)...seems I'm less hungry and my stomach is not as bloated feeling as usual. The biggest reason I decided to get this is because I am trying to bump up my veggie intake and this will help. I mixed mine with water and then tried another one with milk both were great. ENJOY!<br /><br />**Update** been a couple weeks now, and the biggest things I've noticed is<br />(1)I don't feel drained and grumpy at the end of a long day anymore....feel I could keep going if needed<br />(2)Slow and steady weight loss (though keep in mind I also added a lot more veggies to my diet besides the drink)<br />(3)This I was not expecting at all, but my sex drive is through the freak'n roof now, after some research I found that an ingredient called MACA in this is prob. the cause of this welcome effect.
