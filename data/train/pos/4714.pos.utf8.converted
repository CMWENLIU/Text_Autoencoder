A native Brit - I am addicted to my PG tips. So, now that I am living in the US I am committed to buying it online. The tea is full-bodied and so flavorful. I brew it straight in my tea mug by pouring boiling water from my electric kettle straight onto the tea bag and let it steep for about a minute. It is strong enough for me by then and then I add my reduced-fat (2%) milk to reach a color akin to pale pine flooring. Drink it piping hot and its a fantastic morning pick-me-up. I prefer to buy it in packs of 40 to keep it fresh but the price on the 80s was hard to pass.
