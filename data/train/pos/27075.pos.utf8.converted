I love, love, love unfrosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts.  It has to the be unfrosted.  I can't stand that<br />hard, crusty frosting on all their other flavors.  It's the only flavor I will buy, and I could eat it everyday.<br />Unfortunately, finding a store who still carries it is becoming more and more like searching for the Holy Grail.<br />The last Wal-Mart in my city just stopped carrying them, and I almost cried.  Scotts and Kroger discontinued them<br />long ago.<br />What's up with you people?  Bring it back!  I would drive 20 miles out of my way to find it.  Now it looks like<br />I'll be ordering it strictly online from now on.  Very bad marketing, Kellogs!
