My husband and I came from Taiwan and have been living in the US for over 15 years. Normally we only buy Chinese snacks that are brand names and made in US or Taiwan. However, I was very glad to find this product in Amazon even though I just bought it today and haven't yet received it. I do know "Hot Kid" very well and used to have it for snack growing up in Taiwan. It was one of my few favorite snacks made by a well reputed Taiwanese company. I trust this brand just as I do General Mills or Kraft. It was already a major food company in Taiwan back then and "rice rusk" was the most popular product. Now, this company has made its way to becoming one of the three biggest food companies in China. Interesting enough, these three companies are all Taiwanese companies. I think the main reason is that people in China do not trust their own brands. I believe that "Hot Kid"is a quality food product. I think the worry is overdone and the red flag is unnecessary. My son is 7 months now and it was a pleasing surprise to have found this product in US.
