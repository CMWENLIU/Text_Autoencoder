I purchased this jam as a result of watching Dr. Oz.  this is the best jam ever, not only is it good for you but the taste is the best I have ever tried.  I had been using a tablespoon of the jam in our protein shakes.  My husband went wild over the flavor.  Needles to say we are now addicted to this stuff.  It is wonderful on toast as well.  It has a somewhat tart taste, not too much, just right.  I have been trying to get my local grocer to get it into the store.  So far he has special ordered it for me or as always you can order from Amazon.com, which I have always been very satisfied with.  Try it, you'll love it!
