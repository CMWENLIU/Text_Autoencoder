The six pack is a good value, really no more than I'd pay for tea in the grocery store.  I LOVE this tea, it is much stronger and full bodied than "normal tea" and mixing the Earl Grey with lavender gives it a great taste. Most people would probably want to add sugar but as I have stopped drinking coffee, this is the right amount of slightly bitterness that works for me.  Much better than regular Earl Grey tea.  Have not tried the other flavors as I don't like fruity teas.  This stuff is great.
