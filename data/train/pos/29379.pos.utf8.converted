I spent a considerable amount of money buying kefir from WholeFoods (at $3.99 a quart) until I discovered these miraculous grains. Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule "grains" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money.
