Most juices tend to have a bitter taste when they are pure like this, and this is the sweetest, BEST cherry juice...EVER.  We are thrilled!  My husband does not like to drink any kind of fruit or vegetable juice....and he gets GOUT...which this helps tremendously.  Not only has he NOT had any flair ups since drinking this juice, he LOOKS FORWARD to having it!  He's tried many others and it's always a chore to have to drink....but this juice he LOVES!  Thank you Lakewood for making this task turn into a pleasure with your juice!
