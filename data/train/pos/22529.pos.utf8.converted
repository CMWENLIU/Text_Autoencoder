I received a Keurig machine for my birthday last month. I have tried so many types of k-cups I've lost count! But, the Green Mountain Pumpkin Spice is one I'm sticking with. I wish it was offered year round, because when I run out; I am really going to miss it! It may not be an extra bold flavor, but it is full of flavor when used on the 6 ounce setting. I've been using two teaspoons of non-flavored liquid creamer and one teaspoon of sugar to a 6 ounce cup, and it tastes really good! It's the closest thing to a pumpkin spice latte I can make in the comfort of my own home. As a person who is relatively new to Keurig, I have learned that it is best to use exact measurements with cream and sugar, so you can figure out exactly how you like it and stick with it, so you can have a perfect cup of coffee every time. I should also mention that I do not normally like flavored coffees, but I love this one!
