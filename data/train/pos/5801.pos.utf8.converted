I drink only flavored coffee.  Thus far, my favorites are Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee; Timothy's German Chocolate Cake; Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Spicy Mayan Chocolate.  The last one was my No. 1 favorite, so I was heartbroken to learn that it has been discontinued. I am currently rationing each precious K-Cup from my very last box of 24.<br /><br />Two days ago, I saw and purchased my first box of Folger's Vanilla Biscotti,  (Who knew that Folger's made K-cups?)  It's too soon to know for certain, but there is a good chance this flavor will make my list of favorites.  The good news is that Target sells it and other 18 count boxes of Folger K-Cups for $10.85.  That means you can buy 36 for $21.70.  Compare that to the greedy sellers on this page who get $48.46 and $43.04 (with shipping) respectively.
