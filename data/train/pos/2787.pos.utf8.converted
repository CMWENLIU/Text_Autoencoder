Our son is now 11 months old and we've been using this brand since he started baby food. The taste is as close to the real thing as possibly. Other brands seem watered down compared to Earth's Best. The texture is smooth and flavorful. I like that they have a large variety of HEALTHY options that combine a whole variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and meats. In my opinion, there is no nutrition in mac and cheese so why bother giving it to them. They have different stages that seem to have been very appropriate for the eating abilities of my son. The soups served as a great transition to table food. It has bite size, soft pieces of vegetables and meats in a smooth baby food broth similar to consistency of regular babyfood.
