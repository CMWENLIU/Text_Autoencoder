Ok, so if you are looking for something thats going to raise the heat level of anything you are eating, this is it. I had used some Pure Cap (500,000 SHU) and I had to still add 10-20 drops into whatever I was eating to raise the food to the heat level where I am sweeting and nervously tapping my leg as I eat. With Mad Dog 357, I only needed one drop. I put one drop in my cup of noodles last night and I would not have added another.<br /><br />If you are the kind of person who either cant really taste the heat anymore, or have to add so much hot sauce that your food tastes like hot sauce instead of the actual food, then this is for you. Instantly add copious amounts of heat to your food without augmenting the flavor, I recommend purchasing an eye dropper to dole this stuff out and make sure you wash your hands. My forehead was burning for an hour last night because I used my fingers to wipe the sweat from my brow (after I washed them mind you).<br /><br />Anyway, get this is you are a pepper nut and like excess.
