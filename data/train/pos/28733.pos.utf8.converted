These lids work great.  There are two inner seals/lips so it can fit two different can sizes.  The measurements are 3 inch and 3 3/8 inch diameter.  This happens to fit a 5.0 - 6.0 oz can of pet food.  It worked for all my cans.<br /><br />I wished I had noticed each package comes with TWO lids inside.  I ended up ordering way too many.  The spoon slot it neat, but I doubt I will use it.  Slot seals up just fine without a spoon in it.  Lids are a thick, flexible type of rubber - not a hard, plastic lid (which breaks).
