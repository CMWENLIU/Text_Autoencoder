I wouldn't rate this five stars if the rating applied only to the quality of the coffee.  That said, this is a very good coffee and is likely superior to the gourmet coffees that have been sitting on the shelf in a typical supermarket.  It's well rounded, neither too acidic nor bland for my tastes, and I look forward to the couple cups I start my day with.  Note that last qualification; it's extremely important.<br /><br />In the vast scheme of things, five pounds of coffee is not a lot.  I'm fairly certain that there are many places the world over where more coffee has accumulated.  Even my child weighed more than five pounds at birth, and I'm grateful for that.  However five pounds of coffee delivered to my house is more coffee than has ever gathered there, and if it were five pounds of bad coffee... well, that's kind of a serious situation to have on one's hands.<br /><br />Thankfully the coffee is pretty good and in the nearly three months it's taken me to work my way through it I've had no regrets. So put those beans in the freezer (store it in smaller zip-lock bags if the package is too bulky), only grind what you need when you need it, and enjoy.<br /><br />I give it five stars because it's very good coffee at an excellent price.
