I'm doing the ketogenic low-carb diet that restricts my carbs to less than 20 a day. I never thought I'd eat chocolate again! These bars are the real deal, great tasting dark chocolate that even chocolate lovers will LOVE! Atkins bars, and any others with alcohol-sugars will knock you out of ketosis and stall your weight loss, these don't! I use keto-stix by Bayer to check for ketones (the evidence of being in ketosis)and Atkins knocked me out of ketosis and these don't. Plus these taste better! Best low carb product, period!!! Did I mention I like them?!
