This Cinnamon by Frontier is a very good value for the money, especially if you don't mind buying in bulk. The cinnamon has a fresh and wonderful taste and smell. Much better than any supermarket stuff. I keep the cinnamon fresh by putting it into freezer ziplock bags and freezing it. It's easy to take out of the freezer and use right from the bag, no thawing needed.<br /><br />As stated by a few other reviewers, this cinnamon is from Cassia and according to Wikipedia the "cinnamon" we get here isn't "true cinnamon" and it contains coumarin which is bad for your liver and kidneys at least. It's ok in small amounts and most people would never use a lot in their cooking that would do harm. According to the web site "spice page" you can eat up to one gram without getting the coumarin poisoning. PLEASE research this for yourself!<br /><br />So this cinnamon is not for people that take it for diabetes/sugar metabolism and other health benefits. USE THIS TYPE ONLY for use as a spice in your recipes or to sprinkle on food for added flavor.<br /><br />Frontier DOES sell the more expensive cinnamon that is good and beneficial to you. It's called Ceylon cinnamon, and it's the real deal. So if money is not an issue, or you are very concerned about your health and possible coumarin poisoning, please do not buy this type and go for the Ceylon Cinnamon.
