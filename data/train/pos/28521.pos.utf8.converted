I have tried many brands of almond butter because I can not eat peanuts. I ordered<br />some of this from amazon(great service btw) and i was a little concerned when i opened it because it looked almost like peanut butter. I called the company directly in California. They put the plant manager on the phone to answer my questions. I asked him why it was a different color than i was used to.(most almond butters are sort of grayish). He told me that they don't grind the skins with the almonds. Also the top grade of palm fruit oil that they use is high in cartenoids and helps to keep this product stable (not rancid) and adds to the color. Also they process this product to keep it as natural and roasted flavor filled as possible. I was impressed with the manager, the product and the company. Google the company history and learn about Jennifer Barney. [...]<br />What can I say this is the BEST TASTING almond butter out there In my opinion.
