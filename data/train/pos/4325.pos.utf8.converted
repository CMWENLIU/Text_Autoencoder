Stored in the fridge, this product lasts for years, and remains insect free and ready to add to anything to which you wish to add extra body during the baking process.......this high quality gluten does a great job of trapping the bubbles of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast and your baked goods will rise much higher and be lighter to the taste.
