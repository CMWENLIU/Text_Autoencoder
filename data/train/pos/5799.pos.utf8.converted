My dogs LOVE the Yummy Chummies and we've been giving them to all three since they were puppies (our oldest is now 5). We normally buy them at COSTCO but they were out for two months, so I ordered them at Amazon. Quite a mark up guys! I pay $9.39 for a 2.5 lb bag at Costco and $25.00 at Amazon!! Today, Costco carried them again, so I stocked up. They are excellent treats and my dogs are worth it, but come on guys, THAT much of a markup?? Yikes!
