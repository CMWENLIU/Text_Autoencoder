I am baking a vegan wedding cake for my niece.  I ordered this sugar because it is not filtered through any animals bones.  There is no difference between this sugar and what you get from your supermarket except that this seems much fresher.  It is very nice to use.  The sugar arrived promptly and I expect to order more of it.
