I discovered this delicious flavor during a visit to my local Joe Muggs Cafe - and I was instantly hooked. So rich, thick & the flavor lasts until the last sip. I was thrilled to find this product, here on Amazon, and immediately placed my order.<br />Which leads me to the second part of this review - that of Beverage Gourmet...reliable, dependable, the package arrived on time as promised and even though the pump was missing from my order - I simply sent through the "formatted problem with this order" section available here at Amazon and within an hour or so received a very courteous, apologetic reply. BG shipped the missing portion of my original order via UPS and it arrived within 48 hours. I couldn't be happier with the product, the service and the professional, courteous manner that I was greeted with and the manner in which my issues were resolved should be held out as 'the' example of top notch customer service.
