Matcha is purported to have elevated antioxidant and cognitive benefits above standard green teas and was the reason for the purchase. The price is also correspondingly higher, and this brand was the least expensive with the most favorable reviews available on Amazon. This product was my introduction to matcha, and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems a more potent version of your typical, off-the-shelf green tea in just about every way. As a regular tea drinker, I can definitely see this becoming a frequent addition to the different teas I consume on a regular basis.<br /><br />The reason for the deduction of two stars was the packaging. The small box the tea is shipped in is small and relatively flimsy, but is sealed, which is not a big deal. However, as another reviewer testified, the plastic bag inside that actually contains the ground tea was not only partially unsealed, but I would estimate maybe a half tablespoon of powder escaped the bag's 'seal.' This is absolutely unacceptable. I don't care if you're shipping sand; any powder, let alone tea, let alone a finer grade of tea, needs to be completely sealed with an extraordinarily-high level of confidence that the bag is secure. I fail to believe this cannot be achieved within the boundaries of both successfully cost-effective and green packaging.<br /><br />As a broke university student trying to maximize dietary healthfulness on a restricted budget, I'd very much like to include matcha in my regular tea consumption, but I'm not sure I'll order again from this outfit. The unprofessional feel I experienced from this product was not insignificant.<br /><br />*****UPDATE - 10/13/11*****: I since reordered this product, and I was indeed surprised to find that any packaging concerns have been completely resolved. As in the pictures listed on the product page, the flimsy plastic the tea came in previously has been replaced by a thick, folded, brown bag placed inside a very solid tin - which I'm sure I'll reuse. The tea itself is fantastic and now it comes with killer packaging. Zero complaints about this product now; 5 big stars.
