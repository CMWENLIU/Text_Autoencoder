This is a bulk rendition of the same wild rice product that you can pick up individually at your grocery store for a bit more money per box.  It's well packaged, and perfectly sized for many of the recipes I use.<br /><br />I've never seen any "worms" -- though fully-cooked wild rice does look a bit like them!  It's really not likely that a company could continue selling a product that was contaminated like that.  For me this has been a good product at a good price. I'll keep getting it here.
