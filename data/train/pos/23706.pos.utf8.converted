Have tasted only one out of 12 teas, but it was wonderful--- green tea jsmine lotus blossom. Great flavor, light and delicate but with lots of flavor. The flower that unfolded was beautiful. A definite baragain for the price. Other places were at least double the  cost. I highly reccommend Primula flowering tea.
