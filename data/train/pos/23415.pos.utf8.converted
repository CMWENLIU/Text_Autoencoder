This product is very effective and I can not emphasize enough how good it is to promote hair growth, strengh and shine.  It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray at bay.  I wish I had found it many, many years earlier.  I mix a spoonful of Shikakai and Amla powder on my regular conditioner and use it once or twice a week when I wash my hair. I also mix a spoonful of Brahmi powder in my regular shampoo.  I will always, always use this product along with Amla and Brahmi powders. These powders are just that good.
