Excellent product! It's become a kitchen staple--supplements stir-fry dishes, meats, eggs, pasta sauces, salads --with not overly-pungent garlic flavor. Also contains sea salt, so keep this in mind when adding to recipes. I use frequently with steamed veggies--a couple spritzes adds subtle garlic flavor. Glad I found this through Amazon, because local stores stopped carrying it.
