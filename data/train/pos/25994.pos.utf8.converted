Bear in mind, different people have different metabolisms and different tastes.  From past experience, I avoid anything lemon-lime flavored.  I went with orange, which tastes like watered down OJ.  Just two ounces, small bottle fits in a knapsack or desk drawer.  When I'm crashing, caffeine just gives me the jitters and I still feel tired, no matter how much coffee or tea I drink.  I had a bad mid-afternoon crash and could hardly keep my eyes open so I drank a bottle of this stuff.  Instantly, I had mid-morning perkiness again.  Magic.  No after effects, but if you're dead tired to begin with you should probably treat the cause rather drinking energy drinks which relieve only the symptoms.  Also, if you have a high metabolism, take a small sip and wait 5 minutes.  Drink only what you need.
