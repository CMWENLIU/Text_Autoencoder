I live in Texas and this is the best brand of canned or jarred chipotles I've yet to try. Inferior brands tend to smell like overstewed salsa or Rotel gone rancid when you open them up, so you'd know right away it's not good. I find those ones to be worthless - the peppers lack that tasty smokey hotness and the adobo sauce tastes as bad as it smells. But not this brand. These smell and taste smokey and slighly vinegary like chipotles in adobo are supposed to.<br /><br />Empacadora San Marcos thankfully doesn't disguise any of their ingredients under the vague label "spices" (like other brands) so you know exactly what you're eating, and they don't use nasty soybean oil (which seems to do something strange and unpleasant to the peppers). I've also found that they are usually the lesser expensive brand on the shelf. It's even cheaper in bulk. So heck of a deal.<br /><br />The local grocery store that carried this brand here went under, and I haven't found it elsewhere so far. So I'm greatly thankful I can buy these here at Amazon. I'll gladly order these online then settle for something inferior (and any good chipotle-phile will understand that without reservation).
