Haribo makes an astonishing variety of candies. Gummi Raspberrys are an excellent candy that demonstrates the inspired imagination that sets Haribo apart from run of the mill candy makers. There are two flavors in the bag, Red Raspberry and Black Raspberry, and their tastes are believable, if maybe a tad sweet. The real inventiveness of this candy is the texture. They feel like a real raspberry when you bite into them, thanks to a coating of flavored carnauba wax "seeds" (it tastes better than it sounds!) that crunches when you chew, just like the seeds on a real raspberry.  Habit forming.
