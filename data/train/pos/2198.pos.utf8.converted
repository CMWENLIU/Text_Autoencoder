From the country of Indonesia. Warm, earthy , delicious. It has a bold taste to it and I only get it on special occasions, this one is a little harder to find. It has a very full bodied smooth taste with more earthy notes. Its a powerful blend, also the smell is to die for. I'd recommend this one if you like French Roast or Sumatra. Enjoy.
