As a connoisseur of tea, and taking it as a constant pleasure, I can tell you I have specially added this brand and flavor to my cabinet. I first bought a box at Fox and Obel, a fantastic gourmet market in downtown Chicago. The fruity overtones of this tea provide a smooth treasure of flavor that balances well with the taste of the oolong tea leaf. One cube of raw sugar really brings the taste to full flavor.
