I bought this for my wife who has many food allergies. She cannot have wheat or items containg gluten.  This is one of the best products I have found. Its crunchy and tastes great. It seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another, this product has it all.  I even like it. She absoultely loved it and I am out of the dog house.....for as long as it lasts...
