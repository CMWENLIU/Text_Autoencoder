The Taste of this tea is very nice. Not grassy like other Teas and has a nutty taste in the background. I enjoy the taste. I drink mostly Green Tea and added this Oolong tea to have more options. I haven't been drinking it long enough to know if it helps with weight loss, but it is very tasty. According to research has antioxident values and that is a great benefit added to a great tasting Tea. ENJOY!!!
