This is best tea I have had from Davidson's tea bulk company. Lot's of blueberries and pretty flower petals. They claim it is organic, but they put natural flavor in there. Please stop! Blueberries got enough flavor!<br />P.S. If you have ordered another kind of loose bulk tea from this company, expect this package to be smaller. Even though it is 16 oz, blueberries weigh a lot more that just tea petals so volume wise you get less.
