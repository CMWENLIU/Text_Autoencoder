I had purchased this salt previously from another site, and I was very happy to find it here.  I use the salt stones for a relaxing bath, the coarse salt in my salt mill, and the fine salt in my shakers.  I love the flavor of the salt, and I enjoy the fact that this salt is natural and not chemically produced like most table salt.  I hope to continue enjoying this salt for years to come.
