We love this natural creamer!  I couldn't get my husband away from the creamers that tasted so sweet and are full of corn syrup, etc...but he will use this creamer.  It's not as creamy, yes, however, it does a great job...dissolves quickly, no bitter taste and no strange color.  It fits great into our organic life-style.
