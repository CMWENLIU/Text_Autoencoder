I frequently drive long hours as part of my work and, thanks to Jolt, I don't have to worry about falling asleep at stop lights or hitting some lady with a stroller anymore. Whenever I start to feel drowsy at the wheel, I chew two or three pieces and it wakes me right up. I just keep it in the glove box. If you have a job that requires staying alert, you ought to try this.
