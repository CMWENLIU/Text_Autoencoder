I went to the west coast and fell in love with these Limon chips!  They are the best chip I've ever tasted and addictive.  Of course  when I got back to the south, they were nowhere to be found.  Everyone needs to write Lays Co. and ask them to do another survey in the south for these chips.  It's been since 2000 and people's taste have changed since then.  I'll definitely buy a case if I can find them.
