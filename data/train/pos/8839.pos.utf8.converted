Recieved this for Christmas from our daughter because we love peanuts. It's great because your hands only touch the peanuts you eat. They stay fresh in the top and it holds alot. In 1 years time only changed the batteries once. didn't even have to empty the peanuts. Just be careful not to get too large of peanuts they can get stuck.
