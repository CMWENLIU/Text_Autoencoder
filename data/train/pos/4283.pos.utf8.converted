This is the same pasta which sells for considerably more at Whole Foods, Smiths and some Albertson's. This tastes like the pasta you would be served in an upscale Italian restaurant. Since it is made from spinach (but sure doesn't test like an spinach I've had)it is very healthy and simple to make. Add your favorite sauce, or some fresh tomatoes, and a glass of wine and you will be sitting down to a very nice meal with a minimum of effort. For a change try adding some chicken, soy , meatballs or fresh vegetables.
