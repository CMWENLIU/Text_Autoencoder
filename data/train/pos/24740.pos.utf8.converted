I've always liked adzuki beans, but whenever I've bought them in bulk at various stores, they tend to be poor quality, with many rocks that have to be sorted out, as well as a few shriveled up beans here and there.<br /><br />I'm glad I tried these adzuki beans by Arrowhead Mills, because they're much better quality, but still at a reasonable price.  Every package in the case was fresh, and although there were a couple of pebbles in one bag (which is why you should ALWAYS sort dried beans before booking them, no matter what brand they are or where you got them), they were excellent over all.
