My husband has loved bread made from Pamela's Bread Mix ever since we first found it available at a specialty foods store, and we were delighted to learn of its availability in bulk, since he goes through a lot of it over the course of a year. However we have yet to make use of ANY of the bags we purchased from Amazon.com due to the fact that somewhere along the line in the supply process some sort of packing equipment being used managed to puncture every single bag we purchased. All three of the first bags we bought had identical holes in identical locations and were leaking mix out into the box. When we asked for replacements we had to wait several weeks for them to arrive, and when they did the new bags were also punctured in the same spots. Unless Amazon.com, or the manufacturer itself, is able to prompt some sort of better oversight of the equipment used to handle these bags we do not recommend you purchase this product. It's a shame that the warehouse or the operator of the equipment--whichever it is--can have turned out to be such an impediment. We were given a refund for our purchase and have discarded all six bags, unfortunately. So just beware, and check the bags as they come in. These days it seems less than prudent to use any food product that does not come in a fully sealed package.
