I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.  I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.  I just ordered my second bag of PB2!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>
