I originally got this tea as it was recommended as a helpful liver tonic.  With the thought of dandelion, I imagined a bitter tea but was pleasantly surprised at its nice light, toasted flavor.  It is almost like a roasted barley tea.  I drink this everyday now in place of plain water.  The price on Amazon was almost half of what I purchased it at the grocery store.
