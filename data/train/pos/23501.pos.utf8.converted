With 130% of the daily amount of Vitamin C and all natural, this is the drink for you.  Just one warning, it is not sweet.  In fact it is very bitter.  But remember it is pure tea, very little added.  No sugar or sweetener has touched these tea leaves before or after they were brewed.  So be warned!  Otherwise goes great with food or by itself.  Make sure to drink it chilled and enjoy!
