This is the best tasting sugar free syrup I've ever had. I love the sugar free french vanilla also. It's great in smoothies and coffee. It's a great value for the price. I thought it was a mistake when I saw the size of the bottle. I've paid $4 more for different brands that weren't even half the size and didn't taste nearly as good. I highly recommend this product.
