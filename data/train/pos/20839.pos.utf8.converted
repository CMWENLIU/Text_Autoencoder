The Anasazi lived in small spaces and knew the value of good clean air!<br /><br />These beans have a wonderful taste, need no soaking, cook fast and best of all NO OR LITTLE GAS. Add your favorite seasoning meat (salt pork, andouille sausage) salt, pepper, roasted garlic bits and a little onion. Fix a pan of cornbread and ENJOY!!!
