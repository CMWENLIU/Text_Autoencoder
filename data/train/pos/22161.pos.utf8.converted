Yep, another displaced New Yorker.  Californians can't even imagine what Duck Sauce is!!  This is a wierd state.  I grew up on Dai Day and my family has been sending me jars now and then.  Well it's summer BBQ season.  Dai Day on ribs and pork chops is just killer. I'm glad Amazon has the "Good Taste" to sell Dai Day.
