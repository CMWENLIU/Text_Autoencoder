I've used a few different kinds of GF flour including Bob's Redmill and Gluten Free Pantry and other rice flours. This one is by far the best in terms of taste and texture for all the baking that I've done with it. I love that it has recipes on the back of the bag for all sorts of breads, bagels, and other baked goods. It even includes directions for use with breadmakers. It's so easy. And the results are tasty. The breads to turn out more dense than non-GF loaf bread from the store, but that's the case with most breadmaker breads. I love this flour - I I have it on the auto-ship option because my husband and I go through so much of it.
