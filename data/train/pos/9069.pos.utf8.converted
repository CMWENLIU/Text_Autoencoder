I like orange flavor to begin with, and when I want a cup of herbal tea, I generally reach for Mandarin Spice. The flavor is a mild orange with a slight tartness and there is a bit of clove overtone, rather like a non-black tea version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BLQ">Constant Comment.</a><br /><br />The ingredients are excellent: Orange peel, hibiscus, roasted chicory, rosehips, blackberry leaves, chamomile, hawthorn, cinnamon, natural mandarin orange flavor ,other natural flavors , cloves and coriander. The hibiscus and rosehip add tartness and natural vitamin C, the chamomile is soothing, the orange and spice are delicious. The color is a pleasant orange-red. I find it doesn't require any sweetener, but if you like sweet tea, a drop of Stevia, agave, sugar or honey won't hurt it. Cold, you can mix this tea 50/50 with juice or fruit punch. The reason to do this is that you can make a juice-punch that is sweet but not overly sugary for people to sip on hot summer days. Kids like to drink juice and if you are concerned about the amount of sugar in juice, this is a great way to drink juice while cutting the sugar in half.<br /><br />It also makes an excellent tea punch with cranberry juice and fizzy water or champagne.<br /><br />We keep a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018A2YIM">3 liter hot water pot</a> on all weekend and pour glass after glass of this herb tea to keep hydrated.
