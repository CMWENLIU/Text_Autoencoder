Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Whole wheat. Great nutty flavor. Excellent for organic pasta salads. Spirals are a nice occasional "fun" change from penne.  Recyclable cardboard box. Also do really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDEXM">Hodgson Mill Organic Whole Wheat Penne with Milled Flaxseed, 12-Ounce Units (Pack of 8)</a>. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out "Vegan Grocery Favorites" and "Vegan Grocery Top Ten" in Listmania.
