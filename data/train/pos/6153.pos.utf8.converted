I needed a gift in a pinch to take to my neighbors house, who I owed a huge favor.  They have three little kids, so I was sold on the name Snackalicious. One of the little boys answered the door and his face lit up when he saw my basket full of goodies!  They opened the basket immediately and it was a huge hit.  Thank you Amazon/ig4U.
