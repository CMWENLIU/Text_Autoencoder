I couldn't disagree more with the review that claims these taste like sand. As far as gluten free cookies go it's hard to find anything more delicious than these. The fact that they're so small makes it a little tough to dip them in unhealthy things like Nutella or peanut butter, but it's still possible. They remind me a lot of Teddy Grahams, but if you look at the ingredient list you can actually recognize the ingredients instead of just a laundry list of chemicals and additives.
