Splenda...aka...sucralose<br /><br />To be clear, I do believe this is not the same SIZE bag you can readily pickup in your local supermarket.  The local Walmart, Target, Publix and Albertons bags are of the 9.7 ounce variety, not this huge gigantic bag.  So this is in essence, two of those bags for this price.  Pretty even I would think.<br /><br />I love this stuff and it for all things that need sweetening.  I put it in coffee, a little in my high fiber cereal, sometimes in high protein smoothies, sometimes to sweeten my green tea, and just about anything else I can make that needs extra sweetness.<br /><br />I don't bake yet so would think I need the bake friendly version.  ;)
