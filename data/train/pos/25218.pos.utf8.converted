It is not common knowledge that the symptoms for too much stomach acid are pretty much the same as for too little acid. As such many people, like myself, start taking tums or rolaids or a purple pill. Stomach medicine is huge industry and once on these drugs to relieve symptoms you may find yourself becoming a lifelong user. Heartburn began becoming a problem for me a few years ago, late 40's, and got worse with fatty foods like beef or grilled cheese.... I had to take something after each meal to manage the belching and burning in my chest as the problem became chronic. I heard about ACV as a home cure and gave it a try. Voila!!! In a few minutes, after the burn of drinking some straight out of the bottle passed, I noticed my symptoms got noticeably better. I tried more, 2-3x day, and after a few days/weeks the problems disappeared completely. I then got off it and took it mostly on a need be basis, or sometimes before a heavy meal, so problems would randomly occur. Then I read books on the subject and realized the many other benefits and said to myself 'I should be taking this regularly' and did. Now I get heartburn barely once or twice a year and only in connection with some meals and this only happens when I am away from home on a trip and away from my ACV.<br /><br />This stuff is great and only cost pennies/serving. The taste is, well, it's vinegar, which is weak acetic acid. I generally pour a little, about a tablespoon or so, in a glass, add a little water, and down it like a shot - horrible to sip. Sometimes I do this before a big meal but often just a hit in the morning. This, along with Carlson's Cod Liver Oil, are now part of daily healthy living supplements - I have not been sick in years and I used to get sick 1 or 2x year for almost 50 years. If you are on stomach meds for heartburn, give this a try. It may or may not be the ticket but if your problem is too little acid then STOP taking things that kill your acid pump else you may be destined to a life of worrying about what you can or cannot eat. I love my heavy and spicy foods (not every day) and now they love me back.<br /><br />Also, you want the good stuff, this brand with the mother (shaken before each use), not filtered ACV from Heinz or similar brands - these may help with acid reflux symptoms but do not include all the beneficial nutrients/enzymes of the 'mother' which are pasteurized out of almost all modern foods. Diets these days do not include essential enzymes as they are killed off during pasteurization process. The modern lifestyle has us hunting for drinks, including ACV and juices  that are filtered and clear (clean looking), but your body wants what it needs to stay healthy and this is one of those things that costs almost nothing and should be part of your standard diet/lifestyle. They used to say, 'an apple a day helps keep the doctor away.' Apples (pectin) and ACV will help keep the doctor away. Health is achieved via lifestyle; diet, exercise, rest, NOT pills. Pills often come into the picture after one leads a unhealthy lifestyle.
