BR is a great soda found in mainly the southern US, and is a very popular drink in Texas.<br /><br /> The flavor is quite hard to describe, some say bubblegum, others say vanilla, others say cherry. But it tastes great!<br /><br /> Another thing you can make is a Big Red Float. Just pour a glass of Big red into a glass, put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it and VIOLA! A great treat!<br /><br /> Try this pop out! It also comes in a new flavor, Big Red Vannila Float. BR with a hint of vanilla!
