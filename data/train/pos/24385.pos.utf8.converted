Shipment arrived fast and in a nice, practical bucket. The wheat berries sprouted perfectly and grew quickly, thick and tall! I was a bit surprised as I'd never done anything like this before, and fully expected a few trial runs before getting it right. I used Ann Wigmore's sprouting technique, and the resulting juice was hearty and dark, though still sweet and great. Highly recommended! After a few trials, though, I would say be careful not to under water. I worried about molds and fungus on the third or fourth batch (tiny spots had begun showing up) and the grass suffered for it. More water means more, better grass.
