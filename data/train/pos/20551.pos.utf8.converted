This is one of my diet staples.  When I first ate it, I admit that it sort of tasted like cardboard to me.  But that's because I was used to eating crap like cocoa krispies.  Now, I can't imagine going back.  I've grown to love the earthy flavor and substantial texture of this cereal.  I let it soak in milk a bit before eating, and if I'm in the mood for sweetness, I sweeten it with stevia or splenda.  Yum!
