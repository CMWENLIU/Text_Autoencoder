These beans come in a vacuum-sealed package to preserve freshness, and it works extremely well--all the beans that Beanilla sells are moist and plump with a wonderful texture and scent. There are multiple terrific flavors that you can get from Beanilla, but Tahitian is one that I knew well from buying it in extract form in the past. My Tahitian extract was extremely expensive, and I doled it out little by little and made it last for years. Then I discovered the fun and easy process of do-it-yourself vanilla extract, and a world of gourmet-cooking possibilities has opened up to me. My most frequent use of my vanilla extract is for homemade ice cream using my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YRJT6">Vita-Mix</a>. It adds an amazing extra zing to the taste that is just delicious.<br /><br />I had never made my own vanilla extract before I ordered from Beanilla. Their customer service is superb, and one of their representatives told me by email how to make vanilla extract when I asked, and he also explained why one might want to make his/her own vanilla extract. When you make your own, you can be 100% sure exactly what has gone into the extract, which is not always the case with some types of vanilla extract that you buy pre-made. It is also cheaper and a lot of fun to make your own.<br /><br />Here is the technique for making vanilla extract spelled out in detail for anyone who has not tried it before, and I have uploaded photos demonstrating these steps:<br /><br />1. Assemble kitchen scissors, good quality vodka, a clean, dark-glass jar (I save all my empty vitamin jars), a funnel, a spoon, something to label the jar, such as a self-sticking label.<br />2. Remove the beans from the package. Cut each bean lengthwise in half. Then cut the beans horizontally into pieces small enough to fit in the jar and easily be covered by vodka.<br />3. Place the bean pieces in the jar.<br />4. Pour 1/2 cup of vodka into the jar per every 3 beans (for 10 beans, it would be a little over 1-1/2 cup). Then tamp down the beans so that all bean parts are covered by the vodka.<br />5. Put the lid on the jar and label the jar with this information: what kind of vanilla bean you used, the date, the amount of vodka you used in ounces (or whatever measure you prefer), and the number of beans you used, then place the jar in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet (I put mine with my spices).<br />6. Every week or so shake the jar.<br />7. After 8 weeks, the vanilla extract is ready to use.
