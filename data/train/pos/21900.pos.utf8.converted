This is really good tasting gum! Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking sweet tasting treats that will not affect my blood sugar and this sugarfree gum is now very high on my list favorite things.<br /><br />The flavor is a lot Girl Scout "Thin Mints" (which was real weakness for me), but slightly more minty, and lasts a very long time. I also like that gum retains it's consistency, lasting as long as the flavor.<br /><br />I will picking up more of this great tasting gum! Note that this is sweetened with Sorbitiol which can cause gastric distress in some people, like my wife (which leaves more for me :-)<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
