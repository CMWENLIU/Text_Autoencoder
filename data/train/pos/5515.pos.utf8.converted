First off, I have to say this is the BEST value I have found on EVCO - I really didn't know how BIG this container would be until it arrived!  But the way we go through it, I might divide it into smaller containers and start keeping them in different places instead of always running to the kitchen.  The oil looks and smells fresh and creamy, but maybe I am just getting more used to coconut oil, or maybe this batch doesn't have as much of that cocoa smell?  Not that that is a bad thing, I would just say it seems more neutral, especially after cooking with it.  I have to say that since I've been using this product, I have really lost my cravings and appetite is much less - I am a stay at home mom and think about food/weight all day!!!  Adding the oil to my everyday cooking has made it easier for me to start cutting out more carbs, and have the energy to get back into doing exercise videos a couple times a week...in about 6 weeks I have lost almost 10 pounds, and it has all come off my waist and belly.  TOO EXCITED is an understatement.  Good fats make all the difference, avoid those hydrogenated ones and you'll be amazed.  I feel more relaxed and confident now that the weight really will come off (permanently) in time, without all the fuss of counting calories, fat, blah blah.  Love it!!!
