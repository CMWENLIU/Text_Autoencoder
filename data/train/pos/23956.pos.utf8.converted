I love olive oil and use it almost every day.  I'm from a Greek family so I was raised with lots of olive oil.  A year or so ago I got interested in tasting the various brands and types of olive oil on the market, sort of like I do with wine and coffee.  Anyway, this was the first that I tried in that vein and it's a winner.  I've tried quite a few others but for all around great taste, great packaging, great price and availability this is the winner.  I've made everyone in my family try it!  I still can't get over how well priced it is for such an excellent and well packaged product.
