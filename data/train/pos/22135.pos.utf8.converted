I live in Chicago and I always stop at Portillo's to get a smoothie.  I like the Pina Colada smoothies, but they can be a little costly.  I love Torani's syrups and when I found the puree's I simply fell in love!  They are better than Portillo's.  All you need is low fat milk and ice and you've got the best smoothie ever!  I imagine you can use it for cakes, as well, but it makes a really great smoothie. Also, try it with rum for a pina colada cocktail.  Check it out!  You'll be hooked just like I am.
