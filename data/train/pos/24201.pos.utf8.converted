My dog used to be on Nutro Natural Choice - recommended by a petsmart clerk... and his stool was always soft-runny and he went maybe three to five times a day. He was also very stinky.  I switched him to Innova puppy food and let me tell you... the results were almost instantaneous.  In a week, he stopped smelling bad and his stool became hard and he only went twice a day.  It regulated his bowels so much I could not be happier.  He looks better and has more energy.  He will NOT go near the old food.  We wanted to know if he had a taste preference as we suspected that he was eating less of his old food right before we made the switch.  So we tried mixing the two foods and he would take a mouthful, spit it out on the ground, and only eat the Innova!  This food is so great for him! I am so happy.  Perfect ingredients for a young puppy.  Do yourself and your dog a favor, educate yourself by going to [...].  Don't feed your dog Iams or the other big brands like Nutro, Pedigree, Beneful... They put the worst stuff in their foods!
