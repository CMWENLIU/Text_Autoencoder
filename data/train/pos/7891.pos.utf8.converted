We used these hash browns camping on a wilderness camping and fishing trip. They tasted as good as if they where fresh grated from potatoes. I recommend for home as well as any camping trip. So easy to make. Hydrated with boiling water for twelve minutes in the existing container, then fried up with a bit of oil. WOW, very great product.
