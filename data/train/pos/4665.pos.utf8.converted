I usually make mine from scratch but this is an excellent fast alternative.  I found a full can of milk makes the soup to watered down so I cut back to 1/2 a cup.  I add some chopped chives and a TBS of sherry.  To really kick it up, I add some cayenne pepper and imitation lobster meat -- making it into a full meal.<br /><br />This soup tastes exactly how I expected it to and I already ordered another case.
