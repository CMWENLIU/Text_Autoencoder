Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him. He sheds a little more. But I don't have that problem with this and the other cat food I'm giving him now.
