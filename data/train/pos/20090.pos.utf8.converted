I read somewhere of a story that tumeric cuts through the protein plaques in the brain that result in Alzheimer's Disease.  But just try to buy Tumeric anywhere.  Well, this is a good product, and the customer service is really on the ball.  Fed Ex got it to me in a few days.  I stir it into coffee.  Tastes like nutmeg.
