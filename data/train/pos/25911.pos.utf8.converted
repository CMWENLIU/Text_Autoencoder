Being a diabetic for 29 years, I have tasted virtually every sugar free candy on the market. These are wonderful -- hard to tell from the real thing. No more watching my friends indulge without being able to join in! Use with caution, however -- excess consumption (like eating half the box during a really good movie -- not hard to do) will make you rather ill. On the whole, though, these are great.
