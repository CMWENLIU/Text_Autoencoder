First and foremost, why are strawberry newtons no longer offered at every supermarket? As though someone out there is systematically sabotaging my snacking habits. Thanks to Amazon for not letting the strawberry newton fall victim to what I regretfully refer to as "Hydrox-ing."<br /><br />As for my order <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA15B8">Fig Newtons, Strawberry, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>, I didn't think that my expectations could be exceeded (after all, I was ordering an entire case of my favorite treat.) But the package arrived promptly; furthermore, Nabisco has designed a new "freshness seal" alleviating the only drawback of the newton - the stale, dried-out cake resulting several days after a package has been opened. This, plus a healthy dosage of sodium benzoate will ensure the existence of strawberry newtons for many months to come.<br /><br />Thanks to all who were involved in this. You made my day.
