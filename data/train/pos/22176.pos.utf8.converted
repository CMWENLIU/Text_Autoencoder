This is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty, solid granola with irresistable double chocolate.  I really love this product -- a chocolate lover's dream.  Yet, it's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet.  The fat/sugar content is comparable to most other granolas.<br /><br />I've tried numerous granola's over the years, and this one is special.  Probably not the most nutritious granola overall, but it's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas.<br /><br />I would not have this as my exclusive source of granola, but I will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings.  In fact, I will probably always keep this product handy because it's highly satisfying.<br /><br />Great for a breakfast, snack or dessert.  Yummy!
