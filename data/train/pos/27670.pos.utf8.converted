My opinion is that this cereal is great.  It does need some sweetening, so I mix in a little of another cereal that's too sweet by itself.  I also use this cereal for added fiber, flavor, and texture when making bread. Plus it's more economical than buying the ingredients separately.  Highly recommend.
