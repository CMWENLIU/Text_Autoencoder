I have used it for over two years.I work for the airline industry.It was very hard for me to grab the bags but since I started using  SAFFRON I am able to grab the bags and the pain has gonne away. My wife put a pinch of SAFFRON , STAR ANIS and CINNAMON STICKS ( break them in half ) boil them in water on a tea pot when ready you can drink it warm or cold sweet tea before you drink it.First week drink two cups a day , second week one cup a day , on the third week you stop for 3 days and them continue with one cup per day and so on, always stop drinking teafor 3 days after the 3rd week, so you body can clean. Try this and you will start feeling much better, Saffron help in many ways, read about it and you be suprise!!!
