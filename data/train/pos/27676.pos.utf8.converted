These are great! They are an organic snack that isn't messy. I can hand them to my twins when they're fussy (waiting at the doctors, car rides, etc.) and they can hold them, eat them and not mess up their outfits. Much better than regular crackers or cookies which make huge messes and aren't nearly as healthy. My twins love how these taste. They are light, crunchy and slightly sweet.
