As a previous reviewer said, one box makes a lot of falafel. It tastes great leftover though. Mine kept well in the refrigerator for a week; I sealed it in some run-of-the-mill tupperware. The mix is mildly spiced, but I think it will appeal to most palates.<br /><br />A minor warning: I managed to fill my kitchen with smoke while making a batch using the broiling directions listed on the box. The instructions tell you to brush both sides of a falafel patty with olive oil and then broil them. This is all well and good, except olive oil has a very low smoke point. The falafel baked just fine for me, and it still tasted great. I made the rest of the batch using vegetable oil with no discernible difference in taste or texture. My broiler doesn't have "high" and "low" settings, so perhaps baking at a lower temperature would solve this problem.<br /><br />Really tasty - will definitely make again.
