I love blueberries so I was really looking forward to trying these...wow, am I glad I did! The 4 lbs. of dried fruit is packaged in a sealed plastic bag that is tucked inside the cardboard box shown in the picture...once opened, the bag fits nicely inside a one gallon zip lock bag for storage. About the size of small raisins, these dark blue fragrant gems are sweet, chewy, and full of mouth watering blueberry flavor. So far I've mixed them into hot oatmeal and yogurt and, of course, eaten them straight from the bag. Fresh blueberries are still my favorite but these will definitely satisfy me when I can't go pick my own. The subscribe & save price is very fair and worth every penny. Yummmm!
