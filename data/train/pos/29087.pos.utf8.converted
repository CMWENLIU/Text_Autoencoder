Dog Loves 'em, what else is there to say? The resealable bag keeps the product fresh. We break up the Beggin Strips into smaller pieces and hide them around the house as the dog (Standard Poodle) seems to love the challenge of the hunt.<br />We pretty much limit the dog to only 2 of these a day so as to reduce spoiling her and any adverse health risks.<br />Great product as we have used these for years.
