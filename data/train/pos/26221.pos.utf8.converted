I have been drinking this brand of lichee tea for over 30 years, whenever I could find it (thank goodness for the internet). The quality has never faltered. As other reviewers say, the lichee in the tea is not overpowering--more of a delicate roselike aroma than a fruity taste. The tea itself is not too tannic, and it re-heats well.
