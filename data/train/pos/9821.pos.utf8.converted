Since my daughter is allergic to all artificial food dyes we are always looking for new products that she can have.  This not only met our expectations it blew us away!  The flavor is not too sweet, nor is there any strange after-taste.  Very tasty!  This was the first flavor we tried, now we are going to try all of the rest but in the larger bottles.  The bottle is supposed to make about 28 servings at about $5.99 per bottle, so a much better value. We liked them so much that we went through the packets pretty quickly.  The packets are a liquid, not a powder so mix very quickly and are handy.  I think we'll end up getting them off the Flavrz website though since they also have gingerale, rootbeer, cola and many other flavors not available here.  I think that they will also make great freezer pops and sno-cones!
