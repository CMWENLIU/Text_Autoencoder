Some reviews have given low scores to this product because Amazon is not listing ingredients. In 2 minutes I was able to go to the product website<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />and find out that the line of products are "Celiac Disease Foundation and the Celiac Sprue Association" approved.<br /><br />My advice to the reviewers that gave this a 1 star because no ingredient information was listed, I hate lazy people!,<br />next time do an Internet search (it's easy, ever hear of Google),<br />go to the product website to get the information,<br />stop bashing a product for information Amazon does not have and<br />keep your thoughts to yourself until you actually try the product.<br /><br />I give 5 stars to Betty Crocker for stepping up and giving a minority population a product in mainstream grocery stores at a reasonable price. I searched the Betty Crocker website and found that these are not avaiable anywhere in my zip code yet.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I have ordered all 4 Gluten-Free products from Amazon and look forward to baking!
