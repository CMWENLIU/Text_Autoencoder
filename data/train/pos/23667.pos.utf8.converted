This energy drink is my current energy drink of choice because 1) It tastes very good. It is not too sweet or gross like some other drinks. Monster/RedBull/Rockstar all have that yucky side/after taste yet this drink tastes good like Full Throttle. 2) It Works, its an energy drink and it does its job, i havn't really paid attention to whether or not there is a crash at the end but certainly no jitters. 3) It contains no caffeine or taurine but Co-Q10 which is apparently more "natural" and healthy. 4) 8.3 ounces is a good size, i dont understand why some people enjoy 16 ounce monster/full throttles... they like to pee a lot i guess? Liquid Ice is a very good energy drink. 4) Also, its price is about average, not too expensive.
