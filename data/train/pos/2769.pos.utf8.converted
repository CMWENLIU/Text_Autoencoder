I saw this new flavor in my local store last week and thought it sounded good, so I bought a box. OMG!!! When I took the first bite, one thing came to mind...This tastes just like a Samoas Girl Scout cookie (my fav)!<br /><br />Every year I buy 10+ boxes of the Samoas, this year I'm trying to loose about 30lbs. I thought cookie-selling time would tempt me, but now I'm not worried. These things are delicious and completely replace my desire for the Samoas.
