I've been using Nutiva Coconut oil for over a year now and I order in the 54-oz containers through Amazon.  A friend turned me on to the benefits of coconut oil so I tried it out.  I use it in stir-fry, curry and fried rice.  It gives the food a very light coconut flavor. In my opinion, it is most suited to baking.  I substitute coconut oil whenever the recipe calls for butter, vegetable oil (microwave the coconut oil to liquefy) or shortening. I've used it to bake cookies, muffins, bread, sweet dinner rolls, etc.  Everything comes out moist and delicious, with no worry about trans fats. I definitely recommend this product.
