Tazo Rest immediately appealed to me because it promises relaxation and deep sleep. The blend of lemon balm, lemon myrtle and valerian are supposed to cause the eyelids to willingly succumb. Since this has ginger in it I added lots of honey which also goes well with the orange peel, lavender ,licorice and ginger. Yes this tea is slighltly spicy with a heady comforting floral fragrance. Even as I type late at night I feel it working its magic. I will be asleep in minutes so good night and rest well and try this wonderful tea at bedtime as often as you like. You deserve it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
