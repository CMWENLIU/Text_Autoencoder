The other day my significant other looked at me and remarked..."You have the skin of a teenager". It is the dramatic improvement in my skin since I've been using this product.  First my dry hair's texture was changed within a few days and I no longer have dandruff since using this product.  Then my skin from the neck down has this kind of sheen that I have not had in 40 years...the last time I was a teenager.  Also the acne on the back or my arms, backside and back of my thighs is gone.  I used to slather on a tea tree oil lip balm several times a day.  Now I rub in coconut oil on my lips in the morning and maybe one other time during the day, on the days I do not wear lipstick.<br /><br />The thing that has struck me most is my face.  I had been through microdermabrasion, chemical peels and all sorts of exfoliating products that are now all replaced by coconut oil.  I'm not usually one for dramatic reviews, but this product has performed VERY FAR BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS!!!  Also by using this product I save a lot of money now that I no long have to use a ton of other products.  I should note that I've been using this coconut oil for the last 4 or 5 months.
