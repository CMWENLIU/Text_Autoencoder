I used to to work in a professional kitchen and this was our e.v.o. of choice. like the description says it is a well balanced oil with a slight hint of pepper, i'm not a huge fan of overly peppery olive oils(which this does have some at the end but not over powering but unless you actually try this by the spoonful(yes which i have done in my own personal taste test comparing olive oils) to me thats the only way you really get the peppery sensation on the back of your throat,if you use it for bread dipping the pepper finish isn't  as strong, it has a great up front olive taste that will hold up well(with a nice sprinkling  of sea salt to boost flavor!)l as a finishing oil on top of eggs, fish , salads and works great for vinaigrette and is great to cook with too!, the small size tins are perfect for the kitchen and provides protection from light, the size of the tins also make them great to give as a gift!
