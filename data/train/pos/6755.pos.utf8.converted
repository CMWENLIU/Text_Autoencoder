We were curious to try this salt based upon an article we read in a health magazine. The "rotten eggs" smell was, of course, a concern, but we opted to try it anyway.<br /><br />Let it be known that the smell is exactly as described, as well as the taste when sample straight out of the packaging. However, once added to a dish and cooked (even sprinkled on veggies), the sulfur-like aroma and flavor changes into a subtle and interesting result for your palate.<br /><br />At first, I thought this might be one of those seasonings only for special dishes..but we tried it on some basics (other than adding to veggies). We added it to a crack-peppered hummus...and it rocks!<br /><br />Experiment and you'll find that it is an eggcellent salt!
