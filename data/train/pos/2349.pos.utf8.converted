I have been drinking Celsius for about three months, usually one every day, and after trying the different flavors, I found the Wildberry to be my favorite. I am not a big cola person to begin with- so this was just right for me--no weird aftertaste that I can detect, and it does seem to fill me up and give me a boost during the day when I may be sagging and want to reach for a sweet, fattening snack! As to whether or not it has supported weight loss, that is hard to say. I am conscious of what I eat and have been reducing portions and increasing my physical activity- so that is where credit goes for dropping a few pounds, but I CAN say that the Celsius does seem to stave off the munchie cravings when they come along.<br />I never drink more than one a day, and it is usually in the afternoon. I have not had any ill effects from the caffeine. I do drink one or sometimes two cups of coffee fairly early in the morning, so by the time I have a can of Celsius I would imagine my morning caffeine is long gone.<br />This just happens to be the flavor I like the most-- you may not-- it isn't some kind of miracle elixir-but I enjoy the taste, the pick-me-up, and the fact that I don't grab a candy bar instead!
