WOW! Condensed Milk in a bottle, what a great idea!  We love condensed milk on strawberries and shaved ice, but can never use up the entire can, sure you can refrigerate the leftovers, but it gets really thick and the texture changes, just not as good.  No problems with the bottle - just flip and squeeze!  Will be buying these from now on...
