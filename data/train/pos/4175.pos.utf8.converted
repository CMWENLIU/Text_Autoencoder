I too have been a devoted fan of The Pepper Plant Hot Pepper Sauce for years.  True, it has a spicy hot flavor - but the hotness never overpowers the wonderful flavor this sauce emparts.  Terrifically versatile, I've used it on beef and chicken - even in soups! So if you're looking for a hearty, rich-flavored sauce with a hotness that won't melt your molars, give this one a taste. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Truly exceptional.
