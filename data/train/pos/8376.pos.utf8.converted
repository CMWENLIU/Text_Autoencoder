I love using India Tree sugars because they have perfect flavor and consistency.  This caster sugar dissolves instantly in liquids, perfect for sweetening everything from margaritas to whipping cream.  It quickly sweetens iced drinks without the grit on the bottom of the glass that you get with regular sugar.  Perfect for baking and creme brulee too. The 3 pound jar is a wonderful value and nice size to have in your pantry to insure you always have some on hand. Free shipping on 6 pounds is a great deal with Amazon!<br /><br />PS> India Tree Muscavado sugar is amazing, the best dark sugar on the market!
