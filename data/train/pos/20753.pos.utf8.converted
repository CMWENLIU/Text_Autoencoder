My dog has been eating this brand dog food for the last 2 1/2 years. Shes healthy and happy with this food. We have zero problems with "dog odor"...in fact the groomer said he could tell she eats a good brand dog food. I will continue to purchase it online as it was hassle free and arrived on time and in good condition. The price is comparable to purchasing it locally...but without the in store hassle and constant out of stocks. I would reccomend this to any dog owner.
