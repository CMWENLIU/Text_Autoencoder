This is without a doubt one of the best coffee's out there. One poor review is from an admitted Starbuck fan who wants to taste the roast. I want to taste the coffee. It is a matter of preference and expectations.<br /><br />The sad state of coffee is the Starbucks syndrome of dark roasting. Yes, the dark roasting lends a flavor in addition to the coffee that, according to the popularity of Starbucks, appeals to many.<br /><br />I have seen many coffee boutiques offer fabulous medium roast coffee only to cave in to the demands of the Starbucks crowds and burn, uh, roast my favorites darker than I prefer.<br /><br />Not so with this Eight O'Clock delight. If you want more coffee than "roast" flavor, this is the drink for you! It takes a VERY high quality bean to stand up to a medium roast without tasting like wood or paper.<br /><br />If you want coffee that taste as good as it smells, and are not looking for the Starbucks burnt offerings, look no further.
