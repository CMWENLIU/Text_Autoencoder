We have a beautiful five year old Abyssinian with an unfortunate tendency to vomit fairly often. We had gone through food after food, trying different protein sources (as well as grain free foods) and finally figured out that it seems he's allergic to all poultry. Some protein sources were better than others (he did better with duck vs. chicken or turkey), but nothing seemed to completely take care of the problem - until we tried California Natural's Herring and Sweet Potato. After two weeks of this cat food, he hasn't vomited at all. Our cat's coat is glossier than it has ever been. Some reactions to previous foods were so severe that he would also lick bald patches in his coat, often on his tummy. That behavior has stopped as well. After researching many foods, this one seems to be the best and has excellent reviews as a healthy dry food for cats. I'm thrilled to have finally found a healthy food our kitty loves.
