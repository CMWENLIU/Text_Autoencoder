This is one of my new best friends.  On Weight Watchers, it is 0, as in zero, points.  It is 20 calories.  It has a satisfying chocolate flavor.  It does clump a bit and takes an extra stir or two, but I think this is an amazing way to have a hot drink and a little chocolate fix.<br />With also perhaps a dollop of fat-free whipped cream,or a tbsp of skim milk added, you will feel you had a sweet treat.  Note that this variety is called "Diet"--it is not the same product as merely low-fat or sugar-free.
