It is great to have fresh, clean herbs on my counter top anytime.  As a long-time gardener and cook, I really missed my fresh herbs when winter came.  I bought an aerogrow garden in February and love it.  Now that warm weather is here and I can grow herbs outside, I plan to grow salad greens, bug and dirt free.  The garden looks attractive on the kitchen counter, doesn't take up much room and has been fun for me and my grandaughter.  I highly recommend it. Would make an excellent gift.
