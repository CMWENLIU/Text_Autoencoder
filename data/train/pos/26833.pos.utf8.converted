I have tried several different Italian coffees, all claiming to be the best coffee available.  Caffe Kimbo is by far the best.  Caffe Kimbo is a rich, dark coffee that makes an excellent espresso, especially in a moka (stove top espresso pot).  It is rich, full bodied with a depth lacking in other brands.  Well worth a try!
