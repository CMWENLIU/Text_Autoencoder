The assortment is a large box---the individual 8oz bags are much larger than they look in the photo.  With the bonus bag, the assortment comes out to 5 1/2 pds of coffee for $40 (subscription price at the time of this writing), which works out to a an economical $7.27 per pound--and that doesn't even count the mugs.  The mugs are well-designed, light and fit nicely in the hand.  Yeh, I know they are just mugs, but I have dozens of mugs, many of which are unnecessarily heavy and/or hard to hold.  But these are above average, in a functional sense.<br /><br />Although the bags look like kraft paper, in fact they are metalized-plastic inside, sealed air-tight, and re-seal air-tight easily and securely.  They even have a valve so you can squeeze out excess air, which is a good thing to do.  The presentation box is utilitarian but nice---the sampler would make an excellent gift for any coffee lover, even a wedding gift.<br /><br />The selection is SUMATRA MANDHELING, COSTA RICAN TARRAZU, COLUMBIAN SUPREMO, BREAKFAST BLEND, FRENCH ROAST, DARK HOUSE BLEND, ITALIAN DARK ROAST EXPRESSO, FRENCH VANILLA, HAZEL NUT, and DECAF COLUMBIAN.  Unfortunately, not the selection I would make if I had a choice.  The full 8-oz "free sampler" was CITY ROAST COLOMBIAN, but presumably other varieties may be substituted for the "free sample".<br /><br />Honestly, I'd prefer another bag of coffee rather than the mugs, and I wish I could have the option of a "no-decafinated no-flavored" sampler.  But, the French Vanilla and Hazelnut are not too objectionable, and one can always save the single decaf bag for evenings.  Ironically, you CAN purchase an all decafinated sampler <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWFB40">Coffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Decaf Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Box</a>, or an all flavored sampler <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHE1I">Coffee Bean Direct Assorted Flavored Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Box</a>, so why can't they offer a "no-decafinated no-flavored" sampler?<br /><br />If you are a real coffee lover, I strongly suggest purchasing a Mellita manual cone system, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLCT">Melitta Cone Filter Manual Coffeemaker 6 Cup, 1-Count</a>  For some reason I cannot link to the "10 cup" system, which I recommend.<br /><br />I'm working my way slowly though the coffees.  I'll add updates as I go through them.  Note that such evaluations are strictly a matter of personal tastes, and quality may differ between batches. In general I prefer light roasts, and loath flavored coffee.  Based on C being "typical American coffee":<br />SUMATRA MANDHELING C+ glad I didn't buy the 5pd bag I was considering<br />DARK HOUSE BLEND B<br />COSTA RICAN TARRAZU B<br />BREAKFAST BLEND B<br />CITY ROAST COLUMBIAN A<br />FRENCH ROAST B+<br />COLUMBIAN SUPREMO B+<br /><br />Be careful grinding the FRENCH ROAST---it has alot of sugar as a glaze (not enough to taste).  If you overgrind the coffee you apparently melt the sugar, and the powdered coffee and sugar sticks, like a turd, in your grinder.  I use a wooden popsickle stick to scrape it out, but still it's annoying.  I do not know why sugar is added to dark roasts during the roasting process, but it is common.
