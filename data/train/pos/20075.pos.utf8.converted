I bought this on sale 40% off clearance price.  It came out to about $0.62 per cup.  Nice price!  I like the taste.  It's like mild-medium spiced.  It vaguely reminded me of spicy bean soup.  The couscous definitely has flavor (as opposed to most couscous I've tried).  Someone with a light appetite could eat this as a meal.  I believe it is vegetarian.  I think it's a great value for good tasting food, and I would definitely eat this often.<br /><br />It's basically like a healthier "cup-o-noodles" because you just add hot water, wait, and eat it.  If you care about the nutritional value, read on.  It's only 200 calories, low in fat, no saturated fat, has carbs for energy, has fiber (4g, which is 14%DV), has a decent amount of protein from the couscous and lentils, which by themselves are low in protein, but together they fill out each other's gaps in essential amino acids (10g, I believe you need about 50g in a day)), and has iron (15%DV).  The only downside might be the sodium.  It has 730mg (30%DV) of sodium, but isn't too bad if you're eating it as a meal or if the rest of your day's food is lower in sodium.<br /><br />Calories: 200<br />Calories from Fat: 15<br />Total Fat: 1.5g (2% DV)<br />Sat Fat: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium 730mg (30% DV)<br />Total Carb: 36g (12% DV)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (14% DV)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 10g<br />Vit A: 0%<br />Vit C: 2%<br />Calcium: 4%<br />Iron: 15%<br /><br />Percent Daily Values (DV) based on 2,000 calorie diet)
