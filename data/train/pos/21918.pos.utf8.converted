Once my cat ate Fancy Feast she became insufferable if she did not get her can a day.  I started with 1/2 can to give her as a daily treat.  Well she would start pacing and following us around feeding time.  Also she is part Asian so she talks a whole lot.  So to see her or hear her you would have thought we were torturing her until she got here can and then  when I got it and opened the can she started meowing very fast until you set her bowl in front of her like we were starving her.  Then she is ok until tomorrow.  Sometimes she will wolf it down and want more.  Thankfully she still eats dry food too or I'd have to start buying in bulk to save money.<br />I have also noticed that her fur is very shiny and she is very energetic not like she was in need of the energy.
