I ordered a box of these cookies to be sent to my mother who is 84 years old - they were her Christmas present along with a box of the Chocolate Chunk Breakfast Cookies.  She doesn't eat breakfast so I thought these might encourage her to eat something in the morning with her meds. She said they are really quite tasty.  She lives out of town, and since I have to eat gluten free, of course I haven't personally tasted them.  But if my mother says they're good, I feel confident in giving them a favorable review.
