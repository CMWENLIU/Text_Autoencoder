I, along with many others it seems, emailed Twizzlers when they changed their chocolate Twizzlers formula and made the twists with open ends.  I kind of forgot about it and converted to eating the strawberry ones because I just hated the new formula.  Well, they must have kept some kind of database because that was like several years ago and I just received a letter stating that due to consumer response they were bringing back the classic twist!  I also received a couple of coupons.  I must say I was impressed!  I did just find them in the store and they have the old shape back and I'm pretty sure the old taste too although the package still says "made with Hershey's syrup" and it didn't used to say that.  Another co-worker tried them and she too, thinks it is the old formula.  Thanks Hershey's!
