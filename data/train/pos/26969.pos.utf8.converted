Wow, that is some serious overpricing!  Walmart sells these babies for 2.50.  Buy from them, they are the best little snacks to give to your kids.  The healthiest? No but they do taste really good, our entire family likes them.  Nice to leave in the diaper bag so you bring them out when little ones get cranky.
