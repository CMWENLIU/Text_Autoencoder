I absolutely love this soup mix!  It has become a staple in my diet.  It is quite easy to make, and it tastes great.  I also love how cheap it is.  I use 1 cup of mix per batch, and there are 4 cups (approx) per bag.  Each batch gives me 4 large servings.  So that means this box gives me 64 servings!  At the subscribe and save price that means $0.20 per serving!  I dare you to find a meal that fills you up this much, is this good for you, and only costs $0.20!!!!<br /><br />Here's my recipe:<br />1 cup of the Veggie Soup Mix<br />6 cups of water<br />6 TB of Vegetable Broth Powder (you can also use bullion or liquid broth)<br />1 can of Tomatoes (either diced, stewed or half of each)<br />season with Basil, Oregano, Marjoram, Salt & Pepper to taste<br />  Throw all this in a pot and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.<br />It's that simple!<br /><br />Try it, you won't regret it...
