These burgers are fantastic! Anyone who is stating they are dry and not tastey or tough and chewey is not cooking them right. Sounds like you are over cooking them or not following the cooking directions. I have made them a number of different ways, pan fried, bbq grill, george foreman grilled and broiled... everytime they come out awesome! Grill or stir fry some onions with them, add a little cheddar, monteray jack or spice it up with peper jack cheese, whatever kind you like, and you got an amazing burger! Top with a little Ketchup or russian dressing if you like condiments or for some added zing lightly brush a little italian dressing on the bun before toasting. So much better than those super market slop burgers! If your not sure how best to make them, read the little book that comes with it. 15 minute flash defrost trick works great for pan frying or broiling. I have grilled them frozen fresh from the freezer on both the bbq and the g foreman grill and they come out great.In fact... I think Ill make some for dinner... AGAIN!
