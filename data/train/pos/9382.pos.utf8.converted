This is excellent tea. I have to admit that the packaging and brand name (eXtreme health) put me off a little bit, but as they say, the proof is in the pudding. The tea had the perfect level of flavor and sweetness (natural sweetness) which to me usually indicates a superior tea. It is not temperamental in terms of brewing, and does not easily turn astringent with slight over-steeping. I am not sure where this tea is grown, but kudos to the farmer. It is far better than several very expensive varieties I have ordered directly from Japan.
