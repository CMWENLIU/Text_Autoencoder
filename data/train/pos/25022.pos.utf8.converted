When I received my box of Kraft fat free mayonnaise packets I immediately checked the individual packets for an expiration date and there was none. I then looked on the box and found a UPC code and another code with 7 alpha-numeric characters (ex: 08M07C0). I called Kraft Foods and was told the code next to the UPC code was the expiration date. Using the code on my box as an example (08M07C0), the code reads as MM(letter)DD(letter)Y. This translates to August 7, 2010. I asked about the letters in the code and was told they have nothing to do with the manufacturing date.  Kraft Foods also said these packets have a Shelf Life of 5 months only. So my box was manufactured on 08/07/10 and expires on 01/07/11. Kraft Foods did not recommend using the packets after the expiration date. I would like to see Amazon list the expiration date of their stock so you know how much useful life is left to a grocery item. Maybe they could create a link on the page that you could click on and have the expiration date displayed.
