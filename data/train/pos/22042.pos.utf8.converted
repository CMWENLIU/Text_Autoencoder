I love Sweet Chili Riceworks chips.  I first tried them at Costco, then could not find them again.  I emailed the company and found Walmart was to get some in.  I purchased 6 bags, but once again found they no longer carry them.  I finally found them once again at Amazon after contacting the company.  But I will not be buying from Amazon again.  The chips are nothing but crumbs in the bags and I ordered 12.  They came all crushed, very few whole chips.  I am greatly disapointed.  I love the chips, but would like a local place to purchase.
