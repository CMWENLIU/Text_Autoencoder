I have always enjoyed tea, but I started drinking it regularly when I lived in England during college.  The school I went to served PG Tips, and once I returned to the United States, I could not find anything dark enough for me.  Eventually, I found it in a store in NYC but then had to order more from an online import retailer.  When we got a World Market in my city, I was able to buy it there.  However, I now order it from Amazon because of the price and convenience.<br /><br />I recommend buying one 40 or 80 bag box at a time because it will lose flavor over a couple of years if purchased in bulk amounts.<br /><br />Pros<br />Easy to vary how dark it gets, but this tea will brew a very dark cup if desired -- which is what I love about it.<br />Cost -- This price on Amazon is excellent and while there are probably "finer" teas out there, PG Tips is high quality yet inexpensive enough to drink daily.<br />While it states on the box that it is low in caffeine, two large cups pack plenty of get-you-going punch.<br /><br />Cons<br />Nope, no string.  I never remove my tea bag from the cup, though, so this isn't a problem for me.  A spoon works great.<br />You'll never feel the same about the tea you can buy at a grocery store in the U.S.  Very few, if any, have enough flavor.
