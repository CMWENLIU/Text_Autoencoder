I stumbled upon these at Costco several months ago. I'm glad I bought them!<br />My German Shepherd loves these treats. They are perforated and can easily bend in half. I was afraid she might reject these since she was raised on Greenies, but she loves Checkups just the same. Her teeth are very white and she never has bad breath. They are also made in the USA.
