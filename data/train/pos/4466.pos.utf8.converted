These have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips.  Always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks. Top quality ingredients; brown rice, oat fiber, sunflower seeds etc. are what give this product the taste to start a conversation. Serve with fresh veggies and a good dip, always a crowd pleas-er!  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor.
