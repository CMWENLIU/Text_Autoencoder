I am back to order another container of this stuff after previously getting one for myself and one for my boyfriend (let him get his next jar himself, now that he's hooked on it.) I've tried other coconut oils and this one is by far the best. It's great that you can get such a big jar of it online...even health food grocery stores don't seem to carry much of a selection of coconut oil (and I live in granola-crunchy California.)<br /><br />This is great for cooking with, since it doesn't start smoking as soon as olive oil does. My boyfriend loves it for making biscuits as well as for spreading on top of biscuits or bread. We've used it in our "almost perfect Chicago deep dish style pizza" crust and people can never figure out what our "secret" ingredient is but they LOVE the pizza. It adds a great flavor in stirfrys and for sauteeing vegetable pot stickers.<br /><br />It does have quite a coconut flavor, which is part of the reason why we love it so much, but if you don't like the taste of coconut or you are making something where that taste or aroma might not be appropriate you probably want to choose another type of oil.<br /><br />Oh! It's perfect for seasoning cast iron, too!
