What is wrong with me?  I ~love~ Product 19!  Not because it is healthy (for cold cereal), but because it tastes great and keeps its crunch.  How can Special K, which turns to mush on contact with milk, be so much more popular?  How can it be that even some "fans" in these reviews take shots at the taste of Product 19?  My love for this cereal may be slightly eccentric, but I do not rave about it from the perspective of especially favoring aggressively "natural" foods that are full of bran or whatever.  True, I hate Wonder Bread and other foods that have been processed beyond all recognition.  But I definitely do not favor twigs and berries.  It seems to me that half the world is willing to give up brownies in favor of granola bars (I definitely am not), and yet people bash this great-tasting cereal as though it were cod liver oil.  But I cry out to you from the wilderness!  Give this stuff a try!  It's delicious.<br /><br />8/22/09 - Gosh...we seem almost like a cult, we fans of P19.  I remember when it was introduced and believe its low sales were caused by marketing ineptness.  It was perceived by the public to be a health food, similar to Special K, which was already well established.  Kellogg's never did get around to promoting it for its great, hearty flavor and ability to stay crisp in milk.
