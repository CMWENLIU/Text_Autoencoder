For pastry type baking, pie crust, fluffy pancakes, brownies, etc. this is a really nice flour.  It works well with any recipe calling for baking powder and/or soda since it is very light. No need to mix whole wheat and white, just use this 100% stone ground flour. The yogurt pancakes on the bag are terrific.
