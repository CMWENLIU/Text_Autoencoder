the good news:  this stuff tastes as good as candy, but it is 100% fruit.  the other flavors are also good.  and not too chewy like other products.<br /><br />the bad news:  it's cheaper at my local store for $1 each.  why would i buy 48 of them on amazon and be paying more too?  come on amazon!<br /><br />product gets 5 stars.
