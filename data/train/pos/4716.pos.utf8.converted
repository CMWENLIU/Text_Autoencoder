These are our favorite (only!) fruit snack.  We went with these because of two BIG reasons, first they use only natural colorings (artificial colors are a common allergen and they can cause ADD like symptoms) and the sugar used is a less refined sugar which is better for you.  I know these are supposed to be for the kids, but I love them too.  We had been buying them on sale at Target for $2.99 a box, but our local Target only carried the berry flavor, and I like the citrus and the kids like the tropical.  This variety pack is much needed!  On sale at Target it turns out to be 60 cents a pack, this variety pack if you pay Amazon's price with free shipping comes out to 92 cents a pack.  So shop around, and if you have a Costco near you go there, because we just bought this same 24 pack variety box there for under $10 which makes each pack only 41 cents!
