UPDATE  - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah.  But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free.  Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010.  Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner.  You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color.  I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping.  I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free.  Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay!  Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />Old Review -<br /><br />I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES--remember how many women died of cancer because of DES?) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen to see if they had any plans to try and remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. Some companies are concerned and working to remove BPA (Eden Organics) while others are defending BPA--they are the ones that really upset me (Del Monte and Coca Cola are some of the worst--I won't buy ANY of their products anymore). Eden Organics has removed BPA from their canned bean products and is working to remove it from their canned tomato products.  Vital Choices is the only company I know of that has gone 100% BPA free but they sell mostly canned fish and a few other products but no canned tomatoes.<br /><br />I have switched to fresh food or jarred foods--no more cans for our family unless they are BPA free.  The lids of most jars have a little BPA but so much less BPA is leeched out compared to a whole can lining, still I would prefer NO BPA.  It just makes me sick that I fed my children with baby bottles that contained BPA.  I gave my children synthetic estrogen!  We already have prostate cancer in our family, and now I have increased my son's chance of prostate cancer even more by using BPA estrogen laden baby bottles--ugh!!!!!<br /><br />Contact Muir Glen and tell them you want BPA free cans!  We as shoppers, have a lot of power if we decide to use it.  In fact, contact all the companies that you buy canned goods from and let them know you don't want to feed your family BPA anymore.<br /><br />Let me know if you find any tomato products (diced, crushed, paste, ...) that are BPA free by responding to this comment--I will get an email.  I desperately want to make my chicken cacciatore again!<br /><br />I just read some more about BPA, Minnesota has banned BPA and several states are also trying to pass legislation to do the same.  So write to your legislators about banning BPA!  I also read the following from Fran Pavley the sponsor of California's BPA ban:<br /><br /> "Well over 100 independent academic and government peer-reviewed studies have linked BPA to a host of problems, including brain and developmental damage, breast and prostrate cancer, early puberty, obesity, infertility, miscarriage and hyperactivity. Young children and babies are particularly vulnerable because their body systems are still developing.<br /><br />Still, the chemical industry remains in denial. It has employed more than a dozen lobbyists to kill my bill.  Lobbyists for popular formula brands are roaming the halls of the Capitol, telling my colleagues that alternative products aren&iexcl;
