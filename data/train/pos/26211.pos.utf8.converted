When my health care provider asked me to eat concentrated amounts of protein as between meal snacks,  what could I choose?  That was my dilemma.<br /><br />When looking for snacks I needed something that was easy to carry around with me and rather low in carbohydrates.  I kept finding snack bars and snack cups that were mostly sugars and carbs.  Those are nice for energy snacks, but not for long term slow release that comes from protein.<br /><br />Then I found Skippy Natural Peanut Butter.  To begin it has only 6 grams pf carbohydrates per serving compared with 15 grams for other brands.  Next it does have 7 grams of protein.  So with Skippy I get my protein (most PB has about 7 g), with far fewer carbs.<br /><br />Next I compared the other ingredients.  Skippy Natural contains peanuts, a little palm oil, a pinch of salt, and a bit of sugar.  Regular brands toss in corn syrup, fully hydrogenated vegetable oils, digryceriges, molasses, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, copper sulfate, and pyridokinne hydrochloride.  Skippy Natural is the clear choice on the basis of ingredients.<br /><br />Skippy Natural tastes good and spreads smooth.  I recommend Skippy Natural.
