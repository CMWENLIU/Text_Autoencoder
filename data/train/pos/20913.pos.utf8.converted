I have visited many cities in China enjoying hot pot and a variety of other dishes with Sichuan Peppercorns as an ingredient.  It was terrific to find I could buy them on-line and that after using them in a recipe learned in Guangzhou I discovered the flavor and quality to be what I had experienced in China.  The shipping and packaging was good with no issues.
