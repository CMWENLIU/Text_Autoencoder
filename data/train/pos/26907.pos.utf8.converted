I discovered this coffee while I was in Munich, Germany.  It is the smoothest, non-bitter coffee I had ever had.  I was able to get a few bricks back to the US but needed to find a way to get more.  Then I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Most people on here use it for their espresso machines, but I just use my "Black-n-Decker" coffee maker.  My guests always ask where they can get their hands on it.  A few friends and family have transitioned from their Maxwell House to Lavazza!
