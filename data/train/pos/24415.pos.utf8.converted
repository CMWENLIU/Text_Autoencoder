I spent some time in Japan and the shirataki noodles are used in a bunch of dishes including Sukiyaki.  Maybe that's why the Japanese are thin.  These noodles should be parboiled to remove the preservative.  They don't melt easily so they can be cooked for a long time.  They have a hard gelatinous texture so they don't absorb flavors easily.  I think they taste better with strong sauces, smoked meats, etc.  If you are trying to lower your carbs and/or cut calories, you can have your noodles and eat it too.
