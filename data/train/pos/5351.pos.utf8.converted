I have been buying the standard L'Olivier olive oil in the crock container for years. It is a beautiful oil with a great taste. It's not something I'd cook with - high heat kills the subtle flavors - it is a finishing oil.<br /><br />Having bought the drums more recently, I prefer them to the crock. While the spout does leave much to be desired, getting  the wax off the crock was a pain. What I'd recommend (if you really love this oil like I do) is buy the crock, get the wax off (you can melt the final bits with a flame to get it nice and clean), and then buy these drums as refills for the crock. Best of both worlds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product! I'd make it 4.5 stars because of the drum, but since that's not an option, I have to round it up to 5.
