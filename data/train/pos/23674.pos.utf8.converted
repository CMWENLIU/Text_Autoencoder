This is one of the best tasting nutritional yeasts products I've ever tasted and I've been using nutritional yeast for over 30 years.  I am vegan and use yeast for its cheesey, nutty flavor. Bob's is guaranteed gluten free as well!  One of my favorite meals is a gluten free pasta tossed with a little flax or extra virgin olive oil, Bragg's liquid aminos and Bob's yeast.<br /><br />I really love it so many ways but interestingly enough I use it more for my 10 year old cat than myself these days!  She has adored nutritional yeast since she was a kitten and I sprinkle a generous amount on her kibble every day.  It's  also very useful sprinkled atop any food I might have to coax her to eat when she is being finnicky.<br /><br />I've always been told that all cats and dogs should have nutritional yeast in their diet to help keep fleas away. Regardless, animals love it so why not give them the extra good nutrition?<br /><br />Amazon's is an excellent buy too, even less expensive than buying bulk at the health food store.  So treat yourself and your pets to delicious, high quality, good nutrition!
