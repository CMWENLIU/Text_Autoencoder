As this is a gift basket, I didn't actually receive it. I sent it.<br /><br />However, the lucky recipient has mentioned it in emails no less than three times over the past month. Delicious, sinful, and decadent - or so I was told. Apparently the chocolate mints were a huge hit. (There were chocolate mints?)<br /><br />Sending gift baskets is a bit of a mine field when you don't really know your recipient, and when you're doing it online and don't know the supplier.<br /><br />So, thumbs up to this Supplier. You made me look really good. Will buy from you again AND recommend you highly to others.
