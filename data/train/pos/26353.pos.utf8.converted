I am a retired professional chef. I use this base at home in at least one dish daily. I have used Minors professionally, for years. This is the stuff that makes my dishes different from all my freinds and neighboors. A little bit goes a long way. Use it on anything in place of salt and amaze youself and your guests. My advice is to buy two! KEEPS GREAT IN FREEZER AND SPOONS OUT SOFT!!
