Never one for sardines but tastes changed as I got older and surprised myself by liking sushi.  I read good reviews about this product, high Omega3 and protein levels - they arrived today and am completely amazed at just how good these little things are.  As one reviewer wrote that they were very mild and tasted like tuna - absolutely correct.  These are delicious, I am so glad I took the chance and ordered them.  It was a case of reading customer reviews here that sold another product to me.
