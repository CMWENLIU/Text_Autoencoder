I really enjoyed the Deli-rye Triscuits when they were offered in the Evansville, IN<br />market many years ago.  Unfortunately they no longer carry this product in our grocery<br />stores. On visiting a friend in Cincinnati, OH I discovered them on the shelves at a<br />Kroger store. Naturally I was elated with joy. I bought several boxes to take home.  This was the closest area that<br />I could find that carries them.<br /><br />  I did a search on the Internet for the Deli-rye Triscuits and to my surprise found<br />them available on Amazon.com. Now I don't have to drive four hours to get them.  Amazon.com can have them<br />delivered right to your front door.  They come 12 to a box so I can share them with<br />my friends and relatives. They can't wait until my shipment comes in.<br /><br />  The Deli-rye Triscuits have a great rye taste that makes for a great compliment to any<br />kind of spread or topping.  I like them with shaved ham and swiss cheese.  I also like to melt<br />Monterey Jack cheese on them for a hot snack. For a special treat, try them with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and<br />fresh dill.<br /><br />  Thanks Amazon.com for making them available so that everyone can enjoy them.<br />  Duane in Evansville, IN
