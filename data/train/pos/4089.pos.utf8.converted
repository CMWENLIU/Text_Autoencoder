I love, love, love the Nanami Togarashi seasoning.  Having moved away from a Yoshinoya restaurant, I missed it so much.  I contacted Yoshinoya and asked where I could purchase the seasoning and they directed me to Amazon.  I was so thrilled I ordered three!  This stuff is great on rice, chow mein, chicken, beef, and more.  I liberally sprinkle it on many things I eat.  In fact, I sneak it into restaurants in my purse and sprinkle it on my food.  I know that must sound insane but that's how much I love this product.  The price is right, too.  I could go on forever about it but I won't.  Just try it!
