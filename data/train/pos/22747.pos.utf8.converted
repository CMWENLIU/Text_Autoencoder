For years and years we had said we would finally try haggis, but never had the courage to face it.  (We pictured chitlings.)  This Christmas I finally bought this product and we were entirely pleased with it and will buy it again.  As an alternative to cleaning and stuffing a sheep's stomach, I have to say it is convenient (think canned hash), and it makes a DELICIOUS shepherd's pie!  It doesn't require that scotch be drunk alongside it (or prior), but -- and in the tradition of Robert Burns -- it deserves a toast.  We recommend it most heartily.
