My Yorkie was a rescue, so I don't know anything about his puppyhood.  It took me a long time to figure out the commands he had been taught.  Trying to get him to respond to treats so I could get some new concepts into his brain was interesting.  He didn't seem to care for any of the standard treats other dogs love.  I think I tried everything in the local pet stores.<br /><br />Then I bought some wild Alaskan salmon on line and they sent a sample of these.  An instant hint.<br /><br />Also check out the salmon oil.  My picky eater would sometimes not eat when I fed him.  In general that isn't a problem, but I do want him to poop on schedule, like when I am home to let him out.  Eating on schedule is essential.  With a little salmon oil on the bottom of the bowl, regular food, and a little more, he eats soon as I put it down.<br /><br />There are several flavors, some chewy and some crunchy, but my dog has to have the chewy salmon.  He has gone through one 2.5 pound bag, and isn't bored with them yet.
