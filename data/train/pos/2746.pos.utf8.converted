I have purchased these beans before when they were in the $2.00 a package range.  They are tasty athough my Mexican friends say they are not as good as Mom's. At almost $5.00 a package with a modest $7.00 for shipping, thats only $1.00 for each ounce, brings the beans to a total price $12.00 for just 7 oz.  A man would be a fool to pass up this deal.  Pound for pound it would be cheaper to fly Mamacita in from Mexico so you could experience the real deal.  Sorry no sale at these prices.
