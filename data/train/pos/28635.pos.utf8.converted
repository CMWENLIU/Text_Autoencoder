My husband is an extremely picky carnivore and will not eat other vege-burger products.  This one he hardly even notices, the texture is only slightly different than ground beef, other than that it could pass for the real thing easy.  It takes seasoning well and is completely interchangeable for ground beef in casseroles, for tacos, chili, etc.  It does not mold into hamburger patties though.  We have been extremely happy with the product.  I've even used it in my slow cooker and it held up nicely.
