I just bought a jar of this stuff on a whim last night, despite its $8 price tag and boy am I glad I did.  I've never truly liked Peanut Butter, in fact I loathed it for many years...but as my tastebuds matured I learned to tolerate it once in a while with chocolate or apple slices.  I've been searching for a common ground because my BF LOVES peanut butter, but only the "kid" kinds...loaded with sugar and hydrogenated oils.  I like the fact that nut butters can be healthy and satisfy the appetite but I just couldn't deal with the Jif any longer. :)  Well, I've found our compromise... Barney Butter is ever so slightly sweet (just enough, I think) and close enough in taste to PB that my BF likes it, yet it's missing that indefinable something that makes me dislike peanut butter so much.  Plus, the Barney Butter is WAY healthier... compare the nutritional info  on the jar of Barney Butter to your standard jar of Jif or Skippy.  I know it isn't quite as pure as some nut butters since this still contains palm oil, BUT all of the No-Stir nut butters contain palm oil...it's a compromise I can live with if it means not having to stir anything with the consistency of cement... that just too much work for a sandwich.  Anyhoo..this stuff is fabulous and I can't keep my spoon out of the jar!!!  I was very glad to see the 3-pack on Amazon.  I'm ordering it right now!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  My initial enthusiasm for Barney Butter has not waned.  Peanut Butter has never made it back into our house since.  I use the Barney Butter in baked goodies, candies, smoothies, on toast, and on plain old spoons :).  I actually buy 6 jars at a time from Amazon.  LOVE IT!
