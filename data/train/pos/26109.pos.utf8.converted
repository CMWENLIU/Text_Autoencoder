I've tried a few brands of coconut milk since I have started cooking Thai-style curries, and, so far, I like Roland the best.  It's organic, it tastes great, and it has the full fat content, which I prefer.  If you're looking for a good, full-fat coconut milk, give it a try.<br /><br />Ingredients: organic coconut milk, water, guar gum (thickener).
