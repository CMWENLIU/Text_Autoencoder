I received a WhirlyPop popcorn popper for Christmas. After a little web research, quickly discovered that coconut oil, as used in the Real Theatre Popcorn Popping Oil, is a key ingredient to making great popcorn. Using regular canola or other vegetable oils just does not compare to using this popping oil. My family loves the popcorn we make with this oil. We will never eat microwave popcorn again.
