We have two of these.  The white one is in the kitchen growing herbs, and the black one is in the office growing lettuce.  I finally feel like a successful gardener!  These come with explicit instructions and pictures so you can't make a mistake. There were only two issues: the lights weren't working correctly on the black one, and the customer service representative said to remove the battery and put it back in--that solved it in about two minutes.  The other issue was the water was not flowing to all the plants on the white one, and a different customer service representative explained very patiently, step by step, how to adjust the water flow; it took just 5 minutes to fix.  Both calls to customer service were answered within 5 minutes (during the holiday season in December!), both people were very helpful and patient, and both encouraged us to call back if there were any problems at all.  There have been no more problems, and the plants are growing amazingly fast.  The lights are very bright, so you may not want the AeroGarden in a bedroom, but it is very easy to time the lights to turn on and off when you want them to--as long as it's the right cycle for the particular plants you're growing. I'm excited about the different seed kits they have--we'll try Italian herbs next. Very little work, and lots of plants. Oh--when you put it together at first it won't look like the picture on the box because you raise the lights as the plants grow, so your Aerogarden will look short at first.  Also, check the booklet to see if there are specific places to plant each pod.  It didn't matter with the lettuce, but there is a plan for the herbs, so don't just put them anywhere. This is a wonderful garden I know we will enjoy for years.
