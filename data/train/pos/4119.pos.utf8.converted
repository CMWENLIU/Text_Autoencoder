I have been a sardine eater for years and I love my boneless skinless. I have tried a million brands and variations. I have learned a few things.<br /><br />All sardines in this shape tin are from morocco and from the same plants. They are the same exact sardines in seasons, king oscar, etc; so its all about finding the lowest price brand and seller. I fully endorse these sardines and this seller as being an excellent example of service and quality goods. I ordered on friday and got them monday morning with free shipping option.<br /><br />These are boneless and skinless as specified with very minimal salt added. The fish was fresh even for my ridiculous standards, the olive oil was of good quality with the fish very well marinated, and the oil goes good with cooking or with good french bread and balsamic vinegar.
