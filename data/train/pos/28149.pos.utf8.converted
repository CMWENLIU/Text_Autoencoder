Good for your liver. My past couple blood tests for my physicals were showing borderline elevated levels of liver enzymes and CRP, so I was in search for some natural cleansing remedies. I believe this tea helped me. I have not yet recieved another blood test to confirm, but I do feel more energy at work. Whether or not its psychological, it works in my favor. As for CRP levels, it was a sign of inflammation in the body and I knew exactly where the pain was (my hands and feet). I have also been drinking Moringa tea (also recommended) but as far as I know the painful inflammation is almost gone. Before the tea, I was using prescription anti-inflammatory painkillers but now have put a hold on the medicine since I am feeling better. Was it the tea? Maybe, but the good part is that I'm not relying on meds. Only time will tell, but for those in doubt, this is a tea very well worth the investment if you are looking for a natural remedy of sorts.<br /><br />The taste and aroma is best described as nutty, kind of like roasted peanut brittle with hints of tahini or sesame. What I like about this tea is that the longer you let it brew the more robust the flavor and nutrients extracted. This way, I can just leave the tea bag in the kettle as I boil the water and also in my tea pot, unlike other teas like green tea which gets real bitter if you steep it too long.<br /><br />UPDATE 3.29.2012 ***********<br />Since my first purchase, I have tried another brand, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QY88">Alvita Tea Bags, Dandelion Root (Roasted), Caffeine Free, 30 tea bags (Pack of 3)</a> and have found Traditional Medicinals better to my liking. It provides a more richer flavor and a smoother aftertaste in my experience. Plus, each tea bag is individually wrapped for freshness and includes the draw string.<br /><br />I find the best time to enjoy this tea is early in the day. The bold, robust flavor of this tea seems to trick my body into thinking its coffee. I can drink to my heart's desire (or perhaps liver) and not have to worry about caffeine. It's a greay way to get that invigorating fresh brew without the jitters.
