i have two yorkies, one weighs six pounds and the other weighs sixteen pounds.  i started them out on the puppy formula and then gradually onto the adult small breed.  the quality of the food is good and i like that the bits of kibble are small enough for my little dog, but hearty enough for my big boy.  my vet recommended dry kibble over wet dog food since it keeps their teeth cleaner which is important to me.  it may be more expensive than the brands available at the local grocery store or walmart, but my dogs are certainly worth it!!
