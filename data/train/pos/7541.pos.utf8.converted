This is the best vanilla extract I have found, and the only extract I have found that contains no sugar. My family uses the Bakto extracts for flavoring seltzer with a SodaStream. Vanilla seltzer is my absolute favorite, but we also combine flavors to make orange creme (orange & vanilla), vanilla blueberry, etc. I highly recommend these products!
