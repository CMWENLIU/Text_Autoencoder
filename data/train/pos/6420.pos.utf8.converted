I have consumed two bags of this green tea.  It is an excellent quality tea, balanced in flavor and balanced in terms of the sense of well-being it imparts to the imbiber.  It helps me to concentrate better and helps to even out my moods.  It feels like a good detoxifier to take after eating a meal with a lot of saturated fats or meat, partly because of its anti-inflammatory effects.  It has less caffeine than regular tea or coffee.  Just enough caffeine to give a slight elevation of mood, but not enough to cause one to hyper-concentrate and feel mood swings.  Of course, this tea consists of loose leaves and twigs, and not tea bags.  This is an important concept.  In a typical supermarket, the tea comes in bags and has too much caffeine and is overly processed, which reduces its nutritional value dramatically.  In general, green tea bought from a popular brand in a supermarket does not contribute to the reputation for health that green tea has.  This kind of green tea that is in the natural form is the only kind that does.  I brew it by microwaving water to boiling, then letting the water cool for a couple minutes while stirring it with a spoon to agitate out any oxygen dissolved in the water.  Then put a heaping teaspoon of the tea in it and let it sit for 3-4 minutes.  Very hot but not boiling water is the key.  You will likely find that consuming natural forms of green tea like this one, raw and unroasted, is far superior to drinking most popular brands of tea from the supermarket, or to drinking coffee.
