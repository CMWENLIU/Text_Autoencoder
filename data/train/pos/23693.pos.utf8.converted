I've been using Fenugreek for about 2 weeks now.  I LOVE IT!  It works great.  I bought Fenugreek because I'm a working mom who pumps 2-3 times a day at work. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up with my babies needs because my first 2 weeks back at work the baby ate more at daycare than I could pump.  Within a few days of taking the Fenugreek I was pumping more than he was eating.  I no longer have fears that I'll have to supplement with formula.
