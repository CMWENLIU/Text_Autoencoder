At 33, I was hit with a sudden-onset (over the course of a month) wheat intolerance. I've always loved good food, have become an accomplished cook, and mostly cook from scratch. But...good ol' Kraft Mac & Cheese has been a childhood favourite that I've never stopped loving. When the wheat intolerance came along, I thought I'd never get to enjoy my occasional Mac fix again, but then I stumbled across this! It's received some criticism in other reviews here, but my guess they come mostly from people who don't have to eat wheat-free and either (a) aren't used to the slightly different flavour of the foods or (b) don't know how to prepare these foods properly (ie the cooking times/what to look for when preparing rice pasta), with the necessary tweaking. I thought this was delicious, worked well without a lot of doctoring, and was as close to my childhood favourite as I ever thought I'd get again. If you're like me, & thought you'd never get to enjoy that old Mac & Cheese standby, you'll love this!
