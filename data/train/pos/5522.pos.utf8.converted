I bought this green tea because it is organic. I knew I was getting a healthy product but what I got was much more. The taste is really good. It is fresh, smooth and full bodied. You will be pleased with this high quality tea. What a nice surprise. Note: This Bigelow product comes 40 bags to a box and 4 tea bags to a wrapper.
