Since I have begun to use this cocoa, my family and friends rave about the difference in my baked goods, my chocolate cake has been declared the best they have ever eaten. Recently I baked my chocolate cake with a cheaper dutch cocoa and my husband immediately could tell the difference. Sorry guys, pay the price and enjoy the best!!!!!!  Donna
