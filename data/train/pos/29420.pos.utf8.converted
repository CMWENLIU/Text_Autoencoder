I have had all three of the Fiber One Bars (oats & chocolate, oats & peanut butter, and oats & caramel).  I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.  But, now that I have been finally able to order these from Amazon, I will definitely let them try this new flavor.
