I bought this to make my own pepper cream for the wifes arthritis. Not to consume. Rub on affected areas, knees, back, elbows etc... I used 20% Pure cap in a mixture of baby oil. 3 oz of baby oil to be exact. Shake well and use where needed for pain relief. Rubbing only a small amount of this provides instant pain relief and LASTS for hours. You can decrease the amount of purecap to your liking. In our case we wanted strong and long lasting. No worries about that. 8 hours later you could still feel the burn. The arthritis pain was totally gone. We used so little of the mixture that the 3 oz of baby oil is going to last months. No more drugs, no more drug expense, no more drug side effects. This is a God send. But.... be real careful! Do not get mixture in your eyes or open wounds. You will be bad shape if you do. Always wash your hands in cold water and have lemon juice ready afterwards to remove residue from your hands or treated areas.<br /><br />I'm sure this product is great in cooking. However since we do not eat peppers I have no idea. Long live natural remedies!
