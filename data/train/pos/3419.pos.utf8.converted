Everyone in the household was incredibly skeptical when I added this to our super saver monthly delivery.  They were all reassured that we could always remove it if we didn't like it.  Not necessary...everyone loves it!!<br />The first night we got our shipment one of my sons grabbed a can to try; he was surprised to find that this was "supposed" to be a 6 serving size can.  He had already finished off almost all of it plain and on seasoned Triscuits!  We have used it on pizza; yes! Pizza!  It actually makes a great addition to a pizza with a white sauce base.  We toss it in salads, pasta, and rice dishes.  There are so many times that we just want a light snack and the addition of the Spam makes it like a mini meal.<br />The whole family loves it.  I had to upsize next month's order to make sure we don't run out too quickly.  :)<br />Just because it says Spam on the can doesn't mean it's mystery meat.  lol  Loving this stuff!
