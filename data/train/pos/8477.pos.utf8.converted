This is one of the last of the Original mincemeats available suitable for Tarts, and real pies. The U.S. Brands have gone to half mincemeat, half apples, which is O. K. for Apple Pies, but lousy for Mincemeat Tarts. Due scarcity, it is expensive, but necessary for real English Tarts. The Tart Pans are also extremely difficult to find since Williams-Sonoma discontinued them 15 years ago, They are available on a very few sites in England. The 29 oz. Jars go a long way.
