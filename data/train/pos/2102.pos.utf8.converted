I love Ezekiel products.  No flour=no fat gain.  I use Ezekiel for bodybuilding because they make the most nutritional grains that provide sustained energy with a minimal insulin response, and of course they are a reputable ALL NATURAL company.  Flour containing products are not as healthy and spike insulin (causing fat gain) compared to than sprouted grains, so to me flour has no place in everday diet (occasional desserts are a different story).  I don't even have anything to comare Ezekiel to because nothing else I know of is flourless in terms of bread or cereal.  Great products!  Of course raisin is the best tasting of the cereals in my opinion but the others are fine too.  They are a bit pricy, but you really do get what you pay for.<br />You know why many big name cereals (or any product for that matter) costs less?<br /><br />1. lower quality ingredients<br />2. they add nutritionally USELESS things like trans fat (if you see the word 'hydrogenated' in the ingredients, there are trans fats present.  Yes, even if the label says 0g trans fat because that actually means &lt;0.5g), high fuctose corn syrup, etc. etc. to extend shelf life of the product.<br /><br />In other words, many companies put ingredients in their products that have negative nutritional value so they can make more money by having less products reach their date of expiration.  IMO this should be illegal and until it is, I urge people to make the choice boycott any company that does this...  and instead support real companies that understand the connection between the earth and all living things.<br /><br />plantin seed, just plantin seeds  (lol bill hicks)
