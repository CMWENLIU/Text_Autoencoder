This is a great spice if you like your food tasty and on the hottie side.  It works well with everything from fish to chicken.  I like to use it to season my flour for frying or sauting chicken, fish and veggies, like summer squash.  I had been searching for this for some time an friend introduced me a few years ago.  Happy to have found it again.
