I bought this set of tea for my aunt, for a Hanukkah present.  I had already sent her the Numi teapot and tea, so this was to replenish her supply of blooming tea.<br /><br />This set was more colorful.  She shared it with some of her neighbors who come to her house to visit.  They were amazed by the flowering aspect.<br /><br />My aunt loves that I always come up with unique, thoughtful gifts for her.  This one as no exception.
