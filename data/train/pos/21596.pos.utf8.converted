The New Hope Mills Sugar Free Pancake and Waffle Mix is fairly expensive but it is also very low in carbs, which is very important to me since I'm a Type 2 diabetic.<br /><br />The pancakes do taste different than "regular" pancakes, but they are still very good. When used with a sugar free syrup these make a very acceptable breakfast for a diabetic or someone watching their carb intake.<br /><br />One hint to pass along, we cut back on the number of eggs used in the directions as the first batch tasted very "eggy".<br /><br />Highly recommended!
