My husband and I are big pasta eaters. (No low carb diets for us!) This spinach fettucine has long been one of our favorite variations on our routine pasta dinners, and we used to buy them for $3 or more per box at the natural foods stores before our local supermarket started carrying them. But even the supermarket's prices have never been as low as Amazon's.<br /><br />These noodles make an elegant and tasty foundation for all kinds of sauces, especially white sauces like alfredo. Or just do what we do: sprinkle hot sauce and freshly-grated Parmesan cheese over them and enjoy the simplicity of the flavors. They taste great AND look great, and they're priced right.<br /><br />Edited to add: I just noticed today that the product description says "wheat and gluten free" (well, actually at the time of this writing, there's a typo so it says "wheat and guten free") and I'm fairly sure that can't be the case. I have an empty package here to remind me to reorder, and the first ingredient is semolina.<br /><br />So if you're gluten intolerant, this is not a purchase for you.<br /><br />If not, though, the rest of my review stands - I love this pasta.
