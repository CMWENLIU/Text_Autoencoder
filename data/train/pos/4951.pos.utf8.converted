I originally discovered this product at Whole Foods when looking for a healthy fiber-rich carb source to add to my daily breakfast, and think the taste of this is absolutely great.  If you are used to a high sugar baked bean product (eg, Heinz Baked Beans), this will surely be less sweet, however.  My girlfriend, who also eats healthy, seems to only taste one ingredient in this - the Sorghum, and doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />I'd suggest trying it once (if you can buy it in a local supermarket, buy just one), and if you like it, buy it in bulk from amazon as the price is much better here.
