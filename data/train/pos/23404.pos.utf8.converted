This product is a snap to make.  The two flavor components (oil, flavor powder) are in separate packets so you can choose to use more or less if you wish.  The soup is not strongly flavored, but is very rich tasting and definitely satisfying.  It's also a good, simple base to work from if you happen to have a few fresh ingredients to toss in as enhancements.  A little sliced chili pepper, scallion and/or cilantro would really put it over the top.  I will buy it again and recommend it to others.
