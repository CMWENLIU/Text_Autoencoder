This is great tea. It tastes exactly like the tea that Aveda makes, but this stuff is actually affordable. It's certified organic (not that it's worth anything - it's not governmentally regulated really), but this stuff is amazing.<br /><br />It has a stronger peppermint smell than the Aveda tea but this stuff tastes just like it.<br /><br />If you want exotic tea without caffeine THIS is the tea you must try. It's amazing.
