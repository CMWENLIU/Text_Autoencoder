Well, we got a Keurig machine last year.  Almost all of the coffee samples that came with it were too watered down tasting for my wife and me.  So we started to experiment.  I'd say we have tried about 85-90% of the available decaf offerings.  This Jazzed Up version has been, by far, the best yet.  It has even allowed me to appreciate the Keurig again. My wife - not a decaf drinker - has even switched to this.  She's a bit particular and likes the store bought, caffeinated Sumatra coffee. I was going to try the extra bold Rainforest Espresso next, based on the reviews here.  I was about to order the Rainforest product but the rich, bold coffee taste of Emeril's Jazzed Up convinced me to go with it again.  Now my wife can drink coffee in the evening and not worry about it affecting her sleep.  I'll get the Rainforest Espresso next time and add a comparison here.  The Espresso will have to be very good to get us away from this one though. I do hear that the two are comparable - we'll see.  You can use the larger setting on the machine and fill a mug without sacrificing taste.  It's just a great cup of coffee, even for decaf.  I'm off to have another.<br />___________________<br /><br />I did purchase, and have tried the Rainforest Espresso since the above post.  I'm sticking with Emeril's Jazzed Up decaf coffee for my k-cup selection.  While still a good cup of coffee, the Espresso lacks the smoothness I feel we get from the Jazzed up coffee.  I'm not sorry I had two boxes of the Espresso as this was a very acceptable alternative to Emeril's product, but I don't believe I'll be ordering it again.  IMHO, the Rainforest Espresso is just a small notch, or two, below the Jazzed Up coffee for the smooth and robust flavor of Emeril's Jazzed Up k cup coffee.
