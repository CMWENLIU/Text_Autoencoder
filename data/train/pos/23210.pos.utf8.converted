I remember my mom buying "Americana Egg Custard" mix in a brown box (Jell-O) when I was younger.  As an adult, I gave up trying to find it in stores (it used to be by the tapioca)...but then I got pregnant and had a serious craving for it so I got online and researched until I found it on Amazon - and was happy to buy an entire case of it (only choice offered).  Now I get to make it at home again and enjoy this creamy dessert from my childhood memories!
