I purchased Amaranth because of the health benefits.  Unlike the majority of people who use this in place of rice or in baking, I purchased it to make popcorn and it's yummy.  Make sure you do NOT use a non stick pan.  Make sure it is very HOT before placing 1 TBS of Amaranth in the pan.  If it doesn't pop immediately your pan isn't hot enough.  Immediately remove your pan from the stove and shake shake shake so it doesn't burn.  Very tasty treat.  Keep in mind alot of the seeds won't pop but they are still very tasty.
