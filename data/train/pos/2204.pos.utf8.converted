I have been eating Skinner's Raisin Bran since I was a kid. It was the only Raisin Bran my Mom ever bought. A few years ago, when my local grocery store stopped carrying it, I quit eating Raisin Bran. Oh, every once in a while I would try some other brand, my husband prefers Kellogg's, but it would always turn out soggy and I can't stand soggy cereal. Recently, I started craving Raisin Bran and Skinner's was the only one I could imagine. So I searched on-line to see if it was even available anymore. To my amazement, there it was. I ordered two cases (shipping was free that way) and shared it with my family. Everyone was very happy and I get to satisfy my craving. I love the whole grain crunch that comes naturally with the rolled oat method and there are so many raisins that you get a raisin with practically every bite. I love Skinner's Raisin Bran.
