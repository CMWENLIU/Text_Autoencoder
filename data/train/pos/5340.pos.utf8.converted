We all know how expensive artichoke hearts are yet we have favorite recipes or dips that call for them. I always kept a few small cans on hand. When I saw this on a Managers Special, I did some calculations and thought I would try them in bulk and break down the large can into managable portions that I generally use for my recipes. I divided the can up, put the portions in zip lock freezer bags and into the freezer. I wondered how they would be when defrosted, because I still wanted the firm texture that they have. I was pleased to find that freezing the smaller bags did not affect the texture or taste in my recipes. So now I pay a little more in the beginning but get so much more for my money and always have them on hand when I need them. I now have them on subscribe and save and they just feep rolling in whenever I am getting low. Roland has good products and I always enjoy their specials!
