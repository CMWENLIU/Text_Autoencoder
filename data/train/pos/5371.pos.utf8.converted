My cat has been eating the original for a while and after reading some of the reviews on here I was concerned about the smell of the fishy flavor.<br /><br />He did notice it was a different smell at first but he really enjoys it, just as much as the original.<br /><br />I do not notice any kind of smell coming from the bag and I leave it near the cat dish.<br /><br />Grain free is so much better for animals. Try it.
