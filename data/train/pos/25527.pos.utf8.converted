I received this order of Xylitol with all 6 pouches in perfect condition, and already I've used it up!  I love the taste and find that not only is the blood sugar reaction much more gentle than standard cane sugar, but after a month or so of eating it consistently I find it to be far more satisfying in general.<br /><br />A tip for sensitive people, especially those with candida issues (since Xylitol kills yeast): try only a little bit at first and slowly work your way up before cooking with large amouts.<br /><br />A couple interesting things I noticed while cooking with it is: after eating 3 pounds of xylitol a month, there was no weight gain, though the equivalent in cane sugar would have done so, and I've noticed my food keeps for ridiculously long amounts of time (I don't know if this is the xylitol specifically or another ingredient, but it seems to be this sugar).<br /><br />Overall, since this natural sweetener is safe eaten in moderation and in fact beneficial, give it a chance.  Even if it doesn't become your only sugar, xylitol's excellent to have on hand.
