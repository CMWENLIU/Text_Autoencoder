There is something to be said about this candy.  I had never heard of it before a friend of mine gave me a piece that he had bought overseas.  Quite simply I was hooked at that exact moment.  Today's candies are too pretensive thinking that they have something new and exciting to offer.  Little do they know that Hi Chew was lying in wait.  The candy has a texture that is hard to describe, but imagine biting into a cloud of semi-hard marshmallows but not overbearing in the sweet department.  You need this candy in your life NOW!
