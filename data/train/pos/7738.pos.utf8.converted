A long time ago, an organization called the Dutch East India Company controlled much of the global spice trade.  One of their most prized items of trade was Nutmeg.  It was so valuable in fact, that if one were to steal a nutmeg from a storage facility or even freshly plucked... the penalty was death.  Thanks to persevering horticulturists, nutmeg and other closely guarded spices were freed from their tropical island locations and found their way onto the tongues of those who weren't royalty or at least rubbed elbows with them.<br /><br />Why the heck do you care? Because the good folks at Kellogg's decided to liberally sprinkle the stuff all over Cracklin' Oat Bran after first adding brown sugar, cinnamon, coconut and vanilla.  Nutmeg is a traditional add-in for oatmeal with some cinnamon so it's easy to see why they gave it a shot.  The result however is a classic "greater than the sum of its parts."  The mix of ingredients is perfect.  Don't get thrown by the Bran right in the product name... YES there's 6g of fiber in every 2 ounces or so but there's also lots of sugar and palm oil.  While it's not technically health food, the balance does work.  The only way I could describe the taste would be an oatmeal cookie mixed with a nature valley granola bar mixed with a macaroon and sprinkled with magic... but better.<br /><br />I don't even bother to put milk on this.  It's the only cereal I eat dry but it's just too good to get all soggy.
