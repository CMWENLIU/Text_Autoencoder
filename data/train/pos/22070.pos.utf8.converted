Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Firm and mashed style. All organic spices. Not oily. Not super spicy, but the chili, cayenne, paprika flavor notes are more prominent. [I add my favorite habanero salsa.] Approx. 305 calories, 21g protein, 3.5g fat, 630mg sodium per can. Lower sodium allows the flavors of any accompaniments to come out. Also is a great choice for those who like refried beans but watch their sodium. Hearty bean 'base' or paste that can be used with many types of cuisine or appetizers. Great company. Kosher parve. Also really liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTKQO">Eden Organic Rice & Beans, Caribbean Black Bean, Lundberg Brown Rice, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> by Eden which has been popular.
