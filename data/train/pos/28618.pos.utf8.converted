soooooo my debit card got mixed up with someone else's and after sending the proper owner a message i decided to reward myself for my kindness with an amazon shopping spree. this five pound blue raspberry gummy bear was the perfect purchase. even stolen, it still tastes delicious. plus, how can the card owner be mad, i mean its a five pound gummy bear. thank you bartender, for mixing up our cards and making this transaction possible. FIVE STARS.
