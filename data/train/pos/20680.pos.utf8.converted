Kitchen of India is on of the best Indian "frozen" foods. I have tried a lot of these packet Indian Foods like MTR, ASHOKA, etc but this is the best tasting product out there.. If you don't wanna cook at home and still want an Indian meal this is the best out there.. The Best i like is Dal Bhukara and Rajma, Also biryani is good too. You cant eat these all the time as it has high sodium content..
