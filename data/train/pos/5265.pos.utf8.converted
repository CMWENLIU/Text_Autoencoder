Okay the secret is now out!  Singhas mustard bath is some great stuff.  You have no idea how great this product is until you have experienced the benefits.  I take this mustard bath and mix it in a igloo of cold water and bring it to my basketball games and dip my towel in it.  Take the dipped towel and wrap around your neck and oh my God you just cool down immediately and the smell opens your sinus and helps you breath even better.  A definite adrenaline edge on the court.<br /><br />I also use this in my jacuzzi bath for achey muscles after a work out.  But I think the ultimate indulgence is a towel dipped in cold water and mustard bath.  Incredible!  Try it for your post work out or during your work out, it rocks!
