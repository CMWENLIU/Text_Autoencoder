After Hershey decided to "improve" it's Dutch chocolate I had to find a replacement for my chocolate desserts.  I brought every brand Amazon sold and tried them in my ice cream receipe. The taste just wasn't right, so I knew the cakes, pies and other desserts would be a disappointment to a family of chocoholics until I tried Callebaut.  The taste is what you want for ice cream, and no one could believe I could make a better devil's food cake than I already did.  So don't waste your time or money, stick with a proven winner!
