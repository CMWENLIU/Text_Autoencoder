I adore this light version of the Madhava agave because it is so versatile.  I use it in hot and cold drinks to sweeten without any sort of aftertaste.  It mixes easily into both.  It is the perfect compliment to tea or coffee, especially yummy in a vanilla rooibos!  I also use it in place of sugar in various recipes, especially any dressings.  I prefer it to honey because it does not crystallize and it has a very low gycemic index.  When you eat honey it is like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave, while high in fructose, is slowly released into the bloodstream so you don't have that after sugar crash.  Use the amber variety in place of maple syrup but use this light version for any other type of sweetening!  From one sweet tooth to another, agave will satisfy! I'm off to make some tea...
