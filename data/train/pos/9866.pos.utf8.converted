Have just discovered this chamomile citrus blend and now it is without a doubt our favorite tea.  We brew it in a Mr. Coffee drip pot that is dedicated to tea brewing and can get a whole pot from one tea bag so it goes a long way.  It is very tasty very lightly sweetened.  We love it hot or iced.  It's a real winner.
