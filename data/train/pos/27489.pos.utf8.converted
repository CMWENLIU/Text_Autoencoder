This is the best raw tahini I've ever had -- and I've tried many brands. It does have a very strong "raw tahini" flavor however, which some people may not like. But this strong flavor was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike one reviewer, I found little bitterness in this tahini -- I'd say it is far less bitter than the average raw tahini. If you want a mild tahini, go with a roasted one, not a raw one. But if you want a traditional tahini for traditional Middle Eastern dishes, I strongly recommend this one.<br /><br />I've used this tahini in hummus, baba ghannouj, sauce for falafel, and sesame noodles. The results have been fantastic with the tahini flavor coming through in the final product, whereas other tahinis you can barely taste.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, this tahini is more liquidy than other tahinis, no doubt due to a higher oil content, so you may have to cut back on the other liquids or oils in the recipe.
