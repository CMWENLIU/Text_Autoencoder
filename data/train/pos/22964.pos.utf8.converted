The cost of hummas in the grocery store compared to making it is a big factor in trying this product. I can make different flavors in the amounts my family uses. And we use alot. It is so easy to make.<br />With the Al Wadi Tahina in the 32-Ounce Jars I always have on hand what I need to make hummas. We think the taste and texture is wonderful and the cost is more economical than the small jars in the grocery store.<br />It came well packaged and in good time. Give it a try.
