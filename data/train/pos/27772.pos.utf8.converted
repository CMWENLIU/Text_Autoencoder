I LOVE this pasta!  I wish it were in more grocery stores so I wouldn't have to pay for shipping, but even with shipping, it is worth it.  I am in Weight Watchers and am thrilled that I can fill up on this great tasting pasta.  It has a wonderful taste and texture, and I don't feel like I am sacrificing ANYTHING by using it.
