This tea is the best! I put Splenda in my regular tea, but nothing at all in this one, because it has a very mildly sweet flavor, and no bitterness at all. When I was recently very sick, I made huge mugs of this tea, and didn't drink much else. It really helped! I don't detect an orange flavor, though, and was just surprised to see it on the ingredient list. I bet every batch comes out a little different, anyway. It doesn't make you sleepy, but it won't keep you from sleeping at all. Try it!
