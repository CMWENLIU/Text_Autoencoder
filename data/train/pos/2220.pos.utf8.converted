There's not a lot you can say about this: it's several of the most popular chocolate candy bars and they are, of course, delicious.<br /><br />I bought two of these bags for the office candy dish, and couldn't be more pleased. The bag contains Reese's, Almond Joy, Twix, KitKat, Snickers, Milky Way, M&M's, Peanut M&M's and possibly others. They appear to be more or less evenly distributed: it's not one of those bags with just one Almond Joy and two KitKats and the rest Crunch. You know how THAT goes in the office. Oh yes. Everyone takes the good stuff and in two days you're left with a candy dish full of nothing but Crunch bars when what you really want is just one Twix or even a Snickers, and you CRY to the HEAVENS, "WHY? WHY IS THERE ONLY CRUNCH?" as the thunder of the gods mocks you in your pain.<br /><br />Nope, not like that at all. Very good selection.<br /><br />The only downside is that all the Reese's peanut butter cups are pretty squashed. They still taste fine, but they seem to not weather shipping very well in these bags, so when you open one, expect chocolate shrapnel.<br /><br />Good product for the price. Got this through Amazon Prime, so it was fulfilled by Amazon and shipped quickly. Would definitely order again in this manner.
