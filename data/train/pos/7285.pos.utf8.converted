BEST FAT FREE DRESSING EVER!!!! Discovered it when I ordered the Almond Berry Chicken Salad at Wendy's!  I, too, was instantly hooked.  Love it!  Haven't been able to find the dressing in my local grocery stores. Just did an online search and found you can purchase the packets online at Amazon and at mybrands.com.  It's more expensive on Amazon. Also, you have to buy a case of 60 packets. Haven't found it bottled anywhere so far, but will continue to look cause I have to have this stuff in my fridge!!!
