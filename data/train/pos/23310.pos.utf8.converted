American-styled beef jerky like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P38XPE">Pemmican</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026W9U2E">Oberto</a> are typically chewy, dry and salty, but Chinese-styled jerky is much softer and far less salty tasting. This particular brand is tenderized and flavored with fruit juices, and is moist inside the bag. The meat is very juicy and tender, with a nice, but not overpowering, note of sweetness to it. It's not sour, as the description erroneously says. Also please disregard the strange Genmaicha Green Tea inset in the photo. It's obviously a mistake. Reviewer Mary is right that it should be about $1 an ounce, or maybe just slightly more due to inflation.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this product if you've never tasted Chinese-styled beef jerky. It is an excellent and tasty treat. The spicy fruit flavored variety is also fantastic and even better than this one if you like a bit of kick. You might also like Chinese-styled pork jerky such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VH8278">Formosa Pork Jerky Original Flavor-16 Oz</a>, a popular brand in Chinese grocery stores and supermarkets.
