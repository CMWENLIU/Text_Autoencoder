As everybody knows by now, xylitol tastes a lot like sugar, just a little sweeter.  It cannot be absorbed by the cavity causing bacteria in ones mouth so they ingest it and die.  It is the only really "safe" form of sugar, and can be Mixed with aspartame to become a sugar substitute with fewer calories and no risk of dental davities.  It cooks up great, no one else can tell when they eat it that it's healthy for them.  My teenagers think they are getting a treat and I'm watching out for their medical and dental health.
