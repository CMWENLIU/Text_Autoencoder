Let me start by saying that I have a monstrous sweet tooth. I'm pretty sure I've tried every protein bar out there, and this is the best one I've had by far. This bar is filling, but most protein bars are filling. What Think Thin Chocolate Fudge accomplishes is truly remarkable. The chocolate actually tastes like chocolate and not some contrived chocolate-imposter. The texture is chewy and smooth at the same time. When I eat these, I don't just feel like I'm "making do", when really, I'd rather have a cookie.
