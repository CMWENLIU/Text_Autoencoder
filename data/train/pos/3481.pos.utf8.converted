Friends gave us a jar of this as part of a "Taste of the Northwest" gift basket while we were visiting Seattle last year.  We eventually tried it, and fell in love with the taste, texture and ease of preparation.  You coat the salmon in a bit of the rub, and saute it in a little olive oil.  The resulting crust adds a mildly spicy, sweet flavor and a very slight crust to the salmon that my wife and I like better than any other way we've tried salmon.  Highly recommended, and we'll be ordering more as we're almost out.
