I have been a tea drinker for years and have always felt I was buying good tea when I bought the Celestial in the grocery story. Once I tried Yogi tea, I was hooked. I started it while going on a Juice Fast and needed energy and something to hold me from one meal to the next.<br /><br />This tea is perfect. It is great to take to work for breaks and just at home in the morning to get me up and moving. I have totally stopped drinking coffee and use my coffee maker to heat up water in the morning for my tea.<br /><br />I love the flavor (not fond of minty flavors) and it really seems to help me last from meal to meal. I no longer need a caffeine fix in the morning and my day often starts at 4 a.m. for work. I need all the energy I can get to get through a day at work.<br /><br />I have also lost weight which has been a battle after age 60. The tea with other sensible weight lose plans really has worked. This will always be my favorite, while also trying the other teas.
