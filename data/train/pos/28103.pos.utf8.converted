I'm big on Tom Yoong Goong soup.  While this isn't nearly as good as my local Thai restaurant, it is definitely a tasty quick lunch, great for clearing the sinuses, and a good starting point for those who like to add additional fresh ingredients to their instant lunches.  I like to make enough for two people (my momma and I) If you have the time to prepare this ahead of time I suggest adding:<br />2-3 servings. If making for one, just half the ingredients below<br /><br />2 A.C. Tom Yum soup portions<br />2.5 cups water<br />10 med. uncooked shrimp (optional for flavor and protein)<br />1 tsp of fish sauce (optional but added for more authentic flavor)<br />1-2 tsp lemon or lime juice (fresh or bottled)<br />1 tbsp coarsly chopped cilantro<br />1 sm. can of mushrooms (better to use canned as it is already soft and cooked)<br /><br />Heat pot on med. right before boiling point, drop shrimp, T.M. paste, fish sauce, lemon juice, mushrooms, noodles, and packet of dried veggies in pot. On med. low, cook for 5 min. Right before turning off heat drop in cilantro. Pour and enjoy.
