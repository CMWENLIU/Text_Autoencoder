It's not fair that some people reviewing this item give it such a low rating. You get what you pay for, and then some.<br /><br />.40 an oz.<br />$6.40 a lb.<br /><br />That's all the rating I need. This coffee IS EXCELLENT FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY. Also, low ratings for coffee shouldn't be taken seriously. I have 5 years barista experience and know what coffee should taste like and how to make it well. Most people over or under grind their beans. Play with your grind and measurements. Some don't clean their machines or replace their filters. Some don't store their beans properly. Coffee beans are highly porous and will soak up any odor, you MUST keep them sealed tightly and at room temp. Do NOT wash the container you store your beans in with detergent, only mild fragrance-free soap. At Starbucks we wiped the plastic bean hoppers once a day and washed them once a week. If you search "OXO" in Amazon Warehouse Deals, you might find the perfect container for these beans, I have one already. I suggest the OXO 5 quart.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Square-2-Quart-Storage-Container/dp/B000VJ4560/ref=pd_sim__8<br /><br />Flavor: Mild, low acidic taste, nutty, woody, takes cream and sugar well, smells robust but tastes semi-robust. It is, however, Poor Man's blend, right?  :)
