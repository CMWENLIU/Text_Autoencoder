The name may have changed but still tastes the same. Although all the flavors are great Malt is my favorite - and has been since the 80's! Problem is that my local stores stopped carrying the 10 count Malt packages and I had to buy the Assorted. With only 2 Malt envelopes I found myself rationing - and still when I craved a malt I found I had run out already. I happened to stumble upon it here and found the price acceptable. Now - I never run out! Once in awhile I'll have a desire for another flavor and that's where the assorted comes in handy but I am pleased I'm now fully stocked with malt. It really should be added to the subscribe and save program.
