Twinging is a quality tea and the Irish Breakfast is one of my favorites (Twining English Breakfast is also really good). A good tea ball/infuser with a really fine mesh or paper T-sacs will take care of the tea leaves. Boiling water with 1 tsp tea per cup is all it takes for a totally satisfying tea.  Enjoy!
