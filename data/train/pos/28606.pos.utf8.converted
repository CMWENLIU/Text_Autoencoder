We LOVE gnocchi! We discovered it many years ago, and are always on the look out for it at restaurants.  The brand we used to purchase, we could no longer find, so I turned to trusty Amazon.com, and found the DeCecco brand.  We are always skeptical of anything new in the gnocchi area, and I have to say, we have decided that this brand is even better than what we were using before!  We LOVE to have gnocchi with pesto sauce for dinner, and this particular brand is awesome!  You will not be disappointed in the flavor, and the price is not bad either!  As a matter of fact, I think I am nearly out of gnocchi, and will be needing to place another order very soon!
