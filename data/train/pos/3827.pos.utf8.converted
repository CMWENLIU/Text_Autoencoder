This is my favorite coffee for my Keurig coffee machine. It is a very high quality dark roast that is not lacking in flavor. Most K-cups are too weak for my taste, but this one really hits the spot! It's the closest thing to the strong coffee that Starbucks brews in their shops. I also like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Italian Roast</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a>, but the Starbucks French Roast is superior to both. Try it!
