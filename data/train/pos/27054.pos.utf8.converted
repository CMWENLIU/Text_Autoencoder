I purchased at Sam's for much cheaper & noticed that even the crunchmaster.com site had better pricing.  Have not tried the others yet but the Multi-Grain has a great flavor similar to corn nuts but not as heavy, I could honestly eat a whole bag in one sitting! Great that they are baked and not fried and a perfect snack for Vegans too.
