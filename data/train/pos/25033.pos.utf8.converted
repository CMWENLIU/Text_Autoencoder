I go to the .99c stores in my neighborhood in NYC and this stuff is $1.99 at the most expensive.  yet, Amazon seems to think charging $3.00 more for it is something "good".  Yes, this coffee is not the best, but then, it's not made for the US market (which I don't understand since it's available in most other parts of the world).  Still and all, DO NOT pay for this stuff here, go to a .99c store.
