I occasionally buy canned food to tempt my 17 year old dog to eat a bit more-- she enjoys this product.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat "by-products", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, no indigestible corn or wheat, a wide variety of wholesome and varied vegetable ingredients and several probiotics to promote healthy digestion and absorption of nutrients.  On top of that, this is a very palatable food.<br /><br />I came across this food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but after some research I can say that I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo food for my cat, too.
