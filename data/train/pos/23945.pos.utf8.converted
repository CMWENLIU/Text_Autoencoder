If you are going to go to the trouble to bake something that requires brown sugar, do yourself a favor (it may actually not be a favor, now that I think of it) and try this sugar instead.  It is (naturally) more expensive, but the results will justify the expense.  This is a moist, rich sugar with strong molasses flavor.  It will spoil you forever.<br /><br />I am accustomed to spending $3.00+ for this, so if you bake with any regularity, splurge on this package, store it tightly sealed in a cool place (not refrigerated) and enjoy it.  In molasses cookies, this is unparalleled.
