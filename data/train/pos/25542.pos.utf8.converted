This is a great mix, with a slight modification in recipe... double the eggs and double the amount of oil/butter then make the pancakes "swedish style" (very, very thin on a very hot griddle).  It's my favorite breakfast.  And my 4 year old daughter's too, who normally would never choke down any "yucky" gluten free stuff.<br /><br />If you follow the original recipe, you'll get a dense, fiberous pancake, as another poster reported.
