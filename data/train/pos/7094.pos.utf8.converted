Not much to say about the actual product -- who doesn't like M&M's?  One of life's simple treats that always hits the spot.<br /><br />I ordered this on a price dip which put it below what the warehouse clubs typically sell the big bags for. It's not a good value, however, at the regular price -- you can do a lot better at a brick and mortar store.<br /><br />Love them as-is or mixed in with ice cream. (Or, for that matter, mixed in with pretty much anything). Easy way to get a quick chocolate fix.
