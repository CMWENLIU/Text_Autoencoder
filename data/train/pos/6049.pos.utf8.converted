My first taste of Taza chocolate was their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L9WI76">chili-flavored</a> candy - don't laugh, it works! That impessed me so much that I had to try more in their product line. This vanilla-infused offering meets the high standard set by my initial Taza experience.<br /><br />With only three ingredients (organic sugar, cacao bean, and vanilla), the flavors come through crisply and well-defined. They open up in layers, starting with the bittersweet darkness of the chocolate itself. The vanilla note follows, pronounced without overwhelming. The finish includes a fruity tartness, possibly with traces of citrus. That last flavor helps remind that chocolate is a flavor from nature, and that natural flavors have complexities that reveal themselves differently to different parts of the palate.<br /><br />It didn't surprise me this time: the sandy texture of the stone-ground cacao bean. Don't looks for Godiva silkiness here - the texture calls to mind the ancient Aztec preparation of this wonderful flavor. If you can learn to like that, Taza could easily become your favorite chocolate.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
