I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw the Larabars in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours to try. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />If you are a big chocolate lover, I would just warn you that these don't taste like a chocolate bar - the combination of cocoa and chili powder is really more like a Mole sauce you get in Mexican cooking - rich, but not at all sweet. And the chili powder is not enough to be hot or spicy.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.
