I really loves the things that I've made with this flour (the pull-apart dinner rolls, chocolate chip cookies and bread).  The dinner rolls had the density of a biscuit but the look of a roll.  They were really fantastic for Thanksgiving, AND they heat up well.  The chocolate chip cookies were tasty as was the bread.<br /><br />Pro's;<br />Easy to store (no need to have 15 different bags of flours and starches in the cabinet)<br />Tasty results<br />Even gluten eating people thought the rolls were tasty<br />Good price<br />NO ADDED SUGAR!<br /><br />Con's;<br />First ingredient is white rice flour and the LAST ingredient is Almond flour<br />Has potato starch which tends to hurt my stomach<br /><br />I probably won't use this very often as I do have other choices but this definitely will be my go to flour mix when I don't want to measure out 9 different kinds of flours OR when I'm making rolls for special occasions (because they seriously were amazing!)  I think if you are cooking for celiac kids (or someone has just gone gluten free) then this mix is a MUST have.<br /><br />Edited 12.21.10 After almost a month of using this flour I have to admit it's my go to flour.  If a recipe calls for 3 cups of flour I only use 2 1/2 and add 1/2 a cup of teff flour for a little more nutrition.  I love that I don't have a million canisters of every type of flour known to man sitting in my cupboard/fridge and that I've had nothing but sucess with everything I've made using this flour blend.  Another perk it's cheaper than another amazing bread mix I was using and doesn't have sorghum flour or lots of sugar added!  I'm almost embarassed to add that I went through BOTH smaller bags in record time so I just ordered 4 of the 4lb bags!
