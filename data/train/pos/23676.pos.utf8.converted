I have been buying nutritional yeast in our local co-ops bulk bins for years. I wasn't happy that it didn't contain the vit B-12. I decided to give Bob's Mill a try and it is so delicious! The flavor is very cheesy plus has the B-12. We have already gone through 2 bags. Put it on baked potatoes, popcorn, steamed veggies..etc. Works great in dips, makes great cheese sauces. Best ever! I'll never buy any other brand again. This is the first time I have bought any type of food item from amazon and have been very happy,fast shipping. I am also happy I placed this item on auto shipping.
