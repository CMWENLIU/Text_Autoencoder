These are great. So far I've tried 5 hour energy (extra strength and regular) as well as 6 hour power.  5 hour energy is great but too expensive.  I saved a few bucks with 6 hour power but it did not work.  I'm very happy with Red Rain and I'm excited to pay only $11 a case with subscribe and save.  The flavor isn't great compared to 5 hour energy but I don't care since I take these down FAST. If I bought these to enjoy the flavor, I'd buy a big can of one of those sugary energy drinks.
