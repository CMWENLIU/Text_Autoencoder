I am really amazed at the low cost of this quality extract. You can't buy the lower-quality extract in the supermarket at anywhere near the price! It has a pleasant "caramel-y" taste. The three, 2 oz., bottles came wrapped well, and the only minor complaint that I have is that the extract tends to spill/drip when poured due to the small neck of the bottle.
