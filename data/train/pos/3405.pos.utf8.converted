This juice is rich, tasty with full-bodied taste.  I use it to make fruit juice shakes and in my protein shakes.  The reason why I ordered the juice is because I read that cherry juice is great for inflammation.  Prior, to drinking it I suffered from stiffiness and tenderness in my tendons and knees.  It has alleviated the stiffness and my flexibility is improving tremendously.
