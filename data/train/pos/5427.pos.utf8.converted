This brand is a favorite here in New Orleans and I've been drinking this decaf for years, but I was so surprised to see it for sale on Amazon.  It's delicious and super-convenient.  It has a measuring top that allows you to accurately pour it out an ounce at a time (that may seem like very little, but it's VERY concentrated so you probably would not want to drink it straight.)  In the summer time I mix it with cold chocolate almond milk over ice for a healthy, low-cal, mid-day treat.  Very refreshing!
