I have a 4 year old Westie who weighs about 17 pounds and is a very picky eater.  She will chew these treats a couple of times a week with no complaints and I do believe it has reduced the plaque on her teeth.  I combine these treats with a product called "Triple Pet Plaque Off and Fresh Breath" which is a clear liquid that you add to the water bowl.  In 3 months, she has gone from the vet recommending getting her teeth professionally cleaned to saying that they look great.  It has surely been worth the $20 investment to avoid a costly cleaning and anesthesia. Worth a try!
