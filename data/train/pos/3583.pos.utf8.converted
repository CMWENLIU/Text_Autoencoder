With free shipping from Amazon, this product is considerably cheaper than available locally.  A Japanese friend got me hooked on these noodles.  Better quality than run of the mill ramen, sauce flavor and seaweed great too.  I don't use quite the whole envelope of the sauce mix when tossing on the noodles.
