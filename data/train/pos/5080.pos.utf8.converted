I received this as a gift. I love dark roasted strong bodied coffee. That's the only kind of coffee I drink. My first cup was brewed in a small french press. The aroma was succulent. It didn't have the acidic aroma some compare to cat urine (my wife, a non-coffee drinker). The smell was potent, in a good way. It filled the whole downstairs with the small 2 cup press.<br />The taste was something delightful. Very bold in flavor with zero acidic flavor that I have grown accustom to with other dark roasts. There is a great nutty or woody background flavor with this coffee. Add a touch of cream to really bring out the nutty overtones. I have always been a Colmbian fanatic until I tried Caf&eacute; Altura's Peruvian Dark. Though this is beyond my regular budget. I will get it occasionally for a treat.
