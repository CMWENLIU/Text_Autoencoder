I live in California and have an elderly Aunt in Mississippi. She does not drive and has to depend on others for trips to the grocery store. The prices for things like Oatmeal may not always be competitive with places like Walmart or Costco, but ordering grocery items through amazon.com is a great way for me to help out my Aunt. I just talked to her on the phone while she dictated her shopping list.<br /><br />Thank you for this service, amazon.com!
