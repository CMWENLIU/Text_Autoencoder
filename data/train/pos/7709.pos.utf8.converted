I haven't ordered this 16 ounce bag, so can't vouch for that, but will say I think one should be careful when opening it, because this pepper is HOT! Try not to breathe... I've had a jar that I just finished of this pepper, and had it for 10 years and it was HOT HOT HOT until the very end. I can't even believe I had it that long, but you only need a little bit, and I have a high tolerance for spicy hot foods. Seriously, why bother with any other brand. Desperate for more cayenne, I recently purchased the only brand they had at a near by supermarket, and need to return it. It's not hot at all. Frontier is awesomely great!!!
