My new addiction:  peanut butter and coconut oil on toasted wholewheat bread.  It's yummy and healthy.  Also, coconut oil is a delicious change from olive oil in salad dressing.  Just melt it in the microwave--not too hot--and add garlic and lime juice.  Toss with lettuce and tomatoes and whatever else you like and you'll be oohing and ahhhhing.  I've also been using it on slaw.
