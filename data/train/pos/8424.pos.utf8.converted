Buy this chili. Really, I love to make chili, but it tends to be an all day (and somewhat expensive) proposition. This chili has a subtle and balanced flavor that one wouldn't expect from a can. As other reviewers have commented, it's not too hot nor too mild, but with this being such a subjective sort of thing, I'm not sure how helpful this type of information is. If it's too bland for your taste (I have a hard time imagining it would be too spicy, but it probably would be for my mom) you could kick it up with some hot sauce. What really impressed me then was not this "just right in the middle" characteristic, but the overall flavor and complexity of taste. Relatively good for you I suppose as well.
