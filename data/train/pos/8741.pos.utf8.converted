I am so glad that I purchased this item for my dog.  I have a golden retriever that is a very aggressive chewer. I cannot begin to count the number of toys, chews and/or treats I've bought for him that claim to be for aggressive chewers, only to be devoured or torn into shreds in less than an hour.  I hesitated in purchasing this item because of the price (I'm obviously tired of brands not living up to their description) but I am very happy to say that my dog worked well over 4 hours before the treats were gone.  He loved the taste of them and due to the design, they were challenging for him to get out so he really had to work on it.  Another thing I liked was the fact that the ball itself isn't hard, but feels gel-like and that is appealing to him.  This is by far one of the best things I've bought for him and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a dog that loves to chew!<br />UPDATE: Still a challenge for my dog after many months...he has figured out how to pop out the treat but I now insert it upside down so that the treat is concave instead of convex and that has worked very well.
