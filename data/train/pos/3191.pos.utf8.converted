I bought this and the Thai Tea teabags, and this product is definitely better.  It's stronger, has a better taste, and the color is beautiful.  I recommend buying the muslin filter as well.  It makes brewing this a breeze.  I use a recipe by Emeril on Foodnetwork's website, and I use the muslin filter when I brew.  It makes Thai tea just like I have in the restaurant!
