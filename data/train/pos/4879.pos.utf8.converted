This is a great vegetable stock. Sometimes I enjoy a spoonful right out of the tub!  It has a rich yet balanced flavor without the artificial sweetness found in may canned and boxed stocks.  It is a 20 times reduction of a classic vegetable stock made from carrot, onion and celery stocks, wine, tomato paste, lemon juice, garlic and onion powders and seasonings.<br /><br />Although I am a devout carnivore I have often cooked for vegetarians.  In doing so I have found that this stock reduction will replace a meat based glace or demi-glace in a sauce, (however, they also make a Roasted Vegetable demi-glace which contains a food starch which will thicken a sauce better than this one and has a stronger flavor) and it can be used as a base for soups and stews.  I often add a little of More Than Gourmet's Mushroom Stock for a more complex taste.  I use this so often that I buy it in the 16 oz. tubs.  They keep well in the fridge once opened.  A great product to have on hand.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO61AE">More Than Gourmet Veggie-glace Gold
