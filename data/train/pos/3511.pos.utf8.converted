My husband and I are lovers of figs living in exile, in the fig-challenged midwest. This jam tastes like delicious sweet fresh figs, is available year round. The only crappy thing is the really very high shipping cost from this seller. Their own website is just as bad. We ordered one, and then ordered a case the next time. Will probably include in our Christmas gift baskets this year!
