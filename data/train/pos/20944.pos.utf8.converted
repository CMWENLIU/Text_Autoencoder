These potatoe chips are now an addiction!  I bought my first bag at a local BevMo store when they had a 1/2 price sale.  We went back before the sale was over and bought a case of 12. These are not too salty and very nice tasting. If you are a fan of Kettle Cooked by Lays or Hawaiian Kettle Cooked, you will probably like these chips even more.  Highly recommended.
