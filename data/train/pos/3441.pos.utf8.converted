My 14 yr. old daughter has taken a GoGo Squeez with her lunch every day since August when she decided at almost 300 lbs. it was time to slim down. To date, she has lost 69 lbs.!!!!! I am VERY PROUD of her and if this product helps make her journey a little easier, it will always be in my pantry. We originally bought it in Costco but they don't carry it anymore. I was very happy when I found it on Amazon1
