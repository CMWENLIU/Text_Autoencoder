I do a lot of Cajun cooking. I have been making my own seasoning combinations for a while.. I try to keep MSG and sugar out of my diet. I decided to give this a try. I made a pot of chilly. The only change I made this time was this salt. It was AMAZING!! My only regret now is that I only ordered a pound. Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.
