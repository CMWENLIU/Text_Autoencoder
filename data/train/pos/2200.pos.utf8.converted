This cereal must be like one of those "cilantro things". Maybe some people have tastebuds that make it taste like cardboard and some people love it. I'm on the "love it" side so I felt I had to write a review. I think the flakes have a delicious toasty flavor and it always seems to have plenty of raisins (?). My kids like it too. This product is all natural, really, and has a great, old-fashioned toasted grain flavor. Maybe the other reviewers are used to eating chemicals for breakfast.
