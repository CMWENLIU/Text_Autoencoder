I have been purchasing diabetic cookies from The Old Dog Cookie Company for my 13 year old rhodesian/doberman for the last 6 years.  She was diagnosed with diabetes 7 years ago and has to take 2 shots of insulin a day.  I was so thrilled to find a treat for her that is homemade of natural products for diabetic dogs,  as there is nothing else like it out there!  (And even if there was, I would never stop buying from them as they are the nicest, kindest people I've ever met - by phone as I live in California and they're in Maine!).  Oh and by the way my dog Princess LOVES them!!  P.S., I buy the 5lb bulk as I have a large dog and they last longer.
