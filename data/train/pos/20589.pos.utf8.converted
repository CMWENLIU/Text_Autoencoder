I ordered this for my mother's Mothers' Day gift.  She loves good chocolate, and shares my disillusionment with Godiva.  This chocolate is wonderful!  I tried the milk chocolate, and found it to have a full chocolate flavor with the slight creaminess I love in milk chocolate.  My mother tried the Sao Tome, and pronounced it "excellent".  We will buy this again.
