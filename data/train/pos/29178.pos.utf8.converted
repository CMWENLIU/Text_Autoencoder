Guess what I'm eating right now?<br /><br />You guessed it...Bear Naked Banana Nut Granola!<br /><br />I was in the organic section of a grocery store the other night, looking for low-fat granola. (I'm on a low-fat diet to help combat elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. *wince*)<br /><br />I bought myself a 12 oz. packages of the Banana Nut, as well as the Bear Naked Peak Protein Granola. The latter was so-so, but the Banana Nut? YUM!<br /><br />It's delicious plain, in my opinion, but you could certainly eat it with milk/soy milk as cereal, or mix in with some yogurt.<br /><br />There are 11 servings per bag (about 1/4 cup) and here are some nutritional facts per 1/4 Cup:<br /><br />140 calories (60 from fat)<br /><br />Total Fat 7 g (10% DV)<br /><br />NO Trans Fat<br /><br />NO Cholesterol<br /><br />5 mg sodium<br /><br />17 g carbs (3 g dietary fiber, 5 g sugars)<br /><br />3 g protein<br /><br />If you love organic, hand-made, nutritional products, Bear Naked Banana Nut is wonderful! It contains almonds, and tastes a bit like dried banana chips + tasty granola.<br /><br />(P.S. The price here at Amazon is a STEAL! I would have paid over $10 more if I would have bought the same quantities at the grocery store!)
