This is a 1 pound bag of Non-irradiated certified organic orange peel - excellent texture and taste, very high quality.  It comes in a large foil bag.  I fill a small glass jar from the big bag to make it easier to use.  An excellent value as the grocery store charges $6 for a small jar of orange peel.
