To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've ever had Korean BBQ and it absolutely knocked my socks off.  A close friend recommended Mama Eun's home delivery service and I decided to go for it.  I placed my order, paid the bill, and forgot all about it.... until one day when the delivery guy dropped a package on my doorstep.<br /><br />Mama Eun's packaging system is great!  Everything came securely wrapped up inside a cozy disposable (or reusable) ice cooler.  The freezer packs inside kept the meat nice and cold during shipping and are now hard at work in my freezer (nice bonus!).<br /><br />Then, I went to town.<br /><br />I tossed about half of the package onto the grill and a few minutes later the aroma had my mouth watering.  Seriously, people - this is great stuff!  Everything is already marinated inside the package and ready to go.  The meat was so tender and fresh I seriously reconsidered every buying any kind of meat at my local grocer ever again.  Who knew delivered food items could be so darn yummy!<br /><br />Now I'm hooked.  I love Mama Eun's "homemade style" and business approach.  Everything was very professional (but not in a lame corporate way).  They even included some cooking tips/directions in the delivery.  Needless to say, i was very impressed by this company and will be back again soon.  I'm placing my next order right now...
