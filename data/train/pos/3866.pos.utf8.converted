I was worried about Arsenic, which quite often pollutes Rice Bran, especially for brans coming from China. So I called Bobs Red Mill customer service to ask if there was any control on the level of Arsenic in the bran. They told me it comes from California and there is no risk of it being contaminated with Arsenic. I hope thats the truth...<br />Its too bad that they dont offer an organic one.  I searched everywhere and it seems an organic rice bran is nowhere to be found.<br />Anyway this is really fresh, tastes fantastic, great smooth texture, you can use it in sooo many ways, and it's ready to eat, no need of cooking it.
