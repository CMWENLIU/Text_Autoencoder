This makes the best jello salad / dessert and I cannot find apricot jello in the stores in town.  Make jello as directed with 1 cup orange juice (heat to boiling).  Stir in 1 cup buttermilk and a box of apricot jello.  Store in the refrigerator.  This is divine.  The recipe easily doubles and triples.  Hope you enjoy.
