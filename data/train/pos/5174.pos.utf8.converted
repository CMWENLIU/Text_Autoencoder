I love the organic ingredients & portability.  They love the taste.  Every flavor we have tried so far has been a hit - grape, strawberry, sour apple (think granny smith - just tart enough but not really sour), mixed berry & tropical.<br />A winner all around for us in the snack catagory.<br /><br />Price here on Amazon is very, very good compared to my grocery store where you can buy these individually for about a dollar each.<br />I think you can also find these at Starbucks for about the same dollar a piece if you want to try before buying.<br /><br />I find them to be very similar to Stretch Island fruit strips in both flavor, texture & stickiness.<br />Not too sticky for eating out, but wet wipes always come in handy!<br /><br />We used to be on the subscribe program for a monthly delivery for additional savings, but the 4 variety pack is no longer in stock & this one isn't being offered on S&S.  (Which is a darned shame!)  You can get the single flavors on S&S but we really like the variety packs best.
