Why did no one think of this before??!! The angle to the brush lets you baste your food without burning your fingers, duh.  Plus it reaches to the back of the grill and if you're cooking a big roast it's easier to get behind it.  And I LOVE that you can put it in the dishwasher & don't have to worry about a wood handle or bristles burning and/or trapping bacteria - my old brush always kindof gave me the heebie-jeebies, basting raw meat with it and then having to hand wash and air dry - thoughts of salmonella were never too far from my mind.  Definitely an improvement over standard brushes (which trap either too much or not enough sauce usually anyway - this one picks up just the right amount.)  This is one grilling tool that is going to get some use in my oven cooking, too!
