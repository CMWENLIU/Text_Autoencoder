A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives).  Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did!  It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain.  I put the whole can in a blender, plus a tablespoon of minced garlic for added flavor, and puree.  With four tablespoons taken twice daily, the benefits are noticeable within a few days. When you sign up for the subscription service with Amazon, this product is delivered to your door for free, and at the best price I've been able to find anywhere.<br />I highly recommend this regimen as a dietary supplement. As I am not a doctor, I have included an excerpt from someone who is:  As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer.  Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance.<br /><br />The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good...  It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.
