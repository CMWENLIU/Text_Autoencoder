These dried blueberries are of a quality that I have not found elsewhere.  The fact that they are wild means they have almost twice the amount of antioxidants that you would find in cultivated blueberries. In other words, this is a super-super-food.<br /><br />And they taste great!  I like to add them to salads, especially ones that I'm serving to little people.  The kids love them.
