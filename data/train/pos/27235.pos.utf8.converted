I use two cans of the blueberries with one packet of the muffin mix for 6 jumbo muffins. Later, I add 1 tsp cinnamon to the extra mix packet to make apple cinnamon muffins. All the directions are the same, except add 2 peeled, cored, and finely chopped apples at the end (instead of the blueberries.) I make 6 jumbo muffins and bake them for 25 minutes at 350. As the oven heats, I heat the pan, then spray it well with food release spray, this makes for an easy release, because (I was told by a pro) the pores of the pan are open and really seal to the spray.)<br />Whatever you do, don't heat the oven over 375. They burn. (Each of these muffins (whether apple or cinnamon) count as one fruit serving, since they each contain enough fruit.)<br /><br />OR: Even better, you can substitute Bobs Red Mill Golden Flax Seed meal for ALL, or half, (start with half) of the fat! Try this! The muffins are actually MOISTER and stay FRESH longer, PLUS they pack a WOLLOP of GOOD fats and FIBER, and many other nutrients - without ANYONE noticing! Golden Flax is the sweet, tastiest flax, so dont hesitate to try it! Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4). PS These muffins can be stickier on the pan, so HEAT the muffin tin while the oven preheats, then SPRAY thoroughly inside, even letting the pan release spray pool a little in the bottom. Instant Release! (You also get a nicer "crust" by preheating the pan.) These disappear FAST at our house, but of course I dont tell anyone (all males) that they are HEALTHY! Enjoy!
