The idea of learning about trace aluminum in your typical brand of baking soda, had me searching for an alternative almost immediately. It seems Bob's Red Mill is one of the few brands that touts the absence of this metal in it's product. I can attest this does it's job well as sodium bicarbonate, and I recommend the use of this over less costly products from a health conscious stand point. Your health is something to revere, no?
