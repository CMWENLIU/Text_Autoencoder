The Raw Revolution 'Chocolate & Cashew' bars are very good, with a deep chocolate flavor not typically found in 'health food' and/or 'energy' bars.  Plus the Raw Revolution bars have just the right amount of sweetness.  The Raisin, Raspberry, and Coconut chocolate flavored Raw Revolution bars are also excellent!
