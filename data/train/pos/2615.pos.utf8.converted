I have two pugs, who have been on Newman's Own Organic dog food and treats for about 6 months now, with great results. While your dog will survive on any commercial dog food, the better the food you offer them, the healthier they will be and more longeivty they will have.  If nothing else, feeding a food like this one, because it is more nutrient-dense and does not contain undigestible fillers such as corn...less poop!<br />I previously fed Innova, which I was happy with, but made the switch to Newman's on principal.  Newman's donates all thier proceeds to related charities and has a seriously strong reputation for being a never-test-on-animals manufacturer (I know it's funny to not test dog food on dogs, but I don't mean taste testing- I mean ugly, awful, kept-in-cages-and-injected, etc. animal testing) and environmentally-friendly and organic (because less hormones and pesticides is healthier!) company.  Innova won't share thier practices...
