While searching Amazon for raw honey options, I happened across Ambrosia's Pure Honey.  Since we are a family that consumes a great deal of honey, this item of 4 bottles of 23 oz. raw honey is ideal for us.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save with this honey and the price is too good to be true!  Did I mention that the honey is delicious?
