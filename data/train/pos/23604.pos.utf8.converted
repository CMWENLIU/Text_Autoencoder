We were pretty excited to hear about these mixes coming out.  I talked to my local Harmon's grocer and had him order it and call me when they came in.  It was great.  We ate them with some people on a normal diet as well as those of us that are gluten free.  The Wheat-eaters all said that if it were served at a party, they wouldn't have suspected that anything was odd about it.  They said it wasn't the best cake they had ever eaten but it was good.  Translation, It's by far the best gluten free cake mix that we've tried and it is even as good or better than our cake we make from scratch.<br /><br />I'm a 24 year old who's been diagnosed with Celiac disease since I was 4. We've tried a lot of recipes and most everything we make from scratch is better than the mixes we've found. This time, however, we've been defeated and we're thrilled about it.
