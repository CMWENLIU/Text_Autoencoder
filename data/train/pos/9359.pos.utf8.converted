I have been a green tea drinker for several years. I have tried very many<br />different brands and flavors of tea and then I came across this tea & I love it!!! I started drinking it this past Christmas and I am on my third<br />order already! It has a great taste not bitter and the rice flavor has a<br />delicate nutty flavor. I'm telling you i drink this stuff all the time!!<br />I quit smoking in October and this is my replacement. I'm not saying this has any medicinal properties at all, but I find this tea really helps me when I have a craving. It's really great tasting and soothing!!
