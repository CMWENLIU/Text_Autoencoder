I can't talk right now because I have laryngitis. I always use this tea when I get a sore throat or laryngitis. I went to my cupboard to get some and make a pot of tea. To my horror, I realized that we did not have any Throat Coat left. I drank some other herbal tea for the warmth and ordered some Throat Coat using my Amazon Prime next day delivery. Hurry up and get here! I like the taste and it is the best for soothing my throat and relieving laryngitis.<br /><br />I send this tea to my daughter so that she can have it when she gets a cold or sore throat.<br /><br />I appreciate the warnings about various medical conditions. They should also add that persons with certain cardiac arrythmias should be careful about consuming large quantities of this tea because licorice can act like a cardiac glycoside.<br /><br />I am a physician and have sometimes recommended this tea to patients. The very minor risks associated with licorice are less than the side effects of some over the counter cold remedies. Don't get me started about Sudafed. Humidifiers and nasal irrigation can also help when you have a cold.
