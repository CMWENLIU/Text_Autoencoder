I've been using this for years, and teaching others how to make jam with it also. Last year some of my new jammers accidently bought other brands of pectin. They were very unhappy with the difference in the end product.<br />The best aspect of this particular pectin is that you can use any amount of sugar that you want, or none. I've found that most jams are really not sweet enough if you go less than 3 cups of sugar per batch. It still beats the heck out of the 7 or 8 cups sugar that a standard pectin recipe calls for.<br />But if you're making jam for a diabetic, you can use a sugar substitute instead.<br />This is the most dependable pectin out there.<br />And for 2 years in a row, amazon.com has had the most economical price for it!
