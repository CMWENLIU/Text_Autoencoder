I love this ramen. It's so cheap and easy to make. What I do is I boil about 20 oz of water (a little more than recommended since I like the broth), put the noodles in. Around 3 minutes I put in a beaten egg, then stir and chop to make the eggs into little pieces. At the 4 minute mark I put in the spice and veggie packet. Around 6 minutes I turn off the heat. Stir occasionally throughout. Comes out perfectly and much better than microwaving!
