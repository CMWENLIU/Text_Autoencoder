I was initially scared to try this noodle because it was brownish. Then I felt silly because: A) whole-wheat pasta is brown, and B) I eat seaweed all the time at Japanese restaurants. Well, these noodles are no different than JFC's white yam noodles, outside of the fact that they are healthier because of the addition of seaweed.<br /><br />The texture is really strong and firm, and they aren't too chewy (I microwave for 2 minutes prior to cooking in sauce or soup). I didn't smell any suspension liquid during rinsing, though it might be habit not to take any breaths before they are rinsed!<br /><br />This is a great buy and went really great with my minty-pesto mahi-mahi tonight.
