We had heard about Blue Buffalo from others who had cats that chronically threw up.  What we were told is that due to the chicken in many dry foods some cats are allergic to it.  We always thought it was hair balls and that was part of it.  After we tried this food he stopped throwing up regularly and with his regular brushing he doesn't throw up at all. The food is not cheap but it is worth the extra expense to have a happy cat.
