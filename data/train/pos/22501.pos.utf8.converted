Received this as a gift from my mom.  I am basically a lazy (or is it busy and overwhelmed?) person and I love the convenience and easy cleanup.  The device, container and basket are BPA-free, as recently confirmed by independent testing by the Svan company who is taking over distribution of the Babycook in the USA.  The steamer basket holds about a 1/2 pound of peas at a time, which purees down to a full baby food freezer tray, with a couple of servings extra.  Just how much of one thing do you want to make at a time anyway?  I expect that the Babycook will pay for itself, given the high cost of those little jars of babyfood from the market  - over dollar ($1.29!!! in some stores) here, even more for the organic ones.  Although I don't have hard water I always use filtered water, so there has been no brown stuff anywhere, like another reviewer complained about.  Also, love the fact that I can use the Babycook to defrost and heat the frozen portions.  Microwaves slightly change the molecular structure of foods.  The best part?  My three year old loves to cook her own veggie combinations in it (with adult supervision, of course) and eat what she cooks.  Since she is a picky eater I am over-the-moon about this.  I am also excited to be able to prepare meat in it because my husband has religious dietary restrictions and you can't get suitable prepared baby food.  Again, love this product.
