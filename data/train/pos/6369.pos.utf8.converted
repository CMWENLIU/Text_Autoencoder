A week or so ago, I heard an interview on NPR's "Splendid Table" program with Tom Mueller, author of "Extra Virginity" that convincingly suggested that "Castillo de Canena" Spanish olive oil was one of the few brands of the product that could be trusted to be high quality, authentic extra virgin olive oil.  While I almost choked at the very high price asked by distributor La Tienda, I ordered a bottle.  The oil arrived within a couple of days, heavily pillowed in bubble wrap, and we gave it a try immediately.<br /><br />I have to say that Castillo de Canena is pretty much everything that Mueller promised.  The taste is very fine; fresh, herbal and peppery.  It does provide the throat burn that confirms its therapeutic benefits.  And it does add a boost to anything it's added to, including salads, soup or just bread.  The problem, of course, is getting hooked on such quality at such an upscale price.  So while I will be a fan of Castillo de Canena for the indefinite future, I will probably check out Tom Mueller's other recommended sources for extra virgin olive oil in hopes of finding something as good, but a little less pricey.  The California labels might be a place to start.<br /><br />Meanwhile, this one is highly recommended.
