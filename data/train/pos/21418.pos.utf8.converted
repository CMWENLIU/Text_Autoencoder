I really LIKE this cereal, as opposed to..... well, this is something I can eat safely (without gluten). I put all those extra bags in the freezer but will definitely eat them up. Another popular GF cereal is so HARD and extra-crunchy that is beats up my tongue. This is quite tasty and just the right normal "flake" texture.
