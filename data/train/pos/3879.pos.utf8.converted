I am not a fan of plain drinking water and this product is my saving grace.  Even fresh squeezed lemon doesn't do the trick for me!  A clear glass of water over ice with a few droppers of this makes you think you are drinking something sweet and exotic.  What a treat!  You have to be careful not to get it too strong, or it becomes almost "bitter".  I also always put a few drops of Valencia Orange in my water bottles to take with me before I leave the house!  This is a can't do without product for me.  I usually buy 2-3 of these a month and was absolutely THRILLED to find it on Amazon as a Subscribe and Save item.  I'm out in the country and always have to plan ahead to keep my supply going.  I have tried the Lemon Drop and Root Beer flavors, and while they are good, this is the one that I prefer!  You might even be able to break a child's juice or soda habit by using this or one of the other flavors!  This is much more economical and eco-wise than buying the fancy flavored bottled waters that abound in the market place.  I drink out of a quart Mason jar and recycle the empty bottle when I'm done!  It is also a good way to flavor and sweeten hot tea!
