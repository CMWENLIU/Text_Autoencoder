If you can't have alcohol, this is hands down the best stevia on the market. Very sweet but not at all bitter. A little goes a long way. I use this to sweeten coffee, yogurt, just about anything. I even combine it with the Nunaturals white stevia pure extract powder for baking, and it works great! I won't use any other kind now!
