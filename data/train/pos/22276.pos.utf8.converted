For a few years I searched stores in my area to obtain the elusive creamy chicken maruchan ramen. Then finally, after deciding that this flavor must cause cancer and that is why stores do not sell it any more, I found it here! Cancer be damned because I am eating this wonderful treat from the friendly people at maruchan. Thank you.
