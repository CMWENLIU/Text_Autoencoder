It's difficult to review a food when each dogs tastes may vary.  This food is a high quality, grain free food.  The kibble is small (slightly smaller than ToTW).  I moved my dog onto it after she spontaneously decided that she didn't like ToTW Pacific Stream anymore.  Reviews on dogfoodanalysis.com and dogfoodadvisor.com both list the food as a high quality food.  I have seen comments on using asorbic acid as a preservative that can lead to bloating if you pre-wet the food.  If that's the case, well, just don't pre-wet it.  My dog is loving this food and has been on it for several months.  Her coat and breath are both good.  I also add salmon oil and royal jelly to her food, so I don't know if it's the food or not.  She also has Antler chews in the house.  Either way, I'm just happy that the fussy eater is eating.  The subscribe and save option offers about $10 per bag off of the regular price, plus I'm a prime member so I don't pay shipping.  They offer the different flavors in small bags if you're interested in trying it out before investing in the biggers bags.
