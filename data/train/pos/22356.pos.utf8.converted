Thankfully, this is prerinsed because the quinoa was too small for my strainer.  I steamed the quinoa the same way I steam rice i.e. in a pyrex bowl with boiling water covering it.  It was ready in no time.  It tasted fine until I added some salt and a spoonful of olive oil.  Even without other fixings, this product tasted fantastic.  It is definitely suitable as a rice substitute.  I had been eating steamed oatmeal for a week and gotten sick of it so this quinoa has turned out to be a great purchase.<br /><br />It took me a long time to purchase quinoa although I had seen it prepared many times on cooking shows because I couldn't tell quinoa from bulgur and couscous.  I will probably not bother with couscous because it is a wheat and is less nutritious than quinoa. I am trying to be efficient in preparing nutritious meals more than I am trying to expand my horizons. I am also trying to not aggravate diabetic potential.
