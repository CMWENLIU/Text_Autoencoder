I bought the smaller 5.5lb bag just to try it out.<br />My dogs LOVE IT.  I have three dogs, two 15 year old Pekingese that are VERY picky eaters and a Great Pyrenees that will eat just about EVERYTHING. I switched from another holistic dog food brand to this one since this is GRAIN FREE (even though it has potato in it) and my picky eater couldn't get enough of it.<br />However, when you first open the package, you can definitely smell the fishiness of it.  It almost smells like those Asian style dried squid snack.  But it is a lot more moist than most dry dog food and I can tell it tastes better by smelling it and looking at the texture of the food.<br />I was going to get the Orijen Six Fish instead of this one because of the dog food review website I was looking at.  But after two hours spent reading user reviews from different websites, I found out Orijen had some serious problems with their dog and cat food where animals died or seriously injured after eating that brand.  So far, I haven't read or seen anything bad about Acana, so I went ahead and bought the bag to try it out.  I made sure I got the Pacifica one because it is one of the best kind of protein you can feed to your dogs (non-farmed fishes that is).  So far so good, but its something that will take longer than just a month or two to reach... in order for them to get "better", I suspect I will have to continue them on this product for at least a few months to see the real difference. Perhaps I will write an update then.
