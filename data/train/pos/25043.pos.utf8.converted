I decided to give up coffee because of all the brouhaha over cortisol ... but boy did I miss it. Tea was a poor substitute (so I thought), because the longer you brew it the more bitter it becomes. Then I discovered Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast Tea.  Wow - you can brew it to full-bodied deliciousness and it never gets bitter. It's especially tasty with milk in the morning. Not just a substitute for coffee (which it certainly is), but a wonderful, refreshing way to start the day, all in its own right!<br /><br />STRONGLY recommended!!
