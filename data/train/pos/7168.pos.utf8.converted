I always come back to this blend. Although it is great to try all the designer espresso blends I just keep coming back to Lavazza Supercrema, it just makes a consistently good cup of coffee. I generally do 3 or so cap's a day and maybe a straight shot of espresso after dinner and either way it just tastes good all the time. Not to strong, smooth flavor. In my book it ranks up there with the best. I run it through the Mazzer and Rancilio Ms. Sylvia for a great cappuccino. Enjoy.
