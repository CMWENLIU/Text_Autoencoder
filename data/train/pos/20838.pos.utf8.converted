I use Anasazi beans as a substitute for Pinto beans. I've been buying them from Bob's Red Mill for several years, most recently through Amazon.com, and have always found them of excellent quality. Anasazis cook more quickly than Pintos,have a particularly delightful flavor, and go well in Chili dishes and multi-bean soup mixtures. In fact, these versatile beans go well in almost anything that calls for dry beans. I recommend them highly for anyone who likes beans.
