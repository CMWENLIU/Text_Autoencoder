I tried this today at a local gourmet purveyor of wild mushrooms, it was in a salt shaker at the cashier.  I've never tasted anything so wonderful, incredible.  So, I bought a jar immediately.  I was on my lunch hour from work and I had stopped and bought a basil, fresh mozzarella and tomato sandwich, would this taste good on it?  Oh my goodness, it certainly did.  A little goes a long way, but this is an incredible condiment to add to your pantry.  I won't be without it if I can manage it.  Don't hesitate, it is worth every single cent of the price.
