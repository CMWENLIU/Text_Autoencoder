For those that have negative comments about the product...please check out the Betty Crocker website...it would take you less time to get all the information you are looking for than to write the negative reviews.  By the way, yes, these products are made in a gluten free facility...Betty Crocker has a whole website dedicated to their new gluten free products and definitely worth checking out.<br /><br />Now - I've given up on trying to make a gluten free yellow cake - I haven't liked any of my recipes or any mixes...Until the new Betty Crocker mix.  It really is yummy and has GREAT texture - very smooth and moist.  will buy over and over again!!!  Thanks Betty Crocker!
