I love this product! It makes gardening easier when you can just spray and get rid of unwanted grass. The frustrating part is when you can't find it anywhere. It disappeared for months and I was afraid they weren't making it anymore.<br /><br />This is one product you'll always find on my shelves. I also like the Weed-Be-Gone.<br /><br />When I go to gardening stores, they are always trying to convince me to buy some other product when I already know what I want. This works! I don't want to add water, mix, etc., I just want to pick it up, use it, and get on with my life. I have to 'fight' my way to the check-out counter, but it's worth standing my ground. It's easy to use and effective. I recommend it highly.
