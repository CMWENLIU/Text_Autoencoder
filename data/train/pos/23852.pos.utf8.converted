I recently bought the Yogourmet yogurt maker along with this starter.  I had never previously made yogurt, so I thought it would be best if I used a starter instead of trying plain yogurt for the cultures.  It turned out perfectly for me.  The directions are simple, and the product does what it should - produces delicious yogurt.
