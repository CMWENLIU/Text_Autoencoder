My bottle of Kikoman soy sauce lists no MSG in the ingredients so that's good but there is 920 mg of sodium in a tablespoon.  Compare that to 320 mg of sodium in a tablespoon of Braggs Aminos and that is quite an improvement.  Plus the Braggs Aminos is made of purer ingredients and provides sixteen amino acids.  Tastes just as good as soy sauce too so it's a no-brainer to go with the Braggs.  When I ordered I did not realize the bottles had pump spray tops on them.  It's great - makes adding to steamed veggies or whatever very easy.  You can unscrew the top to pour also.
