We haven't used these to bake yet (although we will soon with Halloween right around the corner).  However I opened and tasted the spring green color and it tastes good and a little unusual - remember it is colored with spinach - I think it tastes like turbinado sugar, which we all love in my house. I think once it is baked it will taste just like regular sugar cookies. The sugar is made up of sugar crystals, it is not the refined granules we are all used to which I think will add a fun touch to the decorating process for the kids.  My kids have a strong reaction to regular dyes in colored sugar and other unaturally colored products, so I was very happy to discover this product.  India Tree also makes naturally colored food dyes which would be good for frostings and such.  We haven't tried it yet, but I am going to order that next.
