I will admit that I was worried about buying these after reading the review from the person whose pup became sick after eating four of these, but I decided to take the risk and carefully monitor my own pup.  My 3-month old Golden Retriever puppy came to me with giardia (for which he has been treated, but at the time, he was still experiencing some problems), so I didn't want anything to exacerbate his gastro issues.  I'm relieved (no pun intended) to say that my puppy, along with my two Great Pyrenees, and my gimpy old lab/husky mix, have all four gone through this 5-lbs package of rawhides (in just a little over a month) with no problems at all.  I sent some home with my mother for her terrier mix and for my sister's doberman, and they've had no problems, either.<br /><br />The rawhides are a good mix of small and relatively thin, along with a some (more than half of) which are larger and thicker.  There is no odd (eg., chemical) smell coming from the rawhides, and the bag is resealable - like a giant ziploc bag.  I'm placing my third order (sent one bag to mom and sis for their dogs); the quality is excellent and the value is unbeatable.<br /><br />August 2011 Update:  I have had these on a monthly auto-shipping order for several months, but the last two shipments were bags with rawhide chips that are almost entirely small and thin, and have not included the larger & thicker pieces I mentioned earlier.  I hope the next shipment will bring back the larger pieces.  If it does not, I do not think I will continue to purchase these.  They are fine for small to medium dogs, but are simply too small for my 70+ lbs animals, and they just don't last very long.<br /><br />December 2011 Update:  The last three shipments have seen a return to a more diverse sizing of the chips.  I expect that there will continue to be some variability, but I am especially pleased with this month's bag, since it has many of the thicker chips I prefer for my big dogs.  These thicker chips might be less than ideal for the smallest of dogs, though I think most determined pups would be okay with them.  I plan to continue to receive this bag on a once-a-month automatic shipping order for the foreseeable future; I think it might be possible to make this bag last more than a month even giving all four of my dogs one chip a day, but we're never that orderly, and I find that I'm usually out of chips several days before a new shipment.  With fewer dogs, you can expect this bag to last several months.
