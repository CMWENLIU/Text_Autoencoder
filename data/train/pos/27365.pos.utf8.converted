I found this formula after doing a lot of research 2 years ago.  I was weaning my daughter and wanted to put her on something I felt good about.  At the time, there was a scare regarding most powdered formulas.  Babies Only was one of the few that wasn't affected.  I also appreciated the fact that it didn't smell foul.  I figured if it smelled ok to me, it would be more appealing to my daughter and that proved to be true.  She rejected other powdered formulas, but transitioned beautifully to this one after initially trying some liquid ones that she seemed to like.  I just had a hard time finding it locally.  Only Whole Foods carried it and they were constantly running out.  Fast forward 2 years and when I was weaning my son, I immediately put him on this and he took to it well.  Again, I had trouble consistently finding it locally, so I started using Similac organic. But, as luck would have it, just a month after using it, there was another recall!  It's just too scary how often that happens with the popular brands.  When I started researching alternatives again, I found Babies Only was still the best.  I discovered that Similac Organic had an extremely high sugar content- no wonder my son liked it!  Unfortunately, Babies Only wasn't much more available, but happily I found it here on Amazon and it's basically like buying 2 and getting 1 free, with free shipping.  I just wish I had found this 2 months ago as he's just about ready to get off formula.  Anyway, I LOVE this product.  As a mom who nursed both kids for 10 months, this is the only formula I felt good about giving my kids.  Neither had any problems with digestion, transition, etc. with it.  I highly recommend it.
