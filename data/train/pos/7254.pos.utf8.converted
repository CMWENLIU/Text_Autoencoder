This is the finest Cola I have found yet.<br /><br />There is a small store near me who sells it by the bottle.<br /><br />For cola drinkers, this is significantly better than Coke, Pepsi, etc., but the real treat is when you use this in place of Coke in drinks. (for those of you of legal drinking age)<br /><br />It's not just the quality of the liquor that makes a good rum & cola, Captain & cola, bourbon & cola, etc., it's the quality of the COLA that makes a good drink SOOO much better.<br /><br />Fore those of you mixing, use a high quality liquot with this high quality cola.<br /><br />I recommend Captain Morgan Reserve, Myers Dark Rum, Jim Beam Black, Maker's Mark, etc.
