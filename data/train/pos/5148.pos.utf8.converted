As you can see from the reviews for the other sized containers of these cherries, they are really something special!  I used to choose my breakfast cereal from a cupboard full of 20 or so assorted varietes of cold cereals to keep more morning meal interesting, but now that I have these cherries, I actually look forward to having the same oatmeal with cherries every morning!  I sprinkle a handful in the bowl with 3/4 c. quick oats and 1 cup milk (for the calcium), microwave for 2 minutes, and it just makes my morning; and I am fully satisfied until lunch.  The cherries have the perfect amount of tartness and are soft enough to chew easily (not dried and leathery like some dried fruit).  Also, they don't come in bags, as advertised here, but in clear round containers with replaceable lids.  And they are cheaper than the bagged SunMaid ones in the grocery store!  This quantity lasted me about two months, so I just bought some more.
