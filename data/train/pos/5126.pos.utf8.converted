I wanted to incorporate gelatin into cooking and diet as I can't always make bone stock. This stuff is great! So far I've used it to gel up soups, pumpkin pie, and to turn some dishes into custards. I sprinkle it on my food for an extra dose here and there. Seems like a better source than anything that would be put out by Kraft or Knox, and way better price.
