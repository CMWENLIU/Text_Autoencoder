Of all the date sugars I've tried to bake with, this is by far my favorite. I simply substitute 1 cup date sugar plus 2-3 tablespoons water (to help it mix well) for 1 cup granulated or brown sugar. I've found that cookies made with date sugar are always better the next day (if they last that long). Great results making peanut butter, brownies, honey snickerdoodles rolled in date sugar and cinnamon, vanilla wafers. For chocolate chip cookies, I mix date sugar with a little water for one type of sugar and unrefined cane sugar (Rapadura or Sucant) for the other. The kids love them!
