I was offered the Italian version of this product via the Amazon Vine program and I liked that so much I decided to try the other two flavors, the French (this one) and the Napa.  This one is also very good.  The herbs used blend very well to make a very flavorful combination that has a subtle mustard bent to it. I put some on salmon filets and it was wonderful.  Unlike many other seasonings, while this one does contain salt, the salt does not overwhelm. Instead, everything works together to make a very nice blend. This is a very versatile product - you can use it on pretty much anything.
