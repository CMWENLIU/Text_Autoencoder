Brilliant way to indulge in the flavor of chocolate without having to think about sugar or gluten or anything else you might be trying to avoid.  Last year I drank this yummy organic tea while on a detox plan and it was very satisfying and felt decadent.  It smells like hot chocolate or, as my son says, brownies, lending a soothing aroma-therapeutic effect as well.<br /><br />The tea contains nutrients such as Vitamin D, potassium, and magnesium, antioxidants and Theobromine which boost energy and mood.
