Recently, my local feed and grain store upped the price of their bully sticks so I've been searching for a cheaper online supplier. Everyone else seems to have similar prices, wanting 3.50-4.00 dollars per bully stick not to mention shipping so I was thrilled to find these on here. My dog loves them just the same as any others I've bought for her. There was an even mix of some skinny sticks and some thick ones and it works out to be much cheaper to buy them this way rather than by the price of a single stick.
