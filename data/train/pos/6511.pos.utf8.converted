After trying a sample of the Almond Trail Mix Bars, I immediately ordered a pack of 12.  They are so moist and delicious, you won't want to eat just one.  They taste nothing like the bland, healthy treats I have tried in the past.  I shared these with my family and the 12 pack was gone in 3 days.  I highly recommend them.
