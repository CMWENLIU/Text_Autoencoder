The pecan pie bars are delicious. In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars.
