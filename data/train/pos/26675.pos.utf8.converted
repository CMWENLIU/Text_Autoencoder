I ordered this to make cocoa syrup (I used half this stuff and half dutch process cocoa powder)-- it turned into a concoction "so dark, light cannot escape from its surface".<br /><br />No, no, I didn't burn it.<br /><br />The syrup was so rich I could only use a teaspoon or two at a time, because the flavor of the cocoa is so powerful. It kept for over two years in the fridge with some crystallization. It's perfect for making hot cocoa or mocha.
