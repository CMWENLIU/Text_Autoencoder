This oil is very healthy, just google all the info out there! We used up all the three bottles for a family of 2 adults and one child, much faster than expected, within 4 months! I subscribed&saved this for every 6 months delivery, so now have to order more! There isn't much flavor to the oil, which can be a good thing! it's great to fry with, bake and on salad! There is no better price than on Amazon for this amount! Much recommended!
