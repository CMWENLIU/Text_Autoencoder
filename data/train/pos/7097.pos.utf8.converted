I've tried a few of the other Nong Shim noodle bowls, such as Kimchi, Seafood, and Beef & Ginger. This one's easily the best. The spices provide a suitably lobsterlike flavor that you'd expect from bowl noodles, it's sweet, and there's just enough spiciness to keep it interesting without putting your mouth on fire. Unless you really let the noodles sit in hot water for too long, they remain pretty firm for the meal. On top of that, the bits of cabbage and other veggies aren't much but add a nice extra crunch to the entire thing. Highly recommended.
