I am addicted to shirataki noodles. No joke! If you check out lowcarbfriends.com, there is a thread I started in the main lobby. We've had over 20,000 hits, and there are almost 600 posts. The majority of the posts are from people who are now eating shirataki noodles, instead of pasta. It's great for losing weight, adding fiber to your diet and like tofu, they taste like whatever seasoning or sauce you use with them. I have them five out of seven days a week.<br /><br />There are some recipes on the thread on lowcarbfriends, including noodle pudding (kugel), spaghetti pie, among others. These noodles are the BEST!
