Tried the Granola Gourmet Ultimate Fudge Brownie Energy Bars and couldn't believe how fudgey they were.  They are like an intense Tootsie Roll that actually has lots of redeeming nutritional value.  Great for the whole family.  Don't think there are many chocolate options for diabetics and this one is the real deal.
