Unlike the other reviewer, I don't have problems with the gum sticking to my teeth.  Maybe their mouth was abnormally dry?  It has just the right amount of softness and I just love the taste and how long it lasts. The taste is not overbearing like many of the chemically laden gums.  I was trying to find a gum without all the fake sugars like all the rest have, that tasted good as well.  This is by far the best I have found. I have bought several cases of this stuff. Buy it and you will see.  Great taste without all the chemicals of other gums!!
