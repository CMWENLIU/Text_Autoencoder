This product is not inherently evil, despite what the reactionist one-star reviewers would have you think.  It is used by the finest restaurants to create unique cuts of meat.  When you eat pasta made from shrimp or a filet of duck and rabbit meat, you know they where fused.  Europe banded it not because it's unsafe, on the contrary they found it safe, but because it can mislead consumers.  europeans are more into real food than us, like raw milk cheese, preservative free bread, and beverages lightly sweeter with real sugar. If you doubt this, ask a european what they think of chicken nuggets with cheese on wonder bread with a 46oz coke, yuck!  While I can understand why some people would find gluing meat strange, there is no cause for this outrage.  There are tons of thing that the meat industry in this country does that actually endanger our health and violate basic tenants of human compassion.  Meat glue is not one of them.  Please, stop posting one star reviews on a product you have never tried, and if you must, don't use straw man justification to prove that a natural product is dangerous.  Truth is, frankenmeat and imitation crab are wrong not because they are dangerous but because, like much of our food today, they are sold to perpetuate the American notion that meat should be so cheap that it becomes the basis of every meal. So only buy good meat, and eat less of it.  I, however, like using the product to attach a thick strip of bacon to a prime filet, and there is no scientific basis that that is dangerous.
