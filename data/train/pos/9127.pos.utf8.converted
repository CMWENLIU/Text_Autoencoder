Seriously, this stuff is addictive.  My family argues when it runs out, the same way we would over who finished the last of the milk.  The flavor is hard to descibe but it inspires a certain fanaticism in most people and I've never heard anybody who wasn't impressed after trying it.  The Sesame and Miso has a stronger, spicier flavor, but this is light and really improves mild lettuces like iceberg.  Another advantage is that a little goes a long way.  It isn't the healthiest (but what dressing is?), as it's high in salt and has about 7.5 grams of fat per tablespoon.  On the other hand, it is cholesterol free and has no preservatives added.  I figure, since I enjoy salads now and wouldn't touch them before, that it's a good trade off.  And, really, it tastes amazing.
