Update: February 2012 I told my friend about how to use this product for cooking and how it was helpful for weight loss result - May 2012 she has lost 2 dress sizes and she has more energy.  Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.  After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva.
