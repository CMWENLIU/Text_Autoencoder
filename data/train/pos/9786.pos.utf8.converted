I was encouraged to try this for at least two reasons: we live in an earthquake-prone area and I wanted it for our disaster supply kit. The other reason was for my convenience because we drink our fair share of coffee and cocoa (hot chocolate) and want to have a great-tasting cream available all the time. This product fits the bill on both accounts. I am also going to try the Nido full cream powder and also the Willpowder dried cream (low-carb diet). But you can't go wrong with Peak powdered milk with cream, it is delicious! ADDITIONAL REMARKS/UPDATE: I haven't yet ordered the Nido, it seems expensive. Having compared both WILLPOWDER and PEAK products, PEAK wins! Willpowder is OK but it has a strong aftertaste and consistency that got to us. Keep in mind that if you're on a low-carb diet, Willpowder is cream with zero carbs and Peak is powdered whole milk so it has carbs.
