I first bought this sauce when a local chief recommended using as base (with butter, plum wine, water, shallots, ginger, and garlic) for pork (yum) but it turned out my picky son LOVES chicken marinated in it (wouldn't eat chicken previously, now it's a favorite - thanks Koon Chun - he also will only eat steak with their BBQ sauce). I am writing this review as I make another order (for both). Shipping is a couple of dollars less at reseller's web site.
