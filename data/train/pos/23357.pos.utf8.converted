I've been taking this supplement instead of Orange Juice in the morning or when I don't have a chance to make a fresh pot of green tea.  It's very thick and I always dilute it with water so it can last a long time.  It only recommended to keep it in the refrigerator for 2 months once opened.  I generally dilute 2 1/2 ounces of concentrate with 7 ounces of water.  The taste is really good.  I tried the Noni juice by the same manufacturer, but the Pomegranate is far more palatable.
