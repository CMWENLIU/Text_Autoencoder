This coffee is right up there with Kopi Luwak Coffee and if you've ever tasted it you'll know what I mean. I love this coffee and the best thing about it is that it doesn't cost as much as Kopi Kuwak coffee. I'll be buying a lot more of this coffee I promise. It has no bitter taste to it at all like the coffee we buy from the stores. It has a rich, full flavor that will sooth your taste buds. If you haven't tried this coffee you are missing out on a very pleasurable experience.
