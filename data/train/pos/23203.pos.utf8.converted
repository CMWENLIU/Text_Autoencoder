My cats love this stuff.  I give two of them one can a day and the rest of their diet is dry food (also Organix).  They are only 1.5 years old, so the effects of keeping the cats healthy may not be obvious, but they are both calm-tempered, gentle and friendly overall.  No major shedding, stool is generally in good shape, and they are enegetic.<br /><br />PS  I know the stuff is expensive, but I have had cats and dogs both in the past.  Often, when they get into their senior years, they begin to their physical constraints.  I have seen organic food do wonders for cats who are older and therefore I decided to use organic food for my cats from their kittenhood.  I guess I won't find out until later on how it impact their longevity, but so far, I see nothing but very healthy cats able to buck whatever illnesses come their way.<br /><br />Best,<br />Steven Epstein
