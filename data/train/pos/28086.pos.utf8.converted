Coconut flour is amazing for making delicious and easy baked goods.  I make pancakes and muffins with it. There are great recipes on the web.  It is very dense and filling, so usually only a little bit of it is needed in the recipe, balanced with a large amount of eggs, milk, and oil.<br /><br />A great gluten free flour.  However, large baked goods like a loaf of bread tend to fall apart, so for larger items it's good to use another flour mixed in.<br /><br />Great price on this product. Very pleased with my order.
