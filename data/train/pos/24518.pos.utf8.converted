Everyone I know loves this waffle mix. It makes wonderful waffles. I've shared this "secret" recipe with friends since I found out about it from a relative. Last year I even purchased some for Christmas gifts! The mix is so easy and does not require special ingredients. I even keep a can in our travel trailer. I would suggest you order enough mix to qualify for free shipping because it keeps very well in the pantry. The waffle mix is wonderful as is, but I plan to try making them with milk or soda water as some reviewer have suggested. Enjoy!
