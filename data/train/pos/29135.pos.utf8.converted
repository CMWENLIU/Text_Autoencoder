I'd bet that this is pretty good- my dogs thought so! ha!<br />Bought some of this in bulk from the local natural food store, and planned to use it last weekend.<br />I'd not purchased this before, so only purchased ~ 0.5 lb, and was going to make 'meat' balls for spaghetti for dinner.<br />Unfortunately, I had placed the bag in a location accessible to (normally non-foraging) canines. (Am not irresponsible- just didn't think they could reach there!)<br />I arrived home (granted- one hour late from the pups' normal feeding time) and found only a thin plastic bag and the twist tie left, with the bin number written on it.<br />The mix had been COMPLETELY consumed by three medium sized dogs (likely just two, knowing their typical behavior), with only a very light dusting on the carpet left to give a clue as to what had been consumed.  It was a POPULAR find, as they often just don't finish off their 'kills', as the sport alone (conquest/capture) is largely sufficient without complete consumption.<br />A call to the natural food store ('just what was #96?') confirmed that it was this mix, and a websearch confirmed relatively benign contents that did indeed 'pass in the night' (and for the next few days)- and all is well.<br />Would not recommend this method of ascertaining quality/palatability, but am looking forward to my next (SECURE) purchase to try this mix!
