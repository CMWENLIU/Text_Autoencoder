Sure, you've got to have some patience if making even a simple risotto with little ingredients, but it's the cooking time, the prep and then stirring, for about thirty minutes or so, that makes this so. If you're a rice lover though, and you've never tried making this creamy dish, you must give it a try! Not only is it easy to make, but it's one of those dishes that you can put on the table, roll out the impressive name it comes with (I just love the way risotto sounds when spoken) and you've got an impressive and tasty presentation for guests or even your family.<br /><br />It can be as simple as the great recipe on the box, which Amazon lists in the label description above, or you can fancy it up with some great grilled chicken or shrimp and crispy (or steamed if you prefer) veggies. I would recommend using a good wine, one you'd likely drink with your meal, since this only adds to the amazing flavor (cooking wines DO NOT do the trick!). Experiment with the recipe on the package if you want. Parmasan cheese is a great additive at the very end, it's rich pungent smell coalescing with the other flavors excellently, but don't be afraid to try some others,. i.e. fontina, asiago--heck, even some cheddars work great! When those short grains start to release their starches, the creaminess comes into play and you're almost ready to eat! The smells are devine and it's a dish you will not be able to resist. RiceSelect's risotto rice works great every time, making for the perfect risotto experience.
