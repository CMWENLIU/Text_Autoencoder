Before I sing the praises for this wonderful product, I will tell you a few things about myself:  I do not eat anything processed or that is imitation or that has chemicals in it.  I do not even eat processed sugar or flour.  This is not necessarily for health reasons, but because I simply do not like processed foods.  Therefore, there are very few foods, other than fresh foods, that I will eat.  I am very picky about my foods!<br /><br />This picky eater is giving this cherry pie bar 5 stars.  There are no added sugars, chemicals, or anything else.  There are only three natural, healthy ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries.<br /><br />Taste:  I've often heard that anything that's good for you does not taste good.  These bars must be the exception.  They taste so good, I have to hide them from myself!<br /><br />Healthiness:  These bars are only made with natural ingredients.  No added anything.<br /><br />Energizing:  Because these bars have only natural ingredients and no added sugars or chemicals, they give you the energy you need and cure your hunger.<br /><br />Convenience:  Because they don't have to be cooked or measured or heated, and you don't need a spoon, these bars are good to take for a lunch, or when you are traveling, or just when you will be out and might need a healthy snack before you get home.<br /><br />I have become addicted to these wonderful bars.  They are truly amazing.<br /><br />Also, I must add, these bars are vegan and kosher.  I do know that it is hard to find vegan-friendly foods.  Healthy, convenient, tasty, and vegan.  How much more can you ask for?<br /><br />These bars come in different awesome and amazing flavors.  This particular bar is cherry pie.  It tastes just like a cherry pie. It is amazing how they can make them taste this way without any added sugar or anything else, but only with natural ingredients (and only a few of them at that).  If you like cherry pie, you will love this bar.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  And not just to health-conscious people.
