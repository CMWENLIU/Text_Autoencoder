Seriously it is the same stuff they use in theaters.  If you ever visit the Carmike 14 in Tyler, TX you'll see big canisters of this stuff lying around the concession stand.  My girlfriend and I love this stuff, and she was elated that I was able to find it because for some reason they don't sell it in any retail stores around the Dallas area.
