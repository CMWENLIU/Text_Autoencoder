I was a bit worried about purchasing these online for Mother's Day on Wednesday night since I've heard a lot of things about this vendor not delivering, or that the flowers were not very good.  However, my mom received this on Saturday evening right before Mother's Day, and she was very happy when the flowers started to bloom about three days later.  They were very beautiful, and I am happy to see that this vendor really carried through.  Great service, and great product!
