Because of allergies to wheat and corn I decided to give Dogswell products a try. This is the first dry dog food my dogs will eat without adding gravy or meat or veggies or leftovers and they do so eagerly. It smells good enough for me to eat and they haven't scratched since they started on this product. Amazon's price is cheaper than I can get locally so not only is the food good, it's a bargain at that. I love you Amazon!
