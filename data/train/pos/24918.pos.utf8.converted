The Keen-Wah Decadence bar is CRAZY GOOD.  The first thought I had when biting into it was Rocky Road ice cream!--SUPER rich & chocolately, and you get this explosion of textures in your mouth of chunks of almond, and the crunchiness of chia seeds. The chocolate is just right, not too sweet, but sweeter than dark chocolate.  The best part is, THE INGREDIENTS ARE ALL ORGANIC, Gluten-Free, VEGAN, and Non-GMO.  I've been searching for some great vegan bars this past year, and would definitely say that this one, along with Vega's newest line of protein bars <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005P0UFQO">Vega Sport Protein Bar Single - Chocolate Coconut</a> (which I also reviewed) are the BEST tasting, and contain quality ingredients. Way better than candy....<br /><br />Here are the ingredients:<br /><br />-Almond butter, coconut nectar, Peruvian cacao powder, chopped almonds, cacao butter, Peruvian cacao nibs<br />-Chia seed, sprouted quinoa flour, brown rice protein powder, Himalayan sea salt<br />-Chocolate Coating: dark chocolate (evaporated can juice, cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, soya lecithin)<br /><br />**UPDATED - 7/21/12<br />SCORE!!!  For some reason, I decided to Google these, and found them on Walgreens.com! WAY BETTER DEAL than ordering on Amazon-- 2 for $5  OR $27.99 for the 12pk. + Free {everyday} shipping $25 or more. Apparently they're sold in-store & online, but none of the stores near my house carried them.
