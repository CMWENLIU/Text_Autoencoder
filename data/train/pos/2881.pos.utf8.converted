My Aussie pup loves the flavor of the Wild High Prairie blend, but didn't much care for the sample of the salmon. The only (and signficant) downside to this product is the dog ended up having awful breath. We called it buffalo breath. We started him out on no grain, free range or wild foods to avoid health problems.  We switched him to EVO and the bad breath disappeared, but he prefers the taste of Taste of the Wild. He actually leaves EVO in the dish uneaten...never a morsel left of the ToTW. I might have to learn to live with the buffalo breath.<br /><br />Went back to ToTH and the buffalo breath resolved itself. The Aussie pup is now nearly two and should be the poster dog for this food. The vet, complete strangers, everyone remarks on his beautiful thick coat, shiny eyes, and great energy. His teeth are beautifully white and he is the picture of health. He can spend a full day running with us as we back country ski...his great stamina and exuberance while breed characteristics, they are well supported by this high quality food. We'll never feed him anything else. Portion control is important, however...feed what the bag says.
