I thought I was going to have enough to share out of the first box I bought, but we keep EATING them!  An excellent snack food that satisfies my sweet tooth as well as adds more fruit to my diet.  My sister made cranberry bread pudding which was fabulous!  They store well in the fridge.<br /><br />I just bought another 4 lbs and am going to split them up to give to friends.  This is an excellent value compared to buying the small 6 oz bags at the grocery store.  I'm looking forward to trying the dried cherries and blueberries as well.
