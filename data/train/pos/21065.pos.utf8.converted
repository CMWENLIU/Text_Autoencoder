I will be the first to admit that I am not usually one to recommend any of the higher priced soup mixes.  Being a an old time soup maker from way back, I am not at all opposed to soup mixes for I have a couple of them I favor, and are even reviewed here on Amazon. Bobs is probably the most expensive out of the lot however.  I have never bought Bobs mix from Amazon for it is available locally, (and fortunately at the same price Amazon offers it for). Its easy to imagine that a veggie soup mix is just about the easiest blend of mix to come up with.  They pretty much all have the same ingredients as to peas, peppers, corn, etc.  Its just the stock that is usually the random element as to its real flavor and return factor.  Bobs red mill mix however has definitely broken the mold as far as freeze dried veggies.  They have to be the tastiest that I have ever eaten.  And believe me, as an old time camper and hiker with decades of experience with one pot dinners over an open fire, that is definitely going some.  I have tried just about everything that you can buy, and made everything that isn't.  Trust me, Bobs has proven to me that not all dried veggies are anywhere near made the same.  As for the stock, it is very flavorful.  I would have to say just a notch or two below my own stock.  (And trust me again, that is very much going some)!  The only item I should mention is the same thing many other reviewers here have taken note of.  This is a no salt soup mix.  Not low salt, but none at all.  I really think it is going some in the other direction to think someone could eat this without any salt at all and throughly enjoy it.  But considering how really fresh and delicious it tastes, adding your own level of salt is easy, and for some a very convenient alternative. If its variety you favor, consider this mix a base for anything you like.  I have added beef to it, hamburger, chicken, pork, and even Italian sausage and they are all remembered as some of the best meals I have ever eaten.  Franky I think this is the best soup mix I have ever had, plain, or doctored.  I recommend buying it here on Amazon if you can't find it locally.  And that you order enough of it to qualify for the free shipping.  Believe me after you have had this soup once, you will want it again and again.... Highly recommend.
