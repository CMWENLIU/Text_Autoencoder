We purchase these dinosaurs constantly.  For some reason our dogs just LOVE them.  Unlike the Nylabone bones, these dinos last alot longer as well.  They are funky shapes so our dogs can manipulate them better to hold and chew.  If you have big chewers like my dogs (three lab mixes), I HIGHLY recommend these chews!
