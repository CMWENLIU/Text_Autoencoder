I have an intense dislike for all fake sugars out there, and have tried every one I could get my hands on. Ideal Sweetener is the only one I like. It is perfect for baking and you use it cup-for-cup in recipes instead of sugar. Zero calories and has no funky aftertaste like most artificial sweeteners. I am so happy I will be able to order this on Amazon in the Baking Bag, as all the stores in my area only carry the small packs. Finally, I can make cookies and breads without all the calories!!<br /><br />EDIT: If you are using this for baking, it is not zero calories. I contacted Heartland Sweeteners to find out the calories-per-cup, and this was the response:<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Heartland Sweeteners.  The FDA allows any food item with less than 5 calories per serving to be labeled as "zero calories". Ideal has 202 calories per cup versus over 770 calories in a cup of sugar.
