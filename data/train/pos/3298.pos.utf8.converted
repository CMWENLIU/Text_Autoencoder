I have been using this for about 6 years - my boys all love it!  I chose to start them on Almond Milk instead of Cow's milk as babies, so the flavor to them is completely normal.  It's not exactly what I want to put on my cereal or in my coffee.  My kids love it on the cereal or in their oatmeal.  I frequently bake with it, and I have found the consistency to be an excellent alternative to dairy.<br />I pay $1.69 for 1 32 oz container at Trader Joes.  Don't be suckered into paying $48 for a 12 pack!  That's over $4 a container... what a rip-off!
