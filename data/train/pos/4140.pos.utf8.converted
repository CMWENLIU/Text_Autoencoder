I use this product in a commercial kitchen and bakery.  It has an incredibly fresh and clean orange scent, with no bitterness or alcohol scent.  It is quite concentrated, and I've found that you can use about half of what a recipe calls for.<br /><br />I also add about 1/4 teaspoon per cup of orange juice required in a recipe to give the finished product extra orange flavor.  This product contributes nicely to the overall smell and taste of a finished product.
