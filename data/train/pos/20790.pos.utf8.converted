Our kids really like these freeze dried strawberries. They're nice and crunchy. I also prefer the 4 ounce tubs - the raspberries come in an 8 ounce tub and you have to eat them quickly so they don't get soggy.<br /><br />These strawberries are great as a snack, or on cereal. We usually end up eating them right out of the tub...
