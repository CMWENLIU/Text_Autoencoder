I bought this to make my own homemade vitamin c serum at home. I am not confident of the stability of those expensive vitamin c serums at the store or the high end ones. If they are still good, that means preservatives of some sort. I wanted a good, no-nonsense vitamin c serum so I searched online and found a recipe that calls for camu camu powder. I found this brand and I have used it to make several batches. I only make 10 days worth at a time and it's so easy. I feel more confident that it's working and it feels and looks great on my skin. It's so easy and so inexpensive to make at home, I am so happy. I figured if this didn't work, I can always mix it  in juice and take it as a supplement. So far, I like it. I have even shared some powder w/family to take for their ailments. They say vitamin c is good for everyone... and with all the other benefits of camucamu powder, I do not regret this purchase. It came in fast, and packaged well.
