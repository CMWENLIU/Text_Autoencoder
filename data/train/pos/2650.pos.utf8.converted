I have grown up with this product - over 57 years.  While many manufacturers have cheapened their products over the years, Solo has maintained the same quality and consistency over nearly 6 decades.  The filling is clearly dominated by the poppy seeds themselves - the filler and binder is kept to the minimum necessary to make the product work.  Flavor is excellent and consistent.  I highly recommend Solo Poppy Seed filling.  In our family it supports THE classic family pastry: babovka.
