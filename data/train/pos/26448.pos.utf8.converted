Fresh butter creams are a true luxury, but none so luxurious as the coffee butter creams. One taste and you will be in a soft creamy world of buttery chocolate and creamy coffee flavor. Highly recommended as one of the best chocolates I ever tasted. This is a chocolate you will be talking about in 10-20 years. I fell in love with Leonidas chocolates the first time I tasted them in Belgium and would look the world over for a box if I couldn't find them here. If you are looking for the best chocolates in the world, you just found them!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
