I am a diabetic and I love carbs which is the worst thing for someone like me. I found these products online and I now eat pancakes every Saturday and Sunday!  It is amazing how delicious they are when I make them with a little tweaking.<br /><br />My recipe is so good, I even had pancakes for dinner a few times!<br /><br />I always use  one package of sweet and low, 1 egg beaters container (2 eggs), a little bit of banana, almond, lemon or vanilla flavoring, a touch of oil and a touch of water, I shake it really well (have my own little shaker for this now) stir it to test the thickness of the batter...and start making pancakes.  I top it off with a little whip cream (sugar free and sugar free rasberry ice cream topping) and it is soooo goood!!!  Just  like eating at IHOP or Waffles restaurants!!<br /><br />I recommend getting a small container (for 1 person) with a top for shaking...it makes it so simple..less than 2 minutes and it is ready for the fry pan!
