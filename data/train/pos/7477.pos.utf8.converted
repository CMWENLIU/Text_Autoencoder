As has been noted before, if you arent familiar with Cacao Nibs, dont expect them to be sweet. They aren't sweet at all and are actually somewhat bitter...which is what they are supposed to be. They do carry a peculiar scent due to the natural fermentation. Anyway, that is the bare bones basics of your good old fashioned nibs, and these fit that description. I do enjoy the flavor of them by themselves, but mostly, i use these for a few different things: homemade trail mix, smoothies, sprinkled on waffles, and on rare occasions, i use them for mole and other savory dishes. They are a natural powerhouse when it comes to cancer fighting agents and necessary nutrients.<br />So, why by this brand? Well, they are certified organic, are rinsed with purified water, and basically, every care is made to send them to you the way they should be....good, clean, healthy. Also, the subscribe and save price really surpasses pretty much everybody else's pricing, and especially if you would normally buy these at Whole Foods, Sunflower, or any other organic minded store, you will pay much less here. Solid packaging as well.<br /><br />So, a winner for sure, and in my opinion, a must have for any diet, and especially for vegetarian and vegan diets.<br /><br />Enjoy!
