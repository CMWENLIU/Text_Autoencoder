This product will keep you alive. Significant calorie count. Fairly high carb/protein ratio for energy. Oddly nice, mild taste; reminiscent of fruit cake. 10g (40% daily) of fiber! It will power through your digestive system with the inexorable force of a fruit-n'-nut-flavored glacier. You know that saying about the bear doing something in the woods?  That'll be you. Not a bad thing, just keep it in mind.
