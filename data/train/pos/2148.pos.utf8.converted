My husband and I went wheat free a few months ago and at first I bought a very expensive loaf of Rice bread which was so dry and nasty I gave it to the dogs.  I bought a bread machine and purchase Namaste Gluten free bread mix with fear and loathing.  We were so relieved and happy when we tried the finished product.  It is moist and quite tasty!<br /><br />One thing you should know - each loaf requires 1 whole egg and 3 egg whites!  We ended up with a lot of left-over yolks! (the dogs were happy).  I purchased some White's Only and all is well.<br /><br />The Mix works wonderfully in a bread machine.
