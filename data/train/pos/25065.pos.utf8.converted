I have been trying to find a dry cat food that consists of good nutrition, organic veggies, organic meat, meat meal, vitamins, and everything that my kitties need to have a healthy diet.  I used to buy one of the major vet brands, but found that the carbs were extremely high.  I have a cat that is diabetic.  After doing research on what is best for indoor and/or diabetic kitties, I have found this food to be exactly what I was looking for.  Not to forget the best of all....  all three of my kitties absolutely love this food!  There was no problem making the food switch.  Thank you for such a wonderful product!
