This toy provides a great workout for your cat.  The thing I appreciate most about it is that it's manufactured in the USA, so I felt good about buying it even before the cats got to try it out.  I have foster kittens who absolutely go nuts over it.  My older, lazier, cats also like it a lot, although they prefer to sit and swat at it as it buzzes past them.  This toy requires supervision or the feathers will be history.<br /><br />Great exercise, made in America, cats love it.  What could be better?
