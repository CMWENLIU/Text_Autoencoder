I don't normally care for soup mixes, but thought a single serving mix was worth trying, especially for 150 calories per serving.  I was pleasantly surprised by the full flavor of these soups. They are a little thin, but still flavorful, and they don't have that 'processed' taste a lot of mixes have. They are high in sodium, but that's nothing new for a soup. Just be careful with the rest of the daily menu so it all balances out.  The red chili and the green chili soup mixes are perfect with a cup or two of chopped broccoli thrown in.  I tried broccoli in the tortilla soup but it wasn't a good mix. I may try adding chopped squash or some other veggie instead.<br /><br />My package was leaking powder when it arrived. Several of the packets were not sealed properly and had leaked out. Comida Loca customer service was genuinely concerned and very attentive and sent a replacement. I've also ordered another box from Amazon.
