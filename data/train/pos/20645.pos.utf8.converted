We live in a remote area and I ordered the salted anchovies so my wife could make traditional Korean Kimchi.  These were perfect - exactly what we were looking for!  The order was shipped within 48 hours and the product was really packed well so there would be no breakage.<br /><br />If you need anchovies for salads, pizza, kimchi, or to give any meal a burst of flavor - then these are really delicious and gourmet quality.
