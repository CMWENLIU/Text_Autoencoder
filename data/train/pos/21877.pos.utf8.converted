Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried, these by far are the best.  They are close to the real thing as I recall.  Sometimes they are difficult to obtain.  Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me.
