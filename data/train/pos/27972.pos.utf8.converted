I have been using Himalayan salt now for over a year and agree that it's the best salt on the earth.  The taste is mild and smooth, has no after taste, and it doesn't seem to cause any thirst issues when added to foods.  The minerals in it are good for you, and it has no chemicals and is not heat processed.  Your body doesn't treat it as a foreign object, like it does with commercial salts with only sodium & chloride.<br /><br />I buy multiple grinders and give them away as gifts to friends who also care about what they are putting into their bodies.  I've even read of people keeping it in their purse to use in restaurants (I haven't gone to that level yet).  The price is high compared to other table salts, but it's worth every penny.  I will never buy commercial processed salt again as long as this salt is available.  I just keep refilling my grinders!
