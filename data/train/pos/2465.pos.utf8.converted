It started when my niece was five years old and the only way she would eat her sweet potatoes was with "shaky cheese" on them.  That's all she would eat whenever she was out with the family - sweet potatoes with THIS shaky cheese on them.  Every extended-family meal, this container was on the table.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years and MY five year old is sitting with his fifteen year old cousin...he doesn't want to eat cauliflower (although he loves broccoli, huh)...she reaches over, with cheese can in hand, and shakes the orange powder onto the previously snow white vegetables...<br /><br />and he loves it!<br /><br />From that day forward there's been at least one can, if not two or three cans, in our refrigerator. We use it on vegetables, on onion rings, eggs, macaroni/pasta, pizza, and anything else he can think of.  So, as you can see, losing the availability of this product was pretty traumatic for him!  I searched all over the area and finally found two cans, so I GRABBED them!  LOL!<br /><br />When those cans were gone (about three months later), I could find no more! I ended-up buying boxes of mac & cheese  - just for the cheese! You can imagine how THRILLED I was to find the cheese here on Amazon. On AMAZON!  Go figure!<br /><br />I don't care, I would've bought the cheese from the little boy down the street - that's how much my son LOVES this cheese - and if HE loves it, so do I!
