I reviewed this jerky for my website and really was amazed by the texture. I do eat meat (and jerky) and am not a mock meat fan by any means, but you could seriously slide this jerky by any meat-eater. It had a great texture - nice pull, good chew - but it wasn't the least bit tough as some jerky can be. It is also rich in protein (13g per ounce); a good option for vegetarians and vegans.<br /><br />I waivered on giving it 4 or 5 starts because it isn't a food I would eat regularly since the main ingredients are wheat gluten and soy flour - two foods we try to limit in our household. But since this is my personal ingredient preference and no reflection on the taste and texture of this product (I devoured it in about 2 minutes), I didn't mark it down.<br /><br />Also, the teriyaki flavor is quite savory and a touch salty, not sweet as many teriyaki jerky's tend to be. I think this was a nice change.
