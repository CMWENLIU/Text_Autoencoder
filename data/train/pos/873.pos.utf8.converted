I enjoy instant oatmeal for breakfast or for a snack; however, often brands (Quaker for instance) include too much sugar and other additives. I love Dr. McDougall's oatmeal because it's organic, it has much less sugar but it's still very flavorful, it has lots of real fruit pieces, and it has nutritious grains. A great filling food that I can trust to be healthy! Great fuel!
