OK...if you're looking for pure flavor, this is not the kale chip for you. There is no flavor "fluff." If, however, you are searching for a wholesome, raw food sans other foods used as flavor enhancers that may cause a digestive problem or exacerbate inflammation (i.e., the nightshades), then this is the chip for you. This is not for the faint at heart when it comes to flavor as there is a predominant vinegar taste. It has a strong, raw flavor that reminds you you're eating something pure and simple. I happen to love them and find my self craving them! Great job, Kaia!
