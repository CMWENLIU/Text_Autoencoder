There are many claimants to the title of Best Kona Coffee. Like Lancelot searching for a king worthy enough to serve I have tried many Kona brands and found most to be wanting. When Starbucks was worth their reputation good Kona was available from them by phone order only. That was 15 years ago. It's been pretty disappointing but the good news is that Blue Horse Kona Coffee is making up for lost time. With a little imagination you can actually taste the black soil of Hawaii and feel the Trade Winds in this coffee. There is no other way to describe the smooth, delicious flavor and aroma that seems simple but has the complexity of a good wine wih several flavors one experiences during the beginning, middle and the wonderful finish.
