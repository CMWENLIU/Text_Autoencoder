I am allergic to lactose, gluten and soy and there is none in this!<br />I use it in my (incresingly famous) chocolate sauces, cookies, cakes, smoothies, etc. and it is such a distinct and tasty coconut flavor that one almost swoons.  I have to credit it with the popularity of my recipes.  It is absolutely LOVELY & I HIGHLY recommend this! Also, it is a generously-sized bottle for a gourmet flavoring.  Try it in pancake batter!<br /><br />I am currently waiting until I need more, and then I will be back here at AMZ to purchase this.  This is THE best price I have seen too!  It is a bit oily so when I use it, I keep a paper towel handy to wipe off the opening so there is no "leakage" after closing it. (like one sometimes get after pouring oil from the bottle).  Storage - - I keep it in my cupboard.  For Real "punch," I add it to my coconut oil when I am using it in a recipe and let it sit until it's time to add it to the recipe I am preparing; not sure why, but doing this seems to increase the flavor even more.  TOTAL YUMMM!<br /><br />Like I said, try adding a tsp. of this to your pancake batter, along with 1/4-1/3 C. orange juice and 2 T. coconut oil!
