My dogs love this food! The ingredients are superior to other brands, and my dogs eat less because they are full faster! Their coats are beautiful and they have put on healthy weight as young adult dogs. 2 thumbs and 8 paws up! We have tried the salmon, lamb, and chicken dry dog foods, and they are all happily eaten :)
