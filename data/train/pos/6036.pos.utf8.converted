My first shipment didn't come because of a problem with UPS. However, when I called Amazon, they shipped it out again - NEXT DAY DELIVERY - even though it wasn't their fault that my first shipment didn't get here. Thank you, Amazon, for turning my problem into a good experience.<br />The product was just what I expected - what can you say - it's gluten!
