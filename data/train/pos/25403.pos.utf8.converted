OMG!!!  This has to be the best chocolate bar that I have ever come across in my taste tests of different kinds of chocolate.  The flavor is just so wonderful, its like an orgasim in your mouth lol  The flavors meld so well together, with nothing over powering each other.  Your taste buds will crave more and more.  Buy this product and you will not be let down one bit.  This chocolate melts in your mouth, it is so smooth and the chocolate is so delectable.  I am a big fan of sea salt, so to have that in delicious chocolate, its just perfect.<br /><br />EDIT: I have become a vegan, and it makes me sad that this contains milk.  I have tried other dark chocolates with sea salt that dont contain milk but they are nothing compared to this bar.  This has to have been the best that I have ever had.  I will miss this bar:(
