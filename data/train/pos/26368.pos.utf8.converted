Just tried these for the first time - and they're a very nice snacking cracker. There's nothing I can compare them to because they're just unique. Their texture is very different from a ritz type, or saltine type cracker. These nut-thins have a MAJOR crunch - a snappy crunch - hard crunch - but still not a problem to bite down and chew since they're very thin. If you break one in half, you'll hear a clear snap. The flavor comes through as pleasantly nutty. Not necessarily an over-abundance of almond flavor, because the almond seems subtle to me, but I think the toasty rice must be the nutty flavor I get. There's a hint of a buttery flavor - and just a pleasant bit of saltiness not too much.<br /><br />The ingredients list is fairly simple: Rice Flour, Almonds, Potato Starch, Salt, Expeller Pressed Safflower, Natural Almond Flavor, Butter Flavor (Contains Milk).<br /><br />Health aspects: As a lactose intolerant person, I can tell you the "contains milk" has been no issue for me personally in these nut-thins - I am not getting a lactose reaction. I suspect the "milk" is mostly butter, and butter is something I never have issues with anyway. I would guess this product has no more lactose than lactose free milk - as the grams of sugar are listed as zero on the package for a serving. (The gov lets them list zero if it is below .5 grams I believe). If you're more severely affected than I am by lactose - you may still want to proceed with caution.  As an ibs and acid reflux sufferer - I found this food totally neutral - no reactions - again this is my personal reaction. I'm not a doctor - so take that with a grain of salt. Also - the box notes this is a gluten free food - and the ingredients show no wheat.<br /><br />So far I've been munching them plain - and they're really nice. But I can see where any topping: cheese, cream cheese, ham, etc. would be super on them. I'll buy them again for sure.<br /><br />Enjoy!
