We bought the Celestial Seasonings K-Cup Tea Sampler for use in our <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. Here are my observations:<br /><br />There are two boxes, each containing -<br /><br />* English Breakfast Black Tea; A very rich tea that works well in both small and large cup brew sizes<br />* Lemon Zinger; A very pleasant caffeine free tea that is perfect for winding down after work, I like it brewed on large cup<br />* Green Tea; A good tasting traditional Green Tea that is somewhat strong when brewed on the small cup setting<br />* Sleepy Time Herbal; Another caffeine free tea that is smooth and relaxing and, as the name suggests, perfect for bedtime<br /><br />This is an enjoyable selection of teas that come out nice in the single serving K-Cups.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
