I've been a fan of these little things since I first discovered them on the local ice cream truck when I was a little kid.  Since then, cinnamon toothpicks have gone in and out of fashion, and it wasn't until a couple years ago that this specific brand came back on the market... and oh, was I happy to see it back!<br /><br />While many of the 40-50 year old set fondly remember soaking toothpicks in cinnamon oil (the "old fashioned way"), those in the 30-something set fondly remember buying pack after pack of these ready-to-enjoy treats.  They taste fantastic - cinnamon with just a hint of sweetness - and are great to suck or chew on when you're on the computer, stuck in rush-hour traffic, or simply between meals and without a snack.  Plus, well, they're toothpicks, so you can use them after meals and enjoy the nice, cinnamony flavor.<br /><br />Each packet contains somewhere around 10-12 picks, and they don't go bad when the pack is opened, unlike so many other candies.  Plus, they have no calorie content and no food content, so while you get the flavor, you aren't gaining the pounds.<br /><br />All in all, they're a great thing to have around, regardless of the time of year... but given when I'm writing this specific review, I'd also like to add that they make great stocking-stuffers, or a great gift for the cinnamon-lover in your life.
