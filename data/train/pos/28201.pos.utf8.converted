I see that someone using my name is advocating Annie's Shells and White Cheddar Cheese!<br /><br />This is way better. Let's QUICKLY go over the advantages; I know you have better things to do:<br /><br />1. This is macaroni, not "shells." When you want "macaroni and cheese," do you ask for "shells and cheese?" Not likely.<br /><br />2. The cheese is yellow, not white. Maybe if you like white chocolate over brown chocolate, you'll go for the other kind. In my book, this cheese should be yellow. Enough said.<br /><br />OK, so it's not completely organic. It's still natural and tastes good. AND--this is microwaveable!<br /><br />Res Ipsa Loquitur. ("The thing speaks for itself, already!")<br /><br />Made with Certified Organic Pasta (Organic Durum Semolina, Water), Cheddar Cheese (Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Dry Buttermilk, Butter (Cream, Salt), Salt, Corn Starch, Extractives of Annatto, Beta Carotene. Allergens are as follows: Wheat, Milk, Corn.<br /><br />I am a purist, and proud of it!
