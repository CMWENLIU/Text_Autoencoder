I bought these crackers from Whole Foods because I was doing a wheat-free cleanse.  I thought they were going to be boring and cardboardish compared to some other crackers that I knew and loved.  Much to my surprise they turned out to be absolutely yummy.  They're super crunchy and have loads of sesame seeds and other flavors.  I only had the original but I can't wait to try the rest of them.
