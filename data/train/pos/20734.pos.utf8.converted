One family I know has had a very stressful time of it, loosing a loved one last year, and having another loved one pass away at the same time another family member was getting married earlier this week.<br /><br />Having looked over flower arrangements at various florist websites online, I realized there'd still be flowers from the wedding, and frankly too many flowers after a death in the family can become overwhelming. For roughly the same price as a sympathy floral arrangement, this living sweet bay tree can be planted in a pot for the porch or deck and will provide a lasting memory of "Grammy".<br /><br />I ordered the plant yesterday, and received notice that it shipped this morning! How nice it will be for the family to plant it in honor of someone dearly loved. For those who aren't aware, Bay Laurel (sweet bay) is a symbol of strength and endurance.<br /><br />Update on April 27, 2012: The family planted this in a large pot on their deck, and it has now doubled in size from when it arrived. They live on the VA coast, and simply moved the pot closer to the house during cold weather nights. It's thrived outdoors in their mild climate and they're very, very happy with it.
