I first saw these pickle pops on an episode of Unwrapped months ago.  Curiousity finally got the better of me and I ordered these through Amazon.com.  They arrived today in the mail and after about 4 hours in the freezer, I finally tried one.  At first taste it was wierd!  I'm used to a sweet fruity pop, so the salty pickle flavor made me smile and pucker just for a moment.  After a while, the real pickle flavor (the juice is really squeezed from pickles) won me over and the coolness of the ice was quite refreshing.  I even enjoyed the little bits of pickle found in the ice.  Later I'm going to try the Pickle Pops /Jalapeno (two complementary pops were added to my order) and see what that's like.  I'll definitly be purchasing more of Bob's Pickle Pops as the warm summer approaches.
