I'm not a health nut by any means, yet I have often enjoyed a nice hot cup of green tea when I'm at my favorite sushi bar.  However, when I'd tried my hand at making green tea with packets, I could never come close to replicating the flavor and texture of the tea that I'd grown accustomed to at said sushi bar.  I'd even tried the $3 cup of green tea at Starbucks and it was a bitter experience for me.<br /><br />On a whim I decided to search out a better green tea experience and I found this gem here on Amazon.  The tin that the tea comes in was sealed securely.  Upon opening the tin, inside there was a sealed bag that I opened and poured into the tin carefully.  The arouma of the tea before brewing is pleasant to say the least - it has a fresh and mild scent that is not overbearing.  Brewing the tea was as simple as adding a small amount (about half a teaspoon) to a cup of warm to hot water.  I would not recommend boiling water as I did try that once and the tea clumped up at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />This green tea looks and tastes wonderful.  I don't like adding sugar or sweeteners to my tea so it was an all natural taste.  It's got a smooth flavor and is not at all bitter like many other brands I've tried.  It tastes just as good as the green tea from the sushi bar and I'm more than pleased with it.  As a side note, I notice that some reviews recommend using ceremonial tools to enhance the experience.  I may try those tools in the future, but for now I am happy with the results of my rudimentary method for brewing.<br /><br />One tip - remember that less is sometimes more.  This small tin can last awhile if you ration the amount of tea you use per serving.  Use too much and you may experience clumping at the bottom.  Happy drinking!
