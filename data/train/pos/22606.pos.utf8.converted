I started drinking white chocolate mochas at Starbucks, but at almost $5 a cup, it was too rich for me.  So, I decided to try this product after reading some reviews, and I'm glad that I did!  It tastes almost exactly the same to me as what I was buying at Starbucks when I put it into coffee, but I've found that my favorite mix is to simply add it to cold milk.  I think that it has a wonderful flavor that way, and I prefer it cold instead of hot.<br /><br />As some others have mentioned - if you are looking for a cocoa flavor, this isn't a good choice.  If you know that you like white chocolate and mocha, then I highly recommend giving this product a try.
