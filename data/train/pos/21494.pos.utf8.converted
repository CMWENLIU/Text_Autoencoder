Pasta Knorr Sauce Parma Rosa Creamy Tomato / B000I2OOPW<br /><br />Pardon me while I rave about how incredible this pasta mix is, but I'm just totally in love with this sauce. I love to eat pasta, but I am usually confined to the higher-fat alfredo sauces and cheese sauces because acidic tomato sauces irritate my acid reflux. That means no spaghetti and meatballs, which has been frustrating for me, but that's life, eh?<br /><br />Then, while I was browsing the sauce aisle for Knorr alfredo packets, I found this Parma Rosa sauce. I have no idea what 'vodka sauce' is that the other reviewers reference, but whatever this is, it is GOOD. If I had to describe it, I'd call it a creamy tomato alfredo, but even though it is creamy, it is also very light and pleasing to taste, not cloying. The tomato taste is exquisite, and the acid content is low enough to prevent stomach pains. The taste itself is absolutely wonderful - I can actually talk myself out of impulse eating by promising myself Parma Rosa later - it's that good!<br /><br />The Knorr sauces are fairly easy to make (the instructions are serious when they say to 'stir constantly', though, and I think it helps to preheat the milk before adding the powdered mix) and they store indefinitely in these dried packets (another reason to buy packets, besides the smaller carbon footprint in shipping versus jars!). Oh, and buying them on Amazon means I get them for half the price of the local market! For the Parma Rosa, I also add about a third of a pound of seasoned, browned ground beef as easy 'meatballs'. The portions are such that I can easily get two full meals out of one sauce packet, and the sauce stores perfectly in the fridge - this coming from a person who generally hates leftovers.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
