I make a fabulous sourdough buttermilk waffles that can not be made without Saco buttermilk powder. I've used Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend for several years. It gives a nice, extra richness when added to baked goods. I usually add the dry powder with the flour and add water as  the wet ingredient measurement as called for in the recipe. If you don't use buttermilk often, Saco's buttermilk powder is great to have around for the times the baking mood hits. It really makes sourdough bread special too. Try adding 3 to 4 tablespoons as part of the flour measurement in making bread or rolls - whether they are plain, sweet or savory. Really delicious!
