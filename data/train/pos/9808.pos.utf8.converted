I LOVE liquid smoke, so do most people after they've had my steak, chops or chicken; I've helped initiate more than a few fans. Last year my local store stopped carrying Wright's, but brought in 3 new brands to replace it. All three brands had soy in them and other various ingredients. Having only used Wright's in the past I was shocked to learn that not all liquid smokes are created equal. Wright's liquid smoke is allergen-free, which in my family is hugely important. I was delighted to find Wright's on Amazon, now I order by the case, save money and get the purest product on the market.
