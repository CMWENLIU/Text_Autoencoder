I love this product from Quaker and I'm certainly not a fan of grits. These, however, are really delicious just with salt, pepper and butter or margarine. The small ham bits taste authentic and add a quite different taste and consistency to normally bland grits. They're instant so it only takes a minute or two to prepare and they go well as a side dish with eggs and biscuits or toast, or just served alone. I like the small individual packets, especially, as I can even take them to work. Ordering them in bulk from Amazon is even better as I always know I have plenty on hand as these are the only grits I eat.
