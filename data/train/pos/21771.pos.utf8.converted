Plant was large, full and healthy.  Given as a sympathy gift, they stated that the plant was beautiful and undamaged.  When I ordered this I was told from the beginning that it would not be delivered for 5 to 7 days.  So if you are ordering for a funeral this is something to consider.  It arrived in 5 days.  I will order from this group again.
