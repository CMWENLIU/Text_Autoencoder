I bought this at a store down in Newport Beach a few weeks ago when I was visiting some family. This is some great stuff. The maple vanilla and chocolate peanut butter are my two favorite flavors. The chocolate and strawberry banana are good to, but these are my favorites. I usually like to eat it at night while I'm watching a movie. It's hard to feel guilty about eatting it since it's got less calories than a can of soda and it's fat free. The high protein content is an added plus too.
