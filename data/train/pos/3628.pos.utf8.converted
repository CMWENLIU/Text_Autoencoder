I love this product. I add it to protein/whey/yogurt shakes, and to give a more chocolatey kick to hot chocolate. I take only half of the cheap hot chocolate mix and add a spoonful of this chocolate. The resulting hot chocolate is much richer and not nearly so sweet. I also use it with Acai powder (Sambazon or Amazon Thunder) and add one or two drops of stevia. Acai/Chocolate blend is really the best for mental energy, not just physical energy; It helps me focus for studying, writing, or problem-solving. This powder is a bit coarse, so it works better in cold drinks if shaken or blended, and in hot drinks you need to stir a few more times than usual. This a good price in a two-pack.
