I also tried my first taste sample at Costco and it was the Pomegranate flavor so I bought a bottle and started using it daily...Months later Hoodia offered a new flavor at Costco and that was the Acai Berry.  I liked that even better and many months went by continuing to consume my daily dose of Hoodia Fiber every morning...A couple months ago I went to replenish my supply and to my dismay there was nothing but Nopal Cactus flavor on the shelves at my local Costco and even though the thought of cactus flavor did not sound appealing I purchased 1 bottle and the next morning when I gulped my little shot down it almost came right back up. The rest of the month I would plug my nose every time I had to swallow that swill and I would have some kind of food at the ready so I could immediately take a bite of it to wash away the nasty taste that was left in my mouth from the Cactus crap.  I have now stopped using the product and will not use it again until they offer the the Acai Berry or Pomegranate flavor. I really loved the product as it was first introduced to me.  Why did they have to ruin it?
