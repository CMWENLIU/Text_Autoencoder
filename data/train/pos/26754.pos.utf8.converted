We stopped buying the Kraft mac n' cheese once we got started on Annie's products. The cheese sauce tastes more like real cheese than the sweet, overprocessed Kraft sauce. Once you acquire a taste for Annie's, there's no going back! On the other hand, the kids' friends who come over for lunch often turn up their noses at our Annie's mac and cheese, because they are so accustomed to Kraft or the like. I like that Annie's are all-natural, too, but it's mainly the taste that keeps me coming back for more. A note about the shell kind: you get more for your money than the bunny or Arthur shapes. The kids love the cute shapes, so we buy both, but the shells are a better deal.
