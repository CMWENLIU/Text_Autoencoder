Expiration:<br />I'm always concerned about expiration dates when I order sale items in bulk from Amazon.  I ordered in August 2010, they arrived in two days via Prime shipping, and the expiration on them was 09/11.  That's 13 months away from expiration, if you're an endurance athlete that's plenty of time to go through several boxes (and if you're not, don't buy the marketing hype you won't need these gels anyway).<br /><br />Product Review:<br />These are a great product for a great price.  I got the 24 pack for $24.99 with free shipping, making them about $1.04 per pack.  They usually run between $1.50 to $2 a pack at sporting good stores.  Or you can stock up at marathon/tri expos for about $1 a pack.<br /><br />Everyone who uses these carbo gels has their own personal preference, I like the PowerGels best for their lighter texture.  The texture on these are between PowerGels (more watery) and Clifshots (much thicker).  But nothing new on race day...so I highly suggest you go to the store and buy 1 to see if you like the brand or the flavor before committing to a 24 pack.  If you do, then pull the trigger and stock up.  I highly recommend the price, product, and the expiration on them.<br /><br />Best of luck on your next race.
