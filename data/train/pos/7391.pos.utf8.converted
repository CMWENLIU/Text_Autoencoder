It really is a shame that the Tastykake Brand has only established itself in the Northeastern portion of the U.S.A., being that the rest of the world is missing out on the finest pre-packaged snack pastry on the face of this earth.  For those who are unfortunate enough not to know what a Tastykake is, it's like a Little Debbie or a Hostess, which is centered out of the Philadelphia area.  And should you happen to run into anybody from the Philadelphia area and ask them about this line of products, they will inevitably tell you that once you've experienced the snack God that is the Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpet, those Drake's Coffee Cakes and Hostess Twinkies will no longer have any appeal.<br /><br /> It's hard to put into words just how fantastic these spongey, moist, and vanilla butterscotch frosted guys are.  Seriously, the Butterscotch Krimpet can even beat out many fresh baked bakery products, despite being mass manufactured and factory sealed in boxes.  I seriously suggest grabbing a big jug of chocolate milk and ordering a box of these on Amazon right now, especially if you're not from the Mid-Atlantic region and are under the false assumption that Hostess is a quality product.  If so, you will be blown away by the krimpet's culinary goodness.<br /><br /> Tastykake's seemingly pompous slogan goes, "Nobody bakes a cake as tasty as a Tastykake."  Once you experience the Butterscotch Krimpet, you'll realize that they have more than substantial reason to gloat.
