We tried this food after our 1-year-old Bengal kitten began to develop symptoms of food allergies (gas, bloating, constipation, vomiting).<br />We've been feeding Core for about 4 months now, and she has been symptom-free since the end of the first week!<br /><br />In addition, our 7-year-old cat has also had remarkable and unexpected results.  She has dropped weight, her eyes are bright, kitty acne on her chin has cleared, and she acts like a playful kitten again!<br /><br />Other notes about this food:<br />-Core costs more than our previous food (Pet Promise), but they don't scarf it down like the old food.  They get excited and eat for a few minutes any time the bowl is filled, but then they just return to nibble from time to time.  So, a bag of Core lasts longer.  Perhaps this is because they are getting the protein they need without having to eat pounds of food!<br />-This food smells like fish meal, and tends to give them slightly stinky breath, but it is not overpowering.<br />-Small, round kibble is crunchy, but not as hard and dry as most commercial dry foods. Our picky eater had no problem with the transition.<br /><br />Overall, I would strongly recommend this food.  I'm in awe of the truly priceless health changes we have seen in our cats, and only wish we had made the switch years ago!
