Jerky preference couldn't be more personal.  I've sampled from the ten best list, and have been disappointed. One man's dream jerky is another's gag reflex.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good tasting and satisfying stuff.  I find it a little inconsistent from bag to bag, but so is life. The mixture of spices works for me, a slightly hot and you know you've eaten something. Enjoy.
