I love these little handy Gripz snack packs.  The Keebler Variety Box comes with three types:  Cheez It's, Nacho Cheese & Chips Deluxe.  Each pouch contains mini versions of your favorite snacks and I do mean mini.  Each pouch contains easily 5-6 large handfuls of snack.  Or if you are like me, 10-12 small handfuls of snack.  These are great for portion control - keeps you from eating a whole box of the scale versions. You can spread them out and make them last. They are handy for those on the go or for ones lunch.  I grab one when I head out for the day.  They are perfect for car trips b/c of the size.  Imagine a bag of sunflower seeds - these are a little shorter but about the same width.  This makes them easy to hold onto while snacking.  The cheez-it's look like super tiny oyster crackers.  They are not triangular like their larger predecessor. Oddly enough - the Nacho Cheez is in the shape of a Cheez It and has a spicy nacho cheese it flavor.  My favorite out of the three is the Chips Deluxe.  Those lil cookie bites are freakin awesome.  Imagine the size of a chocholate chip.  That's about how big each mini cookie is and they taste just like the scale version.  If you purchase these in a grocery chain like Kroger, you'll expect to pay about $6.50 a box.  Amazon has a pretty good price on these - especially if you opt in to the subscribe and save program.  At that price with the free shipping alone, it's worth it.  Whether you are a busy mom looking for easy lunch solutions for your kids.  A hungry dad who likes to snack between meals.  A road traveler who is looking for something handy to snack and drive with at the same time.  Or a Granny looking to satisfy a sweet tooth, I recommend giving these a try.  I think you just might like them. Whatever you do, don't lose your GRIPZ!
