I bought this kit for my cats after buying them cat grass at the farmers market.  They went crazy for it and the next time I went to market they were out of cat grass. Coming home emtied handed was not an option for my cats!! I bought the kit and it is a no brainer.  The grass comes up in a few days when put in sunlight.  It takes about a week to get it up to the size for the cats to enjoy and it last about a week.  It is worth it to see them devour the first blades when I put it out.  My cats are two full grown 20lb kittys!  They would live without out it but really like having it to munch on.  The combination of oat, rye, wheat and barley must make it tastier than just the oat grass that I get at the farmers market.
