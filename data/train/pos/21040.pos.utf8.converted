I knew this kit would have to be soldered / assembled.  As such, this is a great / fun project.  All the parts are well labeled and the manual is 34 pages with pictures and great instructions.  There are many projects with fewer instructions, poor component labeling, etc.  Many projects are completed in 5 minutes, making them very boring.  This project took an evening to assemble while we listened to music and I explained the workings to my kids.  This project came with 6 sections so that you could check your work along the way.<br /><br />As a note, for people who understand what electronic kit building is really about, check out the following: (transistor clock kit) [...] (ham radio kit) [...] and (oscilloscope kit) [...]<br /><br />I am not affiliated with Elenco, or any of these sites, I just love building kits.<br /><br />What we as hobbyists really need are more complex kits with SMD components for those "weekend builds".
