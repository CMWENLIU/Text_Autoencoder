I first tried Bob's Red Mill Kamut while visiting relatives and was immediately hooked!  Then the search began... I found lots of other Bob's Red Mill products, but the Kamut eluded me until I found it on Amazon.  A tasty hot cereal, this is terrific with any mix of nuts and/or dried fruits, toss in a little maple syrup and I am in HEAVEN!  Kamut is a delicious improvement on cream of wheat.  Good texture, a nice nutty flavor, you can't go wrong!
