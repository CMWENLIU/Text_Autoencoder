Stuff cures many things.  Unlike other reviewers, we find the taste DISGUSTING - tastes like you would expect grass clippings to taste, flying out of your lawn mower.  But that does not matter.  One daughter caught foliculitis.  Hemp oil cured it. (Applied externally, and taken internally.)  One son caught a nasty mrsa staph infection at the local school gym.  Doc put him on antibiotics, which ultimately failed to cure the problem.  After that, we tried hemp oil, and it worked -  quickly.  (Again - internal and external applications, several times a day.)  Experience seems to be that we all need more oil, not less, as long as it is good oil, like this.  Worth every penny.  Will try this brand of hemp oil for any health issue, before ever visiting a doctor again.  Buy extra, and keep a bottle in the freezer for a friend!
