These candies are crazy addictive.  I had to limit myself to one of each flavor a day because I was finding I couldn't stop after 1.  After a while, I stopped following the restriction I posed upon myself and had to have my boyfriend place it up on the top shelf where my 5'2" self couldn't reach it.  Unfortunately in a weak state of mind I climbed my kitchen counter and ate more candies to my hard-working heart's content.  Did I mention I have a very strong sweet tooth?  These are very very good.
