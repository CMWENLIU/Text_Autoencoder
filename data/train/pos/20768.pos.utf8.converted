Vanilla is one of those items where you tend to get what you pay for...scrimping most often results in the delivery of some dried up, outdated bean good for little more than a hint of the real thing.<br /><br />While this is not the least expensive vanilla available - it's competitively priced especially considering the quality and freshness. This comes with a pack of three glass "vials" that each contain two nice specimens of vanilla means. Fresh, wonderfully aromatic and delicious.<br /><br />Additionally, this is certified organic and non-irradiated. Frontier seems to have a strong commitment to providing quality spices/other at affordable prices. I've recently ordered several items and have been so pleased that I continue to replace my spices/other with this brand as needed.
