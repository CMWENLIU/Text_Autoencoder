The title pretty much says it all.<br /><br />I'm disabled, right, and occasionally I have a hard time moving around enough to get much more than cold cereal for a meal.  It's a little known fact that hot-meal deficiency can lead to an acute onset of Febris Casa or Furor Clausa (Cabin Fever and Closed-Up Crazies, respectively).<br /><br />ANYHOW...<br /><br />Just pop one of these little beauties in the microwave and in 90 seconds - maybe 100 - you have a hot, great tasting entr&eacute;e (North American usage).  If you add some microwavable veggies, you can produce an entire hot, well balanced meal in a single foray from your proverbial, "Bed of Pain."<br /><br />Now... MY 'Bed of Pain' is actually a bed, and the pain part is actually... well... you know... PAIN, but your Bed of Pain may be lack of time between work and your evening Cheese-Straightener Repair Class at the local Learning Annex, or Subito Furore Fames (Sudden Starvation Madness) brought on by chronic Amentia Artis Belli Orbis (Video Game Addiction - specifically: World of Warcraft).  Whatever it is that is driving you into an unhealthy deprivation of hot meals, this is your 90-second prophylaxis!<br /><br />I've been sampling these Hormel Completes, and all of them are worth having around!  My favorite, so far, is the 'Turkey and Hearty Vegetables' running neck-and-neck with the 'Salisbury Steak with Sliced Potatoes & Gravy'.  The ones with tomato sauce - the spaghetti and lasagna - are too sweet for my tastes, but I know lots of people who would do back-flips for them.<br /><br />I cannot encourage you enough to try these things!<br /><br />Umm... well... now that I think about it... I guess that I actually CAN, you know, as I've already probably encouraged you TOO MUCH to try them.  I'll stop typing now.<br /><br />SO:  The only big decisions left to me now is which of the three varieties of Hormel Completes I have in the pantry to have for lunch, and then whether to go back to bed or to fire up My Video Game of Choice.  ('Artis Belli Orbis' has got that... oh... I don't know... 'Je Ne Sais Quoi' about it, don't it?)<br /><br />Ok.  I lied before.  This time, though, I will actually FOR SURE stop typing!
