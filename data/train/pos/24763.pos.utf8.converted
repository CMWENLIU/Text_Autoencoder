Vegan. Natural. Kosher. I love Indian spinach (palak.) Alu palak (or aloo palak, meaning potato with spinach) is a very traditional Indian dish, also very often served with thali meals. Thalis meals are served on separate dinner plates to each guest with small bowls on each plate holding the various tasty choices. This Tasty Bite Aloo Palak is wonderful for adding another easy serve choice to your own 'thali' creation or as an additional item for an Indian or Asian-themed meal. Alu palak is great spooned over basmati rice or with Indian breads [or vegan whole wheat tortillas.] Can also be used as a base for a more elaborate mix of your favorite vegetables and/or beans. Tofu cubes are another delightful addition. I have also used it to make a delicious(!) spinach soup by adding Asian buckwheat noodles. Nicely spiced and not spicy by Indian standards. The spinach is a puree, partly a wonderful spinach gravy, accompanied by small diced potato cubes. A great choice for those who like or enjoy creating with spinach dishes. Made with spinach [palak], potatoes [aloo or alu], tomatoes, onions, water, sunflower oil, salt, cornstarch, ginger, garlic, sugar, chilies, turmeric, and spices. 200 calories and 6g protein per pouch.
