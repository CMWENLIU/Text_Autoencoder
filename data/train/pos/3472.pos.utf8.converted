I have had this machine for 6 months now and use it every business day.  It has worked perfectly since day one.<br /><br />I used to go to Starbucks almost daily and now I can't tell you the last time I went. It has already paid for itself! I make a mocha for a coworker daily who helps cover the costs of the beans, milk and chocolate as well.<br /><br />IMPORTANT!!!  This machine takes some tweaking of all settings to get what you want how you want it.  It also takes tweaking of finding the right beans for your taste, right chocolate if you like mochas and even a good frothing pitcher to get a good froth.  I probably spent a month before I had what I wanted exactly.  For those looking for a Starbucks like mocha I use Starbucks espresso beans and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate syrup along with 2% milk.  It's nearly the same.<br /><br />As for the machine, in my opinion very low maintenance.  Make sure you empty the grounds container fairly regularly so it doesn't back up into the inner workings of the machine and you should be fine.<br /><br />As for the negative review that seemed most helpful to others....this person is correct about the grind and water settings.  If you make the grind too fine the machine will take forever to push the water through and you will wait 5 minutes just for one shot.  The key is to adjust it slowly. Meaning just make one small adjustment at a time and then let it make several shots before deciding.  I took an old bag of beans I had and just experimented on the settings until I got the flow just right.<br /><br />To be fair, I make mocha's, I like them strong with half the normal chocolate so I can taste the coffee, BUT, it's still sweetened to the point that if you really just want cappuccino I can't tell you if it makes it perfectly.  For the money I think it does a great job.  It may seem expensive but if you research these units you will find this is one of the cheaper ones.<br /><br />As for reliability, the above mentioned reviewer seemed to have a few issues.  I have not had any in 6 months of daily use.<br /><br />As for any cons: the water tank is OK but when you make two mochas daily I have to fill it up about every 3 days.  Since this is in my office not near a kitchen this isn't horribly convenient but still...I'm not really complaining, just mentioning it.  If you are really serious about this and going to make a lot of coffee, find one that hooks up to a water supply.  Otherwise, this is just fine.<br /><br />EDITED..... 1 year later....everything above still stands....works like a charm...still making 2 a day....
