This product is amazing.  It grows edible gardens with minimum care and absolutely no soil.  I planted my salad greens garden on Dec. 4.  Within 2-3 days the seeds begin to sprout; in exactly 26 days I was eating salad grown on my kitchen counter.  The only "gardening" I have had to do was add nutrient tablets a couple of times, add water (twice a week since the plants have matured)and raise and lower the lamp as needed.  Setting this up was as simple as popping in two light bulbs, attaching a lamp shade, filling a bowl with water and dropping pre-planted seeds into holes. My kindergarten age kids are just as excited as I.  My 5 year old niece exclaimed on her last visit, "Wow! That plant is really getting big!"  I harvest about 2 salads every other day and pick lettuce for sandwiches daily.  All you need for sucess is to follow the directions that come with the garden.  I highly recommend this product. I have already given it as a gift, and I am considering buying another so that I have herbs and lettuce growing in my kitchen at the same time.  Who needs to worry about e-coli?
