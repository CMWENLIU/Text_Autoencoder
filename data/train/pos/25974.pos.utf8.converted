This product is fabulous. It contains ingredients that my blender would not get fine enough for me to be able to tolerate in my morning smoothie. I do drink this on its on on occasion but usually use it as a base with some ice cubes or frozen fruit because I drink a smoothie made out of frozen fruit every morning and enjoy the cold drink. It contains spirulina, chlorella and blue-green algae all of which would have to be purchased desperately plus if you look at all the fruit in one bottle you really are getting  a bargain...but not for this amazon price. I buy this same 1 gallon container at my local Costco warehouse store for $5.99.<br /><br />So to sum it up great product but buy it at Costco or have it special ordered by your grocery store, most of them will do it if you buy 2-6 at a time.
