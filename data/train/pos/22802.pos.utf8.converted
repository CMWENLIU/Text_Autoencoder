I do a lot of natural supplements and don't get sick too often, but this tea is on the TOP of my list for beating colds, sinus issues and chest congestion.  Both my daughter and I notice immediate difference with the first cup.  Just have to put something sweet into it to get it down! Vanilla stevia is the best cause then you won't have sugar feeding the problem. You can also brew with other teas to change the flavor a bit.  My daughter doesn't think it is as bad as I do so maybe you won't agree with me on the taste issue.  Buy 2 boxes- it goes fast if there are several people who are sick in the house. I had 4 cups a day when I discovered this tea in the middle of a bad chest cold last year that nothing else would help.  Thank god I got 2 boxes cause now my daughter is using it and woke up this morning better after a cup last night.
