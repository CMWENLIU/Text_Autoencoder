My female cat is so finicky, that in eight years and dozens of different brands and flavors, I have not found a single cat treat that she will eat.<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />I got a free bag as a promotion, and she went absolutely nuts! The male cat will eat anything, so he eats these too, but it's the only treat the female cat will eat. So now when I walk by the kitchen cabinet where it's stored, I have not one but TWO yowling cats, demanding treats!
