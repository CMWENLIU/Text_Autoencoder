Priced right & easy to use!  I keep the boxes in the refrigerator.<br />If you have a yogurt maker, making yogurt can't get much easier.  (You can make yogurt with out a yogurt maker too.  You can use a warm oven or warm pad, ect. & you need to maintain the correct temp.  You can reserch all of this on our wonderful informative interenet!) There are lots of different makers out there.  Check them out & get what suits you best!  The basic idea for making yogurt is to heat your milk until it just starts to climb the sides.  Then you let it cool to about 90 degrees or so.  You can put your finger in it & it's comfortable.  If you have skin on your milk, skim it off.  Add the yogurt starter to the milk & mix it in well.  Pour it in your yogurt maker jar/s & incubate it for 4 - 24 hours depending on your needs & desired tartness.  You can even add fruits, syrups before pouring in the milk/culture mix!  Just like "fruit on the bottom" in stores only way way better!  Anyway, instructions come with the yogurt starter so your covered!<br /><br />Make your own yogurt at home, it's cheaper & more satisfying!<br /><br />Good luck & have fun!
