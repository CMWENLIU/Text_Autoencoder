I'm on a diet and a couple of tablespoons of Cream of Wheat is pretty low in calories and filling.  I make mine in low sodium chicken broth or homemade when I have it.<br /><br />In comparison to regular Cream of Wheat, this whole grain product should have a lower glycemic index and be healthier for you.  I can't tell any difference in the taste as compared to the bleached version.  This is a new product that I will regularly stock in my pantry.<br /><br />My 24 hour chicken broth recipe is:<br />  1) 2 lbs chicken bones with some meat.  Roast in the oven first if you want a richer broth.<br />  2) 1 large onion<br />  3) 3 carrots<br />  4) 2 stalks celery<br />  5) 2 fresh bay leaves<br />  6) 1 tbs corriander seed, 1 tsp peppercorns, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, fresh dill<br />  7) sea salt to taste after cooking<br /><br />Bring to boil and reduce to low simmer for 24 hours.  Add water as necessary.  Strin through cheese cloth or a fine mesh strainer.
