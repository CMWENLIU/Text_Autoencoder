I have a beautiful 3 year old black and white Cocker Spaniel.  During the first several months with her, she demonstrated some puzzling symptoms...jerking and shivering, even in 100 degree summer weather...I took her to the vet. but he could find nothing wrong.....Instinct told me otherwise....So I tried giving her what we give our patients in the ER, when they have ingested something toxic...Activated charcoal....the shivers and jerking stopped.....I suspected immediately that something in the kibble type food I was giving her was toxic to her nervous system.....up to this point she would stare at the Kibble type food and eat only enough to survive.....I began a search for a substitute...thanks to a knowledgable pet store owner who showed me a bag of Sojos Europa...I now have a pet that no longer shivers or shakes, her coat is very healthy.....she has the energy of a puppy, and her breath no longer stinks....I mix Sojos with cooked chicken snapper and salmon, not all at once.  She loves it.  I'll try some other meats soon.....bottom line is this is really good stuff.....Read the list of ingredients,  this stuff smells so good,I have been tempted to taste it myself...but remember tasting lemon soap the Fuller Brush Man brought when I was a kid, but that's another story.
