I thought I would give this stuff a try after seeing it as the deal of the day.  My husband said that he didn't want any because he doesn't like Indian food but after I had cooked some up and was "mmmmm"ing like crazy he decided to try some.  5 min later he got up and went for 2nds.. then 3rds...Needless to say, we both LOVED this dish and it has earned a home on our weekly menu.  I would also like to add that to both of our surprise, it digested easily and no problems the next day.  ;-)
