Our son has been eating another brand of gluten free bread for the past two years and when we tried this - he is sold. Tastes like white bread and he has been eating it up!  I did use the oil when making it over the butter.  I've found that the oil for some reason the mix rises better and cooks well.  Using butter instead, I would never eat this again! I thought it was terrible when made with the butter.  Then we tried the oil - it's a totally different bread.  Wonderful.
