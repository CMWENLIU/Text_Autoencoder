The vet wants Baron to lose a little weight, but I also want him to enjoy his food. I've tried some that I had to add other ingredients to or he wouldn't eat. That defeated the purpose of getting quality food and giving him less of it. He's also showing signs of aging, for very good reason. He's old. I keep reminding myself of that so it won't hurt so bad when I wake up some morning and find him gone. I want to keep him healthy and happy as long as possible.  He seems to be doing very well on this food. A few minutes ago he was bouncing around like a puppy. He looked happy. That's all I can base my review on. Others have discussed the ingredients. I just judge the bounces.
