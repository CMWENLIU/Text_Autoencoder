These licorice wheels are perfect for the black licorice addict!  Eating three of them gives you 35% of your daily iron and even some calicium!  Haribo black licorice wheels are hard to find where I live, and I have been known to drive 35 miles one way to get some, but no more!  Thanks Amazon!  BTW, this bag is HUGE and heavy!  I'm stocked up for at least a week!
