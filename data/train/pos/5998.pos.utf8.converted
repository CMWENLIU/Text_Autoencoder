I found these cookies at my local Costco and hesitated before finally deciding to try them. They are delicious! I have only had the cranberry, but they also have pistachio and chocolate! I am a cookie fanatic who has recently decided to start eating better. These make the perfect guilt free snack. Only 100 calories! The name says it all - they are addictive! The cookie itself is thin and crunchy. The cranberry is just the right amount of chewy and tart, and the almond slivers complete this tasty treat. If you like biscotti, you will love these.
