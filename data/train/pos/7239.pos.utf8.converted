One of my dogs is very allergic to grains in dog food. He gets hives and itches terribly. Tried a raw food diet, but that's not very practical and I'm not convinced that it provides enough nutrients. We tried several different grain free brands and they're all fine, but the Wilderness is the brand that even my cats try to steal because they love it. So now we get them the cat formula and all our fur faced kids are eating Blue Buffalo Wilderness. No more hives, better skin, shiny coats.
