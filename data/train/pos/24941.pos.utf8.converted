I enjoy Bewely's enormously. I drink a variety of teas from the "fancy fruity" type to the "high mountain picked by monkeys in the mist" teas but I always come back to Bewley's for an excellent sit down and drink to enjoy tea. It's great with food, it's great by it's self. it's good without any additives, or fabulous with a bit of honey and soy milk. It's a steady, reliable daily drinkable tea!
