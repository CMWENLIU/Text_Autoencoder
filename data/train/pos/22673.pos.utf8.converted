My original Kcup holder with the needle accidently went for a spin in the garbage disposal and was rendered useless.  The my Kcup holder was useless with pods as it does not have the needle necesary to puncture the pod.  I ordered this replacement from Cuisinart (this is the same k cup holder for their model) and it works perfectly.  Whole lot cheaper than buying a new Keurig!
