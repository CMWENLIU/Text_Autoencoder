Our baby (11-months-old) is now on solid foods and we try to feed him a great variety of items. The doctor said he could eat the same foods we eat. Well, that's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat. In part, we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush. In addition, my wife found this Earth's Best Organic line of baby foods at a local store. They have quite a lineup of foods, but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.<br /><br />One thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures, so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake. My wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods. We're gradually trying more and more of the Earth's Best Organic lines of food, and we've been very satisfied so far.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
