Take the warm scent of Italian Bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into South Indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea. This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey, vanilla syrup and a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of sugar and you have a honey and vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. I don't think you can only use one teabag. I use four in 16 ounces and like it a little stronger. It is like a raspberry chai without the spice. Perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I'm trying the green tea with mint and also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
