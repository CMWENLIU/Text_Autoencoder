During my pregnancy, I read that raspberry leaf tea can help strengthen the uterus for labor. I started drinking this tea 3 times a day on my 39th week. Before I went into the hospital for a cervadil and induction, I used 2 tea bags and infused it for 30 minutes. I brought some tea bags with me to drink during my stay at the hospital. This is my 2nd pregnancy and this time was more positive and less tramatic for me. I only had to push my son out 3 times before he came out on his own. The contractions were strong enough to push him out without any help from me. I certainly believe this tea helped my labor to be shorter and easier for me. I felt better and stronger for the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy than the whole 9 months. I also like the smell and taste of this tea. I continued to drink this tea for my recovery from giving birth. This tea has become my favorite drink now. I definitely recommend drinking this tea during the last few weeks (starting 34 weeks) of pregnancy.
