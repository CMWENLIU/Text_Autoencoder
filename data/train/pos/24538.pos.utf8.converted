You wouldn't believe how many different brands I ordered in an attempt to find the recipe done properly.  We normally get a case of damson preserves every year from South Boston, VA, and they are so delicious; we share them with all of our friends.  This year, unfortunately, there was a shortage of damsons, so we couldn't acquire a single jar from South Boston.  I thought I couldn't possibly try another jar of inferior damson, and then a jar arrived from Tiptree, and I thought...okay, one more time...WOOHOO!!!  You have the pieces of damson fruit in there, exactly how we like!  This is what MAKES or breaks a recipe for damson preserves (not to mention the top quality ingredients of course).  So thank you.  I wish they weren't so expensive so we could order more.  I would dock you a star, but I can't bring myself to give you only 4 stars because the product is so outstanding.  Yum, yum, yum!  Thank you from California.
