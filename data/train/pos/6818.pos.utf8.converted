This is an amazingly healthy food for all cats, as previously reviewed. 90% of the protein is from rabbit, chicken, salmon, and herring meals. Since cats are carnivores, I think it makes sense to go for something that is grain-free and gluten-free.  I mix it with Evo for variety for my two cats. They are active indoor cats with gorgeous coats and of healthy weight.<br /><br />For a cat of a friend of mine, this rabbit-based food has been a livesaver. Her cat had such sensitive skin that even on premium pet store brands the poor animal had hardly any fur left on its belly from overgrooming itself. They tried everything! Since switching to Instinct Rabbit Meal Formula, the cat is happy, healthy, and recovered.
