As with the Atlantic Haddock Chowder, I found that potatoes reigned the day.  It really needs more clams!!  I bought cans of diced clams and added one to each can of soup.....it made it sooo much more delectable and more 'clammy' tasting!!  Then add fresh milk, a little butter, and lots of fresh black pepper and this soup is scrumptious.  I will be buying more in the future.  Of course, having to add another can of clams makes the costs of this clam chowder very expensive but as a special treat, they are well worth it.
