I've tried a lot of canned sardines and these are about the best I've ever had.  The flavor combination is wonderful, considering if you look around you can find these in stores for somewhere over $2.00 a can.  It's like someone prepared sardines as a meal in advance, and all you have to do is eat them.  Yum!
