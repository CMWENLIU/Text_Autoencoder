I have to admit I'm a bit of a seaweed snob.  I grew up eating seaweed so I'm not a stranger to it.  I've been on a health food kick lately and started to cook a lot of miso soups, legumes, etc.  Kombu is the quintessential ingredient for majority of the dishes I cook.  It lends that famous savoriness (umami) that only comes w/ Excellent quality harvested seaweed from Japan (see, I told you...snob) ;-p.<br /><br />When I first started back to cooking macrobiotic and raw food meals I purchased Kombu and Wakame from a lot of different vendors (coops, organic markets, asian groceries, online vendors, etc).  As I started cooking with all the different brands of seaweeds, I noticed there's a distinct difference in taste between the brands.  I have to say - Eden has one of the BEST seaweeds out there (texture, taste, no additives, clean).<br /><br />Everything I cook has that hearty savoriness with the Eden brand.  With other brands - the seaweed texture, color, and/or taste is subpar compared to Eden.  I don't know what it is but when I cook w/ the other seaweeds - seriously - it just tastes as if something is "missing".<br /><br />Since noticing the taste difference I wanted to know why Eden had one of the Best seaweeds...  I went to Eden's website and read all the stories and research that go behind their products.  I'm very impressed by their dedication in bringing Quality, Healthy, and Clean food to us!  I'm now a Huge fan of Eden!<br /><br />Since I grew up eating a lot of seaweeds - I know what good quality tasting seaweed is... and I have to say - Eden has one of the best out there!  You have to try it!
