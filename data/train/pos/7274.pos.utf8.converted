The Bar Harbor canned fish products are of the highest quality and offer a great value.  I've had this product, the Cabernet wine sauce and the cracked pepper varieties.<br /><br />Of the three, this is my favorite with the wine sauce a nice second.  The cracked pepper type is essentially this one with black pepper added, which really doesn't work for me (but is still far better than most canned fish).<br /><br />The fish is soft and moist and is not overpowered by any heavy handed oils or weird additives.  Very simple and pure ingredients give it a very clean taste with a wonderful texture.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
