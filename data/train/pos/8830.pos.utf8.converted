These are my new favorite Shirataki Yam Noodles. They have a great texture and hold up very well. They are just as filling as House Foods' Tofu Shirataki, but they have 0 calories! Finally You make a great tasty sauce and enjoy it!<br /><br />My advice when cooking Shirataki noodles? If you're a first-timer, cut the bag over a strainer holding it upright. Do not take any deep breaths and breathe through your mouth. The liquid keeping the noodles doesn't smell good. Although I didn't smell JFC's, it might have been because of experience. Rinse the noodles thoroughly in cold water. Squeeze lemon juice over the noodles (it's a palette cleanser, so it helps rinse away any of the suspension liquid's flavor), and continue rinsing. Microwave the noodles on a paper towel for 2 minutes, or take the blow dryer to them. Make sure they are really dry. I like to microwave them with lemon, lime or a wasabi vinaigrette, depending on what type of food I am preparing to help the noodles start soaking up flavors.<br /><br />The noodles will absorb the flavors of whatever you cook them in, so depending on how long you cook the noodles in the sauce, they may or may not taste up to your standards. This is why I try to pre-flavor them unless they are going into soup.
