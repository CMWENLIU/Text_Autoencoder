I first tried this honey in a small mom and pop diner in Montrose Colorado. I came away from that diner with 2 bottles. That was 1996. I've been buying this honey long distance ever since. It does not have the after taste of regular honey, tastes richer, thicker, etc. etc. Only honey I will buy. Except for the HIGH Altitude Honey this company also sells. It is absolutely the most flavorful honey in the world, although more expensive. But worth every penny.
