Treat yourself to an excellent summer tea. Caffeine free with a naturally sweet and nutty taste, the tea can be brewed hot or cold. If this is your first experience with Japanese mugicha (barley tea), the large tea packet is the most common way it is sold.<br /><br />Our sons, ages 8 and 7, like mugicha. We don't buy Kool-Aid or other powdered drink mixes that require added sugar. Our family of four consumes at least a pitcher of the tea every day in the summer, so one package lasts about one month.<br /><br />Last summer, we purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038KNYWU">Hasegawa Juhyo Mugicha</a> but it is currently unavailable at Amazon. It was good though, so I wrote a five-star review for that brand. The price was reasonable, less than $9.45 for 51 packs, or roughly 38 cents for a two-quart pitcher.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZOAQ">House Mugicha</a> is about the same price, a five-package order costs $15.94 through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. Each pack contains 16 tea bags (each making one quart of tea), which comes out to 40 cents for a two-quart pitcher.<br /><br />Rating: 5 stars.
