This is a great product. I first used some in September 2007 for a month as a cleanser. I decided I wanted to use it again at the recommended time (every 6 months), and am finishing up my "run". I think it helps me on a hormonal level; I'm at the stage in life when I don't always get a good night's sleep, and at times have feelings of extreme bloatedness, fatigue, etc. Flor-Essence makes that all go away. I plan to use it every 6 months for as long as I can.
