I currently have 9 month old breast feeding twins, so protein is a huge need for me, as it was during my pregnancy.<br /><br />It can be really hard to consume the full amount of protein that pregnant ladies should have. Orgain makes this important task so much easier and yummy! I would drink one right before bed and kept one on my bedside table (yes they actually taste great at room temp) and drink it the moment I woke up. I believe that this was a huge part of me not getting morning sickness. That's not even counting the few I always had stashed in the car for when I got stuck in traffic.<br />Now that I'm breast feeding, they are just as important to my daily nutrition. Specially great when you need something fast but you are stuck in bed or have hands full of baby. I could feed me, while I fed them.<br />It is really good to know that I can do all this without consuming fake sugars that can be dangerous to my babes or lots chemicals that most commercial shakes have. This shake has a great wide array of the good stuff and little or none of the bad.<br /><br /> Amazon Subscribe & Save  gives you pretty much the best price I have ever found.<br /><br />Great Uses:<br /><br />  * Put them in coffee at home, wow!<br />  * Make them the base of a larger blender smoothie<br />  * On your bedside for late night breastfeeding refueling<br />  * On your bedside for morning sickness prevention<br />  * In you diaper bag for mommy fuel<br />  * Glove box for getting thru traffic thats makes you late for meals<br />  * Frozen as a desert!
