The kids at my son's 7th Birthday loved these sweet-tart flavored, stackable, Lego-like candies.<br /><br />My Son had a Lego themed B-day party and as the kids stragled in I sat them at the table and gave them a bag(labeled with names) of these block candies.  They busied themselves with building and eating.  When everyone arrived I set a timer and had them build the talest stack of candy they could by the time the buzzer went off.  The party started off with the apparent Lego theme, an activity, a game, and leftovers for the goodie bag!  Would buy them again....I did not buy from this company.
