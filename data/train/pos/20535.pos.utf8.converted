This is good. I remember my parents taking the Dinty Moore beef stew with us when we went camping. It was good in the outdoors where we got extra hungry after hiking. This is the first time I've tried the turkey stew and it is "good stuff". I was surprised how good it is. I won't have any trouble eating the 6 cans once a month with the subscription plan. Often canned food like this is too salty but not this. The seasoning is perfect, the texture, the chunks of vegetables are so good. I don't think I'll ever make stew again.
