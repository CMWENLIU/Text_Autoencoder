I first saw this hot sauce in the Asian food section of a local store.  Dating back over a decade, I've been interested in various forms of spicy foods, and this looked interesting.  So, I gave it a try, and it now holds a special place in my heart and kitchen.  As other reviewers have said, this isn't the hottest sauce on the market, with a heat level around that of Tabasco sauce.  However, the heat is where the similarities end.  This sauce has a wonderful, but not overpowering, garlicky element and a thicker consistency than Tabasco.  I use this hot sauce in anything that needs to be brightened up or anything that I would normally use a hot sauce.  This goes great in gumbos, stews, soul food, and of course, Asian cuisine.  I simply cannot say enough good things about this product.
