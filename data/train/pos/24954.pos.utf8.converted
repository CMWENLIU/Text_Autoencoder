These noodles taste great, although the texture is a little different than regular spaghetti noodles.  Be warned, if you do eat the whole bag (a serving size is half the bag) they tend to sit like a rock in your stomach.  I've used these in soup as well as with spaghetti sauce.  The nutritional information is what really blows me away - no sugar, very little sodium, and for those of us on weight watchers, the entire bag is 0 points.  I just wish I could find them in a local grocery store.
