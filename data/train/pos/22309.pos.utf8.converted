I'm thrilled to see and feel what Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Cleanse and Nourish Shampoo, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9E2">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Smooth & Nourish Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a>, have done for my hair in a single application. I have been using salon shampoos and conditioners on my hair for ages now, and been really displeased with how my hair has been looking. It's grey, very thick and wiry, and was dry and brittle to the touch, and had totally lost its sheen. One wash with Clear Ultra Shea has changed all that. My hair hasn't felt this soft in years, and it's actually shining!<br /><br />Clear Ultra Shea shampoo is dense and creamy and feels incredibly luxurious as you lather it in. I was trying to find a comparison to what it feels like, but couldn't. It definitely doesn't feel like any shampoo I've ever used before. The aroma is very subtle and quite pleasant, and I like the packaging a lot. The cylinders are sturdy, with tops that press open easily, and the shampoo stands on its feet, and conditioner on its head, so there is no confusion as to what bottle you're reaching for, half blind with no glasses on and water running down your face. I'm going to keep using Clear Ultra Shea, and those salon products will have to go bye bye.
