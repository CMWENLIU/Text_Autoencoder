This one is a hard review to write because my cats love the food and I do think it is a top quality one, but I won't be buying it from Amazon again.  Don't get me wrong, I have done business with Amazon for over 2 decades and the very few problems that have come up, have always been solved to my satisfaction. To order this product though you have to do business with Pet Food Direct and that is what I will not do again.  I had a problem with this order and I talked to 3 different people at PFD, one of which was a supervisor, and none of them would help me.  They were terrible to deal with and all I got from them was to send it back at my own expense when I got it and they would refund my purchase price minus the shipping.  I then talked to customer service at Amazon, who never disappoints, and they made it right for me.  When you talk to them, they really want to help you and are so friendly!  NOT so at Pet Food Direct...at all!  I wish Amazon would start selling this with the super saver shipping, but until they do I will be buying more by taking a drive to Petsmart.  Sorry.
