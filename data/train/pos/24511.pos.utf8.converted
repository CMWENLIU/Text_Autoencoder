When I saw this on Oprah a few weeks ago, I was dying to try it. Gail and Oprah said it made their sandwich taste like a BLT without the bacon. Well, sign me up!!! I found its sister product, Bacon Salt, on sale at Today's Goodie (and Baconnaise was backordered everywhere), so I tried it first. LOVED it on eggs, salads, pizza... everything. That same site put Baconnaise on sale and I couldn't resist scooping up a jar. If you love the TASTE of bacon but hate the THOUGHT of it, this stuff is for you.
