I admit it did take a few times to get used to the taste and now I think it tastes really good.  I drink it every morning mixed into my soy milk.  I actually use less than the 1 scoop recommendation since the powder does not completely dissolve.  My only advice...check yourself in the mirror before heading out the door as you may end up with an amazing green mustache.
