I recently purchased a box of the Orchard Blend snacks from Amazon hoping that they would taste as good as they sounded.  I was happily surprised to find this better tasting than I expected.  There is great natural fruity flavor and crunch, and each bag is so full that I'm always amazed it's only 70 calories.  I love what it says under Ingredients: "Apples, Peaches, Apricots, and Nothing Else."  It's a fantastic all natural snack that really hits the spot.
