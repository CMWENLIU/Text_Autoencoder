Coffee-like drink without the caffeine - wonderful!<br /><br />For years I have tried to cut back on coffee by avoiding it (not a good idea) switching to tea (ok but still does not work for me), or substituting other things (usually too rich and fattening). But now, I have experienced Teeccino, and I love it.<br /><br />All coffee drinkers will know what I mean when I say there is a different feeling and mental/psychological experience between drinking a cup of rich, dark coffee and a cup of wonderful tea. Both are great, but if you really want coffee, the tea just does not have the same look or texture/feel in the mouth like coffee has.<br /><br />So Teeccino is a great substitute for coffee because it meets these qualities I look for. It is dark, sometimes black, in the cup. It is rich smelling, and has the body or texture in the mouth like a coffee product. Just like coffee and tea, you can drink it plain or add cream and sugar.<br /><br />This particular blend with the chocolate is wonderful. I, personally, do not add any sugar at all, but I do use a little creamer sometimes.<br /><br />I like a cup of Teecinno in the late afternoon and evening because it is herbal and has absolutely NO caffeine. I can have my coffee-like drink without the worry of being up all night long. We all know that even de-caffinated drinks still have caffeine and therefore can still cause problems for some people, but this never had caffeine so there are no problems.<br /><br />Finally, I tried other brands of a similar product, but I promise you, Teeccino is the best of all of them, and it has multiple flavors to match the specialty coffees on the market.
