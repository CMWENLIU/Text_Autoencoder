My family was skeptical at first when I began serving canned salmon, but this has become a must-have product at our house. It's simply the most tender and tasty salmon I've had from a can, and I often simply eat it  for lunch with nothing more than pickles and a bit of mango chutney on the side. Worth the money, although I do wish it were cheaper if purchased in bulk from Amazon.
