*****<br />I have tasted lots and lots of green teas, and this Gen Mai Cha is so different from any other one I've ever tried! It says on the package that it is nutty and savory and smooth---this is all true. I would add that it has a flavor that does indeed taste like toasted rice, and feels like a "comfort food" too---just so unique and yummy! It looks just like regular tea, and you can't discern anything that is rice-like about it, except in the taste. The package says that it is a "medium caffeine" tea.<br /><br />The only ingredients in this tea are organic Sencha Green tea and toasted rice, but the flavors are complex and interesting and exotic. I have only had a few cups but I can tell that I will order this tea again and again.<br /><br />This is worth a try for everyone really, for those like me who love green tea, or for those who don't like it and would like to try something different.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
