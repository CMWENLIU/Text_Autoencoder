I have been enjoying & purchasing Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Multibran Cereal for over a year. When I found Amazon selling it I ordered it at a savings.<br /><br />The 6 pack case Amazon sent me was stale, off color & bad tasting. When I tried to return it via Amazon's online return mechanisim I was told I could not return food products & no costomer service contact was available. As a result, Amazon has my money & I have an unusable product that is past dated & stale.<br /><br />I would recommend Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Multibran Cereal, but not from Amazon.
