I no longer will buy anything Kelloggs makes because they refuse to label their products when they contain GMOs. Not only that, they are spending lots of $$$$ to keep Americans (they label in the UK and Europe) in the dark about their ingredients. I support Yes on Prop 37. I want to know what I am feeding my family. Google - Kelloggs spends money to defeat Prop 37.
