I ordered this chocolate from Nutricity. Although I have no problems with the speed of the delivery, or the way the items were packaged, somewhere along the line, Nutricity did not store them well. DO NOT ORDER FROM NUTRICITY. The chocolate is dried out and discolored. It crumbles in your mouth and has a bitter, astringent taste. In comparison, I just picked up a bar at Wegmans. The color of the chocolate is darker and more consistent than the bars from Nutricity. The bar from Wegmans melts in your mouth and has complex undertones that I can't find words to describe yet. If I hadn't tried the comparison, I would have said that Green & Black's chocolate was pretty poor. However, the bar from Wegman's is a completely different chocolate. So, do not order from Nutricity, but do try Green & Blacks. I rate the chocolate from Wegmans a 5.
