I really enjoy the Hi-chews except in Mango.  I was happy to see this offered in grape so imagine my disappointment when I tasted a very, very strong chemical taste in these.  I would compare it to nail polish remover.  I contacted the seller with my concern but was ignored.  Don't buy the GRAPE!!<br /><br />I had to rate this with 1 star otherwise my review wouldn't go through, but I take it back.
