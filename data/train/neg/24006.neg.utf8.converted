This review is for people who are expecting Loma Linda franks to taste like Morningstar and Garden Burger-type frozen veggie dogs.  I bought these expecting them to be quite similiar.  They are not. They are, however, shelf-stable (I got them b/c I'll be overseas and need protein) and very nutritious at only 110 calories each.<br /><br />I just can't seem to get used to the taste and texture -- much softer and more pliable than the frozen variety, with less of a hotdog "skin". The taste is pretty different.  Less meaty.  Also, there are 8 per can, so storing the leftovers is a bit inconvenient.<br /><br />I can see how these might be great in a casserole or as part of another dish, but on their own (which is how I ate them), they weren't to my taste.<br /><br />I feel bad giving this product a poor review since it's my own fault for thinking that frozen veggie dogs and shelf stable ones in a can would be the same, but thought I should alert others like me who were unfamiliar with Loma Linda and expecting something comparable to Morningstar's product.
