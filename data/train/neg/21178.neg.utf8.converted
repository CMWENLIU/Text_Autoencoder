Greenies addiction is very real. The treats are nutritious and any cat will go bonkers over them. The downside is that your cat may very well stop eating his regular food. My cat litterally begs for Greenies and even wakes me up when I'm sleeping. When I don't give him any, he goes off and mopes until he decides to try again. This whole issue has caused a lot of tension in our relationship, and I've decided to just go cold turkey. I just cancelled a $60 order of the treats. I want back my cat that loves me ... not the one who goes through the motions until I break down and give him treats. He no longer displays real affection.<br /><br />Many, many people give their cats these treats, but do some searching online and you will see stories similar to mine. They don't call it "kitty crack" for nothing.<br /><br />Best of luck.
