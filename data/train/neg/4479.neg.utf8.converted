Got the Peppermint Mocha for Christmas and it was pretty good.  The mocha was not overwhelmed by the peppermint and I enjoyed all 32 oz of it. When it was about gone I checked the company's website for info and saw this one.  Peppermint Mocha is seasonal, but still I am looking for Mocha flavor.  White Chocolate Mocha...At the store where I got it they only had the 32oz.  Pulled it out of the cooler and checked the expiration date.  As soon as I got home I put it in the coffee and as I lifted the cup I got a waft of coconut, like I was on a hot sunny beach. The taste also gave me the impression I just took a sip of suntan lotion.  Not enough mocha like the Peppermint Mocha.  The ingredients have palm oil and I checked the Peppermint Mocha and it does too, but I never noticed it.  Not sure if I can finish the other 31.5 oz of this White Chocolate Mocha. One bad post mentions the taste another becauses of shipping, this IMO is another bad for the taste promoted as White Chocolate Mocha on the label. Should have checked the reviews here first...update...tried a little more.  Shook the bottle well. It's better than the first cup.  Still what I taste is a sweetened coconut with a little white chocolate, not the mocha punch that's in Peppermint Mocha.  I'll bump it up a star for the slightly less coconut, slightly more mocha(?) from the first impression.
