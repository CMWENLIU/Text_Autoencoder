The great quality and flavor of these beans is negated by the claim of "Biodynamic" growing methods.  "Biodynamics" is a theory that holistic agriculture using homeopathy, shamanism, and astrology will harmonize nature to produce superior products.  No plausibility, no evidence, just unjustifiable claims.  Sell me delicious coffee, but leave out the nonsense!
