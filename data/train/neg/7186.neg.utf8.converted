I don't know what the odd taste is. It smells lightly of vanilla, and I've never brewed Starbucks at home before, so maybe all their coffee tastes this way, but there is an acrid, almost chemical aftertaste to each mouthful of this. I smell a decent basic medium roast, but I taste burning and something very off. The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free. I've had better results from grocery-store brands that were pre-ground and on the shelf for who knows how long.
