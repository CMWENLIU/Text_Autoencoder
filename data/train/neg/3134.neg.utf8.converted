We bought a bag of Taste of the Wild after reading all the good reviews on Amazon. Our dog really seemed to like it, and do well with eating it. We bought a second bag. Again, our dog seemed to like it...but she developed a terrible case of diarrhea. We fed her chicken and rice for a while 'til things calmed down. We switched to Science Diet for sensitive stomachs, and then Eukanuba for retrievers. (Sadie is a flat coated retriever.) Her tummy troubles went away. After finishing those bags, we restarted Taste of the Wild...and the diarrhea returned. We looked at a lot of different variables...and it really seems to be this particular food that caused the problem.<br /><br />We won't be buying it again. In fact, we are throwing away what we have left.
