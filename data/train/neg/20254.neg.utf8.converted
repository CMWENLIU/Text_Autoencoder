There's simply not much maple flavor. Even after combining the separated oily, what results is just speckled & oily almond butter. I assume this 'subtle' (to put it kindly) mapley-ness is due to maple sugar rather than maple syrup being used. They really copped out cost-wise with regards to the additives, as there IS palm oil yet separation does occur; sure, this consequently means you don't need to refrigerate it, but this stuff shouldn't be so expensive. Next time I'll just mix real maple syrup into my homemade almond butter for cheaper & superior flavor; really regretting I bought 3, even at the reduced promo price.
