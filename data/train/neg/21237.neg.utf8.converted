May 15, 2012.  I purchased both Turkey and Chicken dry cat food and Weight Management Adult dry cat food about a month ago.  Both my cats began to vomit after eating the food for a couple weeks.  One of them got so ill she threw up bile for 4 days and would not eat.  She ended up in the kitty hospital for 3 days on IV fluids, antibiotics and steroids.  An object on the xray led the vet to think that she had cancer.  After 5 days of anguish thinking my cat was dying, they did an ultrasound which revealed either an ulcer or a reactive lymph node related to the gastrointestional tract.  The vet feels there was an intolerance or allergy to the food which has caused the GI/node issues.  My cat will remain on the medications for another 10 days. Then we will ultrasound again, and perhaps surgery will be required.  This has cost about $1200 so far and I would not recommend this food to anyone.
