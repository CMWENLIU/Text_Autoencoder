I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a "stew," "in sauce," "in gravy," or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter)."<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.
