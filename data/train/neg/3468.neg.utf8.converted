Chasing that wonderful Pumpkin Spice Latte' flavor I tried almost every conceivable concoction ... and I have learned a lot a long the way! First and foremost, the extra cost for the sauce vs the syrup is WELL worth it. The sauce offers a full bodied, truly genuine flavor that has no after taste or bitter residue - Whereas, this syrup is bitter regardless of the amount used. I can't imagine that muffins or coffee cakes would fair any better, however, I haven't tried cooking with this product so that is pure speculation. Bottom line, every time I put this syrup into a drink (cold or hot) it ruined it... completely!
