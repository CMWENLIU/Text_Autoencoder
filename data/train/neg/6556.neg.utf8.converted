I have become obsessed with trying every fig jam and preserves and chutneys I see available.  They are truly wonderful with goat and sheeps milk cheeses.  There are many brands which are simply wonderful - unfortunately this one is not!<br /><br />The flavor is NOT rich and figgy - it tastes diluted and flat.  The consistency has too much gelatin in it so it is NOT smooth and creamy as it should be.<br /><br />I keep my fig preserves in the refrigerator for AGES - and they never, ever go bad - I had one in there for over two years.  This brand however, actually went MOLDY after a couple of months!!  Good riddens to the most disgusting fig jam I've ever had!<br /><br />Now for some recommendations for delicious brands:  Bonne Maman Fig Preserves (France) is widely available and very nice - creamy with a nice fig taste.  The Adriatic Fig Spread (Croatia) is very widely available - it has a rather bright, fruity taste, a bit more tangy - but also nice. L'Epicurien (France) makes a bunch of fig products - some which I haven't tried yet - but the one I have tried is their Fig and Walnuts Confit.  It is pricey for the size (only 4.4 oz) but it DIVINE - really indescribable - very rich and intense - somewhat sweeter than regular fig preserves - worth trying at least once.<br /><br />And finally is the Vergers de Gascogne Fig Jam (France) imported in US exclusively by Williams Sonoma - and as far as I know - only available in their stores - not on their website.  This one is amazing wonderful - a classic - call them and find out how to order.<br /><br />I have another 6 brands in my pantry ready to taste - but too soon to recommend.  But don't waste your money on this one - that is for sure...
