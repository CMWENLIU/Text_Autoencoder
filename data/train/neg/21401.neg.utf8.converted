I ordered these ketchup bottles, some cereal, and some Pop-Tarts for my kids, even though there was already a 1 star review that said that the bottles were not sealed.  I thought that maybe it was a one-time issue.  A huge box arrived today with all 3 items in it, and the ketchup bottles had rattled around the box, smashing into everything else, and leaking all over the place.<br /><br />I tried to wash off the bottles, but then began to wonder which bottle it was that had leaked.  The answer?  There is no way to tell, as there were NO seals on ANY of the bottles.  They all arrived unsealed.<br /><br />If you don't mind about having bottles with no seal, and choose to order them anyway, my advice is to only order the ketchup, and wait a few days before ordering any other foodstuffs.  Otherwise, you, too, may find that the ketchup is all over, and that anything else you've bought has been hammered in its travels by the out of control ketchup.<br /><br />It also didn't help that, by packaging all these things together, the box was so heavy that my son had to help me into the house with it.
