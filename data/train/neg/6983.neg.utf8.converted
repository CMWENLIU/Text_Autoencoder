Just finished making a loaf of this bread.  The texture is OK, but the taste is really not good at all.  The flour mix seems to consist mostly of tapioca flour, and it gives the finished loaf a very odd, slightly sour flavor.  The aroma is like a big ball of steamed corn.  This bread basically tastes just like several other brands already on the market, and at $8 (in my supermarket) it isn't exactly a bargain.  Too bad, I was hoping for something better from King Arthur.
