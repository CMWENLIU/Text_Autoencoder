I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine.  I drink a lot of iced tea (who from the south doesn't?) and I sometimes use artificial sweetener, although I prefer sugar.  Believe it or not, some people don't understand that sugar doesn't have a lot of calories:  just 16 per teaspoon.  Still, many people can't use sugar or just prefer alternatives.  At first, I thought my tea with Nectresse tasted pretty good, nice and sweet....until I got the AFTERTASTE.  I thought the aftertaste was much more prominent than other sweeteners and, judging from other reviews, I'm not the only one.  In any event, that's a non-starter for me.  Can't mess with my tea!
