I was hoping I found a source for "real" grits.  I was tipped off that this wasn't the real deal when the label said something about "mush".  It fits the definition of mush i.e. soft or soggy mass.<br /><br />I have been searching for real grits since my supplier retired.  He refurbished an old grist mill as a hobby then decided to use the plentiful local corn to mill grits.  They were fabulous, the real kind that you had to add water, let the hulls float to the top, pour off the water, add more water, then cook for 45 minutes.  Lots of butter, salt, and pepper and there's nothing better.
