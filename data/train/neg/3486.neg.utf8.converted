I heard wonderful things about these noodles, wish I had read all the reviews and not just the ones on the first page. They were awful! My daughter wouldn't even try them but got a good laugh at me trying to eat some. I had ordered 2 (6 pack) packages to get the free shipping and so sorry I wasted my money. I tried, I really, really tried. I so wanted them to work out but they just make me gag. I've tried them with 3 different types of sauces, with soup and a stir fry. Still Yuck. Bummer, and I know now I can't return them. When I first opened the box I could smell the fishy smell. And now my pantry has that fishy smell too. Don't waste your money!!!!!!
