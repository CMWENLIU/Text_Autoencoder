I enjoy a variety of Green Mountain coffees, so when I saw this on display at a local department store I picked it up. I absolutely love hot chocolate. I couldn't wait to take this one home and try it out. After the first couple of cups I was disappointed in both the flavor and body. After going through a couple of adjustments like less water, it still left me wanting more. Maybe I was expecting too much. Not only does it lose points for lack of flavor, I just don't like my chocolate this watered down.
