I agree with some reviewers that this is bland and tasteless, but I'd go as far as to say it tastes weird. I'm a huge fan of miso, and this didn't have any miso taste to it. My cup also had 2 tiny pieces of seaweed, 1 TINY mushy piece of what I'm guessing was supposed to be tofu, and no mushrooms.<br /><br />I also read the nutrition facts and it had a LOT of sodium, which is shocking since it tasted so bland. Moreover, it said 1 of these 1.9 ounce cups is 2 servings. That's preposterous. How could 1 oz. of anything (even with the addition of bland broth) count as a serving? I think they only made it into 2 servings because otherwise, 1 of these cups would probably be 50+% of your daily sodium allowance? I threw my cup away, so I can't check it, but believe me, it had a shocking amount of sodium for gross, bland noodles.
