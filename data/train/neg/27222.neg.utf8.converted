Amazon list this cereal as being certified organic. It is not organic! The company website only shows 4 of their many cereal products to be organic.  The use of the word "natural" means nothing as the ingredients in any "natural" product may be laced with pesticides,fungicides or hormones and made with genetically modified plants,fruits or vegetables. "Barbaras" the corporation is no more concerned about making the world a better place or protecting the environment than any of the other food conglomerates.It always comes down to profits. Make people think "Barbaras" is synonymous with organic products and then start selling "natural" products at inflated prices. Makes for a great profit margin by taking advantage of well intentioned, but ill informed, consumers.
