We have a 7 week old and his stool was extremely hard and dry after using this formula. I very much wanted it to work, but be careful with it...our child was wincing in pain with each bowel movement. That can eventually lead to fissures and blood in the stool. Maybe if he were older he could handle this formula...real bummer:(
