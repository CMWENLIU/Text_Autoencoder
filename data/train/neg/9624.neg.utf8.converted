very bad customer service.<br />my mother who is 86 years old bought one for her grandson who happens to be in the Army. She entered the wrong address on the order. She called aerogarden immeidately and Aerogarden customer service told her to order a second one and to fix the address problem on the second order.  Aerogarden could have EASILY rerouted the order to the correct address--she called within 10 minutes of placing the order.  They forced her to order a second one and then they made her pay for the freight to return it to them.  poor customer service all around. very unhelpful.
