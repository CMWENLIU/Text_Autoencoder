The fact that it is organic is why I purchased it. The taste is somewhat bland, but the real kicker is that it is LOADED with commercial salt....not sea salt mind you.<br /><br />One serving (there are 4 per package) has 230mg! I don't eat that much commercial, overly processed, white table salt in a month! In fact, I get my Himalayan pink crystal salt from Amazon....and this stuff not only tastes great, it is a wonderful food for the body.<br /><br />Serves me right for not checking closer into the ingredients.
