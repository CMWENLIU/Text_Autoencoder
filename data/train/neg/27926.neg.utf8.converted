I'm not sure what happened to my other review, but it didn't go through.  This 8 O'clock coffee is sour and bitter, no matter much much or little coffee I add, and no matter how much water I put.  It was like this the first day I got it.  I try coffee I buy from Lucky's or Costco and it's nothing like this.  This is the worst coffee I ever taste.  It's so bad that if I had to do it all over again, I would ask for a refund.  I keep the beans in an airtight mason jar.  Like I said, day one and it was sour and bitter so I gotta write this review.  Google around and you'll see people say the same.  I am not sure if I have a bad batch or what.<br /><br />I've also read that pretty much all coffee roasted coffee bean you buy has gone stale in about 2 or so weeks after roasting.  I've recently ordered green coffee beans and will be roasting it myself.  I've tried a few bags of pre-roasted beans, they're nothing special, but this one is just awful.  I've now decided to cold press this 8 O'clock coffee to see if i can improve the taste and finish it.
