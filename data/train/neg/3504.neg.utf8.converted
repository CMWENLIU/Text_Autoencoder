They aren't very good. They're Pop-Tarts and as such bear a vague resemblance to the flavor they're supposed to be. I don't consider $15 for a disappointing novelty a tragedy by any means. But some would.<br /><br />And while I am not the kind to rate how something is shipped, there's no way these dry pastries will arrive without damage. My box was in good condition, but my tarts had been experiencing some rapidly changing g-forces. Need more packing to act as an inertial damper to maintain structural integrity. :D
