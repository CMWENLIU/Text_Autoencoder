Amazon offering Community Coffee delighted us; it's been a favorite for years but this coffee is either stale or something's seriously changed in their roasting. No matter how strong we made the brew in our French Press, and in a perculoator, the beans just did not evidence the delights of the past.<br /><br />We had to cancel our Subscribe and Save and tell friends who joined Prime to get this! Sad, but if you don't notice the grand scent of the beans, return it!<br /><br />PS I did not do that, and called Community Coffee instead! My batch was "Best Brew Date" of 1/18/12, and they KNEW what was wrong, and told me to contact Amazon, which I should have done in the first place. Thank goodness, our fav coffee mystery has been solved! If you have that date on your coffee bags, contact Amazon!
