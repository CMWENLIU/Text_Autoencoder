I bought this variety pack to have at my in-laws house when we came to visit them for the holidays.  It was expensive for the amount of food you get.  The variety was not all that good either...I didn't want to have to make a trip to the grocery store when we got there so I shipped everything through amazon ahead of time.  Seeing what I paid for and the lack of variety, I should have just made the trip to the store.  I thought it was 18 double packs...it isn't, it is 18 total packs of food.
