Nestle Ovaltine Chocolate Malt, is not even close to a Chocolate Malt! Nestle shouldn't be able to advertise this as a malted drink, because, this product has absolutely no malt flavor at all, at least none I could taste.<br /><br />It does have a fairly decent Chocolate taste, (1-star) and is creamy, , (1-star), but that's where it all stops! I doubled the suggested serving amount, and no malt taste. I then tripled it, and still no distinguishable malt taste. The ingredients do list "malt" as one, so where's the Malt?? Then to top  it all off, it's rather pricey for pretty much just cheap coco powder.
