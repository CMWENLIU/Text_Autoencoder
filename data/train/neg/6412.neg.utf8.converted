My wife bought two cans of this "no sugar added" pie filling thinking it would contain, you know, cherries without added sweetener.  I baked the filling into a pie without noticing the teeny "Splenda" symbol down along the bottom edge of the label (see product photo).  To our disappointment we discovered the artificial sweetener on our first bite of pie.  To our tastes, the pie was inedible and we threw it out. Personally, I'd have preferred an actual "no sugar added" filling but even sugar would be better for you than an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Since Comstock obviously needs to do a better job of labeling it's products, I went to leave them feedback on their website.  Unfortunately, they wanted every bit of my personal contact information (Email, phone and address) in order to do them a favor and provide feedback on their product. Hopefully they get this message.
