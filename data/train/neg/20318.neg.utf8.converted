I bought this product after reading about the benefits of it from "First Magazine for Women." I picked it up at Whole Foods for $5.99 and a total waste of money. The magazine touted it as good for weight loss, because the protein would fill you up and it had a lot of  B vitamins. The article said it was good spread on toast. Well the taste is very salty and extremely bitter. You could never spread enough on toast to be filling, because of the awful after taste of bitterness. Also, it is so expensive, you would have to buy a couple of jars a week if you did use it on a daily basis. The taste is like eating a combo of a bunch of anchovies and beef jerky. If you have to watch your sodium, you do not want this. I will not be buying it again.
