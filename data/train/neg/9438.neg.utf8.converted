I have purchased Pamela's products thinking that it would be great to be able to make homemade gluten free bread that tasted fresh, but I was very disappointed with this product.  It is the worst gluten-free bread product that I have ever tried.  It not only did not rise (the first time I thought it was just a bad batch, but it happened twice), and the bread doesn't cook completely, even when you extend the time.  It comes out doughie and uncooked in the center.  And don't think that I am a novice bread maker, I have been baking bread for years.  I would never buy this product or recommend it.  If you want great homemade gluten-free bread, buy gluten-free pantry bread mix.  It tastes like regular bread and works like a charm.
