Our pup LOVED this bone. It's huge and meaty, and we took some pretty hilarious pictures of her trying to carry it around. But after a few days of chewing on it, the bone started breaking off in little, sharp, swallow-able pieces. I felt so cruel taking it away from her, but I felt that there was a pretty big risk of her either choking on one of the broken pieces or having it lodge in her intestine. I have bought lots of bones, tendons, and antlers in our girl's short life, but I have never seen one break off like that and for me it wasn't worth the risk.
