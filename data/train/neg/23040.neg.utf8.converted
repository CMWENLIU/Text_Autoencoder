I didn't read the fine print...my mistake.  They should have called these Rice/Corn Chips.  Corn flour is the third ingredient so they taste more like a corn chip than a rice chip. They also have over four times more fat than a rice cracker<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETC9II">Sesmark Rice Thins, Brown Rice, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>. Now for the good news. Like many things that are not that good for you, they are really,really...good. Excellent taste and crunch.  So if you're not a health nut like me, go for it.  They're great!
