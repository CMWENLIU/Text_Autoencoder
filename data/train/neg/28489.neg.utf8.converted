I gave this a one-star for balance. Had the other reviews been balanced, I would have given it 2 stars.<br /><br />If you are used to eating meat, this stuff is a very big disappointment. When we mix it 1-4 with beef, people won't eat the mixture!<br /><br />My dog eats almost anything, but she won't eat this.<br /><br />Neither my wife or I will eat this, even when mixed with hamburger helpers or whatever.<br /><br />So, beware, because all these five-star ratings are from people who do not eat meat, and probably have forgotten what it tastes like.
