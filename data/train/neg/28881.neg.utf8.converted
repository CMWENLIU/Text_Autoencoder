I love rooibos and I love lavender, but somehow the combination in this tea has created the most vile tea I have ever tasted. I've never had a tea that I thought was so gross that I actually had trouble drinking it except for one that had stevia in it. I don't like the taste stevia sweetened things have and it seems like this tea has that same taste. I was so sure I'd love this tea, I'm glad I didn't buy it here first (I almost did), I only have to figure out what to do with one canister instead of six.
