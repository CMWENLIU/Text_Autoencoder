I was so excited to try this. I love Starbucks. I got to work put 2 pods into my coffee maker, I thought that might be a little strong but I like it that way. It finished and I did not even have to take more than a sip, looked and tasted like colored water. I poured it back in and ran it through again, no better. I am so disappointed. I even added another pod, no better. I would never have expected this from a Starbucks product. I'd like to say I will give it another chance but it is too expensive to take a chance on.
