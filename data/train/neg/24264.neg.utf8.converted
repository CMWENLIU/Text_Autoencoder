The original cracker was one of a kind. It was distinct and different from everything else out there. The only thing close is NY Flatbreads. The new cracker is terrible in comparison. Not much else to say. They also need to change the picture associated with the product. It is fraudulent to show a picture of the old product and then ship the new one out to customers.
