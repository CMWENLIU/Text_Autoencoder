I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid  bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase.<br /><br />Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic, and the seeds don't so so well. They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender.<br /><br />I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good.
