I picked up a box of this because I'd started drinking herbal teas at night and wanted to expand my horizons.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but all the bags had a strange smell that found its way into the brewed tea and just made this the most unappetizing tea I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tazo's a good brand.  I'm drinking a big mug of iced tea made with their Passion blend right now.  But their Calm blend just rubbed my nose the wrong way.
