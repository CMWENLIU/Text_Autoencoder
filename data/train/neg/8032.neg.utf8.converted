my first order was great.  fresh almonds, just the right amount of candy coating.  so i decided to order again and here starts the dissapointments:<br /><br />1.  most of the candy coated almonds were actually candy coated PEANUTS. yep, i know my almonds and peanuts and certainly do not appreciate someone trying to pull a fast one on me or the taste of peanut butter with my candy.<br /><br />2.  the candy coating was somewhat stale.  not exactly crunchy.  almost as it been exposed to quite a bit of humidity.<br /><br />3. many were fused together.  don't even know what to say about that.<br /><br />4.  lots of smallish candy, likely due to the fact that they are actually peanuts.<br /><br />5.  not exactly 1 pound either...<br /><br />done with this vendor.
