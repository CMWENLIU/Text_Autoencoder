I have a 15 year old neutered male domestic short hair and a 15 year old spayed female domestic short hair, who are both overall very healthy and happy. I was excited to put my cats on this food after doing extensive research because it was high in protein, grain-free and had several great reviews. I had them on Innova Senior, but it was a little dry and they didn't really "love" the food. However, since starting to feed Wellness CORE a few days ago, my kitties have both had diarrhea every time they use the litterbox. I've owned both cats their entire lives, and they've never had diarrhea before and it's the only thing that's changed in their diet (they also get Wellness wet food at night). Although I already have them on a relatively high protein, low carb diet, I think the even higher level of protein and fat in this food might be too much for their digestive tracts to handle. I have stopped feeding this food and expect the condition to clear up soon.
