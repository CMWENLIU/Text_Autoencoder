I ordered this item, and was instead shipped a different item (ginger beer).  There is a difference, and the company that makes this makes both.  However, Amazon's warehouses are too stupid to recognize the difference.  When I politely pointed out to them that they had shipped me the wrong item, they very politely apologized, and promised to send me the right item...whereupon they sent me exactly the same wrong item again.  When I complained again, and asked them to either find the right item, or refund my money, they ignored me.  If you really want ginger ale, you can buy this mix on the Internet from other suppliers.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
