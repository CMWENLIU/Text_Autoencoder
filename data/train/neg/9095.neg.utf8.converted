My mother had a major surgery and since my sisters and I live out of state we wanted to give her something extra special to help cheer her up.  I ordered this basket, being the largest one, paid a hefty price and even paid the extra money to have it overnighted.  She received it the next afternoon at 2:30, which is rather late for the extra $30 I was charged.  Though the basket was pretty the yummies were described by my sister staying with her as, dry and tasteless.  That made me really sad because I really wanted something extra special
