I ordered these casings, and when they arrived it was NOT the product pictured on this page. I emailed the seller with a question about the shipping and they never returned the email, but the casings arrived a few days later. However, they are LEM casings. I am not sure if they have always been this way and they just re-packaged them, but I could have bought the LEM casings locally for less money. I believed that I was buying a better product, based on the reviews here, but now only time will tell if what they sent me will work as well.
