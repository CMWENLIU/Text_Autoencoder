I was such a fan of the old formula and would stock up and buy boxes at a time.  I have a heavy work and travel schedule and this was the perfect bar for eating "healthy on the go."  Now the calorie and fat content is much higher and the taste has changed for the worse!  I wish the company would go back to the original formula....I am on the hunt for another bar!  Such a shame...it was the best bar on the market!
