I'm a bit surprised how foul this soup smells and tastes. I doubt that many, unless their ethnic roots are Korean or similar, will find this soup pleasing. The taste is a bit odd, to say the very least. The actual taste is hard to describe but "seafood" is certainly not the word I'd use to describe this product. Seafood implies to me - either fish or shellfish. The closest I can come to an adequate description of this soup is it has the smell of drying seaweed and/or the aroma of fish food.<br /><br />As someone said in the comments section of this review: "I just couldn't get past the smell."<br /><br />Beyond the unusual seaweed flavor (which I obviously didn't like) --- there are only three other dominant tastes - a VERY heavy dose of salt, the bitterness of MSG and a lot of cayenne pepper. The noodles are essentially tasteless yet ladened with 500 calories of saturated fats. The MSG just adds to the unpleasant flavor notes. To be clear - this is a highly processed "food". In fact, very few of the soup's many ingredients are even recognizable as any type of food.<br /><br />HEALTH WATCH: While I'm not a health nut - this soup crosses even my very low bar for products that are better off avoided. One packet of this soup provides almost 90% of an individual's daily allowance of salt and 40% of the allowed Saturated Fats (thanks to the palm oil used to fry the noodles). While many of us think of soup as a reasonably healthy product - that is simply not the case with this soup. Each packet of this soup has about 500 calories.<br /><br />HEADS UP - some of the reviews on Amazon strike me as a bit suspect: There are a number of 5 star reviews generated by One Time ONLY Amazon reviewers. Once these "reviewers" have promoted this company's product - they never publish another review. I've seen this same pattern, time after time, for all the other soups made by this particular company.<br /><br />Even if you have no concern about salt, calories or saturated fats - the smell and taste I doubt will appeal to many.
