It tastes neither like a chocolate nor coffee. I'm not sure about the health benefit but it's a torture to chew this thing. I enjoy many other healthy food but this one's a totally no no.<br />It's as if they just mixed cacao and coffee bean then put tons of sugar to cover the bitterness of the two. Too sweet, but not tasty sweet.<br />I won't buy this even if it's free.
