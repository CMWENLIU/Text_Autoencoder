I THOUGHT THAT KLEIN'S VEGGIE CHIPS WOULD BE A HEALTHY SNACK FOR SOMEONE THAT NEEDED TO WATCH THEIR DIET.  EVERYTHING IN THE LISTING SEEMED TO INDICATE "HEALTHY."  "NATURAL", "DRIED",  "VEGGIE"  "THEY HAD NUTRITION FACTS LISTED FAR, FAR DOWN ON THE PAGES.  UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS.  I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT SUCH A HIGH FAT ITEM.  I WILL SURELY CHECK THE NUTRITION FACTS BEFORE MY NEXT PURCHASE OF ANY FOOD NOW THAT I KNOW IT'S THERE.<br /><br />IT WAS "FRIED" NOT "DRIED"
