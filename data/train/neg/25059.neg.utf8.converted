In my search for a decent sugar-free syrup, I bought six of Amoretti's sugar free syrups including this one, to try on my coffee.  I'd say this Dark Choco and Amaretto are probably the best of the Amorettis I've tried, but they are still, gross.  It says "All Natural Flavors," but when I tried it, there was this unpleasant aftertaste and smell that began after about 5 seconds and lingered for minutes, just like the other Amorettis.  It's hard to describe the aftertaste, but it is similar to "cough syrup."<br /><br />I searched the bottle to see what they used, but there was nothing on the bottle.  I searched the web, and there is nothing.  Apparently, this peculiar aftertaste is a trade secret. I wonder what kind of "natural" preservative was used.<br /><br />The syrup is also very "watery" in consistency, and not "syrupy."<br /><br />To be fair, my wife says it is decent, but for me, these are totally gross.  There is just nothing like a real sugared syrup.  Anything else is still a dream.
