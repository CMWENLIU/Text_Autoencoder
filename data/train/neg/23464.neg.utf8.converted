I wasn't sure what to expect with these - they aren't granola bars, they aren't candy bars...  Of course, they're "NUT BARS."  Triple Nut, to be exact.  (The package also says "5 Chewy Granola Bars.")  "Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, and Cashews."<br /><br />Well...they sorta taste like a dirty Payday candy bar, except the "peanut" flavor tasted like the bad peanut that you end up getting in every bag - a bit bitter or over roasted but pretty gross either way.  I couldn't taste any almonds or cashews (perhaps because they're the the 13th and 14th ingredients.)  They "honey roasting" is sort of a misnomer, as the sweetness is undoubtedly coming from the Corn Syrup (ingredient #2), Sugar (#4, #10), and Evaporated Cane Juice Inverted Syrup (#11.)  In fact, honey is listed as the 4th ingredient under the "contains less than 1.5% of" list.<br /><br />At any rate, a Payday candy bar tastes better, and just by claiming these are "NUT BARS" doesn't really make them healthy...comparing the nutrition facts between these and a Payday reveal these have a less sugar, more salt, and the same protein.<br /><br />Given they're being marketed as granola bars and healthier than candy bars...these are on the very bottom of my list for flavor and texture of a granola bar.  If you're looking for a good, healthy, chewy granola bar...you'd be much better off with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIE">Cascadian Farms Organic Chewy Granola Bar, Chocolate Chip, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  If you're looking for a snack with nuts - just buy the nuts.<br /><br />I'm not sure why all the other reviews seem to be raving about these things...I generally eat only natural and/or organic foods, so perhaps my palate just drastically varies.<br /><br />For reference, here's the full ingredient list:<br />Peanuts, Corn syrup, Crisped Rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols), peanut butter, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, whole grain rolled oats, almonds, cashews, [Contains 1.5% or less than:]  Whey (from milk), soy lecithin, salt, honey, vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed), resistant corn dextrin, Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain rolled wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran), xanthan gum, and more mixed tocopherols.
