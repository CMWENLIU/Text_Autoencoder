We gave this to our one month old son until yesterday, and then found out that the formula we have been giving him since birth was recalled.  He wasn't doing too well on it.  I can't imagine how quality control failed such a major corporation in baby formula.  We switched to the Target brand, and surprisingly (or maybe not), our baby is doing much better now.  We will never trust or go back to the Similac brand (any type).
