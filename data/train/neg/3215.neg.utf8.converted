My 9-month-old son is what you might call an enthusiastic eater. He's sampled a variety of foods, loves most everything (including unexpected favorites like broccoli and prunes), and almost always, to quote one of our favorite bedtime stories, "eats all before him with smiles and goodwill." But these Training Meals from Plum Organics are a notable exception. We tried three different varieties (Pasta with Chicken and Vegetables, Harvest Vegetable with Turkey, and Multigrain Super Greens), and so far, we're zero for three. My son's most favorable reaction was to the Multigrain Super Greens, which he ate, but begrudgingly so, with wrinkled nose and other negative facial expressions. The other two, well... He alternated between pulling faces, emphatically pushing away the spoon, spitting the food out and, on at least one occasion, actually gagging. I'm disappointed. We've loved this brand's fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;es since my son started eating solids, but he's old enough now that he needs to be eating more proteins and more textured foods, and I really thought these would fit the bill. I really wanted to like them, too, as I still haven't found many quick, delicious, organic/wholesome and BPA-free ways to incorporate chicken, turkey and nutrient-rich green vegetables into my son's diet. Unfortunately, it seems these pouches are not the way to go. Guess it's back to the drawing board for Plum Organics, and back to homemade baby food for us.
