I feel bad giving this product such a low rating, b/c it is such an inspired idea.  Lemon chive fettucine sounds so yummy, but I could not really taste either flavor in the pasta.  I could ~see~ the chives in it, & it faintly smelled of lemon, but nothing I could discern as far as the taste went.  It is also extremely easy to over-cook - have be very attentive to make sure it doesn't end up mushy.
