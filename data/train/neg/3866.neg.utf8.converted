With all of the buzz about artificial sweeteners, I am open to finding an alternative to Splenda. I indulge in an occasional Diet Coke, but have been looking for something to sweeten coffee in the cooler weather and my iced green tea or iced coffee in the warmer months.<br /><br />I brewed a gallon of green tea and chilled it. Since some guests prefer sugar or unsweetened, I normally add sweetener when I pour a glass of tea. The first time, I poured it in a see-thru sport bottle to tote along with me during the day. I added some "Zero". It didn't dissolve. I stirred. Still didn't dissolve. I let it sit for a while, still didn't dissolve. Tried sipping it - all of the "Zero" was still at the bottom. Shook ferociously. Left on counter for hours, thinking room temp would help. (Nope) Five days later, the "Zero" in the see-thru sport bottle, still hadn't dissolved. I eventually poured it out. (As an odd note: It left a white film on the lip of the bottle opening.)<br /><br />So I brewed a 1/2 gallon of green tea and added some "Zero" to it while it was still warm. It dissolved. Then I put in fridge to cool. Poured a glass - I used a generous amount of "Zero" - but the level of sweetness was marginal.<br /><br />I'll wait until cooler weather and give it a shot for sweetening my coffee, but I find it to be a poor performing and pricey useless product.
