i ordered these pens in a bind for smurf cake pops i was creating and they blew chunks. would not draw on candy melts. i nearly had a heart attack and had to settle with wilton's gel icing which drips. i will see how these do on fondant.<br /><br />i was very disappointed, as i had to overnight these and for the price, along with the shipping fee, i'll have to think really hard next time around when i require baking goods from amazon.
