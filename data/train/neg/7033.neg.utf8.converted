I've been using coconut oil for some years and I selected this in the Vine program because everything else I clicked on was not available.<br />It has an odd flavor, not like regular coconut oil and a gritty texture that I don't like, even when gently softened in warm water.<br />It did not blend smoothly into the cream soups that I have been preparing (with coconut oil) for some years.<br />I can't explain all the details of just why I don't like this product but it certainly does not live up to the hype.<br />I will stick with the regular organic, extra virgin coconut oil from the same producer.  It is a superior product and much more versatile than this "Manna"
