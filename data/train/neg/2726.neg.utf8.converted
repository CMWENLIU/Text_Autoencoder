I was very disappointed with this order.  The fortune cookies were mostly broken.  Although they're individually wrapped, a large number were already opened and were loose in the box.  As a result those cookies were unusable and stale.  Even those cookies which were still wrapped did not have the right "crunch" to them. They just don't taste fresh.
