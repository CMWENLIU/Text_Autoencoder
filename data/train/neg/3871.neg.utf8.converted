I love Taco Bell, but this sauce is not right....it says "natural smokey flavor" on the ingredients, which comes across as a heavy dose of that Liquid Smoke that some BBQers use...way too much for the flavor.  Left an afterbite and worse, the chipotle flavoring felt powdery, like it wasn't mixed in well.  Kind of like a grit in it....
