I wasted the whole bottle of "Critter ridder" on a small lawn, which was overturned each night by a raccoon. I tried spraing on grass, then on the ground under the grass and bottom side of sod (that's where raccoon finds grubs), but it didn't care at all. Aparently, "Critter ridder" simply made his lunch spicy - that's all. It keeps coming back each night.
