My family fell in love with Haribo Raspberries this fall when we tried our first bag from a local store-they were an instant hit.  Fresh, vibrant colors, the non-pareils (sugar balls) on the outside burst in your mouth as you tasted them.  Yum!<br /><br />However, I was instantly disappointed when the box I ordereed from Amazon arrived, instead of a fresh, vibrant red, the berries that should have been red were a faded, dingy tan-peach color.  The black ones were still black, but when you handled them it left a brown residue on your fingers as if the color was leaching out of them.<br /><br />The color wasn't the only problem-the non-pareils didn't have that "burst" quality, they were rather bland and tasted old.  I think the candy was old, or perhaps improperly stored, because it was still within the expiration date by a few months.  Whatever the case, the large bag was nowhere near the quality or flavor that the locally purchased Haribo Raspberries were, and I'll not make that mistake again.
