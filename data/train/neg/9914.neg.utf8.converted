As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al "Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,"<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />"given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD ["coronary heart disease"] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. "heart attacks"] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted."<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed."<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm."<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook "nutritional epidemiology", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book "Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."
