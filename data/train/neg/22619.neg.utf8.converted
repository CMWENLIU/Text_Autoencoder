I never would have guessed that a candy like this would contain any fat at all...much less in the form hydrogenated oil? This product offered no ingredient list, so I took a gamble and this time, I lost.  I don't buy anything with trans fat for my family. While hydrogenated oils are not technically trans fat, they are still chemically altered fat which makes them more dangerous than regular fats.  This is the same stuff that makes most peanut butters so unhealthy.  I don't expect candy to be healthy by any means, but this is something I would not have bought if I had seen the label.
