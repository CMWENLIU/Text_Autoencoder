I read a great review of the product in The Whole Dog Journal but when I received the product it didn't look anything like the quality one shown in the magazine.  What I received actually looked like the kind of rolls shown that you would not buy.(One that has a nice outer layer but is scrunchd in the center)  A good quality U.S. raised cattle roll is made from a single sheet of fresh, thick, natural rawhide which is what I thought I was getting.  I do commend the seller for the quick service!
