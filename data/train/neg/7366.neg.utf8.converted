This product seemed like an excellent value for decaf English Breakfast tea.  Unfortunately it bears no relationship to any English Breakfast tea I have had in the past 40 years.  I will be returning to paying much more for Twinings.  This Stash product is considerably more like standard black tea than like English Breakfast tea, and if you want decaf black tea that is stronger than Lipton decaf, this is a good choice.  But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.
