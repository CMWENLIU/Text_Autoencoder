I guess I am a proponent of American-made products user, especially food! I received three cases of Green Giant asparagus with the hope that it would improve my health (as mentioned by one other reviewer). I suppose I could overlook made in Chile if the product was at least edible. As opposed to asparagus tips, approximately 20% of this product was impossible to chew as it appeared it was the very bottom of the asparagus stem or stalks. I canceled my order and I believe Amazon.com should state those foods that are imported like the Bumblebee salmon which claimed " made in Alaska" on the advertisement on Amazon.com. Turns out it was made in Thailand. Customer service sent me another free case and this time it was made in Alaska~~WTF?  I thought this was going to be a good way for me to stock up my pantry and not have to lug cases from wholesale stores into my home. Unfortunately I am disabled and I can't rely on other people to shop for me. I guess I'll have to reevaluate each of the 20 or 30 items I've elected to have shipped on a regular basis. Other items I purchased, advertised " cane sugar" and when I received them there was no cane sugar only fructose. I have another free case of that coming too and hopefully it will say cane sugar not fructose. Let's get real here Amazon and call it like it is as I have better things to do than write negative reviews which I've never done before until I started purchasing " gourmet foods" from Amazon. I really hope this helps somebody~~
