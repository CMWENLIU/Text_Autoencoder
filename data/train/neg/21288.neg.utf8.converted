I tried a couple of real cheap litters that of course didn't work well. Then I tried Arm & Hammer which didn't cover up the scent at all.  Fresh step multiple has been by far the best at hiding the odor.  I recommend cleaning the box every couple days and adding just a tad of fresh litter.  In a small apartment this hides the smell pretty well.<br />I have to take off some stars due to how dusty this litter now is.  There's been some sort of change in the production that makes this litter now really dusty.  After petting my cat I can smell the litter dust.  I'll be switching to another brand.
