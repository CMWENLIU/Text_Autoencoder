These are perfect for anyone on sodium free or a low sodium diet. Quality with a rare attribute. They still taste good! The down side is and has nothing to do with the product is they are approximately $22.00 higher here then other websites selling them on the net. Google and see for yourself. To add insult to injury the Vendor is going to make you wait for a three four day processing before they ship them to you. DUH! I have Amazon Prime and love it and buy most items here but this is one I took a pass on as the seller is selling at an awful hefty price in comparison to other vendors. I found them elsewhere for $27.00 a case! Shame on you Liquid Nation you will never get any of my business. I RATED THIS PRODUCT A TWO STAR ONLY BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE VALUE AND DISGUSTINGLY OBSCENE COST! As far as the product itself goes it's a five star.
