This product is labeled "3 oz boxes".  This is not true.  They are 1 oz.  I would not have purchased these had I known they were the small 1 oz.<br /><br />Also, they expire in 10 days.  This is misleading.  What they are selling as current stock is actually "salvage".  This should be disclosed to the consumer so they could make an educated choice.  Product that is unsellable to wholesalers should not be dumped on consumers via Amazon.  I would have paid more at another site rather than get a product that is ready to be thrown away.
