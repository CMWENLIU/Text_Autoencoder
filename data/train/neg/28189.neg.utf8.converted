This soup has two specific directions for cooking, with microwave or without microwave.  Although the directions for preparing are rather simple, dealing with it was not easy.  I cooked it in the microwave, and the bowl, if very hot, is rather cumbersome to hold onto.  Draining it is a problem, and you may need protection.<br /><br />The bowl of soup nutrition facts claim 200 calories, total fat 2.5, and Ogm of saturated or trans fat.  Sodium is high, 440 it contains 38gm of carbohydrate.  I purchased it for the lack of fat.<br /><br />You can add chicken, tofu, stir fried vegetables, and fresh chopped vegetables.  Keep in mind that the meal comes with a small packet of dried tofu, carrots and spinach topping.  The vegetable packet consists of very small pieces, and dry and dehydrated!  Not very appetizing.<br /><br />There is an odd flavor and consistency with the noodles, and the sauce was not all that tasty or flavorful!  First impressions are critical, and I'm not sure I would try other Annie Chun's dishes, and I will not crave the Teriyaki Noodle Bowl.  ....Rizzo
