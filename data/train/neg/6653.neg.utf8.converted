The title is misleading as I thought I was buying popcorn. I know, my fault for not reading description closely. That aside, the bottle you get is about the size of a Vic's Vapor Rub bottle making what you get a complete joke! Why did they chose to write "seasoning popcorn" instead of "popcorn seasoning"... to confuse the potential buyer. SHAME ON THEM!!! (Have not tried the crap yet as it was to be a gift, otherwise I would have given only 1 star)
