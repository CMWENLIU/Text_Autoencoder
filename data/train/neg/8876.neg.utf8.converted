I usually go for Eden Soy or Trader Joe's as they are cheaper and usually taste as good or better, but I was in Walmart and said, "what the hell." Got a half gallon of Silk Vanilla soy milk and took it home immediately, storing it in a Trader Joe's insulated carry-all with some frozen goods on the way home.<br />Right off, it seemed thick, but I shrugged it off as I hadn't had Silk for a while, and I remembered that their stuff was usually thicker than others. Well before a week had elapsed the carton was bloated with gas. The milk got really thick like paste. Yum, a half gallon of mystery Soy-gurt.<br />I looked over the carton and found a "guarantee" of freshness and a web address. I used their web form and explained the defect in their product. Weeks later, they respond with the following response (basically tough poo, our "guarantee" isn't worth the cardboard it's written on):<br /><br />Thank you for your recent e-mail to Silk
