We gave this treat to our three year old border collie, and within minutes she began vomiting blood.<br />We rushed her to the vet and he could find nothing wrong with her. Her vomiting stopped.<br />We were not sure why this had happened. We suspected the treats but were not sure. Three weeks later we tried again, giving her a small piece. Same effect! She became even more ill and began vomiting blood! We rushed her to the emergency care for dogs and they checked her out completely. They could find nothing wrong. Her vomiting stopped. We will never give her these made in China products again. You have to look closely, when we first looked we say Newport Beach, CA and thought it was made there but more careful inspection showed it's made in China.<br /><br />Your dog can't tell you if this is making him/her sick, they are a lot tougher than we are and don't complain like we do.
