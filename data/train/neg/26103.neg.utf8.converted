When I first saw this product, I was so excited as my cat loves catnip and is a real "greens" eater.  I read the directions and the previous reviews, so I could avoid the usual stumbling blocks.  It is now three (3) weeks later, I have perhaps 4-5 little sprouts that cannot be seen unless the container is in front of your face.  I am so disappointed.  What a waste of the purchase price.
