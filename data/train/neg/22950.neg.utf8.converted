I ordered this for a Anniversary dinner that was Italian cafe style and these were going to be gifts for each couple. They weren't at all what was pictured or advertised to be.....there were NO colorful herb inside ( as pictured) and NO red seal...the whole thing came in a plain clear glass bottle with nothing special in it or on it. Pretty deceitful on the advertisement!! I can only hope that the flavor in the bottle will be oregano flavored as described. This cost me with shipping almost $30.00, not much of a discount there for what I received, pretty disappointed!
