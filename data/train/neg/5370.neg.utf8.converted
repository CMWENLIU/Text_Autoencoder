In BIG LETTERS on the front of the box it proudly claims,"Made from AMERICAN grown fruits".<br />On the back of the box and on the individual "stiks"(where it's almost illegible) it states,"Made responsibly in China"*.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the process is. Is the fruit grown in the U.S. and shipped to China for processing and then shipped back to the U.S. ? [Doesn't sound very responsible to me.]<br /><br />Maybe it's all the miles those fruit stiks log but whatever the reason, they taste awful.<br /><br />We're going look for similar products with fruit grown here and processed here even if we have to pay a bit more for the product.<br /><br />*Is that according to U.S. or Chinese standards ?
