We love Mashups and buy then at our grocery store. I was so happy to see them in the Subscribe & Save option. Based on price and description, I thought I was purchasing 4 boxes of 4 Mashups each (so 16 total). Instead I received 1 box. I called Amazon customer service and they confirmed that it was only 1 box. At a cost of $16, I could buy 3 boxes at my grocery store. Amazon did refund my money no questions asked though.
