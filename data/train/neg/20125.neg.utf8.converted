I put the Melitta pod in my Hamilton-Beach Single Cup Pod Brewer. After it has brewed I take the pod and put it in the cup and let it steep for a few minutes.  I remove the pod, give it a squeeze, like a teabag, and add a half teaspoon of Maxwell House instant coffee.  I add my usual spoonful of coffee creamer and then enjoy a cup of weak, lousy tasting coffee. Wish I hadn't bought the 72 cup package.  I'll be choking this crap down for months!
