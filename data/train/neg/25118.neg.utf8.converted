I really cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with Celestial Seasoning's having ruined its perfectly good green tea. The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea. On the box it says "with White Tea for Smooth Taste."<br /><br />Smooth taste my foot -- the white tea bitters it.<br /><br />Can you imagine if you're a Folgers drinker 3 times a day for 10 years and then all of the sudden Folgers adds Essence of Municipal Garbage to its coffee? Yeah -- that's what celestial seasonings did to me. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />You forced me to go Bigelow!
