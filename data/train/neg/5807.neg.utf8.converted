This green tea, like a lot of them is very weak.  It has been very difficult for me to find a good green tea at a decent price.  Tzao makes a decent green tea but their price is a lot higher than others.  One thing you can look at is how many ounces of dry tea they put in each tea bag.  If they only have 2.19 ounces of tea per 40 tea bags, you know you're looking at some weak tea.
