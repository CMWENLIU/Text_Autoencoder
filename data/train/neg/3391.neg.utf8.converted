Disappointing, not the same!<br />We waited a long time for these to become available again and when we got them they tasted nothing like the ones we ordered last year. They are sort of bitter, not as salty, not as rich. We thought the old version were the best caramels we ever had, we bought several brands of salted caramels on Amazon. These are not the same at all as they used to be. Will NOT buy them again!
