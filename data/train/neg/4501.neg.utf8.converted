I received this product last week and my husband and I have been slowly trying the drinks. Thus far, the horrible outweigh the okay. The Grape was okay...the Dr. Zevia was okay...and that's been about the only okay products. The Mt.Zevia was like a flat Mt. Dew, the Cola was nothing like cola, the Ginger root beer was like a carbonated chai drink. They have been such a let down. I am very bummed that this was not a good product as I grew up on diet drinks and am quite attached to them. Not these. Never again, nor would I recommend them.
