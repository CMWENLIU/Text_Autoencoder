I ordered quite a large order from Barry Farms which included the dough enhancer. Their website said that orders would be filled and shipped usually in 48 hours. My order did not ship out for a week, after I sent them an email asking if they had shipped my products yet. I got them today and the whole box of food items that I ordered smells like cigerettes. I thought at first maybe it was the UPS driver but the inside of the cookbook smells like smoke so I am guessing it is at the farm not the driver. Also, the dough enhancer was not at all similar to a different product that I have been using for over a year but there were not ingredients list so I could not compare. I say buyer beware.
