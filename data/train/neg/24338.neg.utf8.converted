While the taste was ok, i wish i had seen the ingredient list. I just had a case of polar kippers, with only salt added, and i assumed these would be the same.<br />the polar ones are better, but they went up in price , and the crown prince are good, but not as good as the polar.  But these - you can taste a chemical. ...and therefore...i would avoid them
