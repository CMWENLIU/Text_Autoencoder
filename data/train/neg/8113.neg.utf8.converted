I was very disappointed in this product.  The ingredients say that it contains either cornstarch or tapioca starch.  The one I got used tapioca and that might have made the difference.  The powdered sugar was like plaster, as another reviewer stated.  It was very lumpy and my frosting never got the silky texture I've gotten for years with the cheap-o powdered sugars I bought in the supermarket.
