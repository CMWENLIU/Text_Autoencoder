The title header for this item is confusing, it says "2 boxes 20 cakes." What you are getting is a total of 20 individually wrapped twinkies. These are the same 10 pack boxes you can buy at any grocery store across the U.S. In the detailed description of the item it does say 2 boxes of 10 but you have to look hard for it amongst all the other information on a typical Amazon page. I thought I was getting 40 cakes for the listed price which would have been a good deal but I might as well have just gone to the store and bought these cheaper and not paid shipping.
