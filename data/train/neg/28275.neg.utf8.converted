This has to be one of the worst hair products I've used and I've thrown it out after one use. The only directions the bottle says is "massage into scalp and hair" So while in the bath, I massaged a small amount into my scalp and the ends of my hair and put a towel around it. It was very oily and I tried to rinse it out. I shampooed my hair three times trying to get it out because it was so oily feeling. I then towel tried my hair and tried to blow dry it and it was still a greasy mess. So greasy that I couldn't even wear it up in a ponytail because it looked so oily. I had plans to go somewhere so the only way I could get it out was with Dawn dishsoap (which worked for the most part but left it stripped)! My shower/bath was a slick mess too so I had to clean that up. The bottle claims it "provides light, non-greasy nourishment to scalp and hair" My experience, and I don't see how it can honestly be any different for anyone else, it was a heavy, greasy mess. The bottle also emphasizes that it is ultra shea...yet the main ingredient is mineral oil and shea butter is all the way down as the seventh ingredient.
