Melina's White Truffle Oil, 2-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)This oil tasted like a medium grade olive oil and had no flavor of truffle at all. When i tried to return it it was listed as an iten not eligble for return.The nice people at amazon customer service did remove the charge from my account though.
