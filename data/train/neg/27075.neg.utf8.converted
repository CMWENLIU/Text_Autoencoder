I once bought this cheese from a high-end cheese store in the San Francisco area and it was the best cheese I had ever eaten -- crumbly, fragrant of earth and (for some reason) oranges, a deep complex flavor that just kept on giving. I hunted for it in Los Angeles, couldn't find it, finally tracked it down on line at igourmet. What I got was like so-so parmesan: hard and a little oily with no particular flavor. To igourmet's credit, they apologized and gave me a full refund, so I don't blame then. I've since read that the cheese is fragile and very hard to find in its best state, even in Italy. If you love good cheese, put in the effort to find a cheese store that carries this cheese at its best. Unforgettable. But don't try to buy it on line.
