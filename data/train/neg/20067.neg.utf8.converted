If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.
