I have been really disappointed with the new Ovaltine formula. I have bought this mostly for my kids because it had an amazing amount of vitamins and minerals and tasted pretty good. I am a label reader. The new product has about one fourth of the nutritional values as before. What used to be 100% or close to it on several vitamins is now only 10%. It's a shame. They have ruined a great product. The taste is still okay, but the new formula doesn't dissolve well. It's funny that the new formula is much cheaper to make, because the price hasn't gone down at all. We are just getting a lot less for our money.
