This bar reminded me of Rice Krispie Treats.  It has a nice crisp, clean, LEMON flavor, but I tasted NO COCONUT whatsoever.  I was very disappointed by that.<br />So, while they tasted okay, I won't be buying them again.<br />Additional information:<br />Ingredients:  Soy crisps (soy protein isolate, Tapioca Starch, Salt),Organic Brown Rice Syrup, Inulin (Chicory Root Fiber), Cashew Butter (Cashew Nuts, Organic Canola Oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Coconut Chips, Natural Flavor.<br />Contains Soybeans and Tree Nuts.
