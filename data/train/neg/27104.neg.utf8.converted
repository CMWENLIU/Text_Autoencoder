My one star rating is for the price, not the product. This cereal is great, if a bit too crunchy-healthy for those not used to it. (the first time i ate it, I did not like it. But now I really like it). But the price here is absurd. Even at Whole Paycheck it's more than $1 less per box than it is here, and even less expensive at Target where you can get 2-packs for $5.
