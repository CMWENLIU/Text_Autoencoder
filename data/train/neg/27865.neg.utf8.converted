Both my boys liked this formula. However, they changed the package from a nice easy to use can to an awful pouch.<br />The pouch is very messy to use in comparison, and wasteful.<br />Powder spills on the counter and gets on my hands every time I use it.<br /><br />After years of perfect milk powder, however, recent packages have produced milk with floating brown specks.<br />The Enfamil people say this is 'normal', and due to 'scorching' in the drying process.<br />I have decided not to feed my baby burned milk.
