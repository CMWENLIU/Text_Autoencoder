I bought this tea as a possible replacement for the Revolution brand of lavender earl grey tea. I found that the lavender in this tea is overpowering, and if you brew it too long, it tastes of soap, which another reviewer had noted. I would recommend getting the Revolution brand instead - it's a perfect blend of lavender and earl grey and is very soothing.
