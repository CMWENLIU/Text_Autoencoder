I thought I would love this coffee, but the butter toffee flavor and the coffee flavor are weak.  I tried making the smallest size cup and it still is not very flavorful.  I like my coffee strong.  My favorite coffee is the Coffee People's Donut Shop.  This was just not good for me.  If you like a mild flavored weak coffee, this may be for you.
