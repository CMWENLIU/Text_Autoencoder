I bought this because it said it was "Gluten Free  No MSG" on the label in the picture.  When I received it and read the ingredients I found it contains Monoammonium Glutamate.  This ingredient contains the same processed free glutamic acid as MSG (Monosoduim Glutamate).  It is the processed free glutamic acid that causes all of the bad side effects of MSG!<br /><br />So, the label is extremely misleading.  If you  don't want the side effects of MSG don't buy this because it still contains the same processed free glutamic acid which causes the side effects!
