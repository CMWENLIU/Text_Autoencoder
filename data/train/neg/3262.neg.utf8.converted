I left positive feed back, the seller was prompt in getting me the tea, the problem is that the taste it TERRIBLE!!!  I compared this tea to another brand and there is nothing simular in the smell or flavor.  This tea is really bad, unless you like moldy pond scum flavor.  I had my sister try it, and she had very simular comments.  Neither me nor my sister could possible drink this tea.  I have since tried to contact the seller two times, and has never responded.<br />Always, taste the product before leaving a review.
