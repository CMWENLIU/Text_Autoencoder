I was so excited to see that I could get flavored coffee creamer cups in bulk. They came in the mail at a decent time, but I have thrown out way too many broken cups that have leaked all over the other cups.  Out of 192 single serve cups I think I've thrown out 15 that were punctured.  That may not seem like a lot, but these coffee creamers are like precious gems to me. I NEED them for my coffee and I hate running back to the store to get more.  So, my only complaint is that I received too many punctured cups. :(
