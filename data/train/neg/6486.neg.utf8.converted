I ate maybe 10 pieces and felt fine for about an hour and after that i had a stomach ache, cramps, gas and diaheria for a whole night and half a day. I thought it was just me even though ive had it before and it was fine, so i took it to work and warned everyone that they taste great but dont eat more than one or two and the girl is now in such severe pain, i know its not just me so if you had it before and it doesnt bother you great but its not for me darn it why cant the candy manufactors have this quality of snack sugar free snack, without having stomach cramps and the runs from something that taste so good! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
