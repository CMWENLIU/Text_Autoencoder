I wrote a long review of this product--I purchased three(3)--and then decided it was too long for anyone to wade through.  So the following is the Reader's Digest version:<br />"YOU'LL LOVE IT--OR YOUR MONEY BACK"<br /><br /> That's what's in large print at the top of the Aerogarden guarantee.  And in the TV ad the founder of the company goes even further and says he'll even pay return shipping charges.<br /><br />I don't have my three aerogardens now.  To me they're not worth wasting electricity on.  And did Aerogarden refund my money?  No.  But they did send me a form-type letter indicating no responsibility on their part because more than  36 DAYS had passed and I'd purchased the aerogardens from Amazon.  SO MY SUGGESTION IS TO READ THE FINE PRINT AND GOOD LUCK!
