I'm half way though the first can I have ever bought and I happened to take the outside wrapper off.  To my dismay, I found that there had been another wrapper on the container.  The original wrapper was a a purple/blue color, now I have no idea what I have given my daughter, was a it was I thought I bought or some unknown formula repackaged.  I'm livid.  This is scary as hell.<br /><br />Do not trust this formula.
