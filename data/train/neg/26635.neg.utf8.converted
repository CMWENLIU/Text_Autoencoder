We are really happy with the improvement in the new Keurig Vue system, however this is an area where they need to look at Tassimo. The cappuccino provided with the Vue is a 2 step system like the Tassimo, but it is a powder not a liquid. On several occassions, we had powder spill down into the cup before the water brewed. More importantly the taste does not compare to a real cappuccino or the quality in the Tassimo. Again, we are really happy with the Vue and will be keeping it, but if you are huge cappuccino fan you are going to be disappointed.
