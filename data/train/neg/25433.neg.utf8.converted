Just like the reviewer above me I placed an order for these 3 weeks ago only to be sent a cancellation email telling me that amazon could not get them in stock even though they had them in stock last night. I have been disregarded by CS reps on multiple occasions and told that amazon would not have them back in stock (even though they had them minutes before for a much higher price). It would seem that instead of standing behind their sales, they find it easier to cancel the orders of their customers and tell them to re-order for a much higher price after already waiting 3 weeks for the product that was purchased. Seriously disappointed in amazon, this is the third purchase in a row that has been cancelled due to them not wanting to/not able to fulfill the orders.
