Neither Amazon nor the Pacific website list the Sodium level in this product. But, based on the positive reviews, I ordered it. Now I know why they don't list it. There's almost 3g of salt in each box! More per serving than Campbells regular! Over twice as much as Campbells Healthy Request! It may be organic and gluten free, but healthy it definitely is NOT!!!!!!!!!!
