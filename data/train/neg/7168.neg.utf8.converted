I bought this because according to the picture it was just the XXX water that I love.  The water arrived in a large box that fell apart as I was dragging into the garage.  As the box broke and the case of water fell onto the floor, I noticed that the bottle said XXX Zero, at first I thought it was just a new bottle.  No, I actually received the XXX Zero, which tastes ok at first but always manages to leave a nasty after taste.  I feel like I just wasted my money on something that I could have bought at the supermarket when it goes on sale for $1 a bottle.  I can't return this and I don't want to drink it, this is what I get for being lazy, and luckily I only paid $25.41.
