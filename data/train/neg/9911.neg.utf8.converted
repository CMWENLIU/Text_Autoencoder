It doesn't have a fresh spinach taste..  The best way to describe it is if you were to take a bunch of spinach, boil it for awhile into a soggy clump of leaves, and then to infuse it with a metallic canned flavor.  On its own, it made me gag.  Mixing it with lentils and a lot of other spices, I was able to get it down.  It still was many times worse than I thought it could be.<br /><br />I'm sticking with fresh from the grocery store for now on.
