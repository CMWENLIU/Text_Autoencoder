This stuff tastes totally awesome; I would give it five stars for taste alone.  The price, however leaves much to be desired.  At my local Costco, they sell a 44 oz. tub of this for only $6.95.  Not only do you pay drastically less, but you also get an additional 8 ounces of delicious pub mix as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this item, but do what I do and get it from Costco.  For a company that calls itself 'Top Notch Bargains', I think their prices are a notch or two above that of Whole Foods.
