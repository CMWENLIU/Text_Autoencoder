I bought 2 jars of this a couple of months ago, from Amazon. The jars both say best before July 2011 and refrigerate after opening. Upon opening a jar just now discovered mold. Opened jar 2, also moldy. I am very disappointed, since it smells great, but moldy butter is not safe to eat. Truly bummed.
