While these do have a great ingredient label, the texture and flavor are, IMO, off-putting.  I bought the strawberry, but it tastes like a cross between apple and pear ... and leaves a strange taste in my mouth.  But the texture is particularly odd.<br /><br />For years I made my own fruit leather.  Guess I'll have to back to it.<br /><br />I really don't like writing negative reviews, but if I had really paid attention to the poor reviews here, I probably wouldn't have bought this.  I just hope I can save someone else from making the same mistake.
