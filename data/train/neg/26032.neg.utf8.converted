I was excited to try a variety of new flavors before committing to an entire box of flavored K-cups I might not like. Needless to say I'm disappointed. I should have read the reviews but neglected to do so. When they arrived, The K-Cups were in a beat-up Ziplock bag. I got two flavored coffees - one Golden French Toast, one Pumpkin spice. The rest were Columbian blends or Caribou coffee, and half of what was there was decaf. Nowhere on the description does it mention normal blends or decaf coffee. Several of the K-cups seals had been broken, so more than likely the coffee would be stale. Returning this for a refund.
