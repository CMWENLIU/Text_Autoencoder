I prepared them like I had them prepared for me when I was at a Buddhist monastery, cleaned, sliced thinly and salted and peppered and they were great at the monastery but these had a funky stronger odor and a slightly moldy flavor, though I couldn't see any mold on the product.  I've frozen the ones I didn't use and will thaw later to see if that helps with the flavor.  It's not worth returning but I wouldn't recommend them.
