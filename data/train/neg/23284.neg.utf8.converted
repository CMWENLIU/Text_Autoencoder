this was the first time we got this molasses flavor and i'm not sure what it was - if the molasses formula leads to easily broken pieces or if the package just got dropped a lot - but every box in this pack of 6 came with broken pieces! mind you, this is the itty bitty ones already so they were really really small! not that my dog noticed the difference, he gobbled it up regardless! i like the itty bitty size because they are just the right size (each one is thin and less than an inch tall) for a little treat time for my dog (about 35 pounds). i will continue to get cloud star treats, but will skip on the molasses itty bitty treats next time
