Well, this is frustrating as I really love this product for making decent quality lattes on my home machine. However, this is the second time in a row where the product has arrived damaged with cartons opened/punctured with leaky milk. It is hard to know what caused the damaged cartons as the original box is packed in a larger box with paper around it. I am thinking that because I am an Amazon Preferred customer, the orders are shipped via 2-day air. Maybe the air pressure in flight is causing packaging to fail. Fortunately, Amazon has been very good about dealing with the situation, but as I said it is frustrating not having good soy to make decent foam.
