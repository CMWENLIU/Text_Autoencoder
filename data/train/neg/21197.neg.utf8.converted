Bought 3 cans of the condensed chowder a couple of weeks ago, 2 had bumble bee on the can the other didn't...Well the Bumble bee ones are not the Snow's that we all love, they changed the recipe.  All I can say is don't buy it if you like snow's, it's NOT.  It's nothing like the real snows not as condensed and I think it taste BAD.
