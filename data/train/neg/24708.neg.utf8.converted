They taste like onion powder. I knew they wouldn't be creamy because they lacked dairy, but they had a weird look and consistency. I could not taste potato. It made the house stink like onion soup mix. Very unsatisfying. They would be much better if they left out the onion powder, then maybe you could actually taste potato.
