I buy this same ginger in a bin from the health food store often. The store is on vacation so I decided to try these little bags. The first one I opened was dark, dry and NO favor what so ever. Then I tried another bag, it was the same! They are clearly very old. Be careful and know these are not returnable! I'm going to call customer service and see what I can do to be able to return them. They shouldn't be selling bad food. I love Amazon and always trust they will take returns. This time I found out they won't.
