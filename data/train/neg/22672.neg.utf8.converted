I cannot recommend Dr. McDougall's Pad Thai Noodle Soup. If it doesn't look like pad thai or taste like pad thai, it's probably a good idea to call it something besides pad thai. A few broken rice noodles in the bottom of a cup of dehydrated broth does not a pad thai make.<br /><br />I had this for lunch today, and the other kids pointed and laughed at me. Thai people walked past my table, frowning and shaking their heads. Soup technicians from the Department of Soup issued my lunch a cease-and-desist order. President Obama stopped by my table, gave me a stern look, and said, "Mark, I thought we had made more progress than this. Forget the debt ceiling. We need to do something about this concoction, which is neither pad thai, nor soup, but an unsatisfying amalgamation of the two."
