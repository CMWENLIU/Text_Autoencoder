This tea is pleasant and drinkable, not unlike a number of oriental green teas I've tried.<br /><br />I learned (after ordering) that all coca teas sold in the US are "decocainized" (check wikipedia... hence the "export quality" that appears on all of these coca teas.)<br /><br />So this is the coca-tea equivalent of decaf-coffee.  I certainly don't blame the sellers or the products for this unfortunate fact (although they certainly don't volunteer the info), I do blame those who have taken our freedoms to chose what we put in our bodies... thanks all you "drug warriors" for restricting what teas I can enjoy.<br /><br />I think many drinkers of these decocainized teas are waking up to the fresh smell of a tasty placebo. Sorry to spoil the party.<br /><br />So: two stars, because it's hard to feel good about paying $75 for what is essentially just green tea... even if it might "help with digestion".  I certainly have not found it to be better at waking me up in the morning than my usual yerba mate.
