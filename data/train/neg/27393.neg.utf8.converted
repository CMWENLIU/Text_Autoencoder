First of all, the ingredients listed on Amazon are not nearly as complete as the ingredients listed on the actual bag. One of my dogs is allergic to peas and carrots, both of which are in the ingredient list on the bag, but not listed on the site.<br /><br />Secondly, one large "SmartBone" takes my large breed dog no more than 5 minutes to devour. At three dollars a bone, this is way too expensive.
