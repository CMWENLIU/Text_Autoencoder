I bought these markers for Hello Kitty cake pops.  The black does not work well on the hard candy melts.  i had to push hard and carve into the candy and the black would not show up (i was only making whiskers, and can not imagine writing letters).  Not sure how they work for other projects.  i was able to write on paper, not on food.
