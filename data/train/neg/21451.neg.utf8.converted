Prior to 2012, this was my favorite cereal. Tasty, healthy and gluten-free. Sometime in 2012, they reformulated the flakes such that they are now totally tasteless and lack any texture. They are thin and become almost instant mush in liquid. There is no longer any solid 'crunch' or interest. You might as well be eating cheap corn flakes. Save your money until they return to the old recipe.
