Like the other reviewers stated, I found this cocoa to have a fairly rich chocolate taste but, after I received it, when I read that it had artificial sweeteners in it....I was very upset.  As one reviewer wrote....MIGRAINES cometh!!... after drinking this stuff.  Before I realized how unhealthy this stuff was, I found that it took 3 packets to make a truly rich, large cup of chocolate drink.  Any amount less and it was like drinking colored water.  And it was really very sweet...to my taste any way --> maybe that was the three packets I needed to get the rich chocolate taste.  Frankly, with the articial sweeteners and the small amount you get for the money, I will NOT be buying this product ever again!  I recommend you try it locally if you must ingest artificial sweeteners but I'll stick to Xylitol, truvia, and other natural, non-life threatening ones along with the natural 'dirty' sugars.
