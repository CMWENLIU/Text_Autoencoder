My wife purchased this all natural dark chocolate and would give it five stars if she wrote a review. I on the other hand would much rather have sweet milk chocolate over this strong bittersweet taste. This chocolate has a bold taste that is very distinct. Reverie won't deliver a moment of timeless pleasure as they advertise, but if you are sophisticated like my wife, there is a good chance you'll like this stuff. However, if you think Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are da' bomb diggity, I suggest saving your money. Perhaps their Toffee Interlude would be more my flavor.
