I loved the original South Beach snack bars - especially the Chocolate and the S'mores, and was very disappointed when those were pulled from shelves. I was eager to try these - and they are terrible. The mouth feel is sticky, almost taffy-like, and has no chocolate or almond flavor at all. They also are tremendously expensive.
