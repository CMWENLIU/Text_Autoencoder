The picture and description of this item is for a pepper plant, or at least I construed it to be that way. What you get is a small can full of dirt with A pepper seed inside, not a living plant. If you're expecting to receive a pepper plant, as I did, you will be disappointed. $12 bucks for one (1) seed is a bit on the high side. Just thought I might prevent some other Buyer from making the same mistake that I did. Plus, it is no longer judged to be the hottest pepper in the world. The Moruga Scorpion now takes that honor.
