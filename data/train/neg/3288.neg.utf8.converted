Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!
