You don't want to put this stuff on your food.  It is potentially dangerous.  They use enzymes from cow or pig blood to produce this product and therefore it could be dangerous if the meat is not cooked well-done to burnt.<br /><br />This stuff has been around for 6 or so years now and explains why some meats we've bought at the grocery store look the way (shape) they do.  God didn't produce these foods like that!<br /><br />Oui Vey
