These are generally fresh tasting out of the tin, and they keep well enough, though they mightn't be spectacular.  They were a fantastic deal when I subscribed them about a year ago, but suddenly they have jumped to the point where they have nearly doubled in price.  It's time to jump ship on this deal.
