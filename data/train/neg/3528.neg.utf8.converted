This is the absolute worst flavored coffee I ever put in my mouth.  I took several sips to be sure I hated it.  On the fourth sip I had to spew it back into the cup.  I thought possible the shipment was tainted with chemicals.  Please don't buy a large quantity that you'll have to pawn off on someone.  For those who like it, enjoy.
