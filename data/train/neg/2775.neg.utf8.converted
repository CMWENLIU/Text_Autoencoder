I checked the packages of these at Sams and on the back is still MADE IN CHINA. I assume the biscuit part could be made in the USA but the chicken jerky part, as are the waggin train other chicken jerky, made in China. I won't chance my dogs health and am following the suggestion of our vet not to buy any treat made in China.
