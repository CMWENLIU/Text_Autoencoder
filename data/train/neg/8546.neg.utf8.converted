"All good things must come to an end" and the end of the great Season sardines is now.  Previous years' Season sardines were too good.  Season (Manischewitz Co.) no longer gets these sardines from Norway.  Now they supply low grade sardines from Scotland canners.  Last year, these were the best northern sardines available; now they are inedible.  Amazon's web page is in error . . . the package now says "PRODUCT OF SCOTLAND".<br /><br />They also switched to a much lower grade oil, "pure" instead of "extra virgin".  It doesn't even taste like olive oil.  The fish have a poor texture and worse flavor.  I couldn't finish one can.  Other sardine brands have switched from Norwegian to Scottish suppliers to reduce cost before.  These are among the lowest quality commodity sardines available.  Anything in your local store has better flavor and texture.  These Season sardines are rubbery and seem under-done.<br /><br />Please understand: I'm not just saying these are not up to their previous high standard.  I'm saying these Season sardines are AWFUL!  Don't be fooled; the only thing in common with last year's Season product is the name.
