This may be the worst soy sauce in the world, which is amazing because it is expensive, looks great in the bottle, and comes from one of the most highly regarded soy sauce producers in Japan.  This is nothing but dark salt water.  It's too salty to use on food.  It's too salty to use in cooking.  It's a great way to destroy any dish.  Pity I have three large bottles ... I don't need soy-flavored mouth wash and I can't think of anything else to do with it.  Down the drain they go.  Don't confuse with Kikkoman Marudaizu soy, which is extraordinary.
