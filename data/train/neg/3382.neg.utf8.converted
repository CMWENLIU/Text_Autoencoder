I must be doing something wrong because there is ZERO FLAVOR. it sure smells nice, and if it tasted like it smells i'd probably love it. i would love to think perhaps i just got a bad batch..but its 6 boxes all with zero flavor and so was my last batch of 6 boxes of vanilla lipton tea...i am just completely done with any teas from the Lipton brand.
