Well... looks like hamster food, smells like hamster food, oh yeah and it TASTES like hamster food!  These crispbread crackers are nothing short of disgusting.  Health food does not mean that it needs to taste bad! I find nothing wrong with all-natural foods that actually taste good.  There are plenty of alternatives that offer whole grain and fiber and are much more flavorful.  The no sodium aspect is difficult to ignore but unless your tastebuds have suffered some sort of great catastophre than I warn you to look elsewhere for something more palatable...
