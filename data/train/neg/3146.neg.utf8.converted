I used Similac with my first two children (one full time formula, second as a supplement). I intended on using this organic formulation with my third, until I did more research. Similac chooses to use cheaper quality ingredients i.e cane sugar instead of lactose in this formula. It's the "cheap" way of making infant milk, although the product isn't cheap. Babies love it because it's loaded with extra, actual sugar instead of milk lactose similar to what is in breastmilk. Sadly, this formula is one of those scams by companies trying to get a piece of the green hype. Check out other brands instead. Earth's Best offers a better organic option for your child.
