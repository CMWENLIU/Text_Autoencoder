I bought this a BJ's at about 1/4 the price.  I still feel that I paid too much because this tastes like saltwater.  I don't tastte any chicken.  Despite being labeled low sodium, it has 25% of the daily sodium per cup.  College Inn Organic Chicken Broth, 99% Fat Free, 32 fl oz or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EOULQ">Swanson Natural Goodness Chicken Broth, 16-Ounce Aseptic Box (Pack of 12)</a> both taste much better.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010ON2AK">More Than Gourmet Glace De Poulet Gold Roasted Chicken Stock, 16-Ounce Packages</a> is the best concentrate by far.  Don't buy this -- it's awful.
