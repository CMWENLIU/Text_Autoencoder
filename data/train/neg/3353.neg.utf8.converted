My daughter loved this soup, but I was disappointed to discover that Earth's Best uses a resin liner on their canned foods that contains BPA - a toxic chemical for children.  While the company says the levels are low and within acceptale government standards, BPA is known to leech even more into acidic products like diced tomatoes, or tomato soup.  So, until Earth's Best moves to glass jars, we'll have to refrain from eating this yummy soup.
