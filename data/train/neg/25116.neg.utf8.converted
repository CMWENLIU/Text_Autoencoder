I'm a huge fan of Celestial Seasonings. Even worked for them, years ago. Their green tea was one of my favorite non-loose varieties. Now, they've gone and messed with it, adding white tea for "smoothness."  Well, if I wanted white tea, I'd BUY white tea (and it would be silver needle organic).<br />Was so disappointed to get the box, and discover that the pure, lightly vegetal green tea taste was gone. Am bummed that they changed the blend, to say the least. Worst part is, the new blend doesn't taste as good as Stash's "Fusion," which is also a green/white mix...<br />Please bring back our green tea, Celestial Seasonings!
