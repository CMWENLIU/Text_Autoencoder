Let me begin by saying I am a huge Coffee People fan.  My wife is from Oregon and anytime we visited her family my first priority was visiting one of their shops.  I was deeply disappointed to see their stores absorbed by Starbuck's (nothing against Starbuck's, they make a good cup of coffee and are a very responsible company).  Having tried Jet Fuel, I find it tastes like it sounds, with a bitter and chemical finish.  I'm no connoisseur, but I know what I like, generally bold coffees, and this may be bold, but also harsh with an unpleasant finish.  I'd recommend passing on this one and explore their other excellent coffees.
