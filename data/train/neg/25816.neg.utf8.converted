I had been using Eden Kombu for years and always had good results. But the last time I bought some it was very different, and not in a good way. Within just a few minutes of coming into contact with water it oozed a green, gloopy slime. Edens Kombu had never done this before so I threw it out and started over with a fresh batch, same results, green slime. I had contacted Eden about it to see if there was something different about the product but never got a reply that explained in any way what could be the cause of this problem. So.....Eden! See Ya! I think they just dissmissed me as a quack or something but I,m quite serious, this stuff was NASTY.<br /><br />There is better quality Kombu out there than Edens, you just gotta look for it.
