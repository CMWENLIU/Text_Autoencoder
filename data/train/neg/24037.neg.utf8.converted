I give it two stars for recieving my order on time. I compare the size of the package to a bag of Oreos. I was disappointed in the taste of the mochi had a doughy very soft texture and a flower after taste, being that I am use to eating mochi like the ones at Tuttimelon and Pinkberry. If you are considering mini mochi that is compare to Pinkberry I would consider shopping at nutsonline.com Omg the best so far I have bought! I tried to get a refund at Boba tea Direct but when they responed the totally ignored the fact and didnt even mention the refund policy, which I thought was rude! Open the bag of mochi and let it sit for awhile it taste a bit better. I won't be ordering this product again. Customer service was very bad.
