I was anxious to buy the Boston Bean decaf breakfast blend k-cups for my husband. However, he did not even get to taste it.  There were no filters in the pods and as you can imagine we had coffee grounds everywhere!  We tried three of them in hopes that it was just one or two that got past quality control.  Now I have my Keurig to clean since it is stopped up.  I LOVE the Keurig....hope it isn' ruined!
