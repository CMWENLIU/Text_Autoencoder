I've been ordering these coffee for awhile now.  It's not very strong, but okay.  I noticed the new package from my last order.  it's not as pretty, but that's just the package (so, I thought).  Unfortunately, not only the packaging is different, but the coffee is different too.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  I thought maybe it's just a bad batch, but when i opened another pack it still tasted BAD...yuk!!!  I'm so done with this coffee.
