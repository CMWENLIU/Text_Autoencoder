I ended up returning this item.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you buy this item, run it through to cook pure water only, then taste and smell the water.  I got a heavy plastic smell and shockingly intense bitter taste, even after 10 cycles after buying it new.<br /><br />At first the reviews I read seemed good and the product is so cute I wanted to like it very much, and the idea of making your own food seems healthier than buying prepackaged.<br /><br />Upon opening, I noticed that the cap for the boiler looked cheap and *entirely* plastic, not like the sturdy caps on similar boilers of a Krups espresso machine of the same price range.<br /><br />But I was thrilled and ready to go, and nearly made a batch of food immediately. I'm so glad I didn't.  However the instruction booklet had an odd suggestion that when first opened new, the user should cycle water only through the machine at least three times.<br /><br />The first time (filled water to the 3 cup line, poured it in, closed the lid, and turned it on), I had a heavy plastic smell in the steam. Still wanted to like it, and figured some smell was unavoidable.  I don't know if the smell came from the plastic lid of the boiler, or the steamer tray, or the clear container.<br /><br />I ended up running it about 6 or 7 times (again water only) and the smell decreased somewhat.  I still wanted to like the product.  That's when I thought I should taste the water.  It was unbelievably and sharply and very clearly bitter.  I couldn't even hold it in my mouth for more than a fraction of a second.  I ended up running the machine about 12 times with just water, and the taste was still just as bad.<br /><br />Had I run the Beaba with food and given it to my baby, I would've chalked it up to the baby hating broccoli. In the end I figured I could run it a hundred times, and even if the smell and taste eventually faded away until I couldn't detect it, I'd still be risking giving chemicals to my baby.  After all, you can't taste BPA either, so tasting it shouldn't be my threshold.  BPA free or not, this product when run with pure water produced hot water that tasted like poison; there are other chemicals out there to be worried about after all.<br /><br />Maybe after this experience I'm not sure I would trust any product involving heat and plastic, so it's back to my stovetop steamer and Cuisinart for my baby food.  (I kept the Beaba silicone freezer tray, since silicone is inert and it works great and I love the design of the tray)<br /><br />It is possible I had a defective lot or something, so if you do end up buying this product, I recommend running it with water only and tasting it for yourself.  Trust yourself, not me.<br /><br />****Feel free to comment to my review and indicate whether you do, or do not, taste the bitterness from running water-only through a brand new Beaba unit.****
