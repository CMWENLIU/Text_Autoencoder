This product deserves an even lower rating. The final product was extremely sugary for a teriyaki sauce. Flavor is a 0/5. It's nutritional value is also very lacking because they don't give you enough vegetables. It's only a morsel about the size of a 1/2 tablespoon. 0.5/5 for nutrition. The portion was also very small. 4 ounces + 1 cup of water makes a a very measly 12 ounce snack. 1/5 for nutrition. The fact that you have to microwave it for 4 minutes destroys many of the valuable nutrients compared to boiled noodles. 1/5 for texture.
