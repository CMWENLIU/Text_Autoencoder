We have three cats - two wanted nothing to do with it no matter how many times we tried.  Ended up pooping on the carpet, something they have never done before.<br /><br />The other cat, who uses this litterbox, gets diahrea on a regular basis.  The box is not designed for that type of mess!  We ended up scooping most of the granules out.<br /><br />So if your cat has these type of issues, do not use!
