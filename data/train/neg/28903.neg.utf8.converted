I bought this as a filler item for my order to bring the total up so that it would qualify for free shipping. As a regular at the gym I have a curiosity about any food that promises lots of protein. This wasn't for me - or my wife - but, hey, it's food, and that's very subjective. Someone else (or his goat) might love this stuff. It smells like rope (it is a hemp product, after all) and doesn't dissolve well in milk, leaving a nasty, gritty mud at the bottom of the glass that sticks to the teeth.
