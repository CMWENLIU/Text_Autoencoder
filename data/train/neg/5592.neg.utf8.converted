My first batch died after a couple weeks of growing to about 1.5 inches; the company was very quick in replacing all three plants, however the next batch did the same thing.  I don't know what is wrong with the tomatoes, my herb garden in my other aerogarden is growing so much that I'm throwing away basil to keep it under control.  Also have tried on another set to grow cilantro with no success even after trying to transplant from a very small potted plant, similar failure with trying strawberries.  I'm getting the impression that aerogrow is really good for growing their standard herb package and nothing else.
