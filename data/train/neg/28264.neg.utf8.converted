As adding any oil to your hair, there was a notable effect on shine and luster, but by the end of the day my hair felt more heavy and greasy than anything else.  Other than having some moderate immediate benefit, there was no long term gain of better condition of may hair or scalp.  I really could not notice anything different about my hair during and after use.
