After acquiring the Log Cabin brand, Pinnacle Foods (which also owns Mrs Butterworths) reformulated Log Cabin. It no longer contains any maple syrup at all; now it contains artificial flavors instead.  Some of those flavors (probably the artificial butter?) are really foul, and the syrup tastes positively horrible.  (Logcabinsyrups.com says they now have a 100% pure maple syrup variety; that one might be OK, but I wouldn't touch the others with a 10-foot french toast stick.)
