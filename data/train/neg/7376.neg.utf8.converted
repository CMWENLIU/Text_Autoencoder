I took a chance having read other reviews that said the coffee was pretty dried out, and that's what I got too. Maybe it wasn't fresh stock, or maybe it's just a dry light brown bean that doesn't brew rich coffee. A friend of mine who has good taste in coffee recommended this product at Amazon to me, but I don't think I got what he got. I am going back to my goopy dark Pete's beans even at 2X+ the price.
