Not what I expected, nothing like the illustration on the package.  I have enjoyed Ryvita products previously, but will not purchase this item again. Two seeds and one raisin per brick of corrugated meal do not make the pain of eating one of these worthwhile. Food should not break into shards and try to stab you. Also, the image suggests that the product is toasty golden.  No evidence given of fireblasted blowtorch charring. Tag suggestions: good god I can't feel the roof of my mouth.
