When looking for pink grapefruit juice, I wanted 100% juice with no added sweetners.  This product seemed to fit the bill, since it is listed as Florida's Natural Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice.  While it does not have added sugar, it is loaded with high fructose corn syrup.  There is a little blurb on the upper right hand side of the label that states the product is Pink Grapefruit Juice Cocktail.  I am selling this product to a friend and feel that this product was mis-represented by Amazon.com.
