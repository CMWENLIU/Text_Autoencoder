I had high hopes for these coffee pods.  I typically use Senseo Columbian Coffee Pods in my Melitta single brewer and those were fine, but my grocery store stopped selling them, so I thought I would try these thinking there's more coffee and better beans in each pod so it must be better.  I popped one in my single pod holder and out came some hot light brown water.  Totally confused, I came and read some more Amazon reviews, and read that I should be wetting one side of the pod, placing it in the double pod holder, and pressing firmly in place to get it to brew properly.  I tried this method, and it did help, but it still tastes like water, so something must still not be right.<br /><br />I'm open to suggestions.
