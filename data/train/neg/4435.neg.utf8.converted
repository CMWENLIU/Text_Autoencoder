<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMKPDI">NEW! POOP-FREEZE Aerosol Freeze Spray (10 oz)</a> This product worked fine on regular poop, so what, I can pick that up with a baggie any day.  I purchased this product for when my dogs had loose stools but it did not work on hardening these stools up to prevent a messy clean up.  Sorry, it appeared to be a great idea!
