I was really quite disappointed. The " meatballs" taste like what I would imagine " fake meat" to taste like as they are very artificial in texture and do not taste like really anything resembling meat. The pasta is overdone, the sauce is watery and, without exaggeration, you can actually drink the whole thing, except for the tiny " meatballs," which are few indeed. This is really a bad example of processed food.
