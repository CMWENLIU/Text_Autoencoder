3 bottles of grape juice 32 ounces each is expensive this way.<br />And.............. had it had a small degree fo grape taste i would not have minded...<br />Just because the grapes are organic does not mean they need be TASTELESS!!!<br />the packaging was ridiculous.............an overhwelming need to wrap it in celephane...then plastic puffy bags....totally unecessary
