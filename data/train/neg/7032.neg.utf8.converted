There was no expiration date on the two jars I received. I called Nutiva and asked if this product was to have an expiration date on it and they said that there should be two dates on the jar. A packed on date and an expiration date should be present.  I then went a local store who I thought might carry this product and yes there is a packed on date and an expiration date which is one year from the packed on date. Amazon did make good and refund my purchase price.
