It's my fault for not looking into the quantity but I didn't expect for the price, I would only receive one box of oreos! The seller should be ashamed of his or herself for charging such a ridiculous price!  I have been a prime member for years and have never felt so ripped off. The candy corn oreos smell like candy corn but had absolutely no flavor like candy corn.
