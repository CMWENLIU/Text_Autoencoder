I ordered this brand ONLY because it stated that it was in a JAR. I got a white, opaque tub, disfigured, from what I suppose was due to multiple liquifying, then solidifying. I could have gotten it cheaper and faster but chose this for the supreme qualities of glass. The oil tastes okay, but I have doubts about what else might be in it.  Even the photo appears to be glass. What a con!
