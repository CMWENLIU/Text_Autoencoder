Don't want to discouraged anyone here but my friends & family know me as a cake expert.  This cake was absolutely awful.  I made it for my birthday & cried. I have made Pamela's & it was ok.  But this was so grainy, the after taste was UGH! It weighed a ton & I had to throw it all away.  For 8 dollars I was not happy.  But I will try the Kinnikinnick next because that got such great reviews.
