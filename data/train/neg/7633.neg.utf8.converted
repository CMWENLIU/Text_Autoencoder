I received a package of Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snack for my 23rd birthday. Growing up deeply entrenched in Asian cuisine, I knew before trying it that it was more than likely not going to be to my tastes. If you like products such as grass jelly or sushi, or anything that is pungent and tastes like plant material without being om nom nom delicious, this is for you.<br /><br />This product is not recommended for small children. There's not enough sugar in it.<br />This product is also not recommended for vegans and seliacs. While it is gluten free and animal-product free, you can do something better for yourselves by finding an alternative snack without the bay water flavor.<br />This product is not recommended for people with heart disease or who are at risk for developing heart disease. It's a high sodium choice.<br />This product is not recommended for alcoholics. You'll start drinking again.<br />This product is not recommended for cigarette smokers. Save your money for your cancer sticks.<br /><br />This product IS recommended for users of Mountain Dew, grass or ai ju jelly, pickled radish, bean thread, sushi, menudo, mole sauce, adobo sauce, specialty bell peppers, bouncy balls, pencil and pen erasers, rubber soles, rubber in general, motor oil, gasoline/petrol, radioactive isotopes, unidentified rare earth metals, tapeworms, Buffalo Bills fans, fruit cake, Hostess snacks, corn, rat, and/or chicken snakes, parents of teenagers (for use as a punishment agent on those late night sneak outs), water bottles, organic milk, Tuscan Whole Milk, Three Wolf Moon shirts, wolf shirts in general, Twilight readers, and insomniacs.<br /><br />The flavor matches wonderfully with a fresh whole rabbit, such as the one listed on this site.<br /><br />I would rate it higher than two stars in the regards that it's a wonderful seaweed product. However, I don't like it. That's the definition of two stars.
