I thought this stuff had a bad aftertaste. Not just the normal stevia aftertaste, but also the aftertaste from added ingredients. It completely ruined my cup of coffee, I had to throw it out and re-brew! I have tried it in a couple of desserts with the same results-- disgusting! I highly recommend using erythritol instead.<br /><br />PS: I have grown stevia and it tastes much better than this stuff. However, even the homegrown stuff has an aftertaste, and I would normally never put it in coffee!! Stevia is very very easy to grow and if you like stevia, I think you should consider growing it :)
