I don't know what all these other reviewers were drinking, but this tonic water is not worth the premium price.  It's cloying and one-dimensional.  To my palate, it is indistinguishable from Schweppes or Canada Dry tonics.  There are much better boutique tonics available, Q-tonic for instance, than this.  Save your money.
