I have purchased 3 bags of Taste of the Wild Bison and Venison. I had 2 Standard Poodle when I purchased the first bag. My 5 yr old SP is notoriously picky and has a very sensitive stomach. She LOVED this food. We went through the first bag and both were doing great. (Gaining weight which is very hard for her to do). So I ordered a second bag, exactly the same. They ate almost all of it over several weeks and all was fine. With the last several cups in the food container the 1 year old SP became violently ill like she has never been before. The older one then became sick. I figured they had gotten into some thing outside and reordered. The 3rd bag came several days later, both had recovered completely by this time. We also got a Bichon Frise puppy about a week before this. The older dogs had Taste of the Wild late in the afternoon and the puppy grabbed some they had spilled on the floor. All 3 dogs then became ill, throwing up all night. Immediately the next morning I removed all Taste of the Wild from the house and put them all on puppy food. Everything cleared up. I have called customer service and was told their vet would be calling me. That was several days ago. I have now emailed requesting a refund.
