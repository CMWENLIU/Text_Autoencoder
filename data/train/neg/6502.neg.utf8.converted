Ok...I was invited to one of those Organo Gold mixers by a co-worker...throughout the presentation it just smelled like a pyramid scheme (a turn off)...my belief is that if the product is so good it would be available for the masses...in every store on every corner.  I have tasted both the mocha and latte and they actually taste the same nor have I noticed a "surge" in energy...I am pretty active already, but was looking for that afternoon boost and I did not get it from this...I will go back to my sugarfree international instant coffee...it taste better and better yet it's CHEAPER!
