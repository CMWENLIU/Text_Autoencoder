Well, I've been waiting for the availability of Senseo Medium Roast pods for almost a quarter now and left enough comments about the insanity of the decision the company made on their facebook page. It will probably be in future textbooks how to ruin a perfectly healthy and highly profitable business.<br /><br />Today I found this offer on Amazon, ONE PACKAGE for almost $30, is this the creation of a mad man?<br />Here is the deal; I love the coffee, I hate what the company did and selling a package @ $30 does not add to the "love-it" part.<br />How much more do you guys try to make sure Senseo will not survive in the long run?<br />Sitting in my chair, still enjoying a Senseo coffee in my cup and shaking my head...
