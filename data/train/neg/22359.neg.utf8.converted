I have been buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps (Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana),  2 - 12-Count  Bags</a> for quite some time and have really enjoyed them, as have my grandchildren.  I thought this brand of fruit snacks would give us some different fruits to try.  The first one I tried was the mango.  It was okay.  Chewier than I would have liked, but the flavor was acceptable.  then I tried the banana.  It was bad.  I threw it away.  This makes me reluctant to try the other flavors.  I guess I just like the ones that are crispy rather than chewy.  I think the crispy ones are easier for the little ones to eat as well.  Both come in a package that is a good size to take along.
