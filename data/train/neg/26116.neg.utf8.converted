This product has palm oil in it, and as far as "vegetable" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but its a saturated fat and its NOT healthy.  It also has added sugar.  Smuckers brand might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.
