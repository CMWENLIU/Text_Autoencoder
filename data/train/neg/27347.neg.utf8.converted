I would exercise extreme caution with this tea.  I used to drink one cup of China Green Tips Tea in very clean water per day.  After 6 months, it had toyed a great deal with my endocrine system.<br />The toxic limit of fluoride is 1 mg per liter, and this tea exceeds 8.<br />The toxic levels of fluoride is a product of the adulturated land and water of China.  As a note, don't buy ANYTHING from China if you value your health!
