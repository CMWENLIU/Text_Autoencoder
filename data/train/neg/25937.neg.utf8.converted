When I opened the box there were three jars in side a plastic bag, sticky stuff all over, on closer inspection one jar had been cracked, the box had two air pillow on each side of box nothing on bottom or top,I think who ever packed it was lazy,and for the bacon jam, not so good. This is my first purchase from Amazon not happy.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZWV5Z4">Skillet Bacon Jam Bacon Spread 7 0z. - 3 Jar Pack</a>
