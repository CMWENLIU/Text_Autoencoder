Nectresse is the new "non-caloric" sweetener, which is set to take on Stevia. The monk fruit, the basis of this sweetener, can be used in high-heat cooking, which Stevia cannot.<br /><br />But, read the label before you decide that this product is for you, because monk fruit is not the only ingredient. In fact, it's the third ingredient of four:<br /><br />1.  Erythrytol -- it's a sugar alcohol that's 60 to 70 percent sweeter than sugar, which occurs naturally through the fermentation of fruits. Industrially, it's fermented with glucose and a yeast. Unlike other sugar alcohols, erythrytol is less likely to cause gastric side-effects (gas and diarrhea) and it does not effect blood sugar.<br /><br />2.  Sugar<br /><br />3.  Monk fruit -- this fruit is 150% sweeter than sugar. It's derived from luo han guo, which is a Chinese gourd family.<br /><br />4.  Molasses<br /><br />While the label says this is non-caloric, note there is one gram of carbohydrates listed on the label. That's four calories per teaspoon. That's less than the 15 calories per teaspoon of sugar and Nectress should not have the same effect as sugar on your blood glucose, but it's still got calories and if you consume a lot of Nectresse, it's going to add up.<br /><br />It's debatable whether Nectresse is natural, either. Sugar comes from beets, which have been genetically modified. Also, the molasses and sugar alcohol components are suspect.<br /><br />Nectresse comes in a small plastic container with two pop-ups on the lid: one for pouring and the other for spooning. It looks like granulated sugar, the only difference is a slight peachy cast which I am guessing is from the monk fruit or the molasses.<br /><br />So--after all this explanation--how does it taste? I added Nectresse to a couple of my favorite teas to see. My initial impression was sweet--actually, much sweeter than the Stevia, which has become my go-to sweetener. A teaspoon will definitely sweeten a cup that would normally take two.<br /><br />The issue is the after-taste. It's sweet and sticky and it lingers. I rinsed my mouth out twice before that taste left.<br /><br />No thanks, I'm sticking with Stevia.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2012
