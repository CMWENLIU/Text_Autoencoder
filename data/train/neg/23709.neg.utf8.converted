I made that silly mistake of buying a brand that I had not tasted and chose it because it was a good price.  Hummus is something I make once or twice a week, so good tahini is essential.  The batches I have made with the Roland brand have not been very good. (Not inedible, just not very tasty.)  It has a more bland taste, less nutty tasting and the texture of the hummus made with it isn't blending creamy or smooth like it should be.  I have yet to open the second jar, but I cancelled the auto-ship so I won't receive any more "less than satisfactory" tahini.
