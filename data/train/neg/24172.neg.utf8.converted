Shipping for cake was fine. We got the cake on day we requested for.<br />Packing of cake was not so great. When we opened cake there was not "Happy birthday" note on the cake. No design of flowers as shown in picture. The cake was just plain. It was so disappointing. Also the cake is too small for the price these guys are charging.
