Worst item imitating a food that I have ever eaten.  Taste horrible.  Too sweet.  Texture like gritty gummy bears (gummy bears taste better).  Very high in calories.  Blueberry beer taste more like blueberries than this abomination.  I like a lot of stuff that I buy through Costco (kirkland),but these are a disgrace. Buy frozen blueberries; just deal with the color or eat raisins.  you'd be better off eating tic tacs.
