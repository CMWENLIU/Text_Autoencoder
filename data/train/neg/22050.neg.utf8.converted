I was very excited to try these "spicy" refried beans being that I am a big fan of Eden Organic.  I was VERY disappointed once I did.... they are the most bland and tasteless refried beans I have ever eaten.  They are NOT spicy at all.  I would never purchase them again.  A much tastier choice (and lower in calories) is La Preferida Fat Free Refried Beans, however Amazon does not have a subscribe and save option for them yet, so for now you get a much better deal buying them at your local grocery store.
