I have purchased halva from this company in the past and have received delicious halva on those occasions.  Additionally, because we were happy with the product, the amount of halva we ordered progressively increased until we purchased 5 pounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on our latest order of 2 pounds, upon opening the package, we discovered that the halva appeared to have somewhat of a pungent odor.  We then tasted the halva and immediately found it to have a rotten taste.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the halva had possibly come in contact with moisture or that the halva sent was dated.  I began the inquiry process and explained the incident with Parthenon foods.  I was shocked and dismayed when they sent me the following reply (verbatim):<br /><br />"Hello,<br />We are sorry, but this item is not old and very fresh.  Are you referring to the package being a little oily, which would be normal?  Halva is not perishable and can not be "rotten" This product is very fresh and perfect to consume.<br />Sincerely,<br />ParthenonFoods.com"<br /><br />I laughed out loud due to their statement, "this item is not old and very fresh", which essentially admits their item is not very fresh!  Pretty funny huh?  Anyways, they were not willing to rectify the issue, even though we spent a considerable amount of money on their product on numerous occasions.<br /><br />Fortunately, the outstanding service of Amazon came through as always, and they themselves rectified the issue by reimbursing me the full amount.  I then of course spent the same amount on a different brand of halva (through Amazon of course!)<br />I will never purchase food items from Parthenon foods again, bad customer service, unwillingness to rectify situation, prompt destruction of good will.  At least they were honest about the halva being "...not old and very fresh"...!
