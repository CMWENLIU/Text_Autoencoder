While this product calls itself "Ultra Shea" and also notes "with shea butter" on the front label, shea is actually the 7th ingredient, after Mineral Oil (#1), Hydrogenated Coconut Oil (hence the suntan lotion smell), Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) oil, and BHT (preservative). So if you're expecting some yummy natural product from the "ultra shea" reference, you'll be disappointed. In this case "ultra" either means "a little bit" or "mostly petrochemical products but also."<br /><br />(Notably, the ingredients aren't immediately visible on the bottle--you have to remove the peel-off label to expose them.)<br /><br />But I'm not opposed to synthetic beauty products, so aside from the misleading packaging, I gave it a whirl. It's a pretty standard hair oil: greasy and thick, which is good for heavy damage or use on ends. I'd probably avoid using it on my scalp except as a deep treatment to be shampooed out, because the oil is quite heavy.<br /><br />But the scent is a deal-breaker for me. It's a *heavy* coconut smell that doesn't readily dissipate and leaves you smelling like you should be on a carnival cruise ship. (I love a light coconut scent, especially tempered with citrus  or mint; but this smells like you're all buttered up in a deck chair swilling a pina colada.)<br /><br />I do like the bottle, which has an elmer's glue type lid that lets you dispense a few drops at a time, and seems to be pretty leak-resistant.
