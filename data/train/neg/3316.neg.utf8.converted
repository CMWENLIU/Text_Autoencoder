This coffee drink is so strong that it dried up all the spit in my mouth for a week.  Not really, but you get the idea.  My daughter happily took it from me and finished it off and thinks it was amazing.  Of course, she really likes Starbucks too.  So, if you love expresso and strong coffee, this IS your drink.  If you are a coffee wimp like me though, look for a lightly flavored cappucino instead!
