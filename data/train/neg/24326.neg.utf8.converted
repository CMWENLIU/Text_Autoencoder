WHEN MY PRIMARY GROCERY STORE BEGAN CHARGING 72 CENT A CAN FOR FANCY FEAST, I LOOKED ELSEWHERE AND WAS THRILLED TO FIND THAT AMAZON.COM HAD EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED FOR 58 CENTS A CAN. I USE TWO CASES A MONTH AND BEING THAT I AM DISABLED, AND I NO LONGER DRIVE, HAVING THE TWO CASES DELIVERED TO MY DOOR FOR NO EXTRA COST WAS A DOUBLE TREAT.I WENT TO ORDER NEXT MONTHS SUPPLY A FEW DAYS AGO AND IN ONE FELL SWOOP THE PRICE HAS JUMPED UP TO THE SAME AS MY GROCERY STORE. I WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE MY FANCY FEAST FROM AMAZON.COM.  THE BRAND FANCY FEAST IS A PERFECT SERVING SIZE AND SEEMS TO BE OF A GOOD QUALITY EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NEVER TAKEN A BITE. IT WAS NICE WHILE IT LASTED.
