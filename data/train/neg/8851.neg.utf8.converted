Don't get me wrong. I love Intelligensia coffee... I buy it a lot living in the L.A. area.<br />But this stuff is just straight up not fresh. I may be a little bit more picky than your average coffee drinker since I usually always buy fresh and definitely always grind the beans at home. But there is a noticeable difference between buying from Amazon and buying from the store itself.
