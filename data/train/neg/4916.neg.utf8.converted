This product tastes pretty good, although I would not call it thirst-quenching. But, if you think you're drinking a holistic refreshment in lieu of a caffeinated beverage, you are not.<br />The caffeine content is about 25 mg/8 ounces (20 ounces per bottle), so you are getting as much caffeine as a cup of coffee! If you think the natural ingredients and B complex are giving you an energy boost, it's probably the caffeine.<br />Me and my heart arrhythmia didn't appreciate being duped. Sobe should label this product to include the fact that it contains caffeine on the front of the label, not on the very, very bottom under the ingredients.
