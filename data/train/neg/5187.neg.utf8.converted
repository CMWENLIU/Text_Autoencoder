I've tried many of the Sweetleaf Stevia liquid flavors and have throughly enjoyed all of them, but the root beer one is one I will never buy again.<br /><br />I love root beer, even diet root beer and this liquid is very weak compared to the other liquids.  The other products I can put a half of a dropper into 64 ounces of water and have a perfect taste.  The root beer takes two or three times this amount to get any taste in the liquid and it is not a true taste.<br /><br />The english toffe, vanilla creme, chocolate raspberry dark chocolate and cinnamon are all great tasting.
