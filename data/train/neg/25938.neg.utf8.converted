I bought this product three times. The first two times I got the "made in Italy" version, and it was among the best canned tuna I had ever had (truly Italian standards - I'm from there and I know what I'm talking about). The last batch I got was the "made in Thailand" version (even though at the time the Amazon description still said "made in Italy") and it was just above mediocre. Pretty tasteless actually, and NOTHING compared to the Italian version. Same price though, which made me feel I had just been ripped off (and scammed, since the Amazon description had not been changed by then). NO MORE!
