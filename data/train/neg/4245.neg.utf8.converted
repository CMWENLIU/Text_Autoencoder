The grains I got didn't look like the one you see on the pic. The one I got had to come from Antarctida bec they were yellow (probably they were frozen before)they also not growing...the amount I got was invisible to my eyes, I complain to the seller so they send me a little more grains but they were still yellow and kind of dead bec they didnt grow. If you want to waste $10 and some time go for it!!! I would really recommend to order it somewere else.
