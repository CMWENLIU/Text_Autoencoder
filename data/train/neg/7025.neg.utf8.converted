There are 2 recipes / preparation methods on the back of the package, so I tried these 2 ways:<br /><br />1. Stir Fry<br /><br />The package suggests olive oil, parsley, peppers, seafood & cheese Italian style. I don't have any olive oil, so I substituted Sesame oil & also cilantro for the parsley & went Asian style. The noodles were hard as rocks. I did pre soak.<br /><br />2. Soup<br /><br />I don't have any soup stock laying around either, so again after the recommended pre soak, I prepared the noodles in an Indian curry with lots of sauce. They were much better this way, but still too tough for my taste.<br /><br />I have eaten similar noodles at Vietnamese restaurants, & I did like them. I am also quite familiar of & approving of Brown Rice Noodles & Whole Wheat Noodles; my problem with these is the texture.<br /><br />It is possible that Olive Oil is REQUIRED; if that is the case, it should have been made more clear on the packaging.<br /><br />If you like your stir fry somewhat cement like, or your soup noodles chewy these are for you. If not....................<br /><br />One last unexpected comment: the uncooked noodles have become my boy kitty's favorite toy of the moment! He found a couple on the floor last night & had a blast stalking & torturing them before eating them!
