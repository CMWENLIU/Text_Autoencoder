This product contains aspartame. This is a toxin with over 90 known side effects. It has caused cancer in rats, though it's very difficult to know if it causes it in humans (because at one point we all consume aspartame and it's still a pretty new product). Aspartame is an alternative to sugar. It's an artificial sweetner. Companies use it instead of sugar so that they can cut down on the calories in a beverage. However, I'd rather have 35 grams of sugar in my system than the kind of agonies that aspartame brings. Don't get me wrong, if you consume it in moderation it's ok, but do NOT consume more than 1-2 packets of this per day. I had no idea the effects of this product until I began consuming it at my only thirst quenching beverage. It all but destroyed my bladder and gave me tons of headaches. Since getting of it, I feel a lot better in both areas. It's a shame, because these packets are incredibly delicious and there's really nothing else on the market that tastes as good.<br /><br />In my experience, I've found that the best alternative is Propel from Gatorade. It's low in calories (10 per bottle) and it only has 6 grams of sugar per 20 ounces. Propel Zero tastes terrible, so avoid it. But regular Propel is fantastic. Not as sweet as Crystal Light, but still good, and much better for you. It uses sucralose for its artificial sweetner, and I trust Gatorade to not go for a bad one (havent heard anything bad about it). Sobe Life water is disgusting, and regular Gatorade has way too much sugar. So if you're looking for something to drink on a regular basis, you can't go very wrong with Propel. Stay away from anything that has aspartame. It's a tough sell, because it really does taste good - but it's just not worth the health risks.
