The cookies were tasty but overly crunchy which took away from the taste. If you are someone who enjoys crunchiness in a cookie...then this is the cookie for you but if you like softer cookies like myself....then better look else where! Also, the ad doesn't really specify that these cookies are not soft. The picture makes it look like you will be receiving soft cookies when in actuality it is not. One good thing about these cookies is that the flavors were great! Chocolate chip, Triple Chocolate and Key Lime.
