This Tea was just plain awful!! I had Hibiscus tea before and It taste nothing like Hibiscus! I do not understand how someone can leave a positive review!!! It taste like unsweetened kool-aid with a plain taste!!! There is no expiration date on the container.It was sent to me in poor packaging, the top lid was damaged.There policy is NO returns on opened containers.  I spent $17 in the trash and thats where the rest of this tea went after tasting it!!
