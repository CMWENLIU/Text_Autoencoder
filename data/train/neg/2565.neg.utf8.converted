Horrible!  When my friend gave me these Chunky Peanut Butter bars to try that she purchased at Whole Foods in California, I thought they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - delicious.  The two boxes I received from Amazon.com were horrible.  Each bar was encrusted in white - looked like mold.  It didn't taste like mold but it was tasteless and gross looking.  Some other reviewers complained about the same thing but I hoped the bars would be more like my initial experience - high protein and delicious.  It is going to be a long time before I enjoy a chocolate covered anything - maybe that is the best thing to come out of having to throw out almost $30 worth of bars.
