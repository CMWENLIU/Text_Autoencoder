We were given these as a gift, and as a chocoholic I ate a few and thought they were good.  However, I woke up a few hours later with an upset stomach and threw up.  I now realize that they are just too rich and the cocoa powder makes them very acidic or bitter, so I can never eat more than one or two now.  No other chocolate or food has done that to me before.
