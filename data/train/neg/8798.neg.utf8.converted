It is too bad that the product is from Bolvia and it says **USDA Organic**. They did not test the product inside the package. First the packages are kind leaking powdery substance and second they stink and tast ROTTEN. I am not kidding DO NOT ORDER this PRODUCT, you will be disappointed. I should of listened to the review that said they threw it all away...
