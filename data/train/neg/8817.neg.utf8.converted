I agree with a previous reviewer that the taste of this is very Crisco-y.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for convenience.  Yes, the Wilton class will mention as many of their products as possible (which is fine, they sponsor the class, but some products are NOT good).  You just have to pick and choose which products are actually beneficial for you...and some you can buy in a different brand but the same basic product.  As for this icing, I plan to make my own once I am done using the one jar for my class.  Actually, you are supposed to make your own batch of icing for the second class session, so maybe it will taste a little better even made with Crisco.  I'm going to switch to REAL buttercream with BUTTER after the class.  You can also use the 40% or 50% off coupons in the paper or online to buy the meringue powder from one of the craft stores, which is a good deal.
