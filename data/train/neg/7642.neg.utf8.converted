I wish I could give this food ZERO stars! It doesn't even deserve 1 star. I switched from wellness core to this food because I read an OLD review and critique of this food BEFORE P&G bought them. No grain, great limited ingredients, no red flag ingredients, all american product. However, since P&G(heartless, money grubbing, animal testing company that has a track record of ruining every quality pet food brand they buy) bought them they must have changed, at the very least, the quality of ingredients. My cat DOES NOT have a sensitive stomach/GI tract and has never had a reaction to any new food Ive given him. Two days after he started eating this his coat started feeling very coarse and he started having the WORST diarrhea and litterbox odor that filled my entire house. I feed him an entire bag of this stuff and instead of gradually getting better, his problems continually got worse. Towards the bottom of the bag it got to the point that his feces was so liquid, it would drip behind him through two rooms of the house! Gross I know, but I think others need to know how bad his problems were before they think of feeding this food to their babies. He is now on Orijen kibble and a frozen raw diet and the problems stopped the day after I switched him off this food. I believe at one time this was a quality food made by a quality company, but this is not the case anymore. Sad, but I think this food is now along the same lines as crud like meow mix and purina.
