This is a ridiculous price for this product.  The only reason I can think that they are charging such a high price is because the latte and cappaccino products were recalled because of a few people getting burned.  I think the sellers who have the product are making people pay these crazy prices, because right now you can't buy them anywhere.  My only solution to this is to buy the Chai Tea Latte and use that with my expresso discs.  For some reason, the Chai Tea is still available.
