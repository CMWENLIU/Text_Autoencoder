Initially we were so happy to find this darkest of the dark roasts. I really enjoyed this coffee every morning for over a year.  However after extended use, I started becoming very irritable in my day, insomnia, ect. After seeing doctors for PMS and everything else, I just got on the web and searched for "caffeine sensitivity".  I learned a little something about coffee from a website,  ineedcoffee dot com.<br /><br />Dark roasts are terribly unhealthy for you! Dark Roasts break down the sugar and oils and burn the coffee bean to a crisp and you are left with ash material. Not many people can tolerate this and will experience unpleasant side effects which lead you to believe your falling apart when really it's an adversion to the dark roasted beans. It only took one cup in the morning to affect my overall health.<br /><br />So as much as I enjoy this super dark roasted coffee, I must make the switch to the light roast.  At least now, I am able to determine if it is a quality coffee bean or not because it is not charcoal.
