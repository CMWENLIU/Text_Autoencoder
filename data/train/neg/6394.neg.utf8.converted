It tastes . . . how to put this . . . gawdawful.  There's very little fruity flavor - it actually tastes more salty than anything else.  They need a little more attention to quality control as well.  On two (make that three - no wait, four) of the twelve cartons, the spout came unglued from the container, making it difficult to open/pour and downright impossible to reseal.<br /><br />Color me singularly unimpressed.  I'm sure glad I didn't pay full price for it.
