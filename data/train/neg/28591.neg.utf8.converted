You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Potassium chloride may be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.<br /><br />In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible.  Like something that is not intended for human consumption.  Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste.  I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!
