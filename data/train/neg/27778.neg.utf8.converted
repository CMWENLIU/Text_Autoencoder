I ordered these thinking I was getting what's pictured here - peanut butter M&M's, not the variety with the whole peanuts.  The item description actually does say peanut (not peanut butter) but I went by the picture.  Food is, of course, not returnable on Amazon if you get the wrong item.<br /><br />I'm quite disappointed, but I'll take them to the office and someone will eat them...
