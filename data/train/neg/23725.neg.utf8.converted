After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you!
