When you first open them up, they look wonderful - like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They smell great too - I was expecting to be in utter heaven when biting in. However, the aftertaste is pretty awful - almost chemically. There's only a very minor peanut flavor about them at all. I don't recommend them.
