Never having tried Community Coffee before, I jumped on the opportunity to purchase some at a discounted price, in addition to S&S. I didn't get a chance to read the reviews before purchasing, "Community Coffee Private Reserve Ground Coffee, Medium-Dark Roast..." It wasn't until I tried this product that I realized, 100% chicory simply isn't COFFEE. The label is misleading as Chicory is a root, and used as a coffee substitute. It's an unfortunate waste of money and I've learned my lesson - read  Amazon reviewers before purchasing, because fellow one star reviewers would have given me a heads up on this fake "coffee".
