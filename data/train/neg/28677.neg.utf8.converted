No flavor here!<br /><br />The main reason why I bought this system was for the Green Mountain flavored coffee. I happen to favor it over all brands at coffee stand. To my big disappointment the flavor is so subdued that you can't even guess which one from the variety pack you are drinking. A big disappointment.
