I saw this in Bevmo when I was wandering around, and I thought it was interesting. How can black water NOT spike someones interest?<br /><br />I went back today to buy a bottle, just to test it out. After letting it sit in the fridge to get nice and cold, I closed my eyes and took a gulp. It was disgusting. It doesn't feel like water, it seems thicker, almost greasy going down. It tastes coppery like you have blood in your mouth. It smells like your hands do after you handle a large amount of change. Sure, it seems healthy and all, but the taste isn't something I'd be able to deal with. It's just gross.<br /><br />To each their own, though. Maybe someone else would like it.
