Reading all the reviews, I was pumped for this product. I love hot sauce and make a lot of very spicy food.  I grow hot peppers and have a fridge door full of different hot sauces.<br /><br />Upon arrival the little eye dropper was intimidating.  I poured some salsa into a bowl and daringly added 3 drops and stirred it in.  I started eating the salsa with chips and I couldn't feel the heat at all.  I added another 5 drops, stirred it in, and then i would only call it 'moderate' heat.  All the reviews had me thinking that just a few drops makes a whole pot of chili spicy.  8 drops in a small bowl of salsa was not very impressive.<br /><br />I guess if this stuff was only $5 - $10, i would have given it a more positive review.  But $35!?  it does add heat without any flavor, but nowhere near what i was expecting. My wife put ate a drop a chip said it was nothing even close to the likes of Dave's Insanity or Da Bomb hot sauce.  she didn't even break a sweat.<br /><br />Save your money.
