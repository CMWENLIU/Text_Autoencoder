The label on-line clearly shows the ingredients as being strictly dates.  But the syrup arrived and the label is completely different.  The item includes SUGAR!! Hello!?!  What is the point of that? Date syrup is supposed to be an alternative to sugar.  I think it is ridiculous Amazon lets this happen.  And because it is a grocery item I cannot return it.  What a waste.
