Why would you use this 15+ ingredient package to make a sauce that only needs three ingredients to make from scratch? Ok, Hollandaise is tricky, but practice makes perfect. Yes, I had a few botched batches, but now I have people requesting that I make my "good hollandaise". Awesome! Knorr has 4 ingredients that are derived from corn. The ingredients in hollandaise are egg yolks, butter, and lemon. Hmm... no corn, no soy, no gum. Seriously, make it yourself!
