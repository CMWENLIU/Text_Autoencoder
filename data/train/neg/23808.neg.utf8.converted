Why in the world would you feed your babies these foods with ingredients like soy and/or soy protein! PLEASE! Look into what you are putting into your childrens' bodies! There is so much information on the internet! Some of these ingredients are so bad for you! Look into soy ANYTHING and you will find out it's not good at all! MSG has sooo many hidden names and SOY LECITHIN is just ONE of them!! Just because it says "Gluten Free" doesn't mean it's ok to eat! Reasearch, research, research! Your children's long term health is at stake here! Use Rice flour for your cookies if you want Gluten free.....
