It took a month for delivery.  The stated time was 2-9 business days.  The delivery was shipped the day AFTER I complained to the company,(Gristedes in New York),...HMMMM.....UPS couldn't figure out how to deliver to a P.O. Box?????(I have had numerous packages go UPS to USPS to P.O. Box) To make matters worst the shipment was short 2 packages of product.  I think next time I will stay on the West Coast for faster delivery and a little extra $$$$. GOOD LUCK if you order from Gristedes Market in New York!!!! (And, remember to stay on top of the order to make sure that you actually get it.....)The ONE positive note was that the product was AWESOME as far as freshness and presentation!!!
