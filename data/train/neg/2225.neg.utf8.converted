The charming picture on the box was reminiscent of the more special momments in your childhood. Unfortunately, the crude sludge contained within was not as enjoyable. With an odor which served only to offend my delicate nasal passages, slightly akin to that of burning vaseline. The taste was generally harsh, and burned my palate. A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink. Avoid.<br /><br /> -My cat on the other hand loves the stuff.
