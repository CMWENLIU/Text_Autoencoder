I received this chocolate yesterday, from the clear plastic box, you can tell there are green/white mold coming out of the chocolate. It is so gross. I am so glad i didn't send this as a gift to my friends and family. I will return this immediately. This makes me question the credibility of this seller. Buyers should watch out. And plus you can get the same exact box of chocolate in Walgreen this week for only $7.99. I think this seller are way overpriced.
