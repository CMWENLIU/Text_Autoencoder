This new "Packaging" is more expensive than the last plus it's smaller - 23.2 oz vs. the 25 in the old packaging.  Granted it's nice not having to fish around for the scooper, but there's no reason to increase pricing on this.  Target had the 25 oz for $19.99 at one point (maybe try to clear old packaging for new) - now it's at $21.05 still cheaper than what I've seen online - even for amazon- so far...
