Let the buyer beware! These are not individually wrapped tea bags which are what led me to fall in love with Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey. What you will receive are six boxes of 50 tea bags that are produced with inferior bags. The characteristic aroma of bergamot was clearly lacking when I opened the box. Nevertheless, I tried steeping a bag using a smaller cup than usual. Even after a full steep (five minutes), this tea had absolutely no flavour. And, as this is a non-returnable item, I am out $40.00 (including the 1-day shipping). I'm chucking the whole lot into the bin. It is undrinkable. The price is attractive, but I'll be ordering my tea directly from the Harrogate folks from now on. If you can find the individually wrapped tea bags, buy them as the quality of the bag will prove to be superior, as are the flavour and aroma. Guess there's a reason why they don't show the bag in the description!
