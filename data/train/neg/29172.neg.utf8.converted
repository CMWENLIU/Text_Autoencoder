I'm not sure what happened, but my box of "54 k-cups" only had 52 cups in it.  There was no packaging inside the box to hold the k-cups in place and protect them, they were just laying in the box loosely.  Some of the cups in the box were also damaged, probably due to the lack of packaging in the box.  This is not the quality anyone would expect from companies such as Keurig and Starbucks!  I suspect the box has been opened previously.  I do not know what happened on the sellers end, but what they sent out was not an original new package of keurig k-cups!  The cups seem to be authentic, but it is hard to tell since the packaging was not up to par and even though the box was sealed, it is looks like the box has been opened previously.  The product I received was sold by "BECCO CORP" through amazon.
