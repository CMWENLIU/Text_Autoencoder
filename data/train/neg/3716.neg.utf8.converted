If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they "roast" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that "all cacao nibs have to be roasted..."  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products.
