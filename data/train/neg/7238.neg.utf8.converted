A prior reviewer stated "you won't be able to eat just one". I think they meant "you'll barely be able to eat them"<br /><br />I'm a curry lover and purchased the curry flavor from a local store. It is really hard to describe these, but they truly are quite unpleasant. Nobody in the house will eat them. They are rock hard, and I can only imagine that a handful of bird seed with some curry powder would taste the same. Given the price difference between bird seed and these, I know which I would purchase if I wanted a similar experience in the future.
