Not a big fan of this coloring, first off the yellow color looked like it had crap floating in it, and no matter how much i shook the bottle it never fully incorporated. The colors themselves were not good as well, when mixing it into icing the only color that really looked good was yellow, the blue almost had a denim hue to it and the red looked like something on the floor after an autopsy. all in all i was not impressed.
