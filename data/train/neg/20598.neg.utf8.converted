I have used MJB Colombian Coffee for years. We used to get it from the commisary, until they stopped supplying it about 5 years ago.  So, we ordered it directly from Massimo Zannetti, the company that bought MJB.  First, they reduced the amount of coffee from almost 2 lbs. down to 1 lb. 7 oz.  Also, the flavor changed.  It doesn't have the rich aroma that is signature to MJB Colombian.  The taste left a lot to be desired, and it takes almost TWICE the amount of coffee to make a decent cup.
