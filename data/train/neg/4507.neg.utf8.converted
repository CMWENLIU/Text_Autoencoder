Purchased these noodles when our family was put on a gluten free diet.  Thankful to find a alternative to wheat noodles I can not express my great disapointment.  The noodles became mushy and break down very badly.  While cooking a package for dinner I carefully watched and stirred the noodles as they shrunk in my pan.  In fear that there would not be enough noodles from this one package to feed my famiy of 4 (both of my children a small and do not eat large portions)  I put on a second pot and started cooking an additional bag of pasta.  By the time they were cooked and serve My husband and two chilren received a 1/4 cup of noodles and I received none.  They were gone it was like they shrank.  Not only were there not enough noodles, they were mushy.  I actually took every bag I had left in the pantry and returned them to the store, I have found the Tinkayana brand to be a much better pasta for the gluten free families.
