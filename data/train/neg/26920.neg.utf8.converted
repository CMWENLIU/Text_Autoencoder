I seem to have develop a new roach problem recently, so got this based on the "fantastic" reviews and price.  It seems to have only caught small bugs like silver fish or 1/4 inch spiders.  One day i saw a spider crawling around; i put the box in front of it and it didnt go in at first and turned around.  Then i moved the box again in its path and it ran right through it!  So much for a trap... its more like a walk in a park with some sticky puddle of goob for these critters.<br /><br />I had good luck with using Roach Motel a long time ago.  Will try it again.
