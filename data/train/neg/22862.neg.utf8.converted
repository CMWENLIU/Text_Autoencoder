I bought several different brands of the Chai concentrate from Amazon, as there are few options in my rural area's grocery stores.<br /><br />The Tazo Organic Chai is my favorite.  It most closely matches that served by Starbucks.  Only difference is it doesn't have the foam.  I've been told it is what they use.<br /><br />Tazo decaf is my second choice.  Strangely, it is not as good as the Tazo Organic Chai... not as spicy, but OK for drinking in the evening.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Original is not as good in my opinion as the Tazo.  It is missing something.  Not enough cardamon or pepper or something.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Sugar-free was very disappointing.  I was hoping there was a good sugar-free option out there as I'd like to avoid the daily calories from my Chai habit.  It just takes like plain tea with mil in my opinion.  It seems to mostly lack the complex, spicy flavor or the Tazo Chai.  Not sure why that is.  The sweetener should have no bearing on the other ingredients.  I have been unable to find any suitable concentrated, sugar-free Chai tea options.  Post if you find one.
