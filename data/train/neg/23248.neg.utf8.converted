The lemon juice packets that arrived are not the same as pictured. They are from a different (inferior?) manufacturer. Note that the item title does not say ReaLemon, even though the product specification does. Also, several of the packets leaked during shipping, creating a sticky mess. I would not buy this item again in the future.
