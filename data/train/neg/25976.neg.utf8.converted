......you don't get the stated amount.<br />In each box I have from the pack of 6, there wasn't 20 bags in any of them, best case 19, sometimes 18.<br />Also, in each box, there was at least 1 bag that wasn't properly sealed, and leaked it's contents all over, thereby reducing the effective count 1 or 2 per box.<br />You get roughly 16-18 good bags per box.<br />The secret for good iced tea from these bags is to fill a clean quart mason jar with water from a filtered pitcher like the brita pitcher, put the full mason jar (No lid, duh.) in the microwave until it boils, then drop in 2 or 3 bags. Leave it in the microwave, so nobody gets burned. Once the water cools enough for you to be able to touch the jar, screw on the top, and leave it on the counter, upside down. Leave the bags and all in the jar.<br />Once it's room temp, put it directly in the fridge. Leave the bags in the jar.<br />Put a thick glass tumbler in the freezer.<br />Leave it overnight.<br />When you're thirsty the next day, get the thick tumbler out of the freezer, fill it with ice, and fill it with the tea from the jar. Now take the bags out and throw them away.<br />Ahhhh....<br />This is good tea, but it needs to be steeped overnight for best taste, and you don't get 20 bags in the box. Don't say I didn't warn you.
