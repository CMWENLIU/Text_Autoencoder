I haven't opened the seal on these jars of turmeric just now received, but before I ordered I enlarged the size of the picture so I could see the weight.  The picture shows 10 oz.  With that in mind, I ordered 3 bottles to get the free shipping.  What I got were 3  8 ounce  jars.  I'm feeling cheated right now, especially because the company went out of its way to plaster over the "NET WT 8 OZ"  with a tracking sticker.  No need to disguise the label if there wasn't something to hide!<br /><br />Of course shoppers want to know the weight!!  They don't need a lame description of "Large Jar".  It's not a large bottle but half the size of what I usually buy my spices in.<br /><br />So, Marshalls Creek....you owe money to all those you are cheating.  Don't moan and groan that the picture was not intended to show the weight.  It showed the weight quite clearly, leading people to believe they would get a 10-oz jar.
