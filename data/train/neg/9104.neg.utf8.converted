Yogourmet Kefir Starter is not really very good.  It produces a cultured dairy product, but not really kefir.  I tried making six  different batches cultured at different temperatures for either 12, 24, and 36 hours.  It produces an odd tasting culture that is like a thin and runny mixture of buttermilk and yogurt.  While I like both kefir and yogurt, I did not find the taste very pleasant.  I tried it plain, sweetened, and mixed with fruit preserves. My dog, who loves yogurt, sniffed it several times before tasting it, but eventually ate it and seemed to like it fine.<br /><br />This starter will not produce a culture that will grow a colony of "Kefir Grains".  The good news is that I did not have to waste the milk that I cultured with the product, I used the milk culture in place of buttermilk for making biscuits, cornbread, and pancakes. They all tasted great - maybe better than when made with buttermilk.<br /><br />Yogourmet's kefir starter got the best review of the commercial brand I could find, so I gave it a try, since it was also the most reasonably priced.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be many commercial kefir starters that are the real thing.  If it will really make kefir, it is probably called "kefir grains" rather than "kefir starter".  It should also look like bits of cauliflower rather than baker's yeast.
