If your kids like bland pasty mac and cheese, they might like this.  I bought a case and donated the other 11 boxes to the hungry college students down the street.  I looked up the company on the web to complain, and while searching for the name found out that they are part of Kraft.  No wonder.<br /><br />These guys do make cookies however that taste pretty good.  The mac was just not for me.
