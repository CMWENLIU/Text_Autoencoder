I use to have a glass of tasty Ovaline, Chocolate Malt just about every day. NO MORE. The new formula is bitter, has more calories, doesn't dissolve well, isn't chocolatey or malty enough. I'm so disappointed. And even worse, when I wrote them, all they said to my email was "acknowledged!" Meaning they there's not even a person reading our complaints. This is why I'm going public and encouraging all fellow Ovaltine lovers to write reviews and return their purchases - hopefully that will get their attention!
