I had tried the Columbian Dark by the same roaster and it was acceptable (Not Great).  Thought this might be better after reading all the positive reviews.  IT IS NOT!  It's almost undrinkable. Bitter/acrid aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after drinking, and an acid stomach to go with it. I suspect this roast appeals to those who like Charbucks coffee which is almost invariably burned and harsh on the palette.<br /><br />I do like the organic aspect, but in this case that is not nearly enough to redeem this lousy coffee. I am going to give this company one more try and order the Sumatran dark. Keeping my fingers crossed. I've learned not to trust the Amazon coffee reviews very much, but I suspect I'm a lot more finicky with coffee than the average reviewer.
