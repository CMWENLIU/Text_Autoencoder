This is truly some nasty salmon.  The taste and mouth feel are awful.  I love fish prepared in a variety of ways - but not mashed up with some yucky seasoning and put in a can.  I have served more appealing cat food (to cats of course).  The trail mix was mostly dried bananas.  The dried soy beans were flavorless.  The chocolate was ordinary.  The crackers were just OK as well.  All in all, a very disappointing box of food and certainly no picnic.
