I love tea.  I was so excited to try this, because of health benefits, as well as the supposedly delicious taste.  I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents.  The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what.  But, I was wrong.  To my taste, this tea is awful.  It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice.  After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted.  I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift.
