I must admit, when it said "Grafted Citrus Tree" I was expecting more than a stick with a few leaves and roots.  I'm sure it will grow, but a picture of what I was actually going to get would have been nice - so, I posted one so everyone is aware that it will be a while (maybe years) before they can actually use this as a source of kaffir lime leaves for cooking.
