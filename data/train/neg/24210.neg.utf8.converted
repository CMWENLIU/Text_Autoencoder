I have tried a number of gyokuros and this one is way to overpriced for what you get. H&S has good gyokuro as do others here in Japan that sell directly from their farms.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern. The company simply does not seem to appreciate its customers and apparently many people feel the same way. I will no longer buy from them due to their poor service and overpriced products.
