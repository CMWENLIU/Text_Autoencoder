I was so excited when I found Whole Wheat Israeli Couscous on Amazon.  Normally, I buy the regular Israeli Couscous from Trader Joe's, but only made it infrequently because I don't like to eat white wheat.  I purchased this and made it the exact way I have always made it.<br />But as soon as I opened up the container, I noticed a really funny smell.  Almost like stale crackers.  I assumed it was because I wasn't used to the Whole Wheat kind, so I went ahead and cooked it.<br />It still had this odd taste and smell.  I don't believe it was because it was Whole Wheat because we only eat Whole Wheat pasta, bread and brown rice.<br />My husband thought it was "OK" and was willing to eat more, but I thought it was inedible and returned it.  I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to like it.  If it was a stale batch, its too bad because its too expensive to risk buying another container.<br />The only product I've ever bought from Amazon that I've beeen really disappointed with.  Maybe because my expectations were so high?
