I truly hate to 'down' a product, as we all have our preferences.  However if you've never used stevia before and you buy this one, you may be disappointed.  Sweetleaf brand is the ultimate and you aren't spending more money since it has much richer taste and takes far less...  I keep this bottle I bought in my purse for restaurant uses and it is nice for that purpose since it is light weight and perfect size for purse.  It closes firmly as well.  So it does have it's advantages.
