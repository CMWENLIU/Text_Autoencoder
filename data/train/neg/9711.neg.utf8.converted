I hate to rag on something when it should have been "my responsibility" to check whether I'm being screwed.<br />The product should be simply called "Gluten Free Flour", without any mention of almond, for it contains, if any, only trace amounts of it (I didn't even open the bag, as is the last item on the ingredient list.)<br />To make matters worse Amazon doesn't allow for returns on food items, which is understandable; I don't fault them for that. But the clear mislabeling of the product should be, in my opinion, Amazon's responsibility.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for Almond Flour THIS IS NOT.
