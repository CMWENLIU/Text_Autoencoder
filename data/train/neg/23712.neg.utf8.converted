Contrary to one of the reviews, these Smokehouse Duck Chips are labeled "Product of China". There are many excellent products available that are made in the USA that I prefer to feed to my dogs such as Newman's Own, Zukes and Platos brands. The package also says "Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling." That does not sound like something I want to feed to MY dogs. These are going back!
