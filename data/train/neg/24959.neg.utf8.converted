The only people who seem to like this are people who already have no problem and taste aversion to other artificial sweeteners. I bought this because I wanted to lay off the sugar, hoping since it was semi-"natural" it wouldn't taste as horrible as Splenda or anything else like that. Sadly this tastes like any other artificial sweetener. I can't describe it well but it reminds me of very bitter powdered sugar with a really bad aftertaste. It does not taste like regular sugar to me. I am really sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners and I can't even stomach diet pop. So if you're like me, don't buy this.
