My wife and I ordered these for our 1 year old to snack on. We are not "it has to be organic people" but we do like items grown in the U.S. so we can be somewhat assured that there are some controls on the food. We purchased these because the product description clear states PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES. Well, that is not the case. On the packaging it states (Product of the USA, Chile, South America and Mexico). Apparently Chile isn't part or South America and South America is its own country...<br />I will not be buying from this producer any more......
