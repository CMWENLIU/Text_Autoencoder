I ordered this product for my 6-year-old who has allergy to wheat. The order was placed on Jan 31. I received eight boxes of cookies with expiration date in early April 08. I do not expect my son to eat up 8 boxes of cookies in less than three month!  The cookies do taste OLD and STALE. My son refuse to eat them. It was a total waste. The good part about the cookies is that they are not too sweet. I really wish Amazon could post and update expiration date information on the web.
