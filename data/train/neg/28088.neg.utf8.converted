These were on discount so I figured why not try them being that my dog's mouth smells like his other end if you know what I mean. After two days of giving him 1 chew a day, he started vomitting everywhere. It has to be these chews as we haven't given him anything else new lately and he rarely ever vomits. I think I will be sticking with greenies from now on.
