These cookies have virtually no flavor.  You know the saying, they "taste like cardboard"  Sadly there is no potential for chocolate bliss.  The outside of the cookies are a pale shade of brown almost grey.  Inside they are darker.  I don't know why that is.  They are a crunchy cookie (but not hard) with chocolate chips that are large in comparison to the size of the cookie.  The cookies themselves are bite sized.<br /><br />Out of all the Newman's Own Family Recipe cookies that I have tried my favorite to date is their Ginger Snaps.  They have heat & a pleasant bite to them plus bits of chewy ginger.  In second place is their Orange Chocolate Chip cookies.  These smell so wonderful & the orange flavor stands out.  Last we have this sorry lot.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars because 2 stars means "I don't like" them.  So while I don't actually hate them, I don't want to eat them again.
