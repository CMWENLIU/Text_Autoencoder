I bought this ginger for my wife thinking it was probably made in Australia or in U.S.A. because the only factories listed in Ginger People's web site were in either Australia or California.  Therefore we were quite disappointed when we found out that it was made in China.  We could probably have bought it cheaper in the local Chinese grocery store.  We tried it and it was both very gingery and sugary.  All you could taste was a full month of sugar and it was so HOT.  The ginger also came in small cubes and they should call it candied ginger.  Some were quite tough.  In short, I was not very impressed with this product.  We could probably purchase better products in the local Whole Food.  We were also skeptical with it being Organic since it was made in China where the standard for "organic' can be substantially different that that of the States.
