I bought this as a add on gift just something small to go along with other items I bought.  I did read other reviews and was still surprised at how small it was. I was really disappointed once it was opened to find a very small amount of candy and chocolate inside of the boxes and most of the space is taken up by filler and I didn't receive the chocolates pictured in the photo.  I would not buy again or as a signle small gift to give to someone, presentation looks great but very disappointing on whats really inside.  The quality of the candy is good but it's very over priced for what it really is.
