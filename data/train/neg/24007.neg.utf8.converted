This is just an FYI for those who may want to know--I looked up the ingredients for Big Franks and found that they contain Propylene Glycol. Please don't jump on me for posting this--I am simply passing this info on in case anyone else may want to know or even cares.  I do like the taste of these and was already to order a case but decided to look up their ingredients and this is what I found:<br />Ingredients: Franks: Textured vegetable protein (wheat gluten, soy protein concentrate, water), corn oil, water, torula yeast. Contains 2% or less of defatted wheat germ, defatted soy flour, dried onion, mono- and diglycerides from soybean oil, salt, hydrolyzed soy protein, garlic powder, autolyzed yeast extract, hydrolyzed corn protein, soy lecithin, caramel color, natural smoke flavor, L-lysine monohydrochloride, spices, concentrated onion juice, vegetarian natural flavors, vitamins (niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B12), propylene glycol, red #3 for color. Brine: Water, salt.
