My husband went to the store for me and purchased this soup, not noticing it had a different label from regular Campbell's Chunky Chicken Corn Chowder. It was absolutely TERRIBLE. It was runny, very few vegetables and almost no chicken. The base was flavorless if anything. Like the other reviewer, I didn't finish it either. It was beyond bland, and I don't see how they can call it chunky when there was such a lack of anything to it plus the base was thin as water.<br />My favorite comfort food is the REGULAR Campbell's Chunky Corn Chowder. That one has a thicker more flavorful base and is full of chunks of vegetables and chicken.<br />This "healthy choice" version was as if they had taken the regular version and added 2 cans of water.
