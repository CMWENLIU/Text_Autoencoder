The reviewer who said "It is probably a half way decent choice for an snack" is, respectfully, wrong. This stuff is FULL of junk! What's "decent" about it? That it doesn't have rat poison?<br /><br />Too many ingredients to list fully, but a quick review: A ton of corn syrup and other sugars, plus terrible oils. It could be a list of what to avoid from a health conscious book. Want to know what to avoid eating? Look at the ingredients on these things!<br /><br />That being said, if you are not health conscious and don't mind a snack once in a while that is full of unhealthy stuff, it taste pretty good. Although another downside is, like another reviewer said, it is messy. You can't just grab it and eat it on the go - you will need a cloth, if not water, to clean up the mess on your hands!
