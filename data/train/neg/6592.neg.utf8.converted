I agree with all of the reviews here (except for the one that gave PB's two stars; should have been one star, like the rest of them).  I tried to give it zero stars, but it wouldn't work.<br /><br />I have been making Potato Buds for many years.  It has been my favorite brand and I have tried many.  I made my own slight changes to the instructions on the box to suit my taste and got accustomed to making them the same way every time.<br /><br />But ever since Betty Crocker changed the formula, there is no way I can make these taste good.  They used to be tasty real flakes of dehydrated potato, now it's more like a bland powder.<br /><br />I just came today to Amazon to try and find the old formula and didn't realize until now that so many feel the same way I do about the present formula.<br /><br />I have no idea why they changed it and I can't believe they are blaming the consumers for the bad taste.<br /><br />These are horrible and I am going to be another of the many who are going to find another brand.<br /><br />Maybe if enough people abandon buying these, BC will get the message and change them back to the way they were before, but I'm not holding my breath.  But I did have to hold my nose while eating these.
