These hooves are not trimmed as shown in the picture. I even talked with a local customer service rep (of the manufacturing company) before purchasing. They have long, thin edges that break off in pieces in my dogs mouth. (I have an aussie sheep dog with a little border collie mixed in.) I don't consider this a safe or quality product and would not buy it again. You are paying for a whole lot of material that should have been trimmed off and smoothed down as indicated in the picture. I would like to find the brand that (apparently) has been discontinued. It had a red and blue label,was made in the US, and was properly trimmed. They were about 10 in a bag for under ten in the local pet store.
