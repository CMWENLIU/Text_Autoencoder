The blend of this mocha java harrar has completely changed since 2007.  For Years I have drunk this blend from coffee masters, ordering usually 8 x 12oz packages at a time .  It was high in complex flavors, mellow, soft, mouth coating, low acid, with a faint background of chocolate, and low in bitterness, wonderful after taste -- Outstanding in anyone's book.<br /><br />The previous 8 packages (somewhat stale- from age?) and the most recent 4 packages I received are a completely different coffee!!!!!<br /><br />Very little flavor -single flavored/no complexity, medium to high bitterness, bright-not mellow, tinny and high acid - like columbian blends!!<br /><br />AND the cost is up 30%-50%.  Coffee Masters should apologize to coffee drinkers and explain why they would sell a different blend under the same name.
