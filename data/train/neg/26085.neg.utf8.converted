<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6GAMK">McKay's Chicken Style Instant Broth & Seasoning, Vegan, 12 oz</a><br /><br />This product states that it is "a complete vegan product"; however, the 3rd ingredient on the label is "lactose (milk)" and the 4th ingredient is "whey (milk)". Animal products are not vegan! It shouldn't be a hit for a vegan broth search on Amazon, either. I am sending this one back!
