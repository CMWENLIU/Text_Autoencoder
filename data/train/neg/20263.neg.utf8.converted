I ordered 3 6 packs and only received 14. Complete waste. Since it's a reseller, amazon was only able to provide an email address for them. I would've bought and sent them myself, but thought it'd be better to use a vendor to insure they'd be well packed etc. Would never order from this vendor unless you want to receive only a portion of what you ordered.
