I find the Earnest Bars to be far too sweet, especially this bar that has so many raisins in it.  I can taste the almonds, but the sweetness is overwhelming.  I got them cheap but will not be buying them again.  If you can find them in a store, you may want to consider trying one and see if you like it rather than getting a box of 12.
