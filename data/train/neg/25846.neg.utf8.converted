Science Diet, like Walmart brand Ol Roy dog food is made up primarily of corn and other known dog allergens. My last dog had so many health problems and allergies as a result of being fed nothing but SD. Now I'm better informed on dog nutrition and only buy 4 or 5 star foods according to dogfoodadvisor.com and practice the rotation diet. Never again will I subject a dog to overpriced, crappy food when you can get the good stuff for the same price or less. Even if you have to pay more for better food it works out cheaper because they'll have fewer health problems.
