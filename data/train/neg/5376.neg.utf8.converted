Dark roast is its own league...the amino profiles of the beans change considerably.  But with that said, I've had high altitude dark roasts that were much better.  In fact, this coffee STINKS when you open the bag and sniff the beans.  I ground it coarsely and used a french press...poured in about 20 seconds...and guess what...it still doesn't smell good.  Drinking it black, it's smooth, not bitter, but flat on the palette.  I don't understand all the rave reviews...this coffee sucks.  I'd rather drink pre-ground maxwell house that's been sitting around for 30 minutes (yuck).  Maybe you can cook with it (in caramel since its not bitter, maybe) but I wouldn't bother drinking it...it sucks.  There is considerable crema and oil...but the taste is flat.  I also ordered Lavazza (Tierra) for moka "espresso" but it brews up better than almost every other bean I've tried.  Also Cameron's Organic "toasted southern pecan" coffee really surprised me (I don't like flavored coffees)...I love it.  Save your $$ and avoid these beans...get a brazilian dark roast instead...
