If you're really gung ho on feeding this to your cat, you might want to pull up a litter box while they eat. Otherwise you could find yourself cleaning diarrhea out of your living room rug.<br /><br />I originally bought three cans of Merrick cat food. The first smelled spoiled and neither of my cats would eat it. The second was fine, though they didn't like the chunks and would just lick up the gravy. And the third one made one of them (and then me!) sick.<br /><br />One for three is an awful average, and I won't be buying this brand again. I'll stick with Wellness and Eagle Pack instead, thanks.
