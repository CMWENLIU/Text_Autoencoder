These are one of the new "light" soups Campbell has created. I wanted something with a little less salt, so I chose the Chicken with Egg Noodles. I shared this soup with a friend of mine. We both agreed that the chicken broth was horrible. Salt wasn't the problem, there was a particular herb flavor that just didn't belong in the soup. Everything else was fine. The egg noodles were still firm. The chicken were in big chunks though there just weren't that many. The veggies were good too, the celery and carrots were not mushy at all. However, I simply cannot recommend anyone purchasing this because of the horrible broth and the lack of chicken and veggies. It's mostly water in a can.
