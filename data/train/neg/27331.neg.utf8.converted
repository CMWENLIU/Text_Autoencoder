These bars are dense, chewy, and dry. I didn't find them as horrible as other reviewers, but it seems like a lot of them are negative because it USED to be a great product. What infuriates me is the size of the product, which is NOTHING LIKE the picture on the package, and barely half the size of the individual wrapper! I wouldn't even call it a bar, it's only slightly rectangular, more like a small thumbnail-shaped chunk. Definitely check out the video that one reviewer posted to show the actual size. I certainly won't buy these again, and it makes me want to boycott the company, even if they make other, better-tasting GF products.
