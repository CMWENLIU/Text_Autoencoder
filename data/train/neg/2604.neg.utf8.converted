I ordered 2 cases of Campbell's soup.  They were obviously packed by an incompetent employee - who just put the tray of cans in the bottom of a much larger box and threw a couple of pieces of bubble wrap on top.  Both cartons arrived with no external damage, but the heavy cans had shifted around, in one carton 3 were open, with soup spilled around.  In both boxes, several cans were dented.  This was not the shipping carrier's fault - this was just incredibly poor packing.  I sent a photo and described the damage in the packaging review that was available right after purchase.  Amazon did not bother to even acknowledge that.  Beware of ordering any canned products from Amazon, I certainly will not do it again.
