The idea of going organic with these types of products makes me feel somewhat better about grabbing it for a quick fix meal solution. Cooking, it's just as easy as any other name brand on the market, and I refer to the stovetop method. A small sucepan full of water, 5-8 minutes of boiling the pasta, mix up the sauce accordng to directions and walla, instant, easy meal that's great in a bowl at your computer or in front of the tube with your favorite movie.<br /><br />The first bite was decent, the sauce doesn't have too powdery a texture and the pasta's your average, ordinary shells. Cooked al dente, they have a nice texture your teeth can really sink into. But after about half my portion, the taste gets more and more bitter (yes, my milk was still good). It's got all the appearance of any normal mac and white cheddar cheese product, but the taste on this one is sorely lacking. I've never encountered a product like this that I didn't care for, so I just went with the directions and tried it traditional style. Maybe it would be better "dressed up" somehow, but considering that there are better tasting products (prepared per directions with no dressing up) like this, I'd be more likely to dress up one of those. If you're interested in trying out similar products, consider Kraft's Organic White Cheddar shells or Back to Nature's White Cheddar and Spirals.
