I like black pepper. When I cook, I grind my own and use as much as is called for by the recipe. On those recipes that I consider "keepers" and decide to tweak, one of the most freqent changes I make is to add more pepper. I tell you all this so you will understand that I'm not a Casper Milquetoast who can't tolerate anything spicier than corn flakes. I am fond of spicy foods, and when I order them in restaurants I do NOT tell the waiter, "Mild, please".<br /><br />The idea of putting pepper on nuts is, I think, a good one and could work well. But there is just too much pepper in these. And not a little too much, a LOT too much.<br /><br />The nuts themselves seem fine. Nice and fresh with good texture. I think the amount of salt is good, but that's difficult to determine with taste buds overwhelmed by pepper.<br /><br />If Emerald would use a quarter to a half as much pepper, I think this could be a winner.
