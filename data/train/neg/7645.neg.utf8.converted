I purchased this product because I usually buy Horizon Organic lowfat milk for my children's lunch boxes and wanted to try a lower fat product.  The Organic Valley had good reviews and said that it was less sweet and it is 1% milkfat vs. 2% in the Horizon.  I purchased 2 cases and tried a couple of the milk boxes from each case ( I always try a product before giving it to my children).  The milk had such an off chemical taste, it was disgusting.  I had 4 of my children each take a sip to see if it was my taste buds and they all agreed with me.  I will never buy this product again and will stick with Horizon Organic milk products.  I am giving this product 1 star only because I have to rate it, I don't think it even deserves 1 star.
