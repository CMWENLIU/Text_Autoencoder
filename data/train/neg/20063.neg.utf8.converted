This is not a review on the quality of the coffee but on the Amazon product selection process. I was specifically searching for Keurig cups and so stated in my query. This product was included on the Keurig cup list. When I received my product I discovered pods rather than cups. I should have read the discription more closely but didn't since I was expecting only Keurig cups. The Amazon search process should exclude products that don't meet the query parameters. Otherwise it is buyer beware! I will use that pods but it is not the convience of the cups.
