Kellogg's Special K Fruit & Yogurt Cereal, 17.5 oz<br />Although the box shows red and blue berries, this "variety does NOT contain berries.<br /><br />Instead there as tiny snippets of red apples that could appear to the eye to be tiny specks of "berries".<br />The product label does not list any fruit other than apples, and LOADS of sugar -honey,malt etc etc<br /><br />To top of their gotcha, Kellog has reduced the size of the box by 5 ounces, from 18 to 17.6 oz.<br /><br />While introducing this Fruit variety some 2 weeks ago, the strawberry special K variety was "temporarily " unavailable . It is now again marketed - as Special K with berries -  strawberries just like the original , but  with size reduced to 16.7 oz.<br /><br />Instead of offering a reliable and consistent product, Kellog seems to have resorted to introducing ever increasing variations, each one more sugary-sticky  than the other, each one cut by a few ounces. Confusing the consumer with name brand loyalty. Or shall we call this marketing approach "fooling"?<br /><br />TRUST BUT VERIFY
