I bought these because I wanted an energy/meal bar that tasted good. I love malt flavor so I was really excited to try these. There's a very light hint of chocolate/malt flavor but if it wasn't written on the package, I wouldn't have thought it tasted like malt at all. Basically, if you really like malt, this doesn't taste like it. The only upside is that it's a little larger than most energy bars and it's filling but the taste is pretty bland. The search continues! I think I'm going to try a oat and fruit bar next.
