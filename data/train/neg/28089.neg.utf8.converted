Raccoons have been raiding our bird feeders and I purchased this product for a humane way to drive them away.  I sprayed the product liberally around the perimeter of the deck where the feeders hang on metal poles mounted to the deck railing.  This did not deter the raccoon in the slightest.<br /><br />The bottle cautions against spraying directly on wood as it might discolor it, but I went ahead and not just sprayed but DRENCHED the areas of the deck and railing where I knew the raccoons were entering and exiting.  I sprayed the product particularly heavily at the base of the pole holding the feeders since that is where the coon has to stand to reach up into the feeder.  The raccoon sat right in the middle of the area I'd sprayed and didn't appear to be bothered by it at all.<br /><br />Perhaps this product might stop raccoons from eating something it had been sprayed on.  Maybe.  Can't say since that is not the purpose I was using it for.  The product did not live up to it's claim of repelling the raccoons from the treated area and I will be returning the remainder of this bottle for a refund.<br /><br />I'm giving it 1 star only because zero was not an option.
