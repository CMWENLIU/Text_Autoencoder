The traditional spearmint Altoids were excellent. The "new" flavor does not use oil of spearmint, having substituted artificial flavors instead. Bring back the oil of spearmint! Otherwise I will not be buying your mints again. I only liked the spearmint, and you have ruined it. Doubtless this is a money-inspired move. Shame on you.
