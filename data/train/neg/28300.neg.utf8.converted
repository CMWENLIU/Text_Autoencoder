This has been my favorite cold cereal for several years now, and it was by far the best oat flake cereal that I was able to find. It contains no wheat, an ingredient that is difficult to avoid in cereal. The old formula had a fresh, clean taste, with a sweetness that was not overpowering. About a week ago, I found that my local Whole Foods was stocking the cereal in a newly decorated box. (More of a white color, rather than the previous yellowish box) The altered product is so disappointing that I will not be purchasing the cereal on a regular basis any longer. There is now a taste of cardboard in the flavor, and the sweetness is cloying and artificial. The new composition is also more soggy with milk. It is disappointing in just about every way. I can't imagine what the manufacturer was thinking, and I wish they hadn't messed with a good thing.
