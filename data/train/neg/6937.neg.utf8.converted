The overall flavor was not bad, but certainly could have had a little more vanilla, I think.  The texture was dry and grainy.  Will not buy again.  I do have to say thank you to B.C. for making the effort.  We need more companies willing to experiment with gf REASONABLY PRICED products.  It's like starting to eat gf.  It takes some getting used to and a lot of practice.<br /><br />Please continue your efforts.  I would love to be able to try an improved version as it would be nice to not have to pay 10.00 for a decent cake mix at the health food store -- which is, incidentally, nothealthy for my wallet.
