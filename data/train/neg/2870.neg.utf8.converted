... nasty.  I may not be the best connoisseur of olives in the world, but I definitely buy my fair share, as Amazon can tell you.  I practically live on olives.  These, however, are soft to the point of slimy mush and just not tasty at all (like any slimy mush would have "taste").  I should have called Amazon and complained, but instead, I just cancelled my "Subscribe and Save" subscription.<br /><br />Nice jar, though.  The best olives I've had to date from Amazon are the Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag.  Now those are fantastic, but they do come in a bag.  So now I have a great storage jar to keep REAL olives!<br /><br />P.S.  In case you're missing my point, do NOT buy these olives unless you have a person in your life you REALLY don't like and want to give them a "gift" they're not likely to forget!  :>)
