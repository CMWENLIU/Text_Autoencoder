I was curious and tried this item on Jan 28th.  I bought 2 bottles of the lemon-lime.  The taste is very bad---need to flush it down with a glass of water.  Within about 30 minutes I began feeling very uneasy---sort of had the jitters----didn't have a lot of energy but was very nervous and just could not sit down.  I was afraid it was effecting my heart rate or blood pressure but I checked and both those remained normal even though I felt very uneasy.<br />I tried it a day later with the second bottle---same results.  Very uncomfortable feeling---I will not use it anymore
