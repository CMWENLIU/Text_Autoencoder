We have a large mixed-breed dog who loves to chew. Her ability to demolish toys is almost comical, so we are always looking for a way to entertain/occupy her that isn't going to drive us into bankruptcy.<br /><br />She loves her Kong, but I hate cleaning it after it has had peanut butter in it. So, when I saw these I thought they would be a perfect solution! Something she would have to put a little work into that wouldn't result in a big mess to clean up afterward.<br /><br />I was right...sort of. She loves them. They only keep her occupied for about 10 minutes but that's more than can be said for most of her toys. However, about an hour after she has one she gets the worst gas she has ever had. I'm not talking the occasional smelly fart. Last night I went upstairs and thought something had died in my bedroom because the smell was so terrible. It took me 15 minutes to realize the smell was coming from the dog and wasn't going away. I can only imagine the discomfort she must be in to be producing that much gas.<br /><br />Unfortunately as much as our dog enjoys them, I'm fairly certain they don't like her and I don't think I can handle the resulting gas storm.
