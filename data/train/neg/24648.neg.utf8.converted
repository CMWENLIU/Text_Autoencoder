I ordered this stuff on Aug 6 and it was shipped to me this morning Aug 11. And when i opened the box. it's said it's expired on AUG 11.<br /><br />Then i think about the cost 45 cents per pack? at least it's cheaper than my company snack bar (50 cents per pack)...dang!!!<br /><br />i just bought this stuff cuz i want free shipping from Amazon.con...at the end i end up sharing these with my co-worker before it will be expired tomorrow.....bad bad
