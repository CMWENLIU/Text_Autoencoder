We had been looking for organic powdered eggs for baking, but was not able to use these.  The smell and taste are distinctly fishy.  Though it is less important, the color, too was somewhat dark, with a greenish tinge.  The eggs were not rancid and were well-packaged, and I appreciated the organic designation.  I am not sure whether all eggs from this manufacturer have these problems, but we will not be purchasing again.
