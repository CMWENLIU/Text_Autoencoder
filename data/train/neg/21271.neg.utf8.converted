Crunchy balls of candy on the outside, chewy gummy in the inside.  Sounds clever, but these are mostly gross.  The black ones are more bitter than sweet.  The red ones have a slight raspberry flavor and are tolerable, but nothing special.  Don't buy 5lbs of these unless you are really sure you like them.
