You've got to be kidding!  This item came in a very small box.  The amount is 0.5 When I ordered this, I couldn't see the weight.  I have now checked and  only when I scroll down to the very bottom  after "customers who viewed this also viewed" do I see it is boxed in 0.5 oz.  Really, I would go through this box in 2 weeks.  The price for this small box is $1.99. That's for 1/2 oz-- 1 oz would be almost $4.00.  Not worth the price or the trouble.  The shipping and handling is over $7.00.  Would it be too much to ask to put the size in the product discription?
