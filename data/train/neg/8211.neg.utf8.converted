There is no doubt, these noodles filled me up...however, i'm not sure if they suppressed my appetite because they are filling, or because they smell SO bad i couldn't stomach eating them anymore.  There is something about the fluid these noodles are packed in, they have an EXTREMELY strong fish odor...even when i rinsed the noodles and boiled them for nearly 10 minutes, the smell was still there (even with some tomato sauce on them).  Seriously, the smell was horrid.  The consistency was strange too, but that i could get used too...the smell...no way.  :-(
