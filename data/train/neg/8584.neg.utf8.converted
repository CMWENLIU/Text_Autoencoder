I went into this product with high hopes, but came out feeling like I was duped.  First off, if you put this just in water, it tastes absolutely terrible.  Might as well throw some stevia in there.  Also, this stuff will cake on the sides of any glass or water bottle you put it into.  Doesn't mix well at all.<br /><br />Lastly, all this "ORAC" hype, yet I noticed absolutely zero benefits of taking it.  I noticed about the same effects I would get if I ate a strawberry.  ONE strawberry.<br /><br />Overhyped, overpriced product.  Spend your money elsewhere.<br /><br />Update: 2/24/12: Sambazon must've changed the formulation.  The powder dissolves A LOT better than it used to. I got my hands on this product again after my original review, and I find that it mixes pretty well now.  It's still a little gritty, but not terribly bad.  Almost unnoticeable in a protein shake.  Problem is, this formula is only a 3g serving size.  That's 1 scoop.  When you use the frozen Acai packs, it's 25g.  Yes, a lot of that 25g is water, so you have to subtract some, but let's say it's 50% water, for arguments sake.  That will means 1 frozen pack is equivalent to 4 scoops of this Acai powder.  Since I realized that, I've been using 2-4 scoops of this stuff in a smoothie. NOW I feel the benefits.  1 scoop is nothing, and shouldn't be the serving size.  I recommend people start with 2 and work up to 4 scoops in their smoothies.  Then you'll notice the Acai benefits, if you didn't feel them before.
