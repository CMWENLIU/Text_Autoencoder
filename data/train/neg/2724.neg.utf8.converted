It's challenging to create a chocolate bar with erythritol or xylitol without compromising texture and flavor ("cooling" effect). But it IS doable! I've ordered chocolates sweetened with xylitol or erythritol from 3 other manufacturers, and I was pleasantly surprised that they weren't waxy. This one, unfortunately, is so waxy that it doesn't taste like chocolate at all.<br /><br />Some people liken these bars to Easter bunnies, but don't the bunnies have a better mouthfeel? Perhaps it's due to the fact that the bunnies are thin (hollow), and therefore kind of elegant. This bar is a very thick solid block - difficult to bite.<br /><br />What made it even worse in my case - I happened to try the Almond variety, and they contained INTACT almonds! Other manufacturers break almonds into small pieces, and that's what creates an elegant experience. Eating this one felt like alternating between putting a plain almond and a piece of sweetened wax in the mouth.<br /><br />Finally, they contain oligofructose (FOS), which causes gas in sensitive people. Some may get bloated from eating just 1/3 of this bar.<br /><br />The alternatives that I mentioned above are:<br /><br />- The best one by far was a custom order from a small maker. E-mail cocosrawchocolates at yahoo, and she will make it the way you want. FANTASTIC!!!<br />- Lucienne's - I haven't tried their improved version yet. The previous version, while flavorful and with decent texture, was too acidic to my taste (I usually eat 90%-cocoa bars, but only non-acidic);<br />- Healthy Chocolate (their product is sold under several labels, e.g. "Xyla") - although it wasn't waxy, it still lacked the right texture and flavor, was very boring (opinion shared by relatives and friends);
