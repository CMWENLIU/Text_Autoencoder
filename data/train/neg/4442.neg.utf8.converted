When my dog usually lays a loaf, it's of the super soft squidgy kind.  Kinda like a Hostess Snowball.  After using this product, his doggy little debbies are a bit more solid, but still way too squishy for me to want to pick up with my bare hands!<br />So do what I do!  Sprinkle some cat litter on the poop and convince your dog that it's cat poop.  He'll scarf his own doggie tootsie rolls like they were leftovers from dinner.<br />How's that for recycling Mr Gore?!?  BOOYAH!!
