I am very disappointed to find out that the ready to feed cans of Similac Alimentum contain BPA.  I couldn't believe it so I had to research it for myself and it's true! All of Similac's other RTF formulas are in plastic BPA free containers.  The Alimentum also comes in a can that can not be stored for later use.  My baby only drinks 4-5 ounces at a time, it would be nice if the Alimentum RTF were in a plastic container that had a screw top so we could save the remaining several ounces for the next feeding.
