So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods?  What gives?  Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is?  And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line.  So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal).  People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding.
