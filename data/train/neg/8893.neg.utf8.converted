The name of the bar is "Fruition", but really all the fruit in it is just dates. Dates are not a super nutritious high-antioxidant fruit, they're just really sweet. The bar basically has a datey and brown rice syrup taste, with just a hint of mild berry flavoring... it doesn't taste authentic and bright and exciting. Hardly any cranberries! Also, the chias are a little annoying; they get stuck in your teeth after swelling; however, there really isn't that many chia seeds to state a "superfood" claim.<br /><br />This bar I thought to try, because it seemed similar to Betty Lou's Just Great Stuff Superberry Acai bar (which I love, and has a great ORAC score), but it really doesn't have the nutrition or flavor that Betty Lou's bars do. It's really too sweet and nothing special. I'd say the best part about it is the packaging--the designing of the film is nice. Based on the beautiful packaging, I was hoping for a great tasting nutritious bar. Not so much. :(
