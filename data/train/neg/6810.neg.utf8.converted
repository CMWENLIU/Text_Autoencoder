Great product.  But was disappointed in the delivery.  Was supposed to arrive on 11th didn't get until 14th.  Everything else I order is here by the day they say if not earlier.  It arrived at slc 80 miles from my home on the 10th. Yet it took 4 days to go 80 miles.  Go figure snail mail ups and usps.
