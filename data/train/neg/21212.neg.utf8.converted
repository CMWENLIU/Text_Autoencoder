Looking at my 80's box, I am very disappointed with it. I cannot believe that there is a 1 liter bottle of soda in this small box, it takes up a third of all the space! This is a flat out rip-off, that was space that could have had candy! Not to mention that it isn't even a brand that we'd ever heard of, so it does us zero for nostalgia. Furthermore, there are more suckers in the box than anything else! I feel like this box, which should have been very easy, was completely thrown together without much thought and is complete garbage, especially as most of the candy is still available in stores.<br /><br />I had to spend more money just to fill in that empty third of the box when  I threw the soda away!
