I am so disappointed in Cascadian Farms or, as I've heard, now General Mills<br />I have emailed them to voice my own concern and got a response that ended with this:<br />"In keeping with our satisfaction guarantee, we would like to send you an adjustment for your purchase and it will be mailed to the address you have provided. Please allow 10-14 business days to arrive.<br />We appreciate your loyalty to General Mills and hope you continue to choose our products.<br />Sincerely,<br />Imee B. Roberts<br />Consumer Services"<br />Guess what I got? Coupons for Cascadian Farms products! ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? Why would I waste my time????<br />BTW, here are the replacements I've found and my daughter LOVES them: 1) Natures Path Kamut Puffs (Kamut is the ONLY ingredient) 2) Natures Path Rice Puffs (Rice is The ONLY ingredient) and 3) Barbara's Bakery Breakfast O's (contain corn)<br />ALL OF THESE ARE ORGANIC!!!!! The Breakfast O's are the only actual "O's" but my daughter has not seemed to mind as long as they are crunchy and yummy!
