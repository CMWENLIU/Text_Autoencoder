This reformulated bar is less tasty and harder to eat than the original Boomi Bar. It's chewier and more oily, which I find to be a worse texture. I hope they bring back the original bar because it was an integral between-meal snack for my gluten-free diet. The change is bad enough that I may drop this bar entirely and eat more Larabars and KIND bars.
