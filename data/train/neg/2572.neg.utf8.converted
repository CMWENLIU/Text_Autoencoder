Tastes really bad.  A strong Chemical after taste.<br />zero grams sugar, but still products tastes sweet -- loaded with chemicals and artifical sweetners<br />one bite and it fills your stomach.  A bloaty feeling just after a couple of bites.<br />a definete NO-NO for any one 12 and younger.  But also not recommended averse to eating food with unnaturnal ingrediants.<br /><br />Since Amazon does not accept return of grocery items - I had to trash the product.
