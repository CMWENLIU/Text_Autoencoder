They've got the appearance of licorice, but close your eyes and you would be hard pressed to identify the taste if someone put one in your mouth. They're really, really bland.<br /><br />If you try hard, you can taste a bit of licorice flavor, but would it have really hurt to put some more licorice oil in there? After all, those of us trying to avoid sugar are not trying to avoid licorice oil.<br /><br />The consistency isn't great either. It's a bit starchy. But I'd take it if they had any taste. As it stands, I have five pounds of these, with no idea what to do with them, because I'm not going to waste the calories eating something this tasteless.
