I wanted to make sure my baby has a good start just like all the parents out there. That is why I am buying organic food and I do my best to prepare fresh food for her when I can. I am so disappointed to know for a company labeling organic containing ''bpa '' in their lids. what is the point??<br /><br />I spend considerable amount of money and effort to make sure my baby is not consuming toxins. I buy bpa free bottles, I even called similac feeding line to make sure formula containers did not have bpa- which they dont and I go buy a organic food with bpa lids. I am higly disapponted by earths best insensitivity to this matter. I personally feeled tricked. I trusted this company since I saw their food were in glass jars.<br /><br />I wanted to take this time to write this review. here is some facts about BPA---<br />The chemical is bisphenol A, or BPA, a component of the plastic epoxy resins used to line metal food cans. Dozens of laboratory studies show that BPA affects the developing brain and reproductive systems of animals exposed to low doses during pregnancy and early life. BPA has recently raised concerns from 2 separate expert panels of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with 1 group of scientists warning that human exposures to BPA are already at or above the levels that harm animals and another expressing concern about impacts of BPA on infants' brains and behavior.
