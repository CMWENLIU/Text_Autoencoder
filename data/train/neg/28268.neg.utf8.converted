I have used pure coconut oil on my hair for some time (massage in a small amount, leave on over night, shampoo out in the morning) so I was interested in trying a commercial "oil" product.Don't get excited. This is mostly mineral oil with a little fragrance and maybe some other oils added. I put two drops on my palms and rubbed it just on the ends of my hair. Result: greasy hair.  I can't imagine what a mess you'd have if you rubbed this into your scalp.<br /><br />This may sound a little weird, please don't judge me. When my dog was in my face...."whaddya got there? what is is? is it good to eat?".....I put a few drops in my hands and rubbed it on her fur. She looked pretty greasy for a while but it had soaked in by the next day. At least she smelled sort of nice for a while.<br /><br />If you have the sort of hair that can stand up to an oil change this might work for you. For ordinary hair ,I don't think so much.
