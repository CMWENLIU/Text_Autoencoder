Was excited about this product for my ridgeback as she eats ger food in about 10 seconds!  This was nice looking and well made but, after one or two feedings, she was right back to her old speed in eating.  This leaves too much room between the bump and sides so a smart pup just eats around the bump as fast as ever.
