I bought this product because the Legacy Farms product (Oat Bran) was shown as not available.  I was looking for the Legacy Farm product.  It seems to be the only one that is gluten free.  The Mulberry Lane Farm product was misleading in that it stated that oat bran is "naturally" gluten free.  The truth of this is, if it is "milled" in a plant that does not clean or dedicate the equipment to gluten free products, then it is not a gluten free product.<br /><br />Please bring back Legacy Farm Oat Bran. As a celiac disease person, I must have the totally gluten free product.<br />I had to give away the Mulberry Lane Farm.  I thought they and you (Amazon) were misleading.<br /><br />Therefore it is the poorest rating you have.  It makes me question buying from you again.<br /><br />Thanks for asking.
