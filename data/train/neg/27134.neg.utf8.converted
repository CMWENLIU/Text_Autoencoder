These have the redeeming qualities of not needing refrigeration before cooking and that they cook in minutes. Great for quick meal or side dish with butter or tomato sauce or such BUT as gnocchi, they are not the greatest. They are more like starchy dumplings, heavy dough with no potato texture or taste.
