After some of the safety issues regarding products made in China (Lead in toys, Melamine in milk, etc.) i'm very hesitant to consume fods products which are manufactured there.  When purchasing a "higher end" product such as this one, one doesn't expect that it would be made in China.  I'm not even sure if I should eat these. I definitely will not be purchasing these again, and in the future would prefer to purchase from companies who produce their products in countries with higher standards for food production.
