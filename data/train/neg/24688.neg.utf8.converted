This product is made in China.  I am concerned about the quality of the product, even though all the dogs I use to give them to love them.  There has been problems with dogs dying, becoming extremely ill (read about chicken products from China on the Internet).  I love our dog, and he doesn't need any additional problems, so I am going to discontinue giving them to him.  We need to start reading the labels on where things are made.  Buy products that are made in the USA!!!
