ProFlowers advertises on Rush Limbaugh's radio show.<br />Rush Limbaugh who has been married 4 times, has no children or family,<br />called a Georgetown law student (who was invited to a US House committee meeting)<br />a slut and a prostitute for using<br />birth control.  Rush has no business commenting on family's, or women, as he has no real experience with either.<br />ProFlowers should not support this kind<br />of hateful, crude and slanderous attack on women.<br />Do not buy flowers from ProFlowers, if your daughter is on birth control,<br />Both Rush and Proflowers believe she a tramp.<br />Shame on Proflowers for not pulling their ads on Rush's talk show.<br />Try another flower company. Support women and do not buy ProFlowers
