I understand it is a box meal so I really did not expect a great deal from it, but this was seriously one of the worst dishes I have ever had the shame of preparing myself.  Based on the box front, I thought that there would be a packet of dehydrated broccoli florets.  Wrong - no florets, just some sort of broccoli flakes.  So I prepare it according to the directions and sit down to eat.  From the first bite I can barely taste anything other than just salt.  I am not salt-adverse though I am not typically one to add a lot of extra salt to my meals, just enough to enhance flavor as needed.  This ended up being so salty I could not finish the dish.  I ate several bites hoping that it would get better, but no such luck.<br /><br />I really don't expect much from a boxed meal, but this kit even managed to disappoint those low expectations. There are much more tasty options out there for quick meals.
