I don't know why anyone would buy the American version of Lipton tea when there are so many good black teas available. If you want to experience a good tea that creates a good strong flavor and aroma without any bitterness try PG Tips. In only 2 minutes a single bag of PG Tips in 8 to 10 oz of water will create a brew that will make you forget about any American tea brand.
