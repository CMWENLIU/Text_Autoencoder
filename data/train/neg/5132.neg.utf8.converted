I was looking for a good, healthy "trail mix", and since this stuff had good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  It was a one-time only mistake.<br /><br />Looking at the picture of the package, and reading the description, it looked like a lot of almonds, pumpkin seeds, some sunflower seeds and berries...just like it says.  However, upon opening the first package, all I saw were sunflower seeds...lots and lots of sunflower seeds.  An average handful would be a overwhelming majority of sunflower seeds with some pumpkin seeds, maybe 2 almonds, a couple of raisins, one or two cranberries, and I'd only get a tiny blueberry or two every 3-4 handfuls.  I was really surprised.  If I had saw this mix in a clear plastic bag at the grocery store, I would think it was bird seed.<br /><br />Wondering how it got such great reviews, I read them (something I should have done prior to purchasing).  Lots of people were saying how much they love it, but not really saying anything about what was in the bag!<br /><br />As for what was there, it was OK.  I'm not sure what "dry roasting" is, but all of the nuts and seeds tasted raw...soft and a bit chewy.  I've got nothing against raw nuts, but since the description says "roasted", I expected nice, crisp almonds and seeds.  Not the case.<br /><br />If organic is your thing, then I'm sure you might like this mix for what it is.  It is healthy as well.  However, I am sticking with my Back to Nature Martha's Vineyard Blend Trail Mix...it's as cheap or cheaper (if you get it at the right time), fresh, with lots of big, chewy cherries and cranberries.<br /><br />If you look at the bag of the Back to Nature mixes, it is clear and shows you exactly what you are getting.  I am guessing there is a reason the Eden mix doesn't come in a clear bag...
