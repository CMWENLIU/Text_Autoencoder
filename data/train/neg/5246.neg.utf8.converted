After reading the reviews, I was syked to receive my order of Ibarra chocolate.  I love hot chocolate, and look forward to trying new flavors and brands.  I've never had "Mexican Chocolate", so maybe this is what it is supposed to be like, but I didn't like it at all.  It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy.  I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together.  It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!!  I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink.  This was not at all what I expected, so if any of those three reviewers are looking for an open package, you can purchase mine!  In one word: YUCK!!!
