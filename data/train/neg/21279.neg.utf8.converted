I haven't had Thai tea in several years because the restaurants make it too sweet.  I purchased this one and a black tea version.  It tasted great, but I developed a migraine that I had to get medical treatment for.  I totally missed that it contained FD&C Yellow 6 food coloring, also known as Sunset Yellow.  The package I received had another label placed over the ingredients, so the presence of the food coloring wasn't noticeable on the package.  It is listed on Amazon's description, so it is my fault for having bought this.  I later learned that it can have several potential health issues.  There have been calls for the withdrawal of Sunset Yellow from food use from the British Food Standards Agency.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest has requested the FDA ban it in the USA.  Sunset Yellow is banned in Norway and Finland.  It is also in the black Thai tea mixture I bought.  I have gotten migraines from other artificial food additives, mostly artificial sweeteners and food preservatives.  I try to be careful, so I only blame myself.  I read every review, but didn't read the description that closely.  If you are looking for a healthy drink, this isn't it.
