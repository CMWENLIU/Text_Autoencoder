If you like buttered popcorn with popcorn salt, but are looking for a healthier alternative, you should keep on looking.  The buttery taste is "off", with a distinct chemical taste.  I used it twice, gave it away to a neighbor, who used it once and threw it away.  I'll stick to popcorn salt and I Can't Believe Its Not Butter Spray.
