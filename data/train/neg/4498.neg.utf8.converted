I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to the regular soda I drink.  And I have to admit, when you first drink it it is OK.  It does have a weird aftertaste though, which bothers me the more i drink.  Maybe I will get used to it but I doubt it.<br /><br />I will certainly not be purchasing this product again.
