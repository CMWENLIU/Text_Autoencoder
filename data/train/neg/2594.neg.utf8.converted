I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients. I was wrong. It's mostly a date flavor and texture with a sprinkle of coconut and a thin chocolate coating. I did not taste cashews or almonds at all. Maybe the folks that are rating these bars highly have acquired a taste for such items.
