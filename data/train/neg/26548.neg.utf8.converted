If you are looking for it then you found it. This is the the famously bad tasting Da Vinci SUGAR FREE Chocolate Syrup. I found one person say it tastes kinda like a tootsie roll. I would say it it is sweet. it is a little tootsie roll flavored. But it also has a burnt plastic taste. The most interesting part of the experience is the after taste. It's smoky but has a slight sensation of Listerine on your tongue. I guess what it comes down to is: I am not a fan of sugar free burnt tootsie roll Listerine syrup.
