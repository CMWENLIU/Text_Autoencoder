I love Chai Latte and so wanted this to be good, but its NOT. This chai smells great, but it has a very weak and watered down taste. I tried brewing two chai disk with one milk to make a stronger cup. Even with two it was still very bland. And the milk gives it an artificial aftertaste. Being able to make chai latte was one of the major reasons I purchased the Tassimo which makes how it tastes all the more disappointing. I really hope they strengthen the formula. And get rid of the aftertaste.
