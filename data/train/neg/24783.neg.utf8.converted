This jerky has been by far the saltiest I have ever had. I actually like salt but to a certain point and this went way beyond it. My favorite jerky was the World Kitchens brand brown sugar but it's no longer available. Unless you really like your food Extra Salty I would stay away. as far as tenderness I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
