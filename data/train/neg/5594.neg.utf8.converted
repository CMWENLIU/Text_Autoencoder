This is the kit I used first with my AeroGarden.  It sprouted well and was ready to harvest in 3 weeks.  My problem is that there is not enough lettuce for 2 dinner size salads.  You are also supposed to only harvest 1/3 of the product, which is enough for a small side salad.<br /><br />It takes about a week from picking to be able to harvest again, and the plants do have long stems.  I won't be getting this kit again.  Hopefully the Herbs will be better.
