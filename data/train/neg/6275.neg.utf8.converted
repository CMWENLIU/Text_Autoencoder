I bought these for my family with respect for Quaker and did not scrutinize the label.<br />They are filled with junk! High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient and brown sugar the third. They are so filled with junk ingredients that they have 43 carbs per bar with 38 in simple non-complex blood sugar raising carbs.<br />I've decided to feed these to the livestock down the road and not my family. Shame on Quaker. I will stick with the breakfast bars by Nature Valley and Kashi instead. Shame on Quaker. Childhood and adult obesity are epidemic. Oats are healthy except when slathered in high fructose corn syrup and junk carbs. Again Shame on Quaker.
