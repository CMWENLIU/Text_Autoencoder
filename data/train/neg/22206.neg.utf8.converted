OK, I'm coming into this ignorant of the fiber/no fiber controversy.  I bought a jar in preparation for making the Sinner's Sandwich from cult video game fave "Deadly Premonition" (recipe: turkey, jam, and cornflakes).  As this was a special occasion, I thought that something a little, y'know, high quality, a little CLASSY, was in order, and into my head popped the '80's TV ad with the English dinner party and the Texan and "Would ya please pass the jelly?".  Reminded that Polaner was NO MERE JELLY, I picked up a jar, and  -<br /><br />Well, indeed, it's not jelly; it's more like gel, with no seeds, no pulp, nothing to indicate that this was derived from fruit.  It's straight and smooth to an eerie degree.  It freaks me out, really  -  more like Polaner NoFruit.  But!  I investigated (i.e. read the label), and there IS fruit  -  just not what's advertised.  Strawberry Polaner is "all-fruit," yes, but that fruit is mostly PEAR.  Pear!  In case you haven't noticed, pears are taking over the fruit-derivative food market as cheap, tastelessly sweet filler for stuff that supposed to be another flavor  -  juice, fruit snacks, you name it.  Go ahead; read the labels of your favorite fruit foods, and you'll be shocked at how much pear is lurking inside.  Flippin' pears!  They're in everything!<br /><br />So, Strawberry Polaner AllFruit: unsurprisingly doesn't taste like strawberries, as there are hardly any strawberries in the dang thing.  Turkey, jam, and cornflakes gets a thumbs-up, though!  Give it a try!  Works with Tofurky, too!
