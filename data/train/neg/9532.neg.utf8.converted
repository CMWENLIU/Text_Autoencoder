Somehow Starbucks is able to make instant coffee with microground Arabica taste more like the Arabica and less like the instant. I had high hopes for this, and I regret having purchased such a large number of cups. This tastes like any freeze-dried instant coffee you can get at the grocery store.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee snob, by any means, but this is awful.
