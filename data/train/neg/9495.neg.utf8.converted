i bought these in bulk for a animal rescue donation drive to add to my care package but am returning them IMMEDIATELY after i saw they are produced in China. i didn't realize it at the time or i would have never bought them.  I don't mean to discriminate but I am still very leery of buying any pet products made in China given their extremely poor (and dangerous!) quality control. I bought all three flavors and the chicken flavor in particular gives me pause as its a bright, almost neon, yellow. There are going back asap.
