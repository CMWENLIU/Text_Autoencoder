The label on the can says... No liquid or oil added... That's just not true. I poured off 1 3/4 ounces of liquid from one can. That comes out to a price increase of over 40%  per can for the salmon you actually get. The salmon was good but if you are doing a price comparison per can based on the amount of salmon you get, the real price is approximately $6.46 per can or $25.84 per 4 pack. The other 3 cans sound like they are also full of water. If Wild Planet is not going to be truthful about the amount of liquid in the can, what else may be untrue? Is it really a product of the USA, or never previously frozen like the can says? The next can I have, I will weigh the salmon after pouring off the water.
