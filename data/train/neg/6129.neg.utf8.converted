I saw the rave reviews for this tea, and I decided to do an experiment and try this tea along with the Traditional Medicinals St. John's Wort Good Mood tea. They should have been similar, although it looks like the Yogi tea has more St. John's Wort in it. I've had several cups of both now, and without a doubt the Yogi tea tastes way too licoricey and like it has a fake sweetener in it. The Traditional Medicinals tastes WAY better to me, with a more subtle licorice flavor and no weird fake sweetener taste. Also, it makes me feel better than the Yogi tea. It gives me a little boost, which I'm not feeling with Yogi. Sorry, but I tried it a few times to make sure! If anyone else wants to try the same experiment, I'd be interested in your opinion as well!!!
