Diet Coke is delicious, and I drink it pretty much all day. Cross your fingers I don't get kidney stones or something. My experience drinking Diet Coke has lead me to get plenty of caffeine in my system without getting fat from the sugar, which I happen to like.<br /><br />However.<br /><br />Buying 24 cans of Diet Coke at ~$40 shipped works out to $1.62 per can. This is well above the accepted price for Diet Coke, in fact... like 6x more. If this vendor could get their price down to something reasonable I'd be happy to order a bunch. If they expect me to pay 2x what it costs in an expensive vending machine, I'll just stick with that, thanks.
