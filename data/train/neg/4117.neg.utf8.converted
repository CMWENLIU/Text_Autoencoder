The apple chips are sent in a silver package, not clear.  The flavor was okay but was afraid they were contaminated.  We received the bags with at least 4 different 1/4" size tears in them.  It had small pokes all over the bags from the apple corners poking through.  If the package is open at all there is a chance of getting stale and contaminated.  I like the bag that the apple chips come in "Bare Fruit Cinnamon Apple Chips", the apple chips do not poke through packaging.  I stopped my monthly order of the Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Apples, Fuji, 1 Pound Bags (Pack of 2) due to the packaging. Who wants to eat anything torn open...
