The other reviewer commented these are sweet--well, of course they are, they have dehydrated cane juice in them. I specifically purchased them because the description on Amazon says peas, salt, water. On the plus side, it is sea salt and organic cane juice, but I like so many others am trying to decrease sweeteners to combat the inflamation caused by glucose.<br /><br />This is the second product I have had trouble with the item description not matching what I actually receive.
