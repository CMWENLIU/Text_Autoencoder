I used to buy the Friskies dental diet for my four year old feline, who had severe gingivitis, resulting in terrible breath and tooth decay. The Friskie's, for being a cheap brand, actually did a pretty good job of improving this condition, since she refuses to let me brush. However, they took this food off the market. The remaining 2 options are this food and Hill's.<br /><br />Finding this online with the free shipping and the cheaper price sealed the deal for me, as they don't usually have it in the store, and her oral condition was deteriorating again. I had been feeding her a hairball and healthy weight formula just because it was what my other cat ate in the meantime, and was happy to have a new dental food.<br /><br />After slowly switching her over, I realized this food really isn't as good as it seems. It mildly improved her teeth, but her breath is still awful and I can see tartar (compared to the improvement I saw from the Friskie's). She now has started coughing up hairballs almost every other day, and she is gaining weight rapidly, even though I feed her less than a cup a day. She also acts hungry all the time. I checked the amount of fat in this food, and it is almost double the healthy weight formula. So I can feed her a normal amount and she will continue to get fatter (been on it for about 3 months, and has gained at least 2 pounds) or I can starve her so she maintains a normal weight. I recommend checking the nutrition or even trying the Hill's if your cat has severe gum/tooth disease, weight issues, or hairball problems. The other reviewers gave it favorable ratings, however, so maybe if your cat has mild problems it will work for you.
