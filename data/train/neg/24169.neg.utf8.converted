To be fair I bought these blindly as an alternative to peppermint Altoids... im not too familiar with ginger but read about its properties of helping with nausea.<br /><br />I had one mint and couldnt make it all the way through. They have a very strong flavor that isnt pleasant. I like gingerbread cookies and ginger ale so I thought I would like ginger mints... but I was very wrong. Tried passing them out at the office and nobody likes them either.
