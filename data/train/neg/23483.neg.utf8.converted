I bought this item because I had eaten the original peanut butter protein bar for years, but was sad to see it discontinued, and really happy to see it out again. I ate one and noticed immediately that it tasted totally different. I reside in Canada so I know that south beach was owned by Kraft and this was definately not kraft peanut butter. Sure enought I looked all over the bar and its not made by kraft anymore. Not only that, but its loaded with sugar and carbs which the old bar was not. This was made to be a low carb high protein bar originally and now its just another granola bar. Wont buy again, and am disappointed that this new company would put the South Beach name on a product that is nothing like the original.
