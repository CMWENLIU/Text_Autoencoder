I thought it would be nice to have a change of the tuna and salmon cans I take to the office for lunch, but this doesn't do it. I bought a 4-pack and opened them all within a week, just to use them up. Too mushy, mouth feel isn't solid enough. Maybe I was expecting too much. Convenient, of course, and organic is important.  I still like the concept.
