I have been feeding my dog TOTW for a couple years now. The last bag I purchased was 2 weeks ago and my dog started throwing up the day after feeding her.  Her poop was 90% runny and was blood red color.  I did my research online and the production code on the bag was one of the recalled.  I called Amazon and they immediately stopped selling the item.<br /><br />I am in disbelief that this has happened!
