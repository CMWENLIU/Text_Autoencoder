I ordered this item having read that the item weight was 3.5 pounds and the shipping weight was 4.5 pounds. I did read that there were 48ct in the box. So I paid my 12.99 with free shipping (other items brought me to the $25). When I got the box- tiny- it was a 17.28 ounces no where near what it claimed. So I got my money back. Be warned this box is only a little over a pound.
