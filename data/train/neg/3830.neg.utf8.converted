I have too say that I buy alot of things I want or need by reading what other people have too say about them.<br />I did not buy these on Amazon,I went to their web site...and they had sooo many good reviews there I bought more than a bag or two......BIG MISTAKE.<br />This candy is small. The lollipops and the candy drops they offer taste nasty,but even if they were good (and they are not) you would still have to eat three or four just to equal what a normal size sucker or candy disk would be.<br /> I bought them to have around for my grand kids,but I think I will stick to fruit for their healthy snacks and leave these things alone.
