Yes, I know, I know, agave nectar is supposed to be the answer for for those seeking to address insulin issues, or on low-carb diets, or just want a healthy alternative to sugar, and even honey and maple syrup, let alone high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners. Yes, I've done the research, am personally interested in both organic and low glycemic index products, and used agave nectar for a couple of years myself, proudly serving it to my friends.<br /><br />Despite the great enthusiasm for agave nectar and the endless hype from folks who should know better, I hate to tell you, but it's baloney--a very successful and clever marketing campaign to promote a sweetener that's no better for you, and very likely worse, than many of the other sweeteners it replaces.<br /><br />First, forget any mental image of a "nectar" naturally flowing from the majestic agave cactus; this product is created in factories through a chemical refining process, much the same way as high fructose corn syrup, from the starchy root of the agave plant and is, in fact, a refined high frustose product stripped of any nutrient value. It has a higher fructose content than high frustose corn syrup. While high fructose agave "nectar" won't spike your blood sugar levels, the fructose in it will cause: mineral depletion, liver inflammation, hardening of the arteries, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, obesity, and may be toxic for use during pregnancy.<br /><br />If you think I'm making this up or shilling for some manufacturer of a competing sweetener, just google "agave fraud" and see for yourself. I wish it were otherwise.<br /><br />On October 27, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported:<br /><br />"[T]he Glycemic Research Institute, a Washington, D.C., laboratory, issued a warning Friday that diabetics experienced "severe and dangerous side effects" during testing of an agave nectar. "The diabetics passed out on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital," says Ann de Wees Allen, chief of biomedical research at the lab. She declined to say how much of the product the diabetics consumed during the test, saying that would be disclosed after a complete analysis of the results.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The lab has stopped testing agave on humans amid safety concerns. Also, Dr. Allen says the lab refused to test four other agave products after a chemical analysis it commissioned from another lab found they were mixed with high-fructose corn syrup, which was not disclosed on the label. She declined to name the brands."<br /><br />Wikipedia's entry for agave notes: "the extremely high percentage of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation," citing:<br /><br />Basciano H, Federico L, Adeli K (2005).
