I also have been a fan of Cafe Francais since it came on the market. I so look forward to my coffee each morning. No more!!! The shipment I received last week came in a tin with a new look. My first thought was to check the ingredients against my old tin. Well guess what-----they changed a perfect formula. It has more sugar, less fat, more sodium, and a whole lot less coffee. It tastes more like creamer with very little coffee flavor. I sent an e-mail to General Foods International Coffees and am waiting for a reply. In the mean time I will not order it anymore unless they change the formula again. I am soooooo disappointed that General Foods would mess with perfection but not surprised. As I told General Foods in my e-mail, the Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans would be amused that they are passing off this new formula as Cafe Francais.
