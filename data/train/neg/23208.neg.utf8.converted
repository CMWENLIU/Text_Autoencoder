I used to love Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk and bought it by the case. But they clearly changed the product and ruined a good thing.<br /><br />The old Thai Kitchen was thick and wonderful. It separated in my fridge and even on my kitchen counter if it was below 70 degrees or so. It whipped up into a lovely whipped cream.<br /><br />This stuff has the consistency of skim milk. It doesn't separate or harden even in the fridge. It doesn't whip up like heavy cream. The flavor seems watered-down.<br /><br />Apparently these folks never heard the adage, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
