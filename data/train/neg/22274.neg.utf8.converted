I was very surprised when I opened the box to find a VERY SMALL CONTAINER that is only 16 ounces.  As heavy as this stuff is, that's about 1 1/2 cups by the looks of it.<br /><br />Nowhere in the description (as of today) do I find that it says it's only 16 ounces.  I could have purchased an entire GALLON of a similar popcorn popping coconut oil for about the same price.<br /><br />I'll keep this one and use it up rather than going through the return process.  But, now I'm a lot smarter... you can fool me once with something like this.<br /><br />So... BUYER BEWARE!
