thought I would try something new.  unfortunately these do no work in my keurig, I have tried 6 times so far and each time the brew will not go into the cup just builds up pressure and sometimes spills out grounds.  The bottom is pierced so I just don't get it.  I have had a keurig for over a year and never had this issue with any k-cup over multiple brands and yes other k-cups still work fine.  maybe if this issue is acknowledged and fixed I will try from this company again in the future.
