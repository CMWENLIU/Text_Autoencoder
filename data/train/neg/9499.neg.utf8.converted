Just our experience, but when I had to supplement with formula for our baby who had only been given breast milk, he wouldn't touch it.  I tried several times, but it tastes very bitter.  Many moms I've talked to have said that breast milk-fed babies do very well with Gerber Good Start formula.  It tastes the most like breast milk.  That is what I'm using.  Hopes this helps a desperate mom out there who is looking for a good formula to try!
