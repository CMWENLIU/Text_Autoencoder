These rawhide rolls are cheap, cheap, cheap. You indeed get what you pay for. Maybe I got a bad batch or something as my experience has been VERY different than the other reviewers.  The bones split into tiny pieces all over the dang carpet which obviously creates a HUGE mess and could potentially choke your dog.  MUCH better product in Beefeaters Natural Rawhide Rolls. Yes, they cost more but stay tight and do NOT splinter...and last longer. You can buy here or other sites- just do a search. I will be buying the Beefeaters again from now on. What a waste of money this purchase has been and, no, I have NO association with Beefeaters or sellers of their products...the above comments are the straight facts.
