Ha.  You think you can handle your Meth?  Your Vodka?  Your Smack?<br /><br />That stuff is Cream of Wheat compared to The Ratch.  One day, it's a little dab - you know, for kicks.  To look cool.  Fit in with the hipsters.  A month later, heck - for me it was half a day - I'm a certified Ratch Head, holding a bottle of the Red Devil upside down like a plasma bag, sucking the heat from a clear plastic tube that I ripped from my little girl's aquarium air pump.  The fish died, but I didn't care.  They tasted sooo goooooood.<br /><br />I lost everything.  My faith in ketchup.  My faith in Chinese mustard.  My cutlery (no pride, I'd just face-plant onto the plate and suck.)  When the intervention happened, they found me curled up in the Specialty Foods Aisle of Target with a fiery cake of Ratch and oyster crackers pasted to my face and clothes.<br /><br />Rehab taught me that once a Ratch Head, always.  I met people there who assured me that I was ok without Sriracha.  That I didn't NEED heat.  The doctors, Mr. Heinz and Mrs. French put me on a new diet of quiet, soft condiments that - well, sure.  They don't have flavor, but they're certainly not making me think of them every hour of the day, either.<br /><br />I have a steady job now, new friends and tonight, we're getting together for Tuna Helper and instant lemonade.<br /><br />Stay away from Srirach sauce.<br /><br />Wait.  Did someone say chicken fingers?  (sniff sniff)<br /><br />Those ARE chicken fingers!<br /><br />SRIRACHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA TIME!!
