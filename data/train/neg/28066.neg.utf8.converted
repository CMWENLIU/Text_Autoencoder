I have gone through 5 lbs of this flour, trying everything possible to change the consistency that it comes out as...with NO luck.  I do not have her cookbook, and I think in order to use this flour you have to use her recipes.  Every time I use this flour the consistency is gummy, sticky like a very glutinous rice flour.  Muffins, scones, pancakes, all came out with a very dense and chewy center.  It even has a transparant type of look to the center of baked goods.  I have tried to use this flour to thicken broths and the four just balls up into little gummy things (Bob's Red Mill works a LOT better).  I would not recommend this flour to anyone.
