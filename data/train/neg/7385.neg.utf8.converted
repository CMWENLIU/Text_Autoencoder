I have been drinking this flavored coffee for over a year. Up until now I have loved it. But the last package I got ( in the new packaging and labeling scheme) is absolutely terrible. The aroma is wrong and the taste is now sickeningly sweet. What used to be a slight hint of vanilla now hits you in the face like a wet glove. The coffee's flavor is absoulutely awful. I am sending it back for a refund immediately. So far the other Gevalia coffees I have are still really good but this one is a disaster after the formula for was apparently changed.
