The friendly face of Mr. Redenbacher may grace this bag of popcorn, and the bright colors and promising text may promise a healthy snack in every bag, but don't be fooled.  Behind that kind smile and bright colors is the smell of smoke, and blackened dreams.<br /><br />Simply put, this is the worst popcorn I've ever had.  Not for it's taste, but in the fact that every single time I've microwaved it, both the popcorn and the bag itself come out burnt.  No matter how closely I followed the directions, or turned down the power setting, or changed the times, both the bag and the corn came out blackened, filling the kitchen with the pungent odor of burnt popcorn.<br /><br />For those who think the problem may lie with the microwave I used, that wasn't the case, as it is new (only a month old).  While I initially went on a setting of 10 (high), like the bag recommends, I eventually resorted to going as low as 7, which resulted in the bag going flat, and the bottom getting burned.  At that point, my father and I agreed that I had wasted my money.  I've popped bags of popcorn over 5 years old that tasted better and come out with no burn marks whatsoever.<br /><br />Despite the low calorie count per bag, this is one popcorn best left on the shelf.
