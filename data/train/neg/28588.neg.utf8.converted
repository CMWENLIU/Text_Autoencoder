I ordered a 40-pack of KTC's Creamed Coconut. However, it was an unpleasant surprise when I opened the package and removed the shrink-wrap around the 40 single boxes of creamed coconut: almost all of them were oily - some looked as they were submerged in oil.<br /><br />Ok, mishaps can happen, I said to me. I contacted customer service and told about the problem. I received a replacement. Unfortunately, the same problem, yet worse. Now practically all of the 40 7-oz. or 200 gram boxes were oily.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I opened a box and saw that the coconut cream was placed in a very thin bag. At first glance, I couldn't figure out where it leaked. Yet, when I pressed gently the bag began leaking out from tiny holes. The longer I held the bag the more the creamed coconut warmed up and the more it leaked. How can someone dare to sell creamed coconut in such crappy bags?!<br /><br />Once again, I contacted customer service,yet this time for a refund!<br /><br />Avoid KTC creamed coconut! Instead, buy Let's Do Organic's Coconut cream. It costs slightly more but it is organic and has a good taste and IT IS WELL PACKAGED. I just pay $12.70 for 6 7-oz boxes of Let's Do Organic Coconut Cream with Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' offer.
