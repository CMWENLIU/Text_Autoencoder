Though the product listing is for "Alive and Aware" cocoa, the 3rd party merchant Halaleveryday sent me "Organic Herbal Essence" cocoa. Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is terrible. I believe the positive reviews on this page are for Alive and Aware, and not for what you're likely to get if you order now.
