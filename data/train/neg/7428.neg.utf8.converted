I, too am disappointed.  The first time I saw this, I was excited.  I was thinking I would be buying at least 10 bags for that price.  Maybe they were about $1 to $2 a piece.  So after my bubble was "bursted"  I went on the Brach's web site.  The price for the 7 oz bag there was reasonable.  It had a feature that allowed me to receive an email when the product was in stock.  I have also looked high and low for the past two years.  What is going on?  I know I am not the only person besides the ones who commented that love these little candy "eggs"!!  Why the inflated price, I ask you?  Tsk, Tsk, Tsk.  And I am craving this like nobody's business!!  Oh, well.  The search continues.
