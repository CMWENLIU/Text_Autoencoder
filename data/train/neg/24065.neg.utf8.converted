All my years of shopping at Amazon,  I've never received a product that had leaked 90% of the contents inside the package during shipment.<br /><br />I read other reviews about this , but thought I'd try it out.  What a mistake !!<br /><br />I was shocked to see almost all the packets broken/torn, with the contents leaking...some packs with multiple breaks despite the bubble wrap.  Thank God the outside box was sealed right....!!<br /><br />-- Makes me wonder if this seller got a cheap bulk shipment of rejects...which he is pushing via Amazon.  There is no way for several packets to break like this --  With such breakages..how does one ensure purity of this product from contaminants !<br /><br />Amazon -  Please see all the reviews and ensure that this seller takes care of packaging !  It's a shame..to sell such products without proper packaging !
