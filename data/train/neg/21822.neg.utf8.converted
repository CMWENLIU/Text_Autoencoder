quality control is poor.  received 12 pack, but 2 were empty.  still sealed by the manufacture. you could tell no fluid inside, just air.  i squeezed the bottle and it showed no leaks. no hole to be found. anyway by squeezing it should have showed where the hole was.  it is full and empty.  i hope the drink is under better quality control.  lee,  fort wayne
