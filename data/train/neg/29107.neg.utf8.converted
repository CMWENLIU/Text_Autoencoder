I've been looking for whole grain cookies and was so excited when I saw these oatmeal chocolate chip Kashi cookies at the grocery store.  But my first bite was disappointing...they were so dry that I didn't even finish the cookie. :(<br />Hopefully Kashi will make these cookies more moist in the future.
