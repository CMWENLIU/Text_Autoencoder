I can't eat these sardines because they are covered with scales. Today I actually had to clean up each sardine from those scales in order to be able to eat them.<br />I've read other superb reviews but nobody mentioned this issue... Does everybody else like to eat fish with the scales on it or is it the problem with a batch?! I don't know.
