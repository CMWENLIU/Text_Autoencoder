I have drunk a pot of Twinings Earl Grey tea every morning for the last 15 years (family favorite).  However in the last year & a half I've noticed a terrible change in the taste of the tea.  The Earl Grey that I knew & loved was fragrant & never bitter unlike the new stuff sold today.  At first I thought it had bought old tea or a bad tin.  I even switched stores & finally bought it here on Amazon.  But same bad taste.  Several members of my family also complained about the change as well as friends who were longtime drinkers.  I googled Twinings Earl Grey & have discovered that there was indeed a switch about 2 years ago.  I cannot recommend this new stuff at all--it is not remotely similar to the Earl Grey of old.  It's bitter, harsh tasting & I can't really taste or smell the bergemot.  It's terrible & I don't recommend it.  I sold  my remaining tins on Ebay.<br /><br />Update:  due to complaints, Twinings is now selling the "classic" or original Earl Grey tea.  Just be sure it's marked classic to get that same great taste.
