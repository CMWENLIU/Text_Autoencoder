This product points to the trouble with modern food-processing: overkill. Do we need fake sugar? Or do we just need to consume (a lot) less of the real thing? I won't wax poetic on that point, except to say that these almonds are gross. They are artificially sweetened, the "cocoa" (it's hard to believe, after tasting these, that it's real) is repulsive and they have an aftertaste---like death. Really, hyperbole aside, these are disgusting.
