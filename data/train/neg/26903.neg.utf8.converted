The manufacturer of this product needs to significantly improve their quality control of bottling this product. I received my first two jars of this yesterday and this morning as I opened the first jar the lid would not unscrew. When I forced it to open I saw that the stevia had not been properly sealed beneath the lid and the powder had filled the screw top and even spilled out into the plastic casing around it. Naturally since the seal had been compromised I was unable to use the contents of that jar. I opened the second jar and it was properly sealed and the taste of the contents was quite good. Unfortunately I will not be able to purchase this anymore because I have lost faith with the manufacturer's quality control and because it is a food product Amazon cannot accept returns. I am adding this note to tell all that when Amazon found out about the defective jar, they sent me an email informing me that they are mailing me a free replacement of the entire order and it has already shipped on the same say I notified them. Now who can complain about that?
