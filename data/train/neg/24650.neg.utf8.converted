This product would have been great, if it weren't for the fact that the chips were delivered on July 7th and they all have expiration dates of July 14th. I ordered these as office snacks for clients and there is no way that we can consume all 50 in one week! Thanks for sending me almost expired food, Amazon and DAB Nutrition.
