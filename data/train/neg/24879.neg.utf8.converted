Unfortunately, I had assumed that all Bob's Red Mills products were organic and bought these raisins. I was really disappointed to find that the word "organic" was not anywhere to be found on the packaging. Grapes/raisins are one of the most pesticide sprayed foods so its important to me that they are organic.
