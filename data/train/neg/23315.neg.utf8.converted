Tried Paul Prudhome's Salt Free Magic Seasoning and it's a complete dud. Adds nothing remotely salt like to the flavor. Hard even to detect the chile pepper that is supposed to flavor it. It is as if it had been on the shelf for 10 years and the spices lost their zip, but the expiration date shows 2014 so it's fresh.<br />Mrs. Dash is by no means great but it is far, far superior<br />Do not waste your money.
