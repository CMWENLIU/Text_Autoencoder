I probably eat more peanuts than Jimmy Carter, and have no idea why, here in the United States, they smother delicious, healthy, energy and endurance boosting peanuts in sweet crud.<br /><br />Of course I like the taste of them--what American doesn't like a mouth full of flavored sugar these days--but corn syrup (i.e. sugar) is the second ingredient listed, "crisped rice" which contains SUGAR the third, followed by peanut butter, SUGAR, then some nuts and oats and other good stuff, and somewhere near the end the key word on the package gets in there--"granola"--which is rolled oats mixed with--guess what--more SUGAR.<br /><br />One bar contains 220 calories mostly consisting of various kinds of sugar and ingredients containing sugar.  Since 100 calories per bar are from fat I have to wonder what tiny fraction of those remaining 120 calories are at all healthy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Stay clear of this one unless you're in the last three miles of running a marathon or horribly underweight.  The amount of fat and sugar (which turns to fat like nothing else can) contained in this bar far outweighs the health benefits of the nuts and oats it contains.<br /><br />On the positive side, I will say, these are delicious and I couldn't resist eating them--which is why I will never, ever have them again.
