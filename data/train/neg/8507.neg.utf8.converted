I love Facebook.  I am just one person but I sent a message out about the insulting message I received from this company in response to my email request to sever ties with Rush Limbaugh.  I reached over 7,000 people in minutes and I already have hundreds of comments from people who will never shop Proflowers again no matter what they do going forward.<br />I am not surprise they defended his remarks as they seem to be cut from the same cloth.<br />If you have any respect and love for the women in your life then click that little red "X" in the upper right corner of your screen, pick up he phone and order from your local florists!
