I happened upon this item by accident when looking at coffee makers. While I feel Eight O'Clock Columbian is great coffee I can't believe anyone would pay this price for it.  I just purchased four bags for ten dollars ($10.00) at my local Giant Food Store as<br />it is on sale at two for the price of one.  I always stock up when they have this sale which happens every few months.
