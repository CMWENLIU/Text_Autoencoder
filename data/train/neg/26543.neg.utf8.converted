I got this order today and while I love the cereal, the four boxes were shrinkwrapped together so tightly that not one box can actually stand upright on its own.  They are all dented, warped or damage from overzealous wrapping together.  When the 6 box was on subscription, it was just in the box loose, and one box did get damaged, but not all of them....
