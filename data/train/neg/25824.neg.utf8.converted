After reading the reviews, I searched the web and found info regarding this product.  I had been feeding my dogs this treat once in awhile.  After reading the very negative info on the Vet Medicine sites and several recall sites,  I chose to throw these away.<br /><br />Sadly, on Thursday, while I was out, one of my dogs, Kio, broke through the barrier where the trash was waiting for pick up and got into the bags.  He ate several pieces of these strips at one sitting.<br /><br />Today, Monday, he went to the vet with acute kidney failure.  He will die.<br /><br />DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE YOU FEED THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />I didn't and now my Kio will pay the horrible price.  Like the other poison food, it's made in China..even though it gives the impression it's American.<br /><br />Several stores have pulled this product and refuse to sell it.<br /><br />I THINK AMAZON SHOULD DO THE SAME THING.<br /><br />Amazon has a responsibility that includes not selling foods that kill our beloved pets...I know it's a money maker for them, but there's evidence that it might be a killer.  And it should NOT BE SOLD until the final verdict is is.
