I should have listened to the negative reviews, but I thought they had experienced a fluke... perhaps the bags ruptured during transport and caused the problems they reported? Surely the positive reviews outweighed the negative. Well, my bag arrived intact and undamaged but the inner bag was, as stated by others, unsealed and exposed to the air. This might have been good rice when it originally shipped from the vendor, but by time it left the distribution center and arrived at my door the rice was stale, tainted by the odor of the bag, and inedible by my standards. I eat rice every day, but I will not be eating this rice.
