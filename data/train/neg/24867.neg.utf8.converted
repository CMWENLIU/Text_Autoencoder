My Puppy was on Royal Canin but we switched her to Wellness Pupy b/c I eventually wanted her on Wellness Core but she doesn't seem to like it.  I have to mix the can with it in order for her to eat it.  She was with a dog sitter for a week while we were out of the country and she came back with her food container full.  She seemed more solid, like she'd gained a lot more weight in just a week.  Apparently she ate their dog food and wouldn't touch her more expensive food.  Now that she's home, she's gone back to barely eating it.  I'll try another brand after we finish this bag.  I'm sure the nutrition in it is great  but if I can't get my dog to eat it, what good is it?
