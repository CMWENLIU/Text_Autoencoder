DHL did a terrible job with the delivery of my gift box in a timely manner.  I tracked it from a local area for two days and then noticed it went back to Rhode Island for a night and back to the Latham office.  It was finally delivered two days after the stated date.  The contents of the box was all jumbled and mixed together from the "handling."  I will not order from a company that uses DHL again.
