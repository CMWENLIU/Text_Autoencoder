Not good at all. The vermicelle has absolutly no flavor on it's own what so ever. It's more of a filler for a dish. I soaked it for a minute in room temp water like it said, then put the olive oil & the garlic in the pan as directed, heated it & added my sliced peppers & shrimp, then added the vermicelli as directed. It was like a paste & NO, I didn't over cook it. Very angry as it made the rest of the dish awful so I wasted my time as well as my electric cooking it & all the other ingredients I had put into it. I would personnally NEVER buy this & if someone gave it to me I'd throw it out, as I did. Lucky for me I had other actual rice to cook to use for my remaining ingredients as I did a small amount instead of cooking all of it together just in case I didn't like it. I was able to pick out the shrimps & the peppers to save them. Those items aren't cheap to buy. You may feel differently about it but I can't imagine why since it has zero flavor.
