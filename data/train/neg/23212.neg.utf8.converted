I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's coconut milk and green curry paste. Now the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless and the curry paste has lost all its fire. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the "recipes" have changed. As will mine.
