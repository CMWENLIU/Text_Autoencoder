I can only echo other parents - I have been buying this product only because of the Iron content shown on the package. My daughter actually hates the flavor, but I was trying to make her eat a pouch every other day hoping it will keep her iron levels high. Very disappointed that this mistake wasn't announced or anyhow made noticable; I found out about it just by luck - was bragging about these pouches and showing the iron information to my parents, and noticed that the last shipment (I have it on subscribe and save) has only 4% of Iron listed on the pouch.
