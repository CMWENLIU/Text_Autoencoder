My husband had this on his amazon wishlist so I ordered it as a Christmas present.  It is exactly what is in the picture, but for $16 I thought the kit would be larger. It is a 2 inch diameter bonsai stand, not sure if they say that anywhere in the product description but be aware it is a very small kit. I wouldn't order this again, I would find something larger for the same price.
