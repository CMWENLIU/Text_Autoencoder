I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their "no return policy" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome.
