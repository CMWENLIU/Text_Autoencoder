Pretty good and inexpensive steak sauce.<br /><br />Effective marinades have to have a significant acid content, typically vinegar in order to tenderize/break down the meat. This mix doesnt qualify, and you can leave your steak floating in this stuff for 3 days and it will taste the same off the grill as if you had let it soak for 3 minutes. 2 Forks
