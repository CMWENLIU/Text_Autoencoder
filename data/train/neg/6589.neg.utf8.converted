I could just bawl.  This is just one of my favorite products that have been discontinued or "improved" in the last couple of years.  I loved Potato Buds for thirty years and I will never buy them again, instead I'll try all the other brands.  I got at least four people (who said they would never eat instant mashed potatos) hooked on Potato Buds, because they were so different and so good.  Now, they're not buds any more.  They're a powdery concoction that has to be contained in a plastic bag, not poured straight from the box.  I thought companies spent millions on consumer research before launching a new product, but somebody definitely screwed up here.  They do not taste better at all and the consistency is not pleasing.
