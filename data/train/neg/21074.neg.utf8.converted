I eat these on occasion. but they do contain a sweetener and are not for diabetics at all. The flavor is oily because they also add oil to them!<br /><br />I only buy them because i get free shipping from amazon. Other than that I wouldn't. better off to buy a frozen pack if that is what you like. but good in trail mixes!
