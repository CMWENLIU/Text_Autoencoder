VERY DISAPPOINTING!<br />Wow... talk about SMALL!!  this is in a 9" x 9" box sub divided by four smaller containers.  Very small portions for the large price!  I can get my fruit and nuts in states other than Cali. if this is what everything costs.  Save your money, go to your grocery and make your own fruit/nut tray.  You'll get 3 x's the amount and will look much better.
