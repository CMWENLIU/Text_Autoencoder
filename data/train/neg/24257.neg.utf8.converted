I'm buying lots of stuff from Amazon.  When it is cheap I don't complain, just toss the stuff in the trash.<br /><br />This Hi Lo cereal tasted like cardboard.  I have not complained to the supplier, not Amazon.  I hate to bother with refunds.<br /><br />I'm on a low calorie diet, tested the cereal dry out of the box that arrived, then served to myself with milk as advised.  I could eat it, but I threw both boxes I had just received -- out.<br /><br />Terrible taste. Maybe the calories are low but the taste is worse.<br /><br />Karl
