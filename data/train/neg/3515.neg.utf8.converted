This was shown next to the same product in a 3 pack but not Amazon Prime. The prices were almost identical but the other had a $10 shipping fee. I believed I was ordering a three pack. I got a one pound can for $12.64 that I could have bought for less in my local supermarket! Caveat Emptor, Let the Buyer Beware!<br />Guess I got hosed on this one. Has happened before I must remember to read the whole page befor placing orders. Even then you do not always get what was pictured.
