I actually ordered the two other flavors, black bean and lime, and those were awful.  So I started to think maybe the "plain" would be fine.  Glad I came here to see all the previous reviews so I won't waste my money on these also.  Apparently these are just as bad as the other flavors and leave that slimy fat-like coating all over the roof of your mouth.  That, along with the artificial flavoring, is what I disliked about the two other flavors.  I wonder if the oatmeal bar product is good, but I can't eat gluten so I won't be trying that either.  So disappointing.
