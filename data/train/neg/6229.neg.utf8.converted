It's always hard to stick to rating the product itself when you see something you really think should be pointed out. My cat loves these treats every bit as much as he loves Greenies. Maybe even a little more.<br /><br />Here's the reason for my one-star-rating-to-attract-attention-to-this-listing:<br /><br />The price I'm seeing for these treats in this particular listing is absolutely ridiculous. I can get a 3.0 oz bag at Walmart or Target for $1.50 or $1.60. This seller doesn't even come close.
