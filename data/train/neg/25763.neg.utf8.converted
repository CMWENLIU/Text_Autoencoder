The Product Description on Amazon's web site says: "Small granules of dehydrated California garlic with the intensity of fresh garlic."  The label on the product itself says "Product of China"  The fact that the product label also says "Packed in USA" fails to mitigate what appears to be deceptive advertising.  I'm not going to fool with this any more; Lord knows what's actually in the bottle.  It goes into the garbage.  Henceforth, unless Amazon states clearly the Country of Origin, I'll pass on their products.
