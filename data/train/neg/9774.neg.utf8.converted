Just received my box of Cadbury Crunchie I've been waiting for. Every review was glowing which sold me on these and made me willing to take a 37.00 chance on 24 candy bars (shipping).<br />Ripped into the box, ripped open a bar, oh man, let me tell you, well, just let me say, Brits, you can keep your health care system AND your Cadbury Crunchies.<br /><br />Serious man, I am only writing this to save some other poor sap of a Yank from thinking that you will like these. Bland bland bland, unless you like the flavor of a bitter burnt sugar center, which is all the flavor the crunchy center has. The chocolate outside is not a sweet chocolate at all, and the only word for it is bland.<br /><br />I am glad to take this rating down a notch or two, as it deserves to be. Keep looking, don't stop here if you want something good and interesting. Seriously, move along folks, there is nothing to see here.
