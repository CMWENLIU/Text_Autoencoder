To put it simply, this is the most HORRIBLE cake product on the market. I wanted so badly for it to be great. Being an avid searcher for delicious fat-free or low-fat dessert alternatives, this sounded like the absolute MOTHER LOAD!<br />Normally when you open a cake mix box, you get that delightful cake smell that we are all too familiar with... this is not the case with this product. In fact, the product had an almost chalky smell to it. After mixing it with the water, the mix took on a paste smell and after baking there was still no sign that this was supposed to be a dessert. Now I'm stuck with 5 other packs that I have no clue what I'll do with.<br />If you are hungry for a fat free treat, my suggestion would be to go with "No Pudge Brownies" and SKIP this horrible excuse for a dessert.
