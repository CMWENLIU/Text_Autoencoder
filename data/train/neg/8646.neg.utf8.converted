In case anyone's confused, this is 96 oz total per order. You get two Double Pack boxes.<br /><br />As for the cereal, I think I got a bad batch (AUG2412 P23). A 14 oz box I got from the local grocery store with a OCT2011 best by date tasted way better--light crisp flakes mixed with thin crunchy ones with sweet clusters of oats that give it a granola-like taste and texture. The oats from this batch were much different: some seemed whole still, instead of rolled, making it harder, chewier, and nuttier; some were giant toasted brown clusters of oats, toasted stiff and hard. Not exactly bad, but the first bowl was quite a surprise, due to how the oats would be rolling around in my mouth, forcing me to chew much more. The whole oats were like bigger sunflower seed kernels, but thicker and harder.<br /><br />Update: Opened another box after finishing the other 14 oz boxes and definitely taste something funny in this. Oats weren't really hard this time, but they had a taste like some sort of chemical cleaner or pesticide in it. I wish I could return this. I sense it's a health hazard. I wonder if I could send this in to test somewhere. To top it all off, I found ants had infested a box. There doesn't seem to be any doubts that there's some quality control issue going on here. Maybe the chemical taste was some ant killer chemical and the production plant this originated from had some sort of ant infestation and they sent some tainted product out.
