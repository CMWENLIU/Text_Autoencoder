I should have purchased a smaller amount first.  This is the worst candy I've ever eaten. The chocolate covering is waxy & tasteless, the caramel is terrible tasting & leaves a very bad taste in your mouth.  The only flavor you get out of this is the strong salt taste at the very end.  I tried giving it away to friends but no one would take it!  A big waste of $30.  Koppers will never get my business again.
