I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Spearmint is among my least favorite flavors, beating out only peppermint. It loses its flavor within two minutes. That's not an exaggeration - you get literally two minutes of chewing pleasure. The main reason I prefer it to peppermint is that at least the spearmint goes tasteless, while the peppermint turns bitter.<br /><br />On the bright side, the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. At least I can chew this without having intestinal problems, which makes it worth two stars despite the lack of flavor.
