The food is decent, but now that Procter & Gamble are buying up Natura, this food is no longer a wise choice.<br /><br />My main concern is not the quality of the food, but the fact that Procter & Gamble (Febreze, Crest, Tide, etc) conduct horrible testing on animals. They're not shy about it either. Look it up online. When you purchase EVO, your money will now be going into their pockets.<br /><br />I prefer to feed my cats a raw supplemented diet, with Blue Wilderness on occasion.
