As a former chef, I guess I expected a lot of of these steaks when I ordered them.  I had worked with USDA Prime cuts of beef in the past and thought that these would be worth the money.  I prepared them in a manner I learned in culinary school, insuring a well-crusted exterior with a perfect med-rare interior.  The results were less than impressive.  Actually, given the cost, they were down-right bad.<br /><br />When I first looked at the steaks I was wary.  One of the key indicators of Prime meat is ample marbling with fat.  Both of the steaks that arrived looked, to my eyes, to have a fair amount of intermuscular fat but certainly not what I would have hoped for given the nearly $100 price tag.<br /><br />A high grade USDA Choice would be a comprable product and this grade is readily available at normal grocery stores (not just Dean and Deluca type places.)<br /><br />Save your money.  Shop wiser than I did.
