This is delicious and nutritious soup which we ordered after ordering and being pleased with the Tomato soup.  BUT 9 of the 12 cans arrived badly dented!  I submitted a review on packaging with a photo of the 9 cans, thinking I would hear back promptly from someone at Amazon or at Amy's company, but so far nothing.  I was not able to find another way to communicate, so perhaps this will get a reply.  The outer carton was perfect and the shipment included a book which was also undamaged.  The 12 cans had been shrink-wrapped on a tray and were o.k. to look at until you unwrapped them.  I don't know how 9 of the 12 could be so badly dented without anyone being aware.  I will be happy to e-mail a photo if someone will give me instructions.  Thanks!
