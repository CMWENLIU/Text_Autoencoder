I've loved using NuStevia for 5 years.<br /><br />I tried using this stevia instead.  It's won't dissolve in HOT coffe.<br /><br />It takes 9 packets of this brand instead of 2 packets of other brands.<br /><br />Customer service refuses to pay for me to ship this back to them.<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this diluted, non-disolving stevia.  It's cheaper to buy a more concentrated brand that will disolve in coffee.
