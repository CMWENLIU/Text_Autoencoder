Amazon hasn't figured out how to get canned goods to the customer.  Every time, 90% of the cans are severely dented. Makes me fear food poisoning. If they could solve this problem I would order this soup & many other canned products regularly.  Buy the soup in a store. It's not bad...a bit too much tomato & carrot but good taste.  Amazon, please address this packaging / shipping deficiency. A few minor dents are acceptable but not cans that must be discarded.
