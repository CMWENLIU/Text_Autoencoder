The tomato flavor is inferior, the taste is extremely acidic compared to others, and there is a weird, sweet-metallic aftertaste. Even a small amount taints everything it is used in with the odd aftertaste, which I assume comes from the packaging. I am throwing the remainder of the tube away and using a canned brand from now on. Even if I throw away half the can, it would be less expensive, and more edible. When compared to home-made tomato paste, or even cheap canned brands, this product simply doesn't measure up.
