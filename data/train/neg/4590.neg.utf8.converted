Who takes a sugarless product and suddenly adds sugar to it - without changing one speck of packaging (except the ingredients list and calorie content)?  Manipulative? Fraudulent? Stupid? Whatever the rationale, Cascadian Farm messed up big time on this one.  I'm going to avoid the cereal and the whole brand from now on unless they make a change (Remember Tropicana's rollback of their ugly new packaging?  Consumers CAN impact these corporate choices by switching allegiances).
