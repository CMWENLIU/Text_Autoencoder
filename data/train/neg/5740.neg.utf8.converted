This tea is horrible. The product has a dirty laundry smell and does not taste much better. I expected better from something so expensive. It is simply not worth it. Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern.
