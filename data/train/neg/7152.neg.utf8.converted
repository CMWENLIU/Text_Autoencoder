I love Velveeta cheese as much as the next guy - great taste, versatility, same product for mega years, etc. etc.<br /><br />That said, I also love online shopping and by that I mean shopping at Amazon.  When I need to buy something, I go to Amazon before I go anywhere else.<br /><br />Those 2 things said, I really do not want to pay over $8.00 each for this cheese when I can get it at town for $5 practically everywhere I go.  I will not order from Amazon until they can actually become competitive with their price on Velveeta Cheese, 32 oz.
