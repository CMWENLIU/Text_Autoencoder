I am glad you ask for a review of this product.  The Cafe DuMonde is excellent but the company that ships it for you leaves a lot to be desired.  Of the 6 cans we received, 3 of them were badly dented in and it did not happen in shipping because the box was in excellent condition.  This leads me to beleive that they were dinged that badly when they were packed.  If I had ordered them all for gifts, they would not have been suitable.  I then called the company to let them know I was unhappy with the condition of the cans received and I left messages at least 3 times with my name & phone number and none of those calls were returned.  I will not ever order this product again through Amazon and I think you should check into this since it is a reflection on Amazon as well.
