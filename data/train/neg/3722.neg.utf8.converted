I decided to try multiple Hormel products when the sale made their price reasonable but I found many of the products to be just HORRIBLE!  This particular Chicken and Noodle is a bowl of salt with hard, thick noodles and a few little pieces of chicken.  They do give lots of sauce though!  I love sauce but ended up spitting out the noodles because they were just awful.  And though I love salt....this product was mostly salt.  I ended up giving all but the one I tried to eat to the local food bank.  I do feel guilty about that but I am sure someone might like this product.  I will never buy this product again and I do not recommend it to anyone.  Buy it at your own risk!!
