I really like all the other Kashi bars in this category, I used to buy the variety pack but changed my order when Amazon started offering subscribe and save for the individual GOLEAN varieties.  I initially resisted this particular variety since I wasn't interested in the idea of coffee cake.  However, every time I ordered another variety this came up as a suggestion.  I have tried new varieties in the past like the pretzel GOLEAN and really enjoyed them.  I finally decided since the main ingredients here were hazelnuts and cinnamon, both of which I like, how bad could it be? Well, I found out.  PRETTY BAD.  PRETTY, PRETTY, PRETTY, PRETTY BAD.  Way too sweet.  Way too artificial tasting.  Someone's really bad idea out of some experimental kitchen of which people should beware.  Awful!
