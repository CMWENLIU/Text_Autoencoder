After being warned by another review that reported their shipment was missing items, I took a chance anyway, because my daughter really wanted a venus fly trap.  I figured that 2 out of 3 plants arriving wasn't bad for the price I was willing to pay, since they were so highly desired.  2 out of three plants arrived, as others had warned.  Who knows what happened to the third plant?  Because my daughter was thrilled with the two that did arrive, I'll leave this review to warn others, but will not pursue it with the company.  The Scarlet belle pitcher plant did not arrive.
