I hate to blast the stuff, but it's major component is Fulvic acid, which give BLK in wonderful black color and unique mineral taste of iron and magnesium. Please note that Fulvic acid is a product of dead rotting organic matter. So basically if you went to your favorite lake or the Hackensack river, scrape up the soaked rotting leafs from the bottom of the water and squeezed out the water into a bottle, you would have made BLK.  It's not for me, But leafs more for you - Enjoy!
