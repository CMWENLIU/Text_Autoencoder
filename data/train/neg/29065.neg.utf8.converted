Over half of my cans were dented because of shipping damage.  I know the product is good, but I wonder if it's worth returning them since I'd have to pay for shipping.  Even though it's not their fault, I have to wonder if anything "can" be done of prevent this damage.  Just hoping the product will be safe and good.
