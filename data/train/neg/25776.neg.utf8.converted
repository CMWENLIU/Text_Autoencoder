I agree with the many reviews that have problems with dispenser. Didn't have a problem when it was new on market. Chances now of getting a spray nozzle that actually works are about one in three-five. Some break, some just fall apart and some won't syphon the fluid from the bottle. It does help control fleas and mosquitoes if you can get it sprayed but it's not worth the hassle.
