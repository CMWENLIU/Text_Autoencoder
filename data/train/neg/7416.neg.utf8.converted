I bought these imported sweet potato chips because they are less than half the price of SAM'S YAMS which are my dog's favorite treats. The first bag seemed fine, but the stored bags all developed what appears to be a silvery white mold, although the expiration date is December, 2013. I have no idea if this could be dangerous to dogs, but I tossed mine out, because we have had terrible problems with food poisoning of our pets from imported ingredients.<br /><br />If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know if the white stuff is natural or is, in fact, dangerous. Thanks!
