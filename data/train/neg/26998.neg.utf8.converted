I enjoy GF products, make many from Bob's Red Mill and am used to the taste. I read the reviews, many of which were very positive, and decided to try these crackers despite the high price.<br /><br />The taste, texture and smell of the crackers is very unappealing and the price is absurd.<br /><br />I do not recommend these crackers.
