I've lost all respect for Cascadian Farm in recent weeks for taking our favorite cereal bar none and turning it into junk overnight - this cereal had been our staple for half a decade since our son was a baby (now he's almost 5), because it tasted great and had no added sugar.  I found it when specifically looking for a cereal without the sugar, and it fit the bill for years.  Then suddenly a week ago our son said it didn't taste right and refused to eat it and I looked at the box and while nothing else on the box had changed the ingredients certainly had - I had one leftover old box and the old ingredients were whole grain oat flour, whole grain barley flour, wheat starch and sea salt, and the new ingredients are whole grain oat flour, corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, wheat starch, sea salt, tapioca syrup, molasses (i.e., they have now added corn meal, sugar, oat fiber, tapioca syrup and molasses and removed whole grain barley flour).  It's completely misleading - the new box has a picture of the old Purely O's, but the new cereal looks completely different from the old one, even though the picture hasn't changed. Now we're stuck with cereal we won't eat and can't return because it's opened.  I contacted the company to complain and asked where I could get the old formula and their response was not helpful - they didn't answer the question of where to get the no-sugar version and the response was pat - i.e., they were sorry to hear of my disappointment regarding this reform and would share my thoughts with the appropriate individuals.  This is so misguided and a perfect example of large companies getting into the organic business and managing to end up serving us junk by another name; the old product was quality, the new one is one to avoid.  While boycotting an entire company's product line is not typical for me, I am leaning toward refusing to buy ANY of their products any longer due to this change and the company's response to my inquiry; I can't in good faith buy from them when other companies are acting more responsibly.
