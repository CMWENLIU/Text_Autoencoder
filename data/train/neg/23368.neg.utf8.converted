This is the first negative review I've ever written, but I was really disappointed when this arrived and we tried it. We used to buy Agro Labs Naturally Pomegranate and really liked it ... It was nearly 100% pomegranate. Now it is filled with lots of other ingredients, including pear juice, apple juice, and other vegetable and fruit juices. It may have the same or more antioxidant value, but it's not nearly as tasty ... and I don't think it's worth this much money for a product that is diluted with non-pomegranate fruit and vegetable juices. We won't buy it again, and it's too bad they call it pomegranate juice!
