My wife and I purchased a 15 oz bag of Amport Foods pine nuts at our local Sam's Club and about one day after eating a small handful we developed a bitter taste in our mouths that made all other foods taste bitter/metallic.  The symptoms have been ongoing for three days now.  We contacted the Poison Control Center and it turns out that there have been several similar reports.  It seems to be some kind of product contamination and the symptoms may last for weeks.
