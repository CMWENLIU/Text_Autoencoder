I purchased based on the good reviews as I was looking for something quick and healthy, while providing protein. I usually enjoy black beans, and figured this HAD to taste good considering the reviews. But...OMG, terrible. I don't know what kind of taste buds others have, but this is inedible! I even feel bad donating to a food bank.
