Be careful with this one.  I thought I was buying what's pictured: a box of 6 packs of 12.  The low price should have been a giveaway, but I just figured it was old stock that they wanted to get rid of and I was only buying it to use in an activity in our Vacation Bible School.  When I received my one little box of 12 today, I went back to their amazon listing to see what happened, and sure enough, there is a warning that what's pictured is not a representation of what you're buying, and nowhere do they state exactly how many Fizzie tabs you're buying.  I wonder how many other people have been burned the same way.  If it's been a problem in the past, what they should do is post an accurate photo and accurate description.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />I will NOT be buying anything from this merchant again.
