The packaging is quite confusing.  It states on the front in fairly large type:  "Product of France."  The word "France" appears in several places.  On the back, in smaller type, presumably referring to the little package of "culinary sauce" that comes with the little tin of beans, corn, etc., it states "Product of Taiwan"  and "Produced in Taiwan under St. Dalfour direction."  Then, to the right, this time presumably referring to the tin of beans, corn, etc., it states:  "Product of France.  Packed for St. Dalfour [address omitted]."<br /><br />It is difficult to figure out where some or all of the contents were actually made.  I am guessing Taiwan but who knows.  Maybe the manufacturer is reading this and can clarify.<br /><br />As for flavor, well that is so subjective, it is hardly worth a review.  But, for whatever this is worth, no, it did not taste all that great IMHO.  Very bland.  And, here's something to consider:  purchased this product in early 2012.  The expiration date you ask?  That would be 7/2014!!  Makes you wonder, eh?
