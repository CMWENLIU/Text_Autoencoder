I bought this popcorn without reading the ingredients.  I never would have guessed that it would contain artificial sweetener.  I made a bag, and soon had a funny aftertaste in my mouth.  A familiar aftertaste.  Sucralose!  Who would expect to find that in a non "diet" popcorn!  WHY???  They ruined it.  It went in the trash.  We don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners and we don't like the fact that one's body doesn't know what to do with them.
