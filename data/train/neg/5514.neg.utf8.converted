I really don't think Amazon should try to sell natural products such as this that require refrigeration or temps below 70F and short storage life.  The box for this product had an unsealed top and the bars were floating around the bigger box it came in. I almost bit into one bar but fortunately opened it outside with sun light and could see well lots of green mold on it. Then I looked on the other bars and they were mostly all spoiled.<br /><br />The other pecan bars I ordered were not spoiled, but taste a bit dated.<br /><br />Too bad as these healthy bars are really tasy and healthy when properly handled.
