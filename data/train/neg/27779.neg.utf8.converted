I give this product 2 stars because the taste is really good, and the ingredients are natural and I did not have an allergic reaction.<br /><br />But this product is really hard. Nearly impossible to chew. I almost choked on it a few times before giving up.  I'll have to throw the whole case away - I can't eat them.  I even tried microwaving the laces for about 20 seconds, which helped, but as soon as they cooled down they went hard again.<br /><br />My advice is to stick with the vines or the bites, the bites being the softest of all.  I am off to order a case of raspberry bites....
