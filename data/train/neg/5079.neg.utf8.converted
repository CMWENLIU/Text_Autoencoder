These are disgusting and inedible. They are incredibly small cuts, almost like slaw. They are packed in citric acid which has completely saturated the product and gives them a horrible aftertaste. I can't believe this product is even being sold as it tastes nothing like palm hearts. I just purchased an entire case of 12 and will be throwing them all out.
