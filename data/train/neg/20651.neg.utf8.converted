They should rename this product Salt Paste For Butter Chicken Curry.  The sodium content is really high and I'm surprised by all the high reviews because you can taste it.  I even tried to add milk to cut it down but it only help minimally.  I understand how some people might like this if they like very salty foods and after all, you are adding 4 Table Spoons of butter to a 3.5oz product, it could be mud and it would be tasty to some people!  But for me, someone who eats Indian food often and realize that it's the butter and cream that can make things taste great just can't find the appeal in this product.  With a serving containing 480mg of sodium (1920mg for the entire 3.5oz)this product should be avoided not just because it's unhealthy but because it's just not really good. I'm adding 1 star because it's shipment was very fast.
