Item was listed as a palet of water for $14.57 plus s&H, however, I received a case of water...that's right, 24 bottles.  They charged me $19 for a case of water.  When I contacted the seller, they advised it was Amazon's error and offered to refund me 1/2 my money.  So it would be over $9 for a case of water! I put my boyfriend on the phone..and he got all of my money refunded as well as a free case of water!  I believe that if something is advertised, it should be honored!
