I buy this brand from a local store in bulk.  I was trying to save myself some time and hassle by buying it through Amazon (about same price either way as my local store).  But after this shipment (and a totally separate different food item shipped from Amazon *on the same order* that also had health/quality issues), I cannot recommend buying this from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent the case pack, wrapped in heavy plastic which was packaged neatly in a cardboard box.  When I pulled out the plastic-wrapped case, it was extremely obvious that these cans had burst... and had done so some time ago b/c an enormous amount of black mold had grown inside the plastic wrap.  Why this wasn't caught by their people, I don't know.  (I'm on "prime"; so, I get my shipments in 2 days or less...not enough time to have the mold grow that much.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did open the plastic surrounding the case of cans to inspect further.  I found that at least 4 cans had burst, and, of course, the stench was horrible.  I tossed the entire batch in the garbage.  There was no way I was chancing my family's health on this one.<br /><br />NOTE: (1) This item was fulfilled by Amazon, not a different seller.  (2) The boxes in which these were shipped was not damaged, not even a small dent.  (3) The cans were not dented, either.  This case was not damaged during shipment.  Whatever caused the cans to burst appears to be the result of an error during "Farmer's Market" manufacturing.  Furthermore, my assertion is that Amazon's people should have noticed the obvious black mold.<br /><br />[Edited to add: Initially (and after talking briefly with a doctor/scientist about these cans), I was given the impression that the burst cans were a result of botulism.  The scientist is the one who used that term with me b/c it had not occurred to me prior to the conversation.  Alarmed, I used the term in my original review w/o referencing the aforementioned conversation.  I have since removed the term.  Regardless, black mold is toxic (more so than green molds), and this experience was health and safety issue.]<br /><br />I will say that Amazon did give me my money back without a major hassle.<br /><br />In my experience WRT household/grocery items, it appears that Amazon gets good pricing from companies for stuff that doesn't meet that company's upper level quality control standards.  Besides all the great books, toys, electronics and more, I order several household items from Amazon.  Most of the items in this "household/grocery" category aren't edible/food items. I do notice minor differences in quality on these other household items.  For the most part, I can overlook them.  But on food?  No way.<br /><br />(To be clear: Other items such as books, electronics, toys have usually been just fine.)<br /><br />To sum up, when I say "tread warily" I'm suggesting that you just be careful and pay closer attention than you otherwise would when you order this (and perhaps other food items) from Amazon.<br /><br />Your experience may vary, and I hope it does.
