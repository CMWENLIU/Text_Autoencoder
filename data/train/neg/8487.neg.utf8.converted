The rice itself is not bad at all. But there is nothing spectacular about it. This small bag of rice is not worth the price they charge for shipping. Only get it if you have free shipping (7.80 is alot). I thought it would have some type of slightly different taste being organic but whatever. There is not even a huge difference in the production of this brown rice and other short grain brown rices. I would suggest that unless the shipping price goes below $2.25, maybe if shipping was for about $2 with no more than $2.25 for the item, than it would be a nice price. Otherwise, look for a less expensive short grain brown rice because it will have the same health benefits for you and let you buy more with your money.<br />Basically, it's just rice and it is overpriced (suggest you search your local chinese markets or grocery stores a little harder for short grain brown rice, or find one with a better shipping cost).
