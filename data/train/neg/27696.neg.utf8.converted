I am in cat rescue and have 20 plus cats in my care at any given time.  I have been buying Innova dry cat food for my cats for about 5 years now.  The cats love it and it has always seemed a good healthy choice for me to buy.  Recently, the food quality has taken a nose dive.  Last month, two out of the eight 15 lb. bags I buy monthly were so crumbly that half of the bag was nothing but powder.  I returned those bags to the merchant and waited a week for them to receive a fresh supply with a different lot number and expiration date and those 2 bags were also crumbly.  I have left messages for the manufacturer - Natura Pet -  to call me with no reply.  At this point, I am searching for a replacement food for my cats and you can bet it will not be manufactured by Natura Pet due to their unresponsiveness to the problems with their product.
