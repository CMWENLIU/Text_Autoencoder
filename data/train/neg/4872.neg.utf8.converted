I was so looking forward to a nice cuppa of Earl Grey but I had no idea what I was in for when I brewed my first  pot of Davidson's organic Earl Grey tea. It was the worst cup of brown liquid I've ever put in my mouth and as my granddad used to say, 'everybody has to eat a peck of dirt before they die.' The Bergamot oil was foul and the tea itself was sour, bitter and tasted of chemicals. I'm not picky, but DAMN!
