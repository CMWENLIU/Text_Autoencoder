I did subscribe and save for these chicken tenders - 2 packages per month.  The first two batches were fine and I thought they were priced fairly.  The last batch arrived and in both packages the treats were darker brown like they were overcooked (instead of that light golden color) and they were hard as bricks.  All of my dogs are small - 15 pounds or less.  My yorkie nearly choked on one of them  I have been giving my dogs chicken tender jerkies for over 2 years.  I am going to allow one more shipment of these to see if they improve and if they are still this bad, I will cancel my subscription.
