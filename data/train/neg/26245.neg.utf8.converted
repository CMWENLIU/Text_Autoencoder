I had previously tasted the pumpkin seed version of this snack, and it was very good.  I went ahead and ordered them in the walnut version because walnuts are supposed to be so healthy.  These turned out to be very bitter.  My children had to spit them out.  Some of them were bitter from the first bite, and others just had a bitter aftertaste.  I was informed by Amazon that you cannot return food items, so I went back and tried them again.  There seem to be some good ones among the bad, but for the most part, they have a bitter taste.
