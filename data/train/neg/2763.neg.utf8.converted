Recently, I've been searching for a good ginger tea.  Preferably, something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger.  Well, I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag.  However, once you brew it (and I let it steep a long time) you can't even taste any of the ginger.  What happened to all the spiciness?  I don't know, but it doesn't make a good ginger tea.  Furthermore, it doesn't even taste good otherwise, as it is really bland in flavor.<br /><br />I suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea, and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste.  Personally, though, I was really let down by this tea, hence the 2-star rating.<br /><br />I discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root.  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness, and is a whole lot cheaper.  So, if you are searching for spicy ginger tea, just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together.
