I bought a bar at Lindt, and it was nice and hot.<br />So good, I wanted a case of 12....<br />Sadly, the case I received was not spicy at all.<br />It was still good dark chocolate, though.<br />I would not have ordered had I known it would taste like dark chocolate without the hot chili spice that we were looking for.  Ten people in our family tried this, and all agreed it was mild at most.
