The main ingredient in this cranberry juice (maybe after water) is HFCS. If anyone reading this doesn't know the danger of this manufactured sugar, then please do your body and your families body a favor and find out the side effects of it.<br /><br />Some may say, that duh, you should know that most juices have HFCS in them now, that is true, HOWEVER, I ONLY buy Ocean Spray cranberry juice locally at Publix because the ones in the store have NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. I had no idea that "restaurant quality" meant "high fructose corn syrup", silly me.<br /><br />I was so annoyed with this shipment because it was too heavy to lift so it would've been a bear trying to take it to the UPS store to ship it back, and I didn't notice the HFCS until after my fiance had already consumed a can of the juice. So $50 down the drain. That's why I came here to warn other consumers, if you don't mind HFCS fine, but if you, like me, buy Ocean Spray because it's HFCS free, don't be fooled here. I know it's hard to eliminate HFCS from your diet these days, but there was no way my household was going to consume 552 ounces of the stuff under my watch. We drink it daily and that's a little too much consumption of this harmful artificial sugar for my sake.<br /><br />But I guess Ocean Spray is making a killing on these cans by using HFCS like all the other brands that do so, it allows them to make the same amount of product as their competitor, for way less cost, then they can undercut all the brands who are using other less harmful sugars (which cost more).
