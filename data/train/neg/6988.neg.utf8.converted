This was purchased instead of the advertised $200 system for keeping my two American Pit Bull Terriers in the back yard.  They walk through a fence whenever they feel like it and this worked great for about three months then nothing.  We discovered it no longer worked when we had to retrieve the dogs from the neighbors yard and repair the fence again.  Unfortunately I have tossed the receipt and the limited warranty is so vague as to what is considered covered damage it is hardly worth the fight for 20 something dollars so I will now do a web search for a more effective model that has an indicator light instead of sacrificing my husband to the gods of electricity, LOL.
