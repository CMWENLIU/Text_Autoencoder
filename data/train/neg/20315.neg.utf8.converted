No one in my family likes the taste of the cheese in this particular Deluxe brand of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.  We thought it would taste like or better than the original but it does not.  It has a very strange taste that we found inedible.  Better to buy one box first before buying this 12-pack only to find out you don't like it.
