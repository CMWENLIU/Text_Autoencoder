Tastes just okay for the price, just a bit too strong though.. But boy oh boy does this coffee stink! It has a very strong smell of tobacco, I have this coffee double bagged and in a cabinet, but can still smell it. This is not a coffee I will buy again, wish they had more flavors, if they had a light roast I might try it again. But think this order will end up in the trash..
