My vet says my cat is in the beginning stage of CRF. I've been changing his diet from dry Science Diet K/D to wet.  Everything I've been reading says wet food is best as long as it is human grade.  Unfortunatly, he won't eat the HI-Tor. Now I'm stuck with a case of it.  It should be sold in smaller quantities for trial purposes.
