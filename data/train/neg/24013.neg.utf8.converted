This is not chocolate at all! I don't taste the chocolate at all because there is hardly any cocoa in it. It taste like sugar and is too waxy. Before Reese's and Hershey's started adding junk like soy lecithin, which is vegetable lard, vegetable oils instead of cocoa, preservatives, and loads of milk into its ingredients, it used to taste so good you couldn't stop eating them. Nowadays, it hard to find 65% chocolate or more that is inexpensive because most brands like Hershey's and Mars hardly put an cocoa in their products.<br />Ingredients:MILK chocolate (Sugar; cocoa butter; chocolate; nonfat milk); lactose; soy lecithin; PGPR, emulsifier); peanuts, sugar, dextrose, salt, TBHQ.
