Warning! Warning! you might want to comb through your muesli for rocks. I just crack a piece about the 3/4 by 1/2 cm size rock with my teeth.  I am disappointed and thought Bob's Red Mill would have a higher standard of quality than this other brand.  This might be an isolated case, but having that size of a rock escaping their quality control is unacceptable.  And thank god that the rock crack into two pieces and not my tooth.
