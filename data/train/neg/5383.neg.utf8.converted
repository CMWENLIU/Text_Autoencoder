I am so upset that I didn't read the reviews first before buying this coffee.  I "assumed" all k-cups had coffee grounds inside.  I wondered why the k-cup was so light when I removed it, so I opened it ....and no grounds. This is nothing but instant coffee in disguise.  So much for a good deal on what I thought would be good coffee.  Never again.
