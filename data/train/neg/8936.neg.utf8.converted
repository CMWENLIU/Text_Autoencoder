I ordered this not realizing that wal-mart has the exact same thing (different brand) at wal-mart for $6.  Seriously.  Same size container, same size gumballs in their grocery candy section.  I was really hoping when this arrived that there would be "something" special about it, ie, bigger than I realized with more volume or larger size gumballs.  Nope.  Exact same thing as the $6 gumball container at wal-mart.  What a waste of money. Shame on me for not checking wal-mart FIRST.
