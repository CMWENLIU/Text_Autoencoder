Yeast extract, one of the ingredients, is code for MSG.  Go to truthinlabeling.com to get the low down on how it's legal for macdougalls to do this.<br /><br />Sneaky, but legal... Makes the entire macdougalls line suspect.  They should be open about the addition of MSG.  It makes many people sick.  So depressing to see this in a "health food".  This is why they can't advertise "no MSG" on the label or in their advertising... Get it?
