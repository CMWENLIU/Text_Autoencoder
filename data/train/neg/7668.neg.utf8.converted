Avoid this one...I've tried several boxes from two different suppliers and every one of them has been nasty.  I like medium and dark roasts, and this is definitely dark, but the roast is not the problem, it's most likely just terrible quality beans (or possibly old, but I don't think that's it).  Blech.<br /><br />If you are looking for dark Baronet coffee that is delicious, try their Sumatra or IMO their best, which is BLAST.  Not sure what the blend is in Blast, but the flavor is by far the best of all the many Baronet coffees I have tried.
