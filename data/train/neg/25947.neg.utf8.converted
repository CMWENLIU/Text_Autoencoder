Last year I purchased a case of this tuna at a similar price.  I was foolish enough, when the offer appeared again that I did not notice the differences.  Last years offer was for 24 5 ounce cans.  This year it was for 3 ounce cans.<br />Effectively it is cheaper for me to buy this tuna at my local supermarket than to buy it through you<br />My mistake
