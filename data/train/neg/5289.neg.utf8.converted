Loved the original formula, but the new and improved tastes burnt or like burnt caramel - it's awful.  Just returned a bottle marked "original" on the bottle but "new and improved" on the neck.  Coffee shop across from work has switched to another brand for the sugar free hazelnut due to all the complaints.  Bring back the original original - I'm keeping my eyes out for the "classic"
