We all know the product, the problem here was the packaging. They arrived having been melted and hardened again. Each candy was no longer a cup shape but a bag of abstract shapes, nothing like their oringinal form. They were ordered to be favors for a wedding. Labels had been bought with the newleyweds monogram in the shape of the pb cup. What a disaster!
