I have to say I was disappointed with this sample. The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect. The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature. The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package. I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing. The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing. These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth. Based on this sampling, I certainly could not recommend these cookies.
