Oh how I do adore the taste of bacon.  One of my favorite indulgences is to actually spread some  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LUM1ZU">J&D's Baconnaise Bacon Flavored Spread, Regular, 15-Ounce Jar (Pack of 3)</a> on each slice of my bacon at breakfast.  I don't use it every morning as it adds an additional 80 fat-laden calories per slice.  Spreading it on your bacon is the meat lovers equivalent of the popular chocolate donut with chocolate icing... crumble some pork rinds over the top and you have the equivalent of chocolate sprinkles.
