I ordered this gift package on extreme sale, and I still don't feel it was good value.  Many items were omitted or replaced -- I don't have it in front of me, but I don't believe I got the skeleton gummies, cotton candy, pretzels, or caramel corn.  No name-brand candies ("Tootsie rolls, Hershey bars, Skittles, M & M's and more!") were included; this was replaced by a bag of Breyers chocolates (a dollar at any drugstore).  "Pumpkin shortbread" and "pumpkin chocolate" cookies were pumpkin-shaped, but not pumpkin-flavored.  The coloring set and pumpkin-carving sets were dollar-store quality.<br /><br />The box was packed securely in Amazon's shipping box, but the bottom of the cute box was broken out and wouldn't pop back, so the contents slip out.  Unfortunate, since it's a nice design.<br /><br />I'm very glad it was shipped to me and not directly to the gift recipient.  I would have been embarrassed and I would never have known how much wasn't included.  You could easily make a better version of this gift box for under $10 at a dollar store.
