I have used wire gopher traps for decades.  From the description on Amazon, I thought this would be a quality trap.  I was wrong.  In fact, this is the worst trap I have ever bought.  It was totally useless.  I couldn't set the trap because it was either designed poorly or made poorly.  I don't know where this trap was made, but there was zero quality control.  Don't buy this trap.  You will be disappointed.
