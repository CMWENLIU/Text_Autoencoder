I work out every day and I've choked down the newest protein powders that tastes like chalk.<br />I eat tomatoes chopped up on food even though I hate them.<br />So after the first bite and that sudden WTF realization that this tasted nothing like apples or cinnamon I figured I would just trod through it.<br />My gag reflex had other plans! (I just burped and almost threw up again!)<br />I'd like to find what ever taste tester at Cytosport OK'd this flavor and punch him or her in the crotch!<br />I tried to give it to my dogs (they are the left over cleaner uppers) and they looked at me like I was holding a club in my hand!<br />They lick their own butts (one of the dogs used to eat from the cats' litter box) and they wouldn't come near it!<br />They must be smarter than me because I figured that I'd try a second container with whole milk instead of water.<br />So much for bigger brain=smarter.<br />I am going to try to feed the last four containers (uncooked) to the squirrels outside and see if they will eat it.<br /><br />Have you heard the saying "anticipation of death is worse than death itself"?<br />Well I have six containers of their maple/brown sugar as well.<br />And I am not too manly to admit that I am scared, yes SCARED, to try one!<br />(Burped again, choking back bile!)<br />I just ate a piece of bread slathered in mustard to block the taste.<br /><br />So in summary, AVOID THIS STUFF LIKE RAT POISON!<br /><br />I may yet call the poison control hotline.<br /><br />If you don't see a review of the maple/brown sugar flavor in the next week, call 911 for me!
