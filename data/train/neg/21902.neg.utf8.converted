It says "Pack of 2" in the text and photo. Yet they sent me one can. They added a comment in the receipt: "price is for ONE canister," as if they could change their minds after I placed my order.<br /><br />I've inquired and will report back what happens. If they send me another can, I'll change this to five stars. But it would be insane to pay for $20 for one can of cocoa, when it's $12 retail.
