This was the first k-cup I tried out with my Keurig coffee maker, and while good it had a weird metallic aftertaste. At first I thought it was because the coffee maker was new, but i'm still getting that weird taste after many other brews later. If you don't have sensitive taste buds it's great, but if you do.. stick with the Green Mountain Hot Chocolate.
