I bought these "Natural" almond butter squeezes.  It has sugar in it. Yuck!  Almond Butter does not need sugar.  It has 1.5 g of sugar and only 3 g of protein. So alot of sugar.<br /><br />My bad. But I really did not expect it. And food items cannot be returned. Watch what you buy at Amazon. What a waste of money.<br /><br />On the package it says:  One serving eqauals about a handful of almonds.  Hey, last time I looked almonds did not have sugar. Stay away from anything made by Barney Butter.com.  and any foodstuffs sold by Amazon.
