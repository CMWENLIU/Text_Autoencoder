I found that Grove Square French Vanilla Cappuchino did not have any pleasant French vanilla or coffee smell. The taste was somewhat medicinal with a bitter aftertaste. Not returnable at Amazon since it is opened and after exchanging emails with the company, Sturm Foods, Inc.,  I learned they do not refund customers based on "personal taste". I would suggest staying with a brand you know and love and avoid this "bargain" item.
