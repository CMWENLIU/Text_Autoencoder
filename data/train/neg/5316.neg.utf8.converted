I have been looking for red popcorn for some time and when I found this I was pretty excited and ordered it even though I had to order so much. I used to buy red popcorn when I lived in the midwest but have never seen it in the northwest. I have only popped it once and there were a lot of unpopped kernels.  My cheap yellow popcorn from the grocery store is much better than this.  I am very disappointed and don't recommend buying it.
