Order Placed:<br />August 9, 2011 pakcof 12 cans, 5,5 ounces<br /><br /> I have purchased this cat food several times in the past and my cats loved it. However, the last shipment on August 9 disappointed me, and my cats. The  design of the can has changed but that does not bother me. I AM VERY UNHAPPY ABOUT THE FOOD ITSELF. It is now almost liquid and does not really fill up the can, while it used to be solid-firm all the way up to the lid, like a good pate' cat food should be. My cats do not even like it anymore.<br />I would like to know if other buyers have noticed the difference or if by chance I received a shipment that is under par. I certainly will not buy it any more and will no longer recommend it to anyone. I would like for Amazon to forward my comment to Felidae. Why did they change the formula and make it worse? Changes like this damage a firm's good name in general.<br />Best regards, Vera Mottino
