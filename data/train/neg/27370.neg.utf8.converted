Minor's has changed their soup bases for the worse increasing the salt and starch filler at the expense of flavor.  I bought some soup bases a few years ago and especially liked the clam and mushroom bases.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer sent me a promo postcard years later offering free shipping and cheaper prices if I ordered directly so I ordered a bunch and the only tolerable one was the low sodium chicken.  This mushroom base is useless and you will taste acrid saltiness before you ever taste mushroom.  I use it in lieu of salt (with the bonus of an msg quality) in oatmeal, teff flour, ground beef and ginger pieces for a not quite Cream of Mushroom Soup stand-in.
