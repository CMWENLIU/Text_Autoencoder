WARNING - this product does not come sealed tight and will explode in the box that amazon sends it in.  The outside of the box was covered in cocoa but the box was not crushed or damaged in any way.  The plastic bag that holds the cocoa was split wide open and the powder was everywhere.  Neither Amazon or the manufacture will answer my calls or emails requesting a refund or exchange.  Buy at your own risk!
