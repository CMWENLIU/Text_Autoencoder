I used to buy this "Snapper soup" at our local ACME market. They discontinued over two years ago,and now I know why. The makeup of the contents has changed dramatically for the worse. It contains NO, and I mean NO pieces of snapper in the contents. It is absolutely the worst substitute I could even dream of serving to anyone. Since when is carrots supposed to make up a large portion of snapper soup? This is actually horrible. If you are from Philadelphia, as I am you know what good snapper soup is,and this doesn't even qualify for using that name. Poor, Poor, Poor!!!
