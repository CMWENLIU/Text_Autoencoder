This case of food was bad.  Every time I fed it to my dog he got sick.  This is a brand and flavor that my dog eats regularly, which we purchase from PetCo and have purchased in the past from Amazon.  He has never had any problem with it until this case.  Some of the cans were dented and I believe it must have been exposed to high heat or something.  I've thrown out can after can that has caused him to be ill.  I have waited several days before trying another can, and again, the same thing.  He has been throwing up all day.  I will never purchased canned food from Amazon again.
