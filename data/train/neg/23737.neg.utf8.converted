This product was a huge disappointment. I bought this planning to serve it at a Witches Tea party. It's a good thing I did a "rehearsal brew" first, because this was an absolute dud. The product is packaged attractively, but with no instructions. However, I'd read enough about presentation teas to know the procedure, which I followed carefully. Using my brand new, purchased-just-for-this borosilicate glass teapot, I chose a tea ball and placed it in the empty pot, then gently poured in very hot - but not boiling - water. The tea ball immediately floated and bobbed around as it slowly unfurled into a mass resembling a clump of seaweed. Eventually a whitish mess became visible in the middle, not in any way resembling the gorgeous yellow blossom pictured on the tea packet. Although disappointed, I thought the "flower" looked pretty creepy and just might work, since it was a Witches Tea after all. When the correct steeping time was reached, I poured a small cup of the heavenly fragranced tea to sample it. UGH. So bitter and vile, even witches wouldn't want it! I tried adding some honey, but still couldn't drink it. Really nasty stuff!<br /><br />I'm going to try another variety, just in case that one ball was defective. If I get better results, I'll post an update. But as of now, Primula Flowering Tea gets two thumbs down from me.
