My husband and I love the "regular" (with sugar) Miss Meringues when we do the Weight Watchers diet as the cookies are incredibly cheap in WW "points value" and provide a few tasty sweet bites. These Sugar Free ones, however, taste nothing like the regular ones and are really quite horrible . . . including a gross texture that gums up in your teeth when you bite them (nothing like an actual meringue) + a bad taste. Skip these! (If I could've rated this product 0 stars I would have.) They have no redeeming qualities.
