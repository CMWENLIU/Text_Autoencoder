I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this "premium" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called "Life's Abundance". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman.
