I ordered this on line because the local store quit carrying it, this product has the same name and packaging as what I was buying locally but the flavor isn't even close, the color is much darker also.  So now I have a six pack of sauce I don't like.  It must be packaged in more than one location, I really enjoy the local version but can't handle this version.
