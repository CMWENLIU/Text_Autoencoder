I purchased this for my three cats, as a way to deal with hairballs and add some vitamins to their diet.  All of them are generally healthy, but this was recommended.  I'm really sorry that I spent the money.<br /><br />I followed the instructions, adding a small amount to their food for two days.  They did eat it; something that surprised me.  Usually they don't like anything different with their food.<br /><br />By the middle of the second day all three of the kitties were spending the majority of their time sleeping and trying to find dark places to hide.  They only do this when they are not feeling well.<br /><br />I stopped using the supplement and within another two days they were back to normal.  My cats are not overly sensitive, but this product really affected them badly.  I strongly suggest you use caution before adding this to your cat's diet.
