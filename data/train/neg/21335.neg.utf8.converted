*****The 2 star review is not necessarily for the coffee inside the k-cup - but for the way the Van Houtte k-cups I ordered malfunctioned.*****<br /><br />I received 2 boxes of Van Houtte Honduras k-cups from Amazon in mid October.  The first few were fine - the coffee was good - nothing spectacular, but not bad either.  Then I noticed my machine was dripping very slowly, then hardly at all. I also saw that coffee grounds were dripping through along with the coffee.  When I opened the top of my Keurig machine, I saw that the k-cup was overflowing with water and coffee grounds. My Keurig machine was only a few weeks old and had been working wonderfully until that time.  I cleaned it out and tried another Van Houtte k-cup hoping that would take care of it.  The same thing happened.  I cleaned the machine again and ran hot water through it a few times to make sure the grounds were all out of it and tried a different brand of k-cup.  It was fine. I used the other brands for a few days and didn't have any problems.<br /><br />Then I tried the Van Houtte again and the same thing happened.  I repeated the cleaning - ran hot water through it and tried another one. Ditto.<br /><br />I think I may have gotten a defective box or two.  The foil on top isn't flat - but is puffed up as if there's too much air inside. The coffee doesn't seem to be very loose when it's shaken like the other brands of k-cups I have. Perhaps they were filled too much.<br /><br />Since I had used so many of the Van Houtte trying to fix my machine,  I figured I was stuck with the remainder.  I still called Amazon to let them know there might be a problem with the product. Not only did they refund my purchase  - they did not ask me to return the remainder of my order. I doubt I will use them - I'm afraid they'll clog up my Keurig machine.<br /><br />Thanks again Amazon - your customer service is terrific, as always.
