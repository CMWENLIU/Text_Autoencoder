This coffee ruined my 6-month old keurig so that I wound up having to throw out both the coffee and the brewer. It explodes out of the pod like sludge, stopping up the machine and making a filthy mess. I have never experienced this problem with another brand of pod coffee and am now back to Coffee People. Do Not Purchase this Product.
