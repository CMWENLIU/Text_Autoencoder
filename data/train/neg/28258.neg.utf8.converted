Let me start by saying that, unlike many other reviewers, I have absolutely no idea what kind of oil is good or bad for hair.  I have, however, always used and liked coconut oil products and, when I saw that listed as one of the ingredients (along with shea butter), I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I was also interested in this product more for my dry ends rather than for my scalp.<br /><br />Now, I've read many of the other reviews where they refer to this as an "ethnic" hair product.  I read the product description and all the information on the product itself, and don't see that anywhere.  But, since it seems to be an issue, I am mixed race with very long, fine, wavy hair.  I use no "ethnic" hair products and never have.<br /><br />On to the product:<br />I decided to use a very small drop of the product strictly on the ends of my hair.  The drop was smaller than a dime.  I rubbed it onto my hands and then into my hair.<br /><br />The smell was not unpleasant and didn't linger very long in my hair.<br /><br />The oil was very greasy.  It coated my hands unpleasantly and left an unpleasant sheen in my hair.  I didn't like the way that it looked so, although the instructions didn't say to do so, I brushed it in.  That made it a bit better, however my hair still looked greasy and heavy.<br /><br />The plain fact is that, like anyone else, I like my hair to look clean. Instead of imparting a healthy shine, this product made my hair look greasy and unwashed.<br /><br />Simply put, I will not be using it again.
