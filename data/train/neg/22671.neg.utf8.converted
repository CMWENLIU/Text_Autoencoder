I like McDougall's products. A lot. My favorites include: Black Bean and Lime Soup and the variety of oatmeals. The Pad Thai soup is not good. Both, the flavor and texture are disappointing. Even if you leave your knowledge of real Pad Thai behind, this soup just doesn't cut it... especially for the price. (The same goes for their ramens... yuck!)
