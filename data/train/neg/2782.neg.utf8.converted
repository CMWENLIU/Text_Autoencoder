Okay, maybe I'm an idiot for ordering Mayonnaise online, but you can learn from my mistake. When the mayonnaise arrived, the ingredients had separated out. It looks absolutely disgusting, and doesn't do much to inspire confidence that I won't get very sick consuming this mayonnaise. I'm not sure if this has been anyone else's experience, but I, for one, will not be ordering mayo online again. Incidentally, this product is, like all grocery products, ineligible for return, so I'm stuck with six bottles of eggwhites and vinegar.
