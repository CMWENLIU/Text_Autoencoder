Purchased these dates to enjoy right out of the pkg. but alas, they're too dry to eat except in recipes such as date-nut bread.  Very disappointed.  I hoped they would be as good as Sunsweet's in a can, but were not at all.  Too bad--I like the convenience of the foil pkts.  I would not buy these again--BIG WASTE OF MONEY.
