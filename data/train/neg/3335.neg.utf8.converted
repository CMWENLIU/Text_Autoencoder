The Gevalia Morning Roast fills a coffee cup to the top so that there is no room for creamer.  I could forgive that and use a larger mug but what I can't forgive is the lack of flavor.  It's listed as "medium" but I find it weak and tasteless.  Full disclosure: I like bold coffees.<br /><br />UPDATE:  If you find yourself with a box of this coffee, here is a workaround for lack of flavor.  Turn off your machine when the coffee level is at the level of a normal 11 oz. cup of coffee.  You will find something to taste when you leave out the rest of the water.
