The production description did not mention the size of the traps. SAFER previously sold "Sticky Whitefly Traps", which I liked a lot but couldn't find in my store any more. So I ordered these traps, assuming that the size of the traps would be similar. But these traps (1.25"x3.75") actually came less than 1/5 of the size of the previous traps (6"x4"). Besides, these traps are only sticky on one side, while the previous ones were sticky on both sides. So counting the sticky surface, these traps are 1/10 of the size, but I paid 1/2 of the price comparing to the previous ones. These did come with stakes which were not included with the previous product, but I don't seem to care much for them. I think the size information will be very helpful for consumers to decide whether the product meets their needs.
