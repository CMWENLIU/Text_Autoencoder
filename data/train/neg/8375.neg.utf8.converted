I found these beans to be nothing special. I found their flavor to be boring and bland compared to the best of other Cannellini beans I've purchased in bulk from health food stores. On the positive side, the beans were big, plump, and fairly healthy (many had crosswise deep cracks, which was not good) and seemed fresh (purchased 12/2009 and had "best by" date of 9/2011). They cooked quickly, which is a sign of freshness, and they tasted fresh.<br /><br />But their flavor was bland; some nice mineral notes, but just not very "beany." There were also some slightly off earthy notes, which I did not care for. I also found their texture to be a bit grainy and not very creamy.<br /><br />I cooked them once with an overnight cold soak in a salt brine (as recommended by Cook's Illustrated to tenderize skins, which really works) and once with a one-hour hot soak in brine (Cook's Illustrated's recommended quick method). One time I cooked them on a very slow simmer to keep the beans whole (which does sacrifice some creaminess), and once at a strong simmer to let the bean skins break open to maximize creaminess. But even this latter method failed to make them creamy -- unlike most white beans. I cook lots of dry beans and have many years of experience cooking beans, so how these beans turned out had nothing to do with how I cooked them. The best of other white beans I've had cook up wonderfully creamy and flavorful. These beans were just far from the best.
