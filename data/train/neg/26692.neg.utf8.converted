I am a huge fan of the betty crocker fudge brownies which always turn out incredible, but these were a disaster.  I cooked them in an 8x8 glass pan just like it said, and they were still completely uncooked in the middle after 50 minutes.  I continued to cook them another 20+ with no luck.  I was able to salvage the ones around the outside but the middle brownie portion was completely raw to the point where when I stirred it up with fork, it became the normal liquid consistency of uncooked brownies, even though the cookie part seemed baked.  I ended up throwing the entire middle away.  What a waste.  Stick to normal brownies, these are a joke.
