This item, requiring refrigeration, shipped from Kentucky.  The weather was very warm. It was transferred from USPS to FedEx for transport, then back to USPS for delivery. It was in transit over a week before delivery was attempted in Minneapolis, MN.  After I refused delivery, tracking history showed USPS giving it a tour of the Midwest for the best part of another week.  It finally ended up being put back in Amazon's stock, according to an e-mail I received from Amazon.  I hope that report was inaccurate, because I'm sure the stuff was rancid by then.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAO91K">Nutiva Organic Hempseed Oil, 24-Ounce Bottle</a>
