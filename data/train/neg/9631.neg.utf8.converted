Aerogarden doesn't live up to it claims.  Plants on outside corners underperform. I contacted Aerogarden directly and they sent me a new pump, which means you have to disassemble the unit and take the plant pods out to install. New pump doesn't seem to make much difference.  Save your $ and grow your herbs outside during growing season!
