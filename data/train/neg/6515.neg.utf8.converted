I have given my cats Goodlife twice--the first time on purpose, the second on accident. All Goodlife products give my cats severe diarrhea. I only gave them a few pieces of this cat treat before I remembered that this brand was bad. It was not a pretty picture. I believe the problem might be all of the vegetables they have put in this. It looks great to people (vegies are supposed to be good, right?), but cats are obligate carnivores, and all this grain and vegies isn't good for them. Don't buy this unless you enjoy cleaning crap off of your floors.
