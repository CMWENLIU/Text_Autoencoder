As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium.
