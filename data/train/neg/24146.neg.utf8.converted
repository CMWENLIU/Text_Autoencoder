I've had Mr. Trivedi's energy transmissions, and I can feel that energy. So, I bought the water because I thought it would be a nice way to stay "energized" in my daily life.<br /><br />First of all, right on the label it states clearly that it is municipal water treated with reverse osmosis. When I first drank it, it seemed "dry" to me, which is to say it didn't hydrate me the way the water I'm used to drinking does. I usually treat my water with a purifying product, then run it through your basic pitcher filter, nothing expensive. But "my" water feels wetter than the Trivedi water did. It's hard to describe how the Trivedi water made me feel, but it was as if I hadn't even had any water...like, it was just nothing, and all I wanted was MORE water! I can understand if it's "infused" with a "drink more" energy because most people don't drink enough water, but it's too expensive, in my opinion, to drink more, drink more, drink more!<br /><br />AND, I hate the thought of buying water in little bottles. I NEVER buy bottled water because of the huge plastic waste it produces, so I won't be buying anymore of this water, simply because I refuse to put more empty plastic water bottles into the world. Even if it were the most miraculous water on the planet, I wouldn't buy it as it's currently packaged.<br /><br />One last note, I used the water to water an orchid that was given to me as a house warming gift....it totally killed my orchid. I'm not kidding. I watered it according to the correct watering protocol for orchids, as I had been watering it since I'd received it, but when I used the Trivedi water on it, it started to drop leaves, and when I looked at it to see what was happening to it, I found that the soil was completely full of mold and the plant was dead. :(<br /><br />I would like to say that if the Trivedi Foundation started with a more "alive" water - as in REAL spring water - as opposed to municipal RO water, just the water by itself would at least have some value.<br /><br />In closing, I'd like to say that I'm not trying to tell anyone NOT to buy this water. I'm only relating my own personal experience with it.<br /><br />Thank you!
