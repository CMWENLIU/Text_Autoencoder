For something as alluring as the "black pearl" name, I really didn't find much difference between this tea and the mass bulk lipton tea packs. I'd say the only difference is the size of the leaves, which are bigger for this tea.<br /><br />However, the bags for some reason are poor quality despite each bag having a much higher unit price compared to the bulk one. Three times I've had leaves leak out and go into my tea and I've noticed that there are leaves in the box from another ripped bag. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I like my tea leaf-free. I'd give it 3 stars for average taste, 1 star for bag quality, so it averages out to 2.
