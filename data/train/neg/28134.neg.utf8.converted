I bought these, and while I'm glad I tried them, I wouldn't ever buy them again.<br /><br />I'm serious about my bacon, and I've tried all three of the available maple bacon lollipops: Man Bait, Lollyphile, and Roni Sue, and of the three these are the last ones you should buy. They're tiny, taste nasty (both of the other two brands are delicious), and it's clear as to why they're the cheapest option. Google Roni Sue, a small company out of New York that infuses their maple bacon lollipops with tea, or Lollyphile, who makes giant lollipops that taste like maple and bacon. Both of them are more expensive, but real bacon freaks will be glad they went with quality.
