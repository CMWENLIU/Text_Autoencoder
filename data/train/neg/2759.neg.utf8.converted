After reading the other reviews, I was hoping the batch being shipped are made from Japan.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I received the "Product of Thailand" batch today.<br /><br />Really wanted to taste the ones made in Japan as everyone says it is better.<br /><br />Amazon, please specify where these are coming from (Japan or Thailand) so we can decide on ordering or not!<br /><br />Thanks!
