I enjoyed Lindt Excellence 70% as a lunch treat for over ten years. It was a real favorite of mine, and I trusted a company like Lindt to not mess with a 165-year tradition. I was wrong. Lindt seems to be pursuing Hershey (or worse) now, instead of keeping a proud tradition alive. (The recipe has, by the way, only changed for the US market.)<br /><br />Lindt is still calling this Excellence 70% Cocoa (although the tag at the bottom does say "Smooth Dark" instead of "Intense Dark"). But it is a (literally) pale reflection of the original recipe, and an insult to the Lindt tradition. At least when Coca Cola screwed up, it had changed the name to New Coke so it could easily bring back Classic Coke. Lindt is now stuck, by drastically changing the recipe but not changing the name. Those who liked the old recipe have abandoned them with this change, and are not likely to trust them again, and those who like the new recipe will react the same if they change it back. I think this one will be studied in biz schools as a "how not to do it" case.
