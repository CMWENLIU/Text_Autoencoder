Quite literally, I have never seen anything like this gift basket construction from Back Mountain Baskets represented here by the igourmet label. And unfortunately, I don't mean that in a positive way. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. Heck, these are even advertised as gourmet items!  Only a couple of items might actually qualify as exotic or gourmet.  At a $49.99 list price, there is maybe $20 worth of small snacks, most of which could be replicated at your local convenience store. If I had made a gift basket at home, it would have been classier and more tasteful than the horribly amateurish efforts made by this company.<br /><br />I won't even discuss the quality of the items included in the basket which I actually have some serious reservations about. This basket is NOT something that you would (or should) pay to have a professional company assemble due to packaging. Many of the included items are stuffed into boxes and wrapped rather cheaply with handmade labels. Okay, not a very deluxe or fancy presentation. But what's worse (and frankly unforgivable) is that the boxes used are not plain white gift boxes or something else presentable--no, they are emptied trash from other products re-purposed.<br /><br />Do you want your elegant food items (again I'm being generous with the item quality) in old cracker boxes glued back together? Just whose recycling bin have they been raiding? It's rather distasteful. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about--first is the empty box used and in parenthesis is the actual item inside:<br /><br />Keebler Club Cracker Box (pretzels)<br />Stauffer's Animal Cracker Box (other cookies)<br />Crystal Light Fruit Punch Box (candies)<br />Nabisco Wheat Thins Box (popcorn)<br />Jello Gelatin Box (cookies)<br /><br />These are but a few examples of boxes used to repackage other items. I got two of these baskets and they were both constructed in a similar manner. Seriously. If you paid to have an elegant gift basket, would you expect to find loose candies glued into a Crystal Light box? As I said, there isn't even the common sense and taste level to use plain white boxes. It would be an embarrassment to send this as a gift item. Due to the packaging, I even threw a number of items straight into the trash as I was not confident of their handling due to the obvious lack of professional standards. A huge disappointment and very unappetizing all around. KGHarris, 10/11.
