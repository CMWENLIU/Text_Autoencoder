//This soup is actually tasty, but is not gluten free. Less than 10 ppm?? Give me a break!! I have tried this soup twice on my 3 yr old and both times he has a instant reaction. Call the phone number on the back of the can and you get a person that doesn't have a clue and literally will read you what the back of the can says. Couldn't even tell me if it was processed in the same facility with gluten. His exact words "Ma'am, it says gluten free on it." Useless. Do some digging on the internet and you'll find a company statement saying "natural flavors and spices might contain traces of gluten". Put it on the can!! Just wanted to write a warning to all the sensitive Celiacs out there.//
