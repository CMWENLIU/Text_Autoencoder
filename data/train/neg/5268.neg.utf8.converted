These were okay at first. We (my kids and I) ate them on the go when we had nothing else. They're super tiny, so just as a snack my 1-year-old usually wanted more than one. I enjoyed though that these seemed to be a fairly healthy convenience snack. Then one day I bit into one of them only to discover a big ugly bug had been packaged with it! Yuck!! I won't be eating any of these anymore. Neither will my kids. I like organic, but not THAT kind.
