I bought a box of this recently.  Even though it sounded pretty "healthy", I figured, how bad can it be.<br /><br />Well, I just had my first serving, and decided that I would share a recipe that very closely approximates the taste and texture of this cereal.  Here it is:<br /><br />4 cups course saw dust<br />1 cup raisins<br />2 Tablespoons sugar<br />1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon<br /><br />Blend all ingredients, serve with cold milk.<br /><br />How on earth can anyone give this stuff more than one star?  The serving size listed on the box is 1/2 cup. First of all, who eats 1/2 cup of cereal?  I doubled up on the serving, and poured a full cup in the bowl... added some 2% organic milk..... yummmm!  Wrong!  Now I know why the serving size is specified at 1/2 cup..... anybody that can gag down more than a half cup of this stuff in one sitting, is a better man than I am. Seriously.... what possible reason could anyone have for eating this stuff?  I tried my best to choke down this stuff, but the more I ate, the worse the experience became.  About a third of the way through, I cried uncle and dumped the remaining meal in the trash.<br /><br />There may be a use for this cereal, but eating it, is not a viable option.  I don't even think birds or small rodents would want to eat it.  I may mix it with some water, and fill some of the cracks in my driveway with it.
