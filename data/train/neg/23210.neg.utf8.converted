I've purchased about 5 cans per month of this for about 14 months. At first, this was a wonderful product.<br /><br />Later, I started finding the bad can occasionally - where the taste was akin to either the product having a metallic reaction with the can, or the product tasting like it had gone bad. But it didn't happen often enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />In the last few months, I've purchased more bad cans than good ones. I've written to their company, and called, numerous times. They don't seem too interested in my findings, sadly.<br /><br />Just now, I read another reviewer's comments stating that Thai Kitchen was bought out about a year ago. That seems to coincide with when my dis-satisfaction with the product began. Not only is the taste often bad; but formerly there would be a nice thick lump of cream at the top of the can, and a bunch of thin watery milk at the bottom - as one would want.  Now, however, the product is as thin as coffee creamer all the way through. It never thickens upon refrigeration, either. Clearly, there is NOT as much fat in the product as formerly. So disappointing!<br /><br />I wanted a product without sodium metabisulfate - which is a huge allergy trigger. The other recommended brands like Chao Koh have the sodium metabisulfate. Thai Kitchen does add guar gum, but I can live with that. If only they could keep their quality consistently good!<br /><br />I'm testing A Taste of Thai presently, which is more coconutty tasting, but is very thin and I'm not sure if I like the taste yet (there is an extra fruitiness that I can't quite identify and it is a little overpowering.)<br /><br />It shouldn't be this hard to get a good prepared coconut milk!
