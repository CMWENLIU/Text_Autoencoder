After reading reviews about Baklawa-w/Walnuts in amazon.com, I also ordered for one package, my seniors and co-workers liked it. I ordered for 3 more packages that were sent out to my friends in different cities, everyone liked this Baklawa. However last week, I decided to order for 2 packages of Baklawa (Baklava) w/Pistachios, believe me no body liked it.You would think that this stuff should be as good as other stuffs made of Pistachios,but no way--just a wastage of money. I feel sorry for spending about 35 dollers on this poor quality product without any taste.I don't know if the pistachios used in this product is of low quality or what is the problem??.
