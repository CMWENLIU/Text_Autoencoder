Since this is a sale price, I assumed it was for the 30 lb bag.  My bad, as I ordered the product and then emailed to verify.  Turns out it's for their smaller bags.  There's a good chance you can buy the same product for a lot cheaper at your local pet store.<br /><br />Customer service has been quick to get back to me, however 15 days+ since they've receive their package back I'm still awaiting a refund.  Overall, this is a horrible value for what is being offered.
