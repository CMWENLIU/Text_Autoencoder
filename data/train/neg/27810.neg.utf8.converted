I have enjoyed this cereal for years, recently they redesigned the box (taller / thinner) and changed the recipe. Looking at the ingredients it seems to be an increase in barley and a decrease in other stuff. Well, the new recipe is - to me - just bad. It used to taste almost like eating banana nut bread; now it is more like banana+cardboard. It is becoming harder each day to find a good, but not over-sugary, cereal.
