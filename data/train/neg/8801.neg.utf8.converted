With coffee prices going nuts, I decided to start trying a bunch of different ones to see if I could find something affordable and tasty. Chalk this one up as a failure. This stuff has no taste. Accidentally put too much in my machine, but decided to leave it in to see if that created flavor (plus I could use it up faster that way). The result was another bland pot of coffee. Definitely won't be buying this stuff again.
