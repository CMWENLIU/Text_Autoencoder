I have used real butter for years.  This product is a shabby imitation, at best.  It has practically no flavor, didn't taste even close to real butter to me.  And if you mix it per instructions, it is extremely watery and has none of the "texture" of real butter.  It was so disappointing I wouldn't even give it away to the local food bank.  I simply threw it all out.  It seemed like a healthy idea, but I'd actually rather use nothing at all as a condiment than to use this product.
