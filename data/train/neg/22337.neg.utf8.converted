I purchased two bags of these Wonderful Pistachios, and both of the bags I received were good.  So, I ordered them again.  The second time I ordered them, in each of the two bags I received, were so many either burned or rotted pistochios...about half of each bag had to be thrown away.  The last straw was when I cracked one that looked only mildly burned and discovered to my horror a WORM!  In addition to the worm was a lot of weird-looking, brown matter.  DISGUSTING!!!!  Needless to say, I found them far less than "wonderful" and will NOT be buyng them again.
