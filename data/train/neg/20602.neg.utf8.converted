I buy this in 14-oz bags at the supermarket.  Unlike most quinoa, the package I buy says "No rinsing needed," and until recently they were right.  But last week I opened a fresh bag, only purchased a few days earlier, and cooked some of it as I normally do.  It smelled funny while cooking and had such a bitter aftertaste that we had to throw it all out.  I sent an e-mail to Earthly Delights several days ago but have rec'd no response.
