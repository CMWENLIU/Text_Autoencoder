In all fairness the packaging is sort of pretty. Thats about it, there is next to nothing included in the tiny boxes. At least they could have used a bit more effort when it came to how much goes inside. Not worth the price, will probably add 'extra' from the store before giving it as a neighbor gift this year. My fault for getting caught up in the amazon lightening deal frenzy.
