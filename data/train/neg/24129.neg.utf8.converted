My cats enjoy this food, and it is of good quality, however, now that I am a regular subscriber I have found that someone is being very careless in packaging and delivery.  My last order arrived in a box that was too big, poorly packed, and half opened at my door.  When I looked inside, I found several cans had exploded and many more were all dented and loose inside the box.  What a mess!  So, after a long day at work, I found myself rinsing and inspecting cans of cat food.  The price has gone up also, and at this point I am thinking it would be less trouble to buy from the pet store again.  At least I won't end up with a mess at my door!
