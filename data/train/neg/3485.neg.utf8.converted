I feel for all the hype on these noodles.  I bought the six pack of the angel hair noodles.  I followed directions on the package and then served them in my stir fry as my noodles.  They smell like fish, and have a texture like worms.  It is the most horrible thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Now I have five left and can't return these things.  I may try putting them outside to see if the birds or raccoons will eat them.
