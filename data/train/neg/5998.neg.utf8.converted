I can't believe that Walden Farms markets this product! The taste is blah,the texture is gluey. If I liked pb cookies I might bake with it. I ended up throwing it out. I'll suck up the calories and carbs from other products. Truly disappointted as I use the WF salad dressings all the time (sometimes as a marinade). A big stinkofor the PB!
