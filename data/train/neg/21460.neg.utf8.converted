My daughter who has Celiac had a severe reaction after eating this and the Mesa Sunrise Cereal also by Nature's Path for several days. This was the only new food in her diet so I checked the website of Nature's Path for more information. it turns out they make their GF cereals on the same equipment as the gluten ones. They promise they wash the equipment and throw away the first part of the cereal made yet there was still enough there for my daughter to react. I would never have bought this cereal if I knew that it was made in the same room much less the same equipment. Some companies are ethical and will admit when their food is processed in the same area or on the same equipment so people like my daughter have a choice of whether to risk their health or not.
