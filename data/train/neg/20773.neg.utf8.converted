I WAS MOST DEFINITELY NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEIPT OF MY ORDER FOR HAVAHART CRITTERE RIDDER.  I purposely ordered the large container (5 lbs).  The container I received had approximately 1 lb of material, hardly enough to complete the job fo which it was intended.  I do hope this was an error and not deliberately deceptive packaging.  Please reply.<br /><br />Kenneth K. Rose
