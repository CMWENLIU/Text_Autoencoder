This so-called natural sushi ginger includes the preservative, potassium sorbate, which is a synthetic preservative.  That's not exactly "natural" in my opinion and had I know that this product contained that preservative, I would not have purchased it.<br /><br />You will notice that the photo of the package does not include the term, "natural," on the package itself.  That term is only in the title and write-up here on Amazon.  I don't know who is responsible for these write-ups but I would suspect it is the specific vendor/provider of the product and not an Amazon's employee, but I don't know.<br /><br />You will also notice that the ingredients are not listed in the "information about product" area, unlike the other Roland sushi ginger product, which does list potassium sorbate as an ingredient. For those of us who seek out foods without preservatives, the product information provided here plus the use of "natural" is misleading, at best.<br /><br />Clearly, this product should not be touted as "natural."  To be clear, fundamentally, potassium sorbate is non-toxic and is regarded as safe. However, its synthetic characteristic is not looked upon favorably by many nutritionists and health-conscientious consumers.  Prolonged use of the preservative could lead to allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea and nutrient loss in food. Toxicity of potassium sorbate is equivalent to that of table salt.<br /><br />Given the large amount of sushi ginger that you will receive if you order this--a total of 96  ounces, you will indeed consume it, and its preservative, for a prolonged period of time.<br /><br />Unless you toss it out, like I will be.
