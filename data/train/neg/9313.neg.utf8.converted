I paid almost $20 for a 2 box pack (24 squares) of the chocolate chip and banana walnut squares at Costco and found the taste to be below average. They may be good for you, but that's about all. I find Quaker Oats or Nature valley nut bars far more appetizing and tasty.<br />I am never buying these again.
