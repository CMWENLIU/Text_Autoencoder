I eat rolled oats mixed with a little breakfast cereal most mornings and thought this would be a great to use to switch things up a little bit.  It is probably very healthy but tastes pretty bad, for me.  Even if I add just a little bit to my oats or cereal, I can taste the bad flavor.  I have tried it with different combinations and I just can't make it taste good.  Too bad it was four packages :(  At least my order qualified for free shipping...
