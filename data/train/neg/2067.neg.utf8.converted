Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract.  While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims, they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast.  They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe, however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process, but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections, I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection.
