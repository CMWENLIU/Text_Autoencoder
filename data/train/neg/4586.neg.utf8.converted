3 years ago we looked long and hard for a sugar free, whole grain finger food for our then 6 month old.  Our son enjoyed this cereal as a snack and until recently, as a cereal, but then I bought my most recent box and noticed right away they didn't look the same.  When I tasted one I immediately knew they were sweetened and sure enough, when I checked the nutrition label it showed 3g of sugar per serving.  The label is completely unchanged except for the ingredients and this is dangerously misleading.  We live in a country where diabetes is rampant and sugar can be very dangerous.  How frightening that they Cascadian Farms/General Mills would sneak sugar into their cereal without changing any of the main labelling.  I will never buy anything from them again!
