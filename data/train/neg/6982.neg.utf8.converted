When I ordered this product, it said it was real cinnamon (i.e."canela") and "product of Sri Lanka". I ordered based on that, but they sent me Indonesian "cinnamon" (not Canela). Not at all what I wanted, and this item has been deemed "not eligible for return", and the website has been revised to match what they sent me.<br /><br />I don't think they did it to be evil, but they should have admitted they no longer stock what I ordered instead of taking my money for something I did not want. This product is WAY too expensive for common non-canela "cinnamon", so I feel a bit ripped-off.  And now I still have to find some real canela. Two stars, because it's probably an overpriced yet adequate product if you weren't bait-and-switched from something else. For me, it was just a total waste of time and money. :(
