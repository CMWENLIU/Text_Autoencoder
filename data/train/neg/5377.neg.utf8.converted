This is instant coffee.. After receiving 4x 24 packs and trying it i realized that the k-cup was empty after the brew.<br /><br />Marketing people at grove Square pulled a good one, they call it "soluble" coffee... clever<br />anyone wants 95 k-cups before i toss them?  (no returns on grocery items)<br /><br />Amazon please add "instant coffee" to your description
