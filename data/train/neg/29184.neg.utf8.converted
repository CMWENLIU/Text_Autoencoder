Fiber one bars actually don't have real fiber.  They contain inulin (from chicory root) which is technically fiber because the body can't digest it.  Unfortunately fiber is defined by anything that can't be broken down easily.  These bars do not contain REAL fiber. (The real fiber usually found in whole grain breads and cereals) So if it says "chicory root" or "inulin" in the ingredients, you can be sure you aren't eating the fiber your body can actually use.
