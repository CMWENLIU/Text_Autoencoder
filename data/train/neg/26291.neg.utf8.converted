I live in the middle of nowhere so if I want to try new food products I've read about, I often have to come to amazon.com to find them.  I've only had a few products arrive that I felt were duds. I recently read a raving review by Hungry Girl about this product , and decided to give it a shot.  Wow, not good.  It may be made from corn, but it tasted more like a rice cake to me, and not a very good one at that.  Plus, the cracker itself has this wrinkly brain appearance...it's kind of creepy.  Not wanting to be the only judge, I gave some to my husband to try.  He loves snack foods and will eat just about anything.  He tasted a couple and said "you don't need to bother with these again".  We threw the rest of the box away.  They aren't worth the calories.
