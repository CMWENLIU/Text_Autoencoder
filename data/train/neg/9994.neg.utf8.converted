Ordered 6-1 Pound Bags of M&M's (Org, Blk, and Silv). 3 boxes (2 lbs each) arrived of M&M's put directly in tissue paper loose in the box. NOT IN BAGS AS DESCRIBED!  After agruing with me that they are only M&M's and they would still have a long self life, I was told I could return the M&M's, but if any of them were broken I would NOT receive my credit. Now I am supposed to pack them better than originally sent to get my money back? Do Not Order from this seller.
