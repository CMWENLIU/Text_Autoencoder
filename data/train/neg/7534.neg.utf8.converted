Like many of the other one-star reviews, our food maker doesn't puree the food because the blade doesn't move. I plan to send it back to the company for a repair, per the instructions on the Baby Brezza website- it's annoying to have to send $10 for return shipping for a $100 product.  In addition, I haven't been able to actually reach a person to talk to since the customer service number is not in service anymore.  I tried calling their main line and was transferred to someone's voicemail. No returned call from them yet...<br /><br />In the mean time, I've been successfully pureeing the baby food with my Cuisinart stick blender.  I should have tried that out first before buying this one step food maker.  I was lured by the 'one-step' process, but hopefully you won't be.
