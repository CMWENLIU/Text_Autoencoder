I have to say this is a bewildering product.  When do I apply it?  During a shower? Afterwards?  There are no instructions, so I simply tried many ways of using it before writing this review.<br /><br />Using it in the shower, this makes my hair too oily to dry and style properly.  (What would be the point of washing the product out?  And, anyway, I tried, and found it took at least two shampooings!  Which defeats the purpose of "nourishing my scalp.")  Using before bedtime results in oily pillows.  Before brushing my hair in the mornings is a bit better, but then my hair looks oily and flat.<br /><br />Probably the most worrisome effect associated with "Clear Scalp" would be (get ready for "Eewwww")...bigger dandruff flakes.  That's right, my scalp felt nice, and I got less flakes--but they are much, much bigger in diameter since I started using this product.<br /><br />As another reviewer here says, it is basically mineral oil with fragrance.
