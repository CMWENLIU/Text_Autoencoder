Dark chocolate has been well established now to have major heart-health benefits. Only 20 grams (just over 0.7 of an ounce) per day will halve your risk of heart attack, which is a pretty impressive achievement for a chocolate bar!<br /><br />But there is an important caveat here. One of the things I like best about the version of this product that I buy here in Australia is that it has no dairy in it at all. From a health perspective this is very important. Dairy foods block absorption of some of the beneficial phytochemicals in chocolate (the flavanols in particular), which is why eating dark, as opposed to milk chocolate is so important.<br /><br />However, I have also seen a version of this product that does have milk in it, and it is far from clear which version we are getting here. At the time of writing, there is no list of ingredients on the product page. What I can tell you is that Amazon does sell a 70% cocoa version of essentially the same product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0">and on that product page there is a list of ingredients</a> which states that the product on sale DOES contain whole milk powder. The fact that whole (as opposed to skim) milk products are used renders this an especially bad choice, since whole milk products have been found to be more potent in blocking absorbtion of the beneficial flavanols.<br /><br />In response to some of the comments I have already received on this review, it seems to be necessary to stress that whole milk powder is specifically listed AS AN INGREDIENT. We are NOT just talking about the standard warning that the equipment used to manufacture the product may also have come in contact with dairy.<br /><br />What's more, despite the fact that whole milk powder is listed as an ingredient, the 70% cocoa version's product page states that it is suitable for vegetarians and VEGANS [my emphasis]. Do these people even know what "vegan" means? It hardly inspires confidence. It's also worth noting that by contrast, this product - the 85% cocoa version - is only described as "suitable for vegetarians". No mention of vegans anywhere. This heightens my suspicion that the product on sale here does have dairy in it.<br /><br />All this is a great pity because otherwise I consider it a very fine chocolate. So it may be worth your while to continue watching this space. My hope is that the version on sale here on Amazon will ultimately be replaced by a dairy-free alternative, just as it has been in Australia.<br /><br />Theo.
