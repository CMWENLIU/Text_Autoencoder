I bought this popcorn a few months ago off of Amazon and decided to come back here and leave a review to warn people that like cheese popcorn not to buy this.  I was a big fan of the Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn but since that has been discontinued, I figured I would try this Jolly Time cheese popcorn.  Big mistake, it is nothing like the discontinued Redenbacher kind.  There is not even a good cheese flavor, it's just horrible.  The bad thing is when you buy this you get 36 bags of popcorn, so if you don't like it you're stuck with a ton of bags.<br /><br />If you really want to try this stuff, I would suggest buying a small box from a grocery store to try it first, and then if you like it, come back on here and buy this lot of 36 bags.<br /><br />I give this popcorn 2 stars out of 5 since it's at least edible.....barely.
