Esssentially, this is a Cracker Jacks rip off with some chocolate thrown in. To my taste, after a few pieces the added chocolate made them a bit too rich.<br /><br />Cracker Jacks, while also completely lacking any nutritional value, are at least a bit less expensive and 10 calories less per serving. (Plus you get a really cheap, unentertaining, and useless toy with Cracker Jacks).<br /><br />For the price and the calories, you'd be much better off to eat an apple. An apple is filling, and contains fiber and other nutritional elements. For that matter, you'd be better off to just eat lightly buttered popcorn. You can eat a LOT more popcorn for the same calories, and really popcorn is more satisfying as a snack, as it doesn't have all the sugar to keep you thirsty that this snack does. Of course that depends on how heavily you salt it too.<br /><br />I tried a bag of these as a filler snack when I was feeling hungry a couple of hours after lunch. Ten minutes later, I was just as hungry again. Since almost all of the calories in this snack come from sugar, that was no shock to me. LOL<br /><br />If you are underweight and looking to spend better than a dollar a pop for a VERY small bag of candy popcorn to smear directly on to your hips, this is your baby. However, the product otherwise is a slap in the face of the better eating habits many of us would prefer to embrace.
