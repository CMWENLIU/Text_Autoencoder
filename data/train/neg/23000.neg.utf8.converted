this item gets only 1 star from me because the green apple flavored floss sugar tastes nasty nasty nasty. its so bitter tasting your whole face puckers up. its not a sweet sour taste. its more like koolaide with no sugar in it. luckily i was able to add some banana flavored floss sugar to the green apple floss sugar and it sweetened it up some. i have tried other flavors of floss sugar, blue raspberry, strawberry, pink vanilla and banana and this is the first flavor i absolutely hate. LOL , i dont blame the seller though. i always purchase my sugar from paragon and will continue to do so. i will just stick to the flavors i know taste good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WF5JW0">Paragon Magic Cotton Candy Floss, 4-Pound Easy Pour Bottle (Green Apple)</a>
