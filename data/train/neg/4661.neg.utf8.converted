I have ordered VITA coconut water 17oz pack and the taste was pretty bad. Most of the bottles smell and taste stale. Couple of the bottles were decent but not as good as ZICO or ONE. I have tasted ONE and ZICO coconut water before and they taste pretty much the same and I like them a lot. So I am going to stick with these two brands for now.
