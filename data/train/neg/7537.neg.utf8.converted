We ordered the Baby Brezza and I was excited to try it out.  We took it out of the box and it wouldn't even turn on.  I was very frustrated and we called the company which was gracious enough to send us out a replacement.  The new one worked very well and I have been using it for about 4 months.  I love the machine it steams very well and I can put a fair amount of food in the container.  I do wish the container was larger because I make large batches of food and then freeze them.  I really like this machine, but now it has started leaking oil at the bottom when it makes the food and drips it into the food when I pour it out.  This I am not happy about at all and cannot feed to my baby with oil in it!  I am going to have replace this product and I don't think I would purchase another one just based off of all the problems we have had now with two machines.  It is a great machine when it works though.
