I've run across some old recipes that call for powdered vanilla.  I Googled powdered vanilla and came here 'cause this was the first entry.  Because people have been honest about the fact that this product is NOT powdered vanilla but some cheap-but-costly fake stuff, I'm not only NOT going to buy this, I'm NOT going to buy food items from Amazon.com.  Moving on in my search.  THANK YOU for taking the time to write and saving me from the same disappointment you must have felt.
