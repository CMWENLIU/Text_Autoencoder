I am a big fan of the Green Mountain's Southern Sweet Tea and when I saw the Green Mountain Sweet Lemon Black Perfect Iced Tea I thought I might enjoy it as well. I purchased the 24 count K-cup pack without tasting it. Big mistake, it has a very strong artifical lemon taste that overpowers the black tea and it's not very sweet.  I have tried adding Stevia to sweeten it up.  This does nothing to improve the taste.  So, if you enjoy Green Mountain Southern Sweet Tea, skip this one.
