My first order, the strawberry sour power belts were great. they were very soft and easy to chew. The watermelon ones are the complete opposite. The packaging for mine was horrible as the box(sour power belt box, not shipping box) was opened and was closed with scotch tape. The sour power belts were hard, and very hard to chew. I do not recommend you buy these.
