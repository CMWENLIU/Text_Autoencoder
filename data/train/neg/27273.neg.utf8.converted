I tried the repellent and gas bombs, the only thing that worked were the traps. You have to dig a hole but if you don't kill the gophers they will destroy your yard so a hole is no big deal.<br /><br />I used the Sweeneys Gopher traps they worked great.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZONYPE">Sweeneys 9013 Gopher Trap, 2-Pack</a><br /><br />As a follow up we have killed all the gophers on our 5 acres (at least the active ones), we did this in 3 days. We spent 3 months trying repellents and gas bombs.
