My little Pomeranian loves treats, but this product makes him physically ill. I even cut them into smaller, bite-sized pieces (no easy chore by the way because they're rock hard) but they just don't agree with him. In addition, they have the most awful fake-bacon smell you'll ever encounter. They make me nauseous, too.<br /><br />On the other hand, the same company's peanut butter flavored treats are my dogs' favorite!
