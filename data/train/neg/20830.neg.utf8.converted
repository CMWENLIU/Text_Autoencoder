I have eaten pecans for many years and always enjoyed eating them. I ordered the Roasted Unsalted Pecans thinking it would have a nice flavor. However, the title of this product on Amazon is Roasted Pecan Halves (1 Pound Bag) (Unsalted) - I must have missed that they roast the pecans in peanut oil in small print further down the page.<br /><br />The package says Unsalted Georgia Pecans -Ingredients: Pecans, Peanut Oil. K - Well I have never had pecans roasted in peanut oil.  When I took my first bite, I immediately noticed these pecans tasted strange to the point that the after taste required a glass of water to chase away the poor taste.<br /><br />I also ordered Unsalted Pistachios Meats - same thing - it was processed with peanut oil. They tasted poorly as well.<br /><br />This is the first time I am writing a poor review on an Amazon purchase. Thumbs down - these are the poorest tasting pecans and pistachios I have ever eaten. I will never order another product like this again.
