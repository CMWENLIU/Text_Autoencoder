After trying different Lavazza espresso whole beans i wanted to give this<br />one a try and ordered Lavazza Grand Espresso .I have checked the UK and<br />German sites to get some idea about the rating for this one since there are not enough reviews for this one. The ratings were not very impressive compare<br />to other Lavazza Whole Beans ( very close to Lavazza Super crema which i<br />have ordered through Amazon )but i wanted to make my own experience .<br /><br />When i oppened the package i saw seemingly oily coffee beans compare to other Lavazza or Illy Espresso beans.<br /><br />I have a Miele automatic espresso machine which was not very amused about<br />his new partner but it was too late to refuse the experiment.<br /><br />Grand Espresso has  a very good Crema which is a result of high Robusta  and normal bucket( aroma ) .Composition 40% Arabica 60 % Robusta .<br /><br />As Cappuccino i was not very impressed compare to other Lavazza Espresso<br />Beans .It tastes very weak ( i have used Whole Foods Whole Milk ).<br /><br />At the end you get what you have paid for. A lavazza brand which is in the<br />bottom of Lavazza Whole beans next to Lavazza super Crema and Lavazza Tierra.<br /><br />For me the first choice for Lavazza Espresso is Pienaroma if it is fresh ( i<br />have bought it through Amazon for about two years ago which was damaged/sour<br />but otherwise it is the top choice and the most expencive Lavazza in Europe)made from 100 % Arabica Beans and very Espresso Machine friendly like all other Lavazza beans (except Grand Espresso ! ) followed by Lavazza Top class.<br /><br />For Cappuccino my first choice is Lavazza Top Class which has a very nice chocolaty and sweet note followed by none ( even better than illy).<br /><br />For me the best Espresso is Illy dark roast (unfortunately overpriced )<br />followed by Lavazza Pienaroma ( best price/Quality ) .<br /><br />For Cappuccino i would always go with Lavazza top class followed by Segafredo<br />Extra Strong .<br /><br />I would not recommend Lavazza Grand espresso for espresso machines a la Miele<br />or Jura .The fat beans would cause damages for espresso machines .<br /><br />If you have regular / filter coffee machine i would see it comparable to Lavazza Super Crema or Tierra (which i also would definately NOT buy again ).
