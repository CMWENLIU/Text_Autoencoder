I ordered primarily peach(16oz) bottle to make ice tea. It had very little peach flavor, and smelled like propylene glycol(the agent they use to carry the flavor.) I added an ounce of flavoring to 1 gal and still didnt get a peach flavor to the tea.The other 3 flavors were also very poor quality. They definitely are not"extracts", so I returned them all.
