I have little yorkies so I generally take products like this and cut into smaller portions.  This stuff was so hard if you tried to snap in half it crumbles away a big portion of the piece.<br />I finally put it on a cutting board and when I tried to cut with a meat clever I got scared the knife was gonna slip sideways.  The pieces still crumbled.  I mean we are talking serious dry.<br />This product is touted as quality and american.  This product is much more expensive yet is the worst I've ever purchased.  It is like it was outdated.<br /><br />Do not buy this product.  It is poor value
