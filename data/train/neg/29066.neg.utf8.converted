I only made it 1/3 of the way through the Kashi Chocolate Peanut Roll. I enjoy eating other brand 'energy' and 'protein' bars (all of which have at least HALF the amount of sugar that this bar has) and hoped that this one would be tasty. It was extremely stiff to bite into, and much of the outer coating of rice fell off as I was trying to lever a bite from the roll. The dry aftertaste is like stale unsalted peanuts and with no hint of chocolate.
