Tried these and they are so totally GROSS.  Don't believe the rave reviews.  These are NOTHING like spagetti noodles and no matter how you cook them - will never be like spagetti noodles.  My whole family tried them but the funniest was my husbands reaction.... I didn't tell him what they were and he took a big bite.....  Did you see the movie "BIG" with Tom Hanks when he ate the caviar... well that was my husband -- so while it was a HUGE waste of money.... that was almost priceless...It is worst thing I have ever tried.  I agree with the others about the fishy smell. never goes away but the texture is Like eating "jellyfish tentacles" - and they look like jellyfish tentacles as well.<br /><br />I am passing these on to the trashcan and hope the seagulls like them....
