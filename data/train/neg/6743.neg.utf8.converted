it's fruity. it's leathery... but is that really all you expect from your fruit leather? personally i like mine a little less leathery and a little more chewy. The fruit has also been 100% liquified before dehydration, so there is a weird, soylent-green like uniformness to the texture. I will stick to 365 (Whole Foods) brand for now.
