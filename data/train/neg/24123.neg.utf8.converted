This are NOT white chocolate chips since they don't contain any cocoa butter in them, that's why they're labeled "Classic White" instead of "White chocolate". They don't taste good and their flavor is nothing near the true white chocolate flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients:Sugar, palm kernel oil, whole milk powder, nonfat dry milk, palm oil, soy lecithin, vanilla.<br /><br />The only good thing about them is that they don't contain any partially hydrogenated oils (=trans fat) like the nestle's white chips.
