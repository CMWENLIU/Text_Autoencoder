DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE ANY ALLERGIES TO FOOD PRODUCTS.  THE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION IS NOT FULLY DISCLOSED.  WHAT IS MISSING IS THE TAG LINE THAT ALL BOB'S MILL PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN A FACILITY THAT ALSO PROCESSES TREE NUTS AND SOY.<br /><br />BE AWARE, YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PURCHASE.  I WOULD SUGGEST GOING INTO A LOCAL STORE AND FINDING THE BAG WHERE YOU CAN READ CAREFULLY ALL THE MANUFACTURING DISCLOSURES.  AND DO NOT TRY TO EMAIL AMAZON FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE; IT DOES NOT EXIST.
