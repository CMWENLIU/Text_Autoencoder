I am a big fan of the Planter's Nut Bar, except when I was a kid they were BIG and lasted a long time. Now they've shrunk (but I haven't). So when I bit into the nut and grain variety I was startled. It was almost like my favorite nutty bar, but there was something strangely healthy about it, which went against my sense of delectable unhealthy eating. if I wanted helth, I would have bought a saw dust granola bar. NOT. I guess if your doctor prescribes saw dust bars and you want a little peanutty flavor to them, and chew instead of the delightful crackle, get this one. It left me indifferent to health and yearning for the parent product. Sometimes the old family formula is best left alone.
