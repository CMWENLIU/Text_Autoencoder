The saffron I received was nothing like the pictures....it was two small bags (not a jar, as advertized) of tiny sticks, not stamens of saffron.  It has no saffron smell and no saffron flavor.  I have no idea what this is, and hesitate to even use it in cooking.<br />Two packets of bonus material were included in the order...supposedly two more little packets of saffron. One bag was a crushed non-decript powder, and the other was a small bag of tumeric, not saffron.<br />I have sent an email to the seller, but no response.<br />This is the first time I feel I was really ripped-off by an Amazon seller.<br />If the seller responds to my email or this review, I will let you know.<br />Otherwise, beware of this product and seller!
