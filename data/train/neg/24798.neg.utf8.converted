Couldn't tell you...all the bags were defective. What a waste of money.....all of the contents leaked in the water or my hand before I could get a taste of the tea...100 bags of nothing...waste of money! Listen...if you don't you will be doing back flips trying to kick your own butt. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! Bags won't hold up to a soft rub...
