This pasta tasted absolutely wonderful - but it's very deceiving. If you compare the nutritional facts to that of whole wheat pasta (which is also delicious, and can be bought anywhere) the whole wheat pasta is actually BETTER for you. Dreamfields packaging states that there are "protected carbohydrates", but never explain this concept. By which standards are they measuring these "protected carbohydrates"?? I say this is a great alternative to regular pasta, but it's not exactly what it claims to be - it's still pretty high on the glycemic index.
