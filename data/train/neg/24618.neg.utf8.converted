Sigh.  The smell is very strong, but I can't describe it as either chocolate or coffee.  It sure doesn't taste like either.  I love mocha, I simply can't call this mocha.  I'm easily affected by the caffeine in coffee.  This doesn't do a thing to me.  As for the chocolate, some other reviewer said it tasted artificial.  I totally agree.
