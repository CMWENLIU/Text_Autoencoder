I have wanted to post notices on the shelves of the grocery stores that stock Silk with their organic products.  Silk is no longer made with organic soybeans.  I think most people just grab it up without realizing that this product has changed.  And the price is high to begin with.  There are many other organic soymilks available that are cheaper and better quality than this rip off. I feel like they deliberately set out to deceive the consumer.
