Two or three months ago, I subscribed to this company for automatic delivery of their dried chicken "breasts" each month.  When this month's order arrived, I allowed my Golden Retriever to eat one only.  Within a short time he became severely ill and continued vomiting repeatedly throughout the entire night.  I am a retired attorney/judge.  I do not become hysterical over every complaint that makes a claim that some product or other can kill your pet.  Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item.  Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident.<br />  My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish.  But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken "breasts" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed.  Such was clearly not the case.  In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States.  Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China.<br />  Amazon is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far.  My complaint is not against Amazon.  But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer).  I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product.  It's true that this was not the case every month.  Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem.<br />  I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is.  It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all.  Please Amazon, end your involvement in this matter.
