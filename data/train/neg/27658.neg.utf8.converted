I recently ordered the following coffee: Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Fogbuster, Whole Bean, 5-Pound Bag. It arrived promptly, but tastes stale. The package does not look like the colorful one illustrated in the picture. Rather, orders are shipped in clear plastic with no information about the company, and in my case the package was defective. A seam on the side had split open, allowing air to enter, which must have affected the coffee as it tastes stale. Jermiah's, so far, has been a big disappointment.
