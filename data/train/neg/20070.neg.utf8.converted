I bought this because it is supposed to be healthy for you.  But it doesn't matter how healthy it is if you can't stomach the taste.  The best I can describe it is like dirt with a hint of cranberry.  At first I didn't think it was terrible - but if you just want to sip it, forget it.  It gets worse with each sip.<br /><br />Since I wanted it more for a relaxed beverage - I just can't tolerate the taste and either had to guzzle it or dump it.  I even tried to make iced tea and mixed it with equal amounts of black tea bags...that dirt taste is just so strong it couldn't even help make it more tolerable.  I will not purchase this again.
