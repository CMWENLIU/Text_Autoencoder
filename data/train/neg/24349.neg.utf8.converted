I thought I was buying 9 lbs of coffee. the Title reads.. "Assorted whole bean sampler, 9 Lb box"<br />So any sane person would think your getting 9 lb's of coffee. To my surprise there was only 5 1/2 lbs of coffee and one bag was marked Free Sample. No where does it state the total coffee weight clearly. Classic misrepresentation. So I read the other reviews and someone else told Amazon about this problem a year ago! How can we trust the product pages?
