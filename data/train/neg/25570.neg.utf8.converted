Ingredient list on the package (which as we know goes from most to least): California raisins, yogurt coating (sugar,partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil, nonfat milk powder, nonfat yogurt powder, whey, titanium dioxide, soy lecithin, vanilla), confectioners glaze, corn syrup, dextrin and maltodextrin.<br /><br />This "yogurt coating" is basically sugar and partially hydrogenated oil, in other words TRANS FAT, which has undeniable harmful effects on your health. Palm oil is saturated fat, anyways. All the yogurt it conatins is a tiny bit of yogurt POWDER. And it has titanium dioxide, which is also an effective sun block that you wingredient<br /><br />Look at all that sugar named in different ways: sugar, confectioners glaze and corn syrup. As for the titanium dioxide, from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Pigment<br />"...When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as "the perfect white", "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.<br />In ceramic glazes titanium dioxide acts as an opacifier and seeds crystal formation.<br />Titanium dioxide is often used to whiten skimmed milk; this has been shown statistically to increase skimmed milk's palatability.[23]<br />Titanium dioxide is used to mark the white lines on the tennis courts of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, best known as the venue for the annual grand slam tennis tournament The Championships, Wimbledon.[24]<br />The exterior of the Saturn V rocket was painted with titanium dioxide; this later allowed astronomers to determine that J002E3 was the S-IVB stage from Apollo 12 and not an asteroid.<br /><br />Sunscreen and UV absorber<br /><br />In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used as a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. It is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils. Titanium dioxide is produced in varying particle sizes, oil and water dispersible, and with varying coatings for the cosmetic industry. This pigment is used extensively in plastics and other applications for its UV resistant properties where it acts as a UV absorber, efficiently transforming destructive UV light energy into heat.<br />Titanium dioxide is found in almost every sunscreen with a physical blocker because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with sensitive skin are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals. The titanium dioxide particles used in sunscreens have to be coated with silica or alumina, because titanium dioxide creates radicals in the photocatalytic reaction. These radicals are carcinogenic, and could damage the skin.
