This was my second Saeco, but will be my last. This machine was poorly fitted together when built, broke twice within the warranty period, but, only repaired, sort of, once. It'd be considered a lemon if it was a car, and customer service has been rude, lying, insulting. I will listen to it squeak out perhaps it's last dying cup, gladly toss it in the garbage, and buy a real coffee machine next time. Buyer beware.
