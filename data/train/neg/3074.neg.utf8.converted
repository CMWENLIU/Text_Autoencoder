I hope this review helps others save their money or at least have a better idea what to expect and if the product will meet their needs. Traditional style really means fish-in-a-blender--scales, pin-bones, and all. I have a low-salt diet, so salty food tastes really salty to me. However, this is REALLY salty. Almost 1700 mg sodium in the whole can. They could have used half that and been fine. Once you pick out the bones and scales, the meat is appropriately cooked and flaky, even if too salty. A lot of work for a canned product. This may be an appropriate product for under $3 per can, but I felt gypped. If you are being health-conscious, you're probably better off buying a salmon fillet, pulling the pin-bones, and cooking it yourself.
