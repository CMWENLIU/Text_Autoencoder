Don't really know the purpose of this product.  It is not the almond flour you are looking for.  It says gluten free but it does not seem to be for me.  For those who are looking for no carbohydrate don't miss the "Blend" on the label because it is not what are you looking for.  If you are using this product you may as well use full blown all purpose flour from the store.
