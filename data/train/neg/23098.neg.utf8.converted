This may or may not be a tasty cocoa powder, but is not decaffeinated and it is not free of caffeine.  The product is simply cocoa powder, the same thing you get if you buy Hershey's or any other brand of unsweetened cocoa.  The label states that the powder is "99.7% caffeine free."  This is true because -- you guessed it -- cocoa powder naturally consists of 0.3% caffeine.  This is not comparable to statements that (for instance) decaffeinated coffee is 97% caffeine free, which means that 97% of the original caffeine content has been removed.<br /><br />If you make a cup of hot chocolate from this powder, using one tablespoon per 8 ounces of milk, the caffeine content will be reasonably low -- approximately 15 milligrams -- but perceptible to someone who is very sensitive to caffeine.  If you make what we might call the Angelina's cocoa recipe (about 80 grams of cocoa), you will have 240 milligrams of caffeine, about the equivalent of a "tall" Starbucks coffee.  Do not buy this powder (as I unfortunately did) thinking that you can make your favorite brownies, truffles, or even hot chocolate with any less caffeine than those recipes would have if you made them from another standard unsweetened cocoa powder.<br /><br />Rated 1 star for deceptive advertising.
