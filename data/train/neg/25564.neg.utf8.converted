The most nastiest caviar I've ever eaten in my entire life, and I know caviar, and it didn't even looked like a caviar, it looked like liquid orange paste, so nasty and so salty. This caviar is not a Russian Caviar! Because authentic Russian caviar is a good quality product and this is a rip-off and a lie! Someone from Brooklyn shipping them. So you do the math.
