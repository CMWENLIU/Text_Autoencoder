Do not buy this product if you want vanilla extract, which is legally defined by the FDA as being derived from a tincture containing at least 13.35 ounces of relatively-dry vanilla beans per gallon of 70-proof alcohol.  Vanilla may be the only food flavoring that the FDA has developed standards for - which is understandable given that this orchid-derived spice may be the most popular flavor worldwide.  The popularity and use of vanilla extract in cooking and other products undoubtedly resulted in the need to standardize its formulation.<br /><br />Not sure why Amazon continues to advertise this flavoring as an EXTRACT given that the bottle's label fails to identify it as such.  Unfortunately I couldn't read the label shown on the low resolution image of this item on Amazon's website, but after I received shipment of this item I noticed the top of the bottle's front label actually reads "Watkins Original Vanilla Double Strength - Artificially Flavored" - and thus it clearly does not identify this product as being an EXTRACT (merely mentioning in the fine print at bottom of front label that it contains vanilla extract).<br /><br />Furthermore, the bottle's back label lists its ingredients - and their order of preponderance shows this flavoring contains more water, sugar and "propylene glycol" (a component of anti-freeze!) than vanilla extract!!!<br /><br />Sure would be great if Amazon would correct this item's product description by removing the word "Extract" from both its banner and "product features" section.  Even better, it should note that the product is "artificially flavored" and also list its ingredients in the order of their predominance (i.e., Water, glucose, propylene glycol, vanilla extract (alcohol, water, extractive of vanilla beans), alcohol (8.25%), artificial flavors, caramel color. Contains Sulfites.).<br /><br />Hopefully, no one else will fall prey to this item's false advertisement.
