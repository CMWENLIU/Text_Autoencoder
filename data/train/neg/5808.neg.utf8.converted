I'm a big fan of green tea but I don't even think Bigelow Green Tea is real green tea. I drink it all the time at work since it's free but I think I might start to bring my own tea to work. The color is brown and the taste is the same as chinese tea. Do yourself a favor and buy Green Tea from an Asian grocer or try Yamamotoyama brand. Those really have a distinct flavor and it is actually "green." Don't be fooled by Bigelow.
