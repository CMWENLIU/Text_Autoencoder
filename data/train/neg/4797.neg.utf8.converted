What a disaster! What nerve they have! They label this mess "Chicken and Broccoli" but there's no chicken in it. There's almost no broccoli in it, either. You get a teeny tiny pouch with some green dust in it, that they have the nerve to label "broccoli florets".<br /><br />Besides that, the little pasta bits have no taste or texture. Then you drown your meat that you added and everything else in a mass of tasteless cheese sauce that has all the calories and sodium of cheese and none of its good qualities (like flavor).<br /><br />What an expensive way to ruin some perfectly good meat.<br /><br />Step 1 in preparing this is to fry up the chicken. Stop right there, hand me the chicken between two slices of bread, and I'll be a whole lot happier, plus saving the cost of this disaster.
