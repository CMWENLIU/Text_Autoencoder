I don't mean to be disrespectful to the other reviewers - and we are all wired a bit differently, I know, especially the taste buds - but these truffles are substandard and quite nearly inedible.<br /><br />You people are simply not chocolate connoisseurs or, simply put, you have never had "proper" truffles. How could ANYONE imagine that these are the best chocolates they have ever eaten? It staggers the mind.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and try some real, well-made truffles - you will be surprised. These are NOT it - even though these are made in France - that was the reason I bought them! The person for whom I purchased these candies said "these things are a triumph of quantity over quality." How true, how true.<br /><br />How can one champion a truffle that lists as its very first ingredient PALM OIL - followed by SUGAR and Reduced Fat Cocoa Powder and then WHEY? Palm Oil, Sugar and Whey do not, in this case, contribute to a quality product. These things taste as if a third-grader whipped them up - they are leaden, oily, and, yes, A TRIUMPH OF QUANTITY OVER QUALITY. Triste!
