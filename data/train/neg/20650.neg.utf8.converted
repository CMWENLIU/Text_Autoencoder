These products were terrible tasting. My husband is Indian and said the taste was terrible. I agreed. When I went to return the unopened packages I could not so so. They have a no return policy. Now I will have to toss out $40 worth of unused product. Amazon is always so very good about returns but evententaly some of their vendors are not.
