you have to be careful with these products.  its not organic, and its not raw nut butter.<br /><br /> roasting ANY nut (or anything, for that matter) destroys the nutrients which should be why youre eating this in the first place. the organic factor isnt as big of a deal, but why buy something with pesticides if you can buy organically grown?  youre already shelling out 8 bucks for 3/4 lbs.<br /><br />  get the maranatha raw organic nut butter. its the second best ive enjoyed (the other brand isnt available on amazon).
