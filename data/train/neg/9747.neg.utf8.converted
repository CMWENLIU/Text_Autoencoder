Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.
