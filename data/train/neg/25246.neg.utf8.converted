I bought this as a mothers day gift for a coffee lover and found that it came with one pound regular and one pound decaf. Not three pounds of regular, they substituted crackers that were all smashed and cappuccino liquer cake.  I opened the day before it was to be gifted to wrap it and was really dissapointed.  decaf for a coffee addict!!!  This turned out to be a really expensive pound of coffee in a nice basket.
