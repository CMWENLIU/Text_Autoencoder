If I wasn't so tight fisted, I would have dumped the remainder of this box in the yard for the birds to eat.  But, I didn't and relented to choking down every last piece of the contents.  Don't even try to eat this stuff by itself- remember Eul Gibbons from Grape Nuts?  Tastes a LOT like those pine trees he was always trying to get us to eat.  The second listed ingredient on this product is sugar, so think about that before you purchase what you think is something healthy.  Go for something else that's better and has less sugar.  This one will leave the birds in YOUR yard standing up and saluting!
