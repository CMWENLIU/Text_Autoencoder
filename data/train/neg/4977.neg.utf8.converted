I have searched high and low for cotton candy flavoring to make cotton candy ice cream.  well I happened upon this product and ordered it.  When it finally arrived I tried it out in some vanilla ice cream and vanilla yogurt.  It tastes nothing like cotton candy and doesn't even have a candy like flavor to it...more of a strawberry.  It is horrible and I am very upset since there is no returns on grocery items.  If you are looking for cotton candy flavoring that tastes like real cotton candy or cold stone ice cream this is not the product, it is a big let down!!
