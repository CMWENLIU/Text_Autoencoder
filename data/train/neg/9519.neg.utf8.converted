I used to purchase them at wholefoods market. I bought a pack of 6 green puffs at Amazon, and half of puffs in the containers are burnt. It tastes a little bitter and the seasonings are all concentrated and sticking to most of puffs. I never had this problem when I got those at wholefoods. I thought it was only the one container that is defected, but I was wrong. I'm a little scared to make another S&S purchase on this item. Am I the only one having this issue??
