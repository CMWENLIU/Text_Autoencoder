Have been drinking Twinings Earl Gray for the last 10 years or so. However the last batch from Amazon was so mild and lacking the flavor that I had grown to love, that it was almost bland. Do not know how genuine the report on Wikipedia is, but it seems Twininigs, in their infinite wisdom has tweaked the original formula in April 2011. Going by my experience, it sounds about right.<br />Sad when a company has to tweak a great and well loved flavor, and still sell it as 'classic'.<br /><br />I will not be ordering it, till they bring back the original 'classic'<br /><br />Shame Twinings.<br /><br />Update: And just so you folks know..Twinings had said that they would send me a pack direct, to make up for my dissatisfaction. It is over 3 months and I am still waiting. I will not hold my breath. Looks like they changed their customer service formula too!
