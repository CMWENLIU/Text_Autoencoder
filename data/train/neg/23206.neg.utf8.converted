First it was a mistake to order this Product because I wanted Casings so I can make my own Sausage but it was my mistake but than I tried the Wieners there are O.K but defently not German or Bavarian<br />so every German who is out there and is looking for a taste from home<br />I'm sorry you want get it with this Product
