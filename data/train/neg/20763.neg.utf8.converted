Tasted like it was very old.<br />When I get home I will check to see if there was a "use by date".<br /><br />I will return since it was a 12.5 pound bag ... or I may use as bird seed etc.<br /><br />When I came back online to write this review, I see the message to signup when this product becomes available again.<br /><br />This suggest that yes I got the last bag and it was very old.<br /><br />UPDATE the next day ...<br />The popcorn bag had an "use by date" MAY 2012<br />That is four months from now.<br />I'm not sure, but I read somewhere (could be wrong here) that the window on popcorn kernels is 3 years from date of packaged. Feel free to correct this if you know this is incorrect.<br /><br />Amazon will refund and emailed shipping label for return. (Thanks Amazon)
