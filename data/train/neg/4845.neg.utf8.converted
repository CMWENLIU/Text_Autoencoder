I give my two small dogs a spoon of pumpkin every night - the vet recommended it and they love it!  The quality and taste of this product seems to be fine for them - they eat it without complaint.  However, the issue is that more than half of the cans were SEVERELY dented.  Since the box was intact and whole, the cans were clearly already in this condition when placed in the box and shipped.  Because of the degree of denting on the cans, I could only safely use about 2/3 of the package.  Big picture - great product but you are being shipped cans the store won't sell because of the denting.  If you can accept that not all cans will be usable, this is good product.  But I was disappoint by the condition of the cans and will not repurchase this item.
