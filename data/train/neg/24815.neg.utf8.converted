Tastes great, has lots of fiber, lots of protein, and stays crunchy all the way through the bowl.  BUT, it stays a bit too crunchy.  This morning, I found a marble-sized, tightly-packed, super-hard piece of "crunch" in my bowl and removed it right away.  Unfortunately, my next spoonful had more of this hard cereal in it.  And, when I tried to chew it, my tooth broke in half.  OUCH!  Sorry, but no cereal should break your tooth, ever!  It's very unfortunate because I ate a bowl of this every day, it's good for me, and I actually liked it.  But, I need my teeth for a few more years.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
