This was always one of my favorite Chunky soups.  However it seems that when Campbell started advertising their new 'leaner cuts' they interpreted those words to mean quantity rather than quality. Last can of Sirloin Burger contained 4 pieces of meat (2 per serving).  Same with their Select soup.  My White Bean Chicken Chili also contained 4 pieces of chicken for the 2 servings. Guess it was a way to cut down on production costs but not price. I like to get what, I hope at least, I'm paying for.  I complained to Campbell but never heard back on my e-mail. Since then I have switched to Progresso and other brands.
