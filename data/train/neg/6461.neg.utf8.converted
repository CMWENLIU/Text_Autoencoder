Was told by an employee in a pet store that this brand is one of the best. Bought from them and then purchased at Amazon (cheaper). My dog wasn't to happy with the beef selections. After reading the label, realized it was processed in Thailand. Only gave my dog a few cans and then threw away the rest.
