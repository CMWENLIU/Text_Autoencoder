Traveled to Belize and as long as the container stays upright, you'll have no problem. If you lay it on its side, it'll leak and the deet in the fluid will damage certain surfaces.<br /><br />We had it packed in a plastic bag on the flight over and the container leaked inside the bag. When I unpacked at the hotel I laid it on the counter next to the sink were it again leaked and damaged the counter. It ate the finish off the wood. In addition, the wipes are very wet and you'll need to watch where you lay them after using them.<br /><br />The product does work well, just needs to have the container redisigned.
