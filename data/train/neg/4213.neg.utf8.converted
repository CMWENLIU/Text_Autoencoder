I truly feel there is no better coconut water than the one that comes directly from the source in hand.  Because fresh coconuts are not easy to find I started buying Vita Coco over a year ago.  From all other coconut waters out there I felt theirs was the best tasting, best quality and I also liked the fact that the source of the water came from just one country and not multiple ones.  I have been a happy consumer for over a year, most of my purchases came from the local supermarket until I decided to purchase the vita coco 6 pack on Amazon as part of the subscribe and save program I gave a box to my mother in law. Earlier this week she opened one of the containers and she said the taste seemed a bit off, a little rancid and she felt like I had swallowed something more than just water. She decided to take a closer look and I was appalled at what she uncovered. Huge chunks of mold her water; it made her sick to her stomach. I am sad to say that after this experience we will no longer consume this product. My concern is what kind of quality control is out there and is this the first incident.  I have heard many reviews talking about rancid taste and moldy taste I wonder how many of those containers had the same stuff inside.  Worse of all is that I have been giving this water to my 3 year old who loves coconut water. My mother in law sealed the container and took these pictures I have contacted the company but I have yet to hear from anyone.
