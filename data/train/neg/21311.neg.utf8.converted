We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.
