I had to put in a review of this product after I read the previously entered 5 star reviews. I purchased some tonight at World Market and I must say that this is absolutely the worst tasting candy that I have ever come across. Believe me, I have done some serious traveling, everywhere from Canada, across the US, Mexico, South America, Jamaica, Britain, Belgium, the Philippines, Dominican Republic, Guam, and the Cayman islands. I have tried food and candies from each one of those locations, and I have never tasted anything like this candy. Please do not waste your money and buy this. The candy is so bad that most people I have given it to could not keep it in their mouth, but rather spit it out on the floor. I could not believe the taste when I tried it. Imagine if you will cramming an entire pack of filter-less menthol camel cigarettes in your mouth and smoking them, while at the same time chewing on a dirty tire and drinking water from a dirty ashtray... That may come close to the flavor of these little bad boys. These candies are made in Sweden therefore I have come to the conclusion that Swedish people have no taste buds. (I'm Joking, I love Swedes).
