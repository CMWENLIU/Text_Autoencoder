I so much wished these cookies were delicious but instead I found them dry and hard. And to add to that they bothered my stomach.<br />I would very much rethink ordering them and instead buy another product. I hope the seller will credit my account and not make me<br />return them and have to pay for shipping them back. Sorry I really did want to like them but I would not recommend them to anyone.
