I was very disappointed when I received the product(s).  The 35 K-cups were loose in the packaging box.  The product is described as a pack of 35. I am uncomfortable that the K-cups are not in a sealed box from the manufacturer.  How do I know these cups were not discarded leftovers from serveral variety packs?  I doubt I'll use the K-cups and there are no returns.  Buyer beware.
