The fine print now says that the salmon is caught in Alaska and then shipped to China for processing and packaging.  I've been buying Wildside salmon for years but no more.  I have no faith in food products that are handled in China and I'm disgusted with Wildside.  I suppose profit margins wouldn't be quite as big if they freeze dried and bagged it in North America.
