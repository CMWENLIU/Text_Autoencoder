Yuck!  What a disappointment!  I ordered these because I was looking for some candy with the flavors of my childhood (Cherry, Lime, Orange, etc.,.)  I don't know what some of the flavors in this box are supposed to be, but they are *not* the Saf-T-Pops of my youth.  Even if you put that aside, the quality of these candies is poor.  The flavors are indistinct and odd, with combinations of flavorings I can only describe as "wrong, terribly, horribly, wrong".  If any one knows of a quality US, Canadian, or Western European hard candy with clean flavors which include Lime, Cherry, and Orange, please leave a comment letting me know about it, and where it might be available.  And, if you, like me, are seeking a source for same, Saf-T-Pops is not the answer.
