I ordered 2 bottles of the Frank's hot sauce and my order was received completely smashed and crushed.  The order was not even bubble wrapped.  I tried to contact the owner and explain my situation but he just argued with me and instisted I was mistaken because he does bubble wrap.  Instead of continuing to argue while I am holding my stained invoice in my hand, I will just choose to no longer order anthing from this site ever again and warn others of my misfortune and the poor customer service I received.
