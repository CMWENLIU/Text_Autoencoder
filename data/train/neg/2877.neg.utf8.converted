I ignored the other reviews for this oil, and purchased because I thought the price was good.  There were two things wrong. First, you will notice it says to put in hot water to melt the oil so you can get it out of the bottle.  This packaging is appropriate for warm weather locations.  Seattle is not a location that works for this product.  2.  The smell gagged me.  You do not want to put this product in your mouth.  I might use this on my hair, before washing it, but that is about it.  It stinks!  I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad. I have edited my review.  The reason I purchased this oil over others was that I thought that it was a bargain.  When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.  If you are using coconut oil for eating or putting on your body,  I urge you not to buy this oil.  It stinks really really bad, is no bargain and you cannot get it out of the container.  I should have returned it to amazon immediately upon receiving this.
