Thank you Amazon, for sending me an enormous bag of cat food that expired five days before I received it. Not only did I feed it to my cats several times before noticing, but now I have to coordinate the return of a giant and heavy bag of old food. Unfortunately, there is no way for the buyer to know the sell-by date before purchasing, so we are entrusting Amazon to do the right thing and not rip us off.
