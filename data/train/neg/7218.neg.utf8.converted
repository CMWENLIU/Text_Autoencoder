If you think this coffee is good you should compare it to something that was not made in an old school percolator. This coffee takes me back to the coffee that was the standard in the early 70's. We have so much more choice today. With coffee that really tastes good. One thing this coffee is good for is if you are cold and tired and you need something fast to get you going this stuff will work.
