I really hate leaving a negative review for this product, especially in light of so many positive ones.  I really had high hopes for this product, especially since I had to buy a whole case of it in order to try it, because it is not sold in individual boxes in any store near me.  But, upon popping this popcorn at work, the first thing I noticed was that the smell is extremely strong, and it permeated the whole office (which is quite large) and many people objected to the "chemically" smell of this popcorn.  When I open the bag, there are fumes that come out at first that actually make my eyes water, they are that chemically and so strong.  However, I personally felt that the taste of this popcorn was okay -- not good or great, just okay.  I much prefer the Jolly Time Kettle Corn flavor.  The smell of this popcorn bothered my coworkers so much that someone actually put an anonymous sign on the microwave asking people (me) NOT to pop popcorn in it anymore.  And the smell permeated the microwave literally for DAYS, coming back just as strong when anyone cooked ANYTHING in the microwave!  I am on Weight Watchers and since I bought a whole case of this, I tried bringing a bag to an office party one day to snack on myself instead of the cakes and cookies everyone else was having, and they actually made me LEAVE the party!<br /><br />So, if you don't mind being a social outcast, or having people criticize you for putting all those "nasty chemicals" in your body, or if you plan to eat this in the privacy of your own home -- then by all means, enjoy!  Otherwise, I'd recommend you think twice about buying it.  The price here is great -- but it's just not worth it . . .
