I'm a big fan of the standard Velveeta shells and cheese so I thought this would be great for a fast week-night dinner.  WRONG!  Ended up throwing it down the garbage disposal and ordering pizza instead.  I wish I had read the reviews first, especially Nancy's.  The first problem is that the "broccoli" was virtually non-existent.  I knew it would be dehydrated, but this stuff was dried up beyond recognition.  I immediately regretted adding it to the saucepan and wished I had steamed some real broccoli to toss in.  I pressed on, however, and added the cheese sauce.  It was thinner in consistency than the typical shells and cheese sauce.  I let it set for a few minutes to thicken but was not very excited to dig in.  The taste was bland and the only texture I got was mushy.  The calories and sodium content were also through the roof!  This was definitely not a good purchase and I wouldn't buy it again.
