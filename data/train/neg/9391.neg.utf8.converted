Product didn't work as advertised. Mixed solution strictly adhering to instructions. Florida gray squirrels would actually lay across birdfeeder roof to dine, totally oblivious to the 'Critter Ridder' that was sprayed across top, sides, and supporting pole.<br />I contacted the manufacturer, Woodstream Corp., to insure I had applied product correctly. Woodstream promptly refunded my cost including shipping. Now that is a very positive response to a disappointing situation.
