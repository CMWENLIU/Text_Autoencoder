These have a really pleasing strawberry taste at first, but then they kind of turn on you and taste a little funky. I had to think about it for a while until I realized that what they've tried to do is combine mint with strawberry. I don't know about you, but those two do NOT go together. I definitely prefer orange tic tacs over these and won't buy again.
