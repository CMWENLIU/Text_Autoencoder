We purchased a three pack of chocolate caramel, strawberry vanilla, and lemon poppyseed because the package looked so attractive, and I thought it would save me some time. The flavors sounded very appealing.<br /><br />Reality couldn't be farther removed from the picture. The cupcakes were practically inedible. The chemical flavor of the additives was unbearable. I actually spit out the first bite I took of the chocolate caramel. I asked several guests to try a bite of all three flavors (because I wondered if there was something wrong with me. Couldn't imagine three flavors of such an attractive looking mix could be THAT gross), and not a single person liked them. I ended up throwing everything away, and having to buy something else in a hurry.<br /><br />Furthermore, I'm not someone who likes much frosting on cupcakes, but the package provided barely made enough to thinly cover the cupcakes. Very thinly. If you were to put as much frosting on your cupcake as is shown in the picture, about a third of your frosting would already be used up. This is probably a good thing, since the frosting had that horrible quality of coating the roof of your mouth in a layer of revolting grease that is hard to get rid of. (And I used strictly fresh ingredients that I had just bought, added according to the recipe.)<br /><br />What a waste of THREE packages of cupcake mix and fresh ingredients!!
