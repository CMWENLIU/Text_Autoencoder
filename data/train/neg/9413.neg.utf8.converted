Hero Black Cherry "Preserve" 12oz is what is displayed on the Amazon website.  However, what you will receive is Hero Black Cherry "Fruit Spread"<br /><br />The Hero Preserve is made in Switzerland.  It is very good<br /><br />The Hero Fruit Spread is made in Germany.  It is very Tart.<br /><br />I have complained about this difference to Hero and their Quality Control was going to address the differences........but they haven't!<br /><br />I was unable to find the Hero "Preserve" in Texas so I ordered it on line only to find they supply the German "Fruit Spread"..........<br /><br />It would be nice if Hero would get their act together and Amazon would change their web site to reflect what is sold.......
