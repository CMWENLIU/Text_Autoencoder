A co-worker left these in the breakroom. I ate one up, boy was it delicious. Within 90 minutes I had to go to the bathroom, it has continued all day. Gastric Distress to the max! I read the wrapper, it has 9 grams of fiber. If you are not a large consumer of fiber in your diet, I say eat 1/3 of a bar and stop. See what happens. Due to the unexpected results I had to give this a one star. No wonder the bars were up for grabs in the breakroom! I wonder who else in the office is suffering.
