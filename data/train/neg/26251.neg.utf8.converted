I ordered the angel hair noodles, and after one bite, I threw them down the garbage disposal.  Their texture is not really "al dente", and they have no discernable flavor.  I covered them with my favorite pasta sauce, but their texture and tastelessness made them seem just awful.  The closest description I can come up with?  Imagine soggy styrofoam...then you have a sense of what I experienced.  I know that some people have given positive reviews.  Perhaps they are less particular; I don't know.  I ordered 4 bags, and I have three left.  I'll probably just throw them away; I can't imagine offering them to anyone else.
