What I got is not carrying the log or its not even the same type of Box!<br /><br />Logo of the Saffron I got is having a symbol of CROWN,the logo appears in picture is a farmer!<br /><br />The Name of the Saffron is Taj Crown!<br /><br />What is there in picture (in Amazon web site)is CHIQUILIN saffron!<br /><br />Its too bad for a customer!<br /><br />I am from India, We say there in India that American company don't do such cheating but I am facing it in America with an Biggest American on line shopping!<br /><br />Its really a Cheating!<br /><br />Saffron could be good, I haven't yet experimented , but my ratting is for the Wrong Brand!
