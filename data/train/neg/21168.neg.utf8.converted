If you are hoping for a cheaper, bulk version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTPAE4">Village Harvest Organic Brown Thai Jasmine Rice, 30-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, this is not it.  While better than ordinary brown rice, the fragrance and texture of Village Harvest is far superior and worth the additional cost.<br /><br />Very sad update (August 20, 2012) (3 stars to 1 star)<br /><br />We discovered the source of the dozens of little brown moths flying all over the house.  Unfortunately, they came from this bag of rice, which we didn't realize until we had reached the bottom of the bag.  I have had issues like this with brown rice purchased from Asian grocery stores before but not with brown rice from American groceries.  Either way, it's not a good thing.
