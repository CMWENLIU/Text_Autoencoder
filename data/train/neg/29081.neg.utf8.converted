First thing to note is this box is smaller than the normal kraft mac & cheese (5.5 oz vs 7.25 oz).  So you get 2 "servings" instead of 3 according to the boxes.<br /><br />As far as the veggie part...the pasta has some "enriched cauliflower" (whatever that means).<br /><br />It has more fat, cholesterol, and sugar than the regular mac & cheese.  The only true benefit (according to the box) was the vitamin C difference.<br /><br />I decided to have a taste test with the family for dinner tonight.  I cooked a box of regular mac & cheese and a box of these...they did not know which was which.  Everyone agreed that the regular one was better.  Everyone also correctly guessed which one was the new one.  Side-by-side there is definitely a difference in taste.  In fact, the veggie pasta does have a distinct taste of cauliflower in these.<br /><br />In conclusion, the slight nutritional benefit is not worth the inferior taste and servings.
