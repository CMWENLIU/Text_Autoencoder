Sent this to my dad for Father's Day and got a note a few days later saying, "some of the items in it were pretty tastless.  The formaggio e vino had no trace of vino whatsoever.  Some of the cookies and crackers had no taste to speak of and were only useful to scoop up the formaggio which wasn't remarkable.  Whoever sold this to you may want to rethink their source.  The basket is nice, however!"<br /><br />So much for a nice Father's day gift!
