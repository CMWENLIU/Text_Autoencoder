Just because your dog likes it doesn't mean it is good for you. I love In and Out burger but I know better then to make a regular diet of it.<br /><br />Meat by products is high on the ingredient list and is a terrible ingredient. If a manufacturer had nothing to hide, they would list the specific animal that makes up the meat content. Plus, the meat is marked "by-products", which is throwaway parts unusable for anything else and of the lowest quality in nutrients. Wheat, corn, and soy are also part of the ingredient list and among the worst offenders when it comes to allergies in dogs. They are among the most difficult things for dogs to digest. Please do yourself and your dog a favor by feeding them a higher quality product. Review the ingredient list and doing a little research on ingredients will go a long way towards a longer and healther life for your dog.
