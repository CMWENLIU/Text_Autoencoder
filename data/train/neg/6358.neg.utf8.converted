We used Nature's Variety (non Instinct formula) for a while, but when we moved to our current location, the closest we could find was Natural Balance, so we had to switch.  When NB put out their grain free Alpha Dog, I tried that out and was amazed at how my normally very smelly Boston Terrier suddenly didn't seem to have any gas at all.  This got me searching for reviews, where I discovered the NV's Instinct line was rated much higher than NB's Alpha dog.  When I discovered the Amazon subscriptions, and how inexpensive that makes it(relative to what I pay at the pet store for organic pet food), I decided to give NV another try.  For the first week, I mixed the last of the old food with the new to get him used to it.  He had diarrhea and the worst gas EVER for days.  Now it's been a week on just the NV food and the sickness has not stopped.  I though maybe he was suffering from seasonal allergies and that's why he seemed so blahhh lately.  Last night I put it all together and realized it's the food.  I really wish I could get a refund, but at least I stopped the subscription in time not to get another.
