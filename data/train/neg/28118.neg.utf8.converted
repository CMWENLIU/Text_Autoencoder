Let me start by stating we LOVE the Plum Organic Training Meals - they have been a wonderful tool for helping us to transition our son to solid foods.  When we saw this we thought it would be a great way to get him to start eating chunkier oatmeal.  However, this is just juice and cinnamon - no oatmeal chunks!  It literally poured out!  Seriously, Gerber stage 1 meals are thicker than this!<br /><br />The flavor is great - I will give it that.  Hence I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  We mixed it with my son's single grain oatmeal to thicken it up and it made a great meal - but a REALLY expensive one.<br /><br />We recommend the other meals - but not this.  Hope they improve this.
