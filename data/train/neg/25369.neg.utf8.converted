We have stopped buying Kellogg's Frosted Flakes because the corn in this product is an EPA registered pesticide. It is Bt GMO corn which is patented by a chemical company that genetically engineered it in a lab and turned it into an EPA registered pesticide. When corn worms bite into this corn, their stomaches explode. There are concerns about the effect these GMOs have on human health and no long term studies have been done. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes are not the same product I ate when I was growing up. I won't feed my family EPA registered genetically modified corn, or any other GMOs. The sugar they are using is from GMO sugar beet. My family loves the Nature's Path version of frosted flakes. Tastes much better and no GMO risks or pesticides.
