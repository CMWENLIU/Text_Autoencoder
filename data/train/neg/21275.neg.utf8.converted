I went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans.<br />BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous.<br />Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA.<br />To be fair it has to be said that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPA<br />Why can't an "Organic" manufacturer not go the extra mile?<br />Buy Eden Food lentils and beans right here at Amazon.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZW5OS">Eden Organic Black Beans, No Salt Added, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>
