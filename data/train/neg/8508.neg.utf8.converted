As a woman, I have purchased flowers many times from ProFlowers for my mom, aunts, daughters, sister and friends.  So long as ProFlowers supports misogyny, I will spend my floral money elsewhere.  I will make sure to keep those receipts and send them to ProFlowers each and every time to let them know how much money they have lost from this former customer.
