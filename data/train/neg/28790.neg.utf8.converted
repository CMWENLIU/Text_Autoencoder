This summer sausage was not that great.  Had a very "tangy" taste, with very little other flavor.  If it were not for the price, this would have been returned.  My dog enjoys it.<br />For real summer sausage I'll stick with the small, specialty companies.  Try Woody's Smokehouse or try the venison summer sausage from the Vermont Country Store.  Heck, even Hickory Farms is better.
