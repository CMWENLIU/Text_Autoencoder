I like strong coffee/espresso and was excited to try Jet Fuel after reading the reviews here.  After a week of drinking this coffee however, maybe I have a different definition of strong coffee.  Every day I drink this very average coffee on the way to work and say to myself, write a review so others don't do what I did, and buy 50 cups of the stuff.<br /><br />It has a bitter taste with not a lot of anything else going on, and maybe that is what some people consider strong.  Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.  Caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee, but now I am stuck with 50 cups of Jet Fuel.  Don't believe the hype.
