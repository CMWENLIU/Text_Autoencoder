Ground Yellow Corn, Corn Gluten Meal, Animal Fat preserved in mixed-tocopherols and Soy: Be very careful of these ingredients.<br /><br />If you spot them in any dog food, it's a giant red flag. It seems a lot of Dog Food these days just have to have them. My dog absolutely loved this brand, but at the moment, I am treating this bag as a treat, just like we give chocolate to kids. We know they aren't really good for your health, but I am hoping giving them once in a while won't hurt them too much.<br /><br />Go with certified brands like Canidae and Wellness, and stay away from ones that contain those ingredients I listed above.
