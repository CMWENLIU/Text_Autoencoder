Wake up people, check the ingredients, CORN GLUTEN MEAL? CORN STARCH? RED 40 COLOR? WHAT WERE YOU PEOPLE THINKING WHEN YOU LEFT THOSE 5 STAR REVIEWS YOU ARE KILLING YOUR ANIMALS. This product was recalled 5 years ago for killing innocent cats, please do some research before you buy something. Have you seen a cat chewing on corn before? no.  So please do not be fooled by those 5 star reviews, its obvious that those people are ignorant, companies like Purina, Science Diet, whiskas don't care about our animals but their pockets. If you love your pet, feed him/her with the right stuff, they don't need stuff that has corn in it. Also make sure there are no artificial colors or flavors. And make sure there is no BHA and BHT used preservatives. These preservatives have been shown to cause cancer in both cats and dogs. Bad Bad stuff and it's in almost every cat treat on the market. INCLUDING THIS ONE.
