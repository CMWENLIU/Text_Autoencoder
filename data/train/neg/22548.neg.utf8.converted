The ingredients listed are nothing like what is actually in the caramel.  I would not call these caramels since they have sorbitol and hydrodgenated coconut oil in them and artificial flavors.  VERY dissapointed, and Amazon just said oh well when I brought this HUGE misrepresented item to their attention.  I now have 4.4lbs of garbage to toss out.  People with dietary restrictions should be very wary when buying from Amazon since there is no one checking the acuracy of the item info placed on Amazon, per the email they sent me.
