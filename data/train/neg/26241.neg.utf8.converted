This product is way overpriced!!! There is barely any candy in this box!!  I should have gone to the store and bought the candy and made my own box.... I bet I could have made 4 of them for this price.  The box is not even nice, it's plain, just a piece of paper saying Happy 80th Birthday on it.  I mean at least give me a box that's decorated with things from that era.  I obviously would not recommend this product!
