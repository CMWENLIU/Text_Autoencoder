We have 2 tomcats and this is the first time I've tried the Litter Pearls and I hate them and<br />the "boys" do too.  They don't clump the waste in the litter tray and they don't cover it<br />either, not like the other brands, so you see most of their poop and it smells unlike<br />the other brands and it is so hard to clean up because the little<br />pearls roll everywhere when some spills out of the litter tray after the boys have been. Hate it<br />and will not ever use this again.
