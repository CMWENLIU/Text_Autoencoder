I've bought all 3 brands of pitted country olives sold on Amazon.  These are my least favorite by far.  There is too much rosemary in them.  It detracts from the olive's flavor and all the rosemary "stems" make for an unpleasant eating experience.  I find myself reaching in my mouth to pull out the stems like when you have a hair in your mouth.
