The packaging of the creamers did not hold up to the test of shipping.  About a quarter of the creamers were cracked open and covered the inside of the box.  They smell amazing but it doesnt out weigh the hour that it took to clean up and the 46 creamers I lost.  I do not blame Amazon.com, International Delight, nor the shippers, but the combination of the three didnt get the package to my door unharmed.
