I purchased the Boardwalk Blend because it was described as being a flavor match with Newman's Own (which I like very much). It wasn't a match. It didn't have much taste and had no aroma at all. Its taste most resembled the flat-tasting stuff that came out of my pot-and-filter coffee maker, and that's what I was trying to get away from with the K-cup machine.<br /><br />Immediately after I tasted this coffee, I made a cup of Newman's Own to be sure I wasn't being too critical. I was not. It's definitely not a flavor match.<br /><br />I am all for as much competition in the K-cup market as possible (so their prices might finally come down). But Brooklyn Beans is going to have to try harder if it wants to stay in that competition.
