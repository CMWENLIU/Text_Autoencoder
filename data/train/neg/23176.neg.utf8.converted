By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.<br /><br />I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the "new" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.<br /><br />This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs.
