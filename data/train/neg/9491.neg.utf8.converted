This is my first review here on Amazon and I felt I needed to post after reading the other reviews on here and trying the product. The other reviews aren't valuable at all and don't say anything about the flavor...which is not to my liking. I tried this product on some beef fajitas and it was far from what I expected. It is very sweet. I was expecting soemthing that was spicy...not hot...but spicy as I would expect on traditional Mexcian food. At first the sweetness was not bad but not good but the more I ate the more it wore on me and in the end is just not good and too sweet. If you like sweet Fajita mix then this is for you. I hope this helps.
