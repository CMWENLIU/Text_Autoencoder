I have been a Senseo coffee lover since 2004.  This has been the best cup of coffee I have found.  On my last trip to Europe I brought a suitcase full of Senseo Coffee Pods back with me.  They are much cheaper in Europe.<br /><br />The coffee in the pods is not the same as in the past.  It's no better than the cheap coffee in the can you get at any grocery store.  I like a full bodied dark cup of coffee, and that's what I used to get in the Senseo Dark Roast.  Now it tastes like dishwater.  I like brewing one cup at a time so I ordered the aftermarket filter insert so I can use ground coffee.  If it doesn't work as advirtised, I'll get a different coffee brewing system.<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Why can't companies leave well enough alone.  If Sara Lee needed to make a bigger profit margin, raise the price, don't change the quality.
