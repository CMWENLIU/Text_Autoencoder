I have been eating these cookies most of my life (and I'm no youngster).  These cookies have changed.  I bought a package of them today and took them back to the grocery store, thinking that something was wrong with them.  They tasted funny and seemed kind of stale.  They gave me a different package which solved the stale problem.  However, the taste is just not good.  I don't know what Keebler has done to these cookies but I'm done buying them.  They are just flat out not as good as they used to be.
