This is the best example of buyer beware. The glucose rise happens 3-4 hrs after. Do not listen to the hype about cooking in acidic tomato sauce. Your stomach uses hydrochloric acid. A heck of a lot stronger than that in tomatoes. If you need to watch your blood glucose watch out and check at hr 3 and 4 and you will be shocked. No differece than regular pasta. The 5 grams of real fiber (inulin) just causes a delay in the high rise. Metamucill makes an easy dissolving fiber with inulin. Take it right before normal pasta ingestion and you have the same affect.
