Was so excited to try this. I received one single serving and was rather disappointed I didn't get a box as I love lemon, my very favorite flavor. I mixed it with the 8 oz of hot water and it doesn't quite look like the box, mine was darker. First sip and I was very disappointed, yikes it is ginger to the max. I like ginger but this is almost ginger gone bad and I couldn't taste the lemon at all. Now I was glad I had only one packet.<br /><br />Wanting to give it another chance I put it in the fridge and later added ice to see if it was any better. The answer was no. It made me feel kind of sick and that is strange because ginger is so good for the stomach. I had no ingredients to look at on the pack all I know it was made in Singapore. If you like SERIOUS ginger then this is for you.
