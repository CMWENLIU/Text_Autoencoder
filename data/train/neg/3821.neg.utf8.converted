Waste of money.<br />If you like to have cranbery tea, it is good product. For weight loss? please don't buy it. I have used for months but gain weight about 20lb by far. Of course weight loss is associated with many different factors but it NEVER decreases your appetite, burns fat, nor increases metabolism. I did exercise at least 30 minutes twice a week and have moderate levels of physical laber - but never worked!! Maybe it is just me but you'd better try some other products.
