I have used Wellness Core for a long time.  I did a lot of research before choosing it.  However after getting a new bag that was moldy I started doing some research.  The company has been bought out and many many consumers have complaints about the quality control of the food now and in some cases their dogs have been getting sick on it.  I am not saying not to buy it but just beware that it is not the same company anymore.
