First, this product package is about the size of a Cool Aid package, approximately 2" x 3". It comes in a sealing foil package similar to Cool Aid. I ordered this through the Vine program and to my amazement, this small package of powdered drink mix came in a box big enough for 20 books! It came in a 19" x 14" box, stuffed full of protective air bubbles. While I appreciate good packaging, the waste here completely turned me off! It was incredible. The product itself was so-so. Not terrible, but not really good either. It is definitely not something that I would replace my green tea or peppermint tea with during the day, so I don't see myself drinking it or desiring it. If you something a bit different, you may want to give it a try. But I was not very impressed with either the taste or the waste associated with this product and will not be using it again.
