I bought this item and last weekend ate quite a lot of it.<br />The savory taste is appealing, yet I have had to educate myself on safe ways to enjoy that taste.<br />Little did I know that my food sensitivity issues would peak shortly after.<br />It began with searing pains in my shoulder, arm and neck. Then a supercell migraine and seizure.<br />It was the most painfully harrowing ordeal of my entire 65 year life.<br />For the first time in my life I was wailing and whimpering uncontrollably, as if tortured.<br />My wife got me to the ER where they gave me IV morphine, then benedryl, then more morphine, then more benedryl.<br />After an hour of blow torch pain, with emergency medical intervention,  it started to pass.<br />I am deeply humbled to more careful choices in the future.<br /><br />This product has a cute bottle, quaint ad campaign, and interesting history.<br />However the slogan: "love it or hate it" is not just about taste.<br /><br />If you have an MSG (monosodium glutamate), or any free glutamate sensitivity, stay far away from this stuff.<br />All processed yeast products and many fermented food items, extracts, additives, concentrate free glutamate.<br /><br />Free glutamates function as a neurotoxin and we each have a different threshold of sensitivity.<br />Phantom neck, shoulder or arm pains are the beginning of noticing where your threshold is.<br />Long time, or early life overdose is linked to symptoms of asthma, migraine, autism, ADHD, ALS, MS, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer's, to name few.<br /><br />Please save your self if you are sensitive to these chemicals.<br />Educate your self through the web info resources on what to watch for (so much it is in), learn to read and decode food labels, etc.<br /><br />This may not ever surface as an issue for you.<br /><br />All others, please enjoy.<br />Word to the wise.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />WV
