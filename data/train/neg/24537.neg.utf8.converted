The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were "Exotic Floral and Berry" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.
