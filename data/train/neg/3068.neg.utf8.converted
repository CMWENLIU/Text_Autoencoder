I really like Earth's Best Baby Foods and Amazon, but these jars were packaged so that glass touches glass... this may not be worth the good price.<br /> The jars arrived all wrapped up in bubble wrap, but 2 of the 8 jars were broken inside.  It was a big mess to clean up the broken glass and baby food.  Also, per the amazon return policy, grocery items are not returnable.
