I'm gonna have to say that I bought this against my better judgement. So yes, it is my fault. Now that we got that out of the way: the basket. There's no other way to say it: the other bad reviews were right. I usually try and stay away from the bad reviews, because let's face it, most of the time it has nothing to do with the product and/or the person is just bitter. But really, this item looked like something you pick up at the dollar store. Seems like they scrapped whatever they could find together, put it in a cheap basket and mailed it out. Each item comes in a sealed plastic bag on top of shredded paper(?) in each section of the basket. You'd probably do a lot better spending 10 bucks somewhere and creating a basket yourself. But feel free to send this out if you want people to A. think you're cheap or B. Hate the person you are sending this to.
