I'm disappointed and I haven't even used it yet.  When I checked the ingredients list on line everything was ok.  A little curious on why they used sodium hydroxide in the yellow, but everything was natural.  That is what I wanted.  When they arrived I read the ingredients on the box and to my surprise the yellow is listed: Glycerin, polysorbate, propylene glycol, filtered deionized water, curcumin.  Polysorbate and propylene glycol, which is used in anti-freeze, aren't natural.  I now can not use the yellow at all.  I have had to order yellow from another company that has all natural colorings.  I am hoping it arrives before Friday so I can use it the frosting of the cake I'm making for my niece's 1st birthday.  I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing this in the future.
