I like these beans very much, but I am not happy that we were sent many badly dented cans.  We would not have purchased dented cans from any store. I feel that the seller is taking advantage of the fact that the customer will not go to the trouble or expense of returning cans of food.  Is Amazon to blame for this -- or is it the manufacturer, palming off damaged merchandise on the internet consumer?
