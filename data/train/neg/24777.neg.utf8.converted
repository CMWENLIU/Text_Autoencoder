I recently bought a bag of chocolate chunks from the store near my house.  It tasted yummy.  However when I was sampling it, I almost broke my tooth.  There was a metal button in with the chocolate.  It was hard to get hold of them to tell them of my problem.  If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money.  I didnt like how they handled it.  Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother.  JUST BE CAREFUL
