We bought this specifically to add body to homemade yogurt. We'd seen only good comments about it. Using less than half a cup of Nido to  42 oz of fresh whole milk resulted in the worst tasting yogurt we'd ever made. We couldn't believe it was the Nido, so tried again, this time with a scant 1/3 cup. Still horrid. Went back to the store brand, not great but certainly edible, until we were able to pick up some Saco, which worked well. I'm not sure whether the Nido was rancid or just didn't fit our taste. It *shouldn't* have been rancid, being in a sealed can just purchased, and not beyond expiration...
