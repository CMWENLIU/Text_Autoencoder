I bought the spray. Didn't work the 1st time. Then dispersed the liquid w/out using the spray the next day....Raccoons and squirrels were happily playing in the area flipping me the bird.  Went out and bought the dry formula... emptied the canister on the extremely small area around my bird feeder. Just checked and sure enough mr racoon is is happily feasting on bird food, amongst the critter ridder, below the bird feeder.<br /><br />Sorry Birds find your own food now.
