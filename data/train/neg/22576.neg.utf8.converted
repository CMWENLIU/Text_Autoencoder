Unfortunately the title says it all.  Sweet generic aroma, not even remotely resembling to passion fruit flavor.  Does not come close to what I used to buy from another vendor here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EWBT4">Passion Fruit Tea, 2 Pound Bag</a><br /><br />They don't have it now, and I was too lazy to go to the CoffeeAM site directly, so I tried this one staying @ Amazon.  Mistake... :-(
