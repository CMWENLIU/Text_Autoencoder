OK to be fair we always have Lavazza or Illy on hand,  I wanted to try something different at a lower cost. These for us seems to have a bitter taste, I am not impressed yet.  I don't know if we got a bad batch or what? It to the point where I am even considering throwing it out and getting more Lavazza.  I bought the brick, use in a pressure machine.  We also find Starbucks has a  weird aftertaste like the beans are over roasted, possibly the same problem here??  So far made 3 cups and 2 stars is all we can give.  I even used a different milk for steaming thinking that could possibly be the culprit,  still bitter sour, it certainly the coffee.
