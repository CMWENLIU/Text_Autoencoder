The description for this product is misleading. These biscuits are not for big dogs - unless you consider 20 lbs, "big."  They are the same size as "small" or "puppy" biscuits from other brands.  In addition, my 6 month old pup is not a fan.  At first, she sniffed when I offered her one and she would turn and walk away.  Now, when she sees me pick up the box, she RUNS in the opposite direction. Like, "oh, hell no.."  It's actually quite comical.  Taste being a personal thing, my rating is really around the false advertising.  I was hoping for a larger biscuit that would keep her occupied for more than 20 seconds.  Big dog biscuits these are not.
