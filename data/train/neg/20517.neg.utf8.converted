I've ordered these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7ELTW">Traverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cranberries, 4-Pound Box</a> from Amazon before and loved them.  The most recent batch is completely different, though.  Instead of the tart fruit flavor of before, these taste more like sugar than cranberry.  They even have the crunchiness of crystallized sugar.  Gross.
