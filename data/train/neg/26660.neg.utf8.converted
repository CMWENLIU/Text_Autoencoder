Not for me.<br /><br />First, the positives: 0 calories, trendy/cool presentation, no preservatives nor artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />The downside -- the taste is just awful.  In terms of a flavor, spearmint isn't my first choice in gum, yet I find it tolerable.  The spearmint flavor here was faint and vague to the point that it annoyed my taste buds because it was just mild enough to feel like I'm awkwardly drinking a squirt of toothpaste stirred into 16 ounces of water.
