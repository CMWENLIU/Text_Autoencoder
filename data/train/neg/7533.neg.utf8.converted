I bought this product in December and was excited to use it.  I began using it last month and have used it maybe 7 times.  Today, I noticed that there is black stuff leaking in the bottom.  I am very concerned that it has been getting into the food.  I just sent customer service an email and hoping to get a response soon.  Before noticing that major problem, I would have given it a 4-star rating but now I'm leaning towards returning it or just getting rid of it.
