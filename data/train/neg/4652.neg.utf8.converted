This popcorn is non-GMO, which means it isn't genetically modified. Nowhere on the bag does it claim to be organic.  While all organic corn needs to be non-GMO, not all non-GMO corn is organic.  Corn is genetically modified to make it resistant to pests and disease.  Non-GMO corn not grown organically is frequently sprayed with pesticides.  So Great Northern Popcorn needs to make it clear whether or not it is claiming this is an organic product, because the bag doesn't back up what is stated in the Amazon description.  If you search "organic" on the Great Northern Popcorn website, "no results" comes back.  Great Northern...is this corn truly organic, or simply non-GMO?
