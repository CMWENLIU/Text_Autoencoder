They sell these things at trader joe's, which is where I got mine originally. These are decent, IF you don't already know about "Mama Lupe's" low carb tortillas. At only 3 carbs per tortilla, and with the closest consistency and taste of a tortilla you won't find anywhere else-other than in a regular flour tortilla-"La tortilla's" get their behinds handed to them by that brand. Unfortunately (because I love me some Amazon so much), you'll have to buy them at Netrition, where you'll have to pay a flat shipping fee of four dollars and ninety-five cents. In other words, it becomes very well worth it if you end up stocking up on them; which you will. Like this brand, you have to keep Mama Lupe's refrigerated or frozen. Note to Amazon: It breaks my heart when I have to purchase something that can only be bought online, from another website. Bring Mama Lupe's to Amazon, and show the people what a real low carb tortilla taste like. Do it for us. Do it for...America.
