I was making peppermint bark for the holidays and I ran out of the white chocolate melts I had been using. I'd already made one tray using another brand of white chocolate, but I still needed to make another tray so I ran to the store and all they had in stock were these Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. I figured for the price they'd be alright to use, and it is Ghirardelli, they talk themselves up a lot and sell themselves as a fine chocolatier so I figured these would be at least decent.<br /><br />I was so so wrong.<br /><br />These were disgusting, first of all. They have a very plain, flat taste. Also, there's a gross after taste that accompanies these. Compared to the other white chocolate I was using, these may as well be classified as inedible. Regardless, I went ahead and attempted to use them. They melt terribly. Actually, they don't melt at all! They became a big, nasty dry mess of powdery white chocolate imitation. No, my chocolate didn't seize, these really are just that bad.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting these to be great, but I was expecting they would be at least usable. They were not. After trying and failing to use one bag, I have decided I'm just going to use the one tray of peppermint bark I already have made and just make some cookies or something instead. These were a massive disappointment.
