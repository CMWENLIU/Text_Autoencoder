This was a present for my Mom for Christmas.  Although we were at first happy because it showed up before Christmas when it said that it would be after, we were very disappointed on what was delivered.  My Mom said that the dirt was all over, even though it was shrink wrapped.  When she found the fisherman, she said it was so small that she didn't know what it was at first.  He was not holding a fishing pole, and she couldn't figure out where he went since she found him hidden in the dirt.  She had to balance the tree against the rocks, otherwise it would fall over.  On a positive note, the seller was quick to respond for our refund.
