i ordered certified organic raw cacao powder. i recieved non organic CAROB powder.<br />i don't think they know the difference between the two.<br />i wasted 3 hours of my time baking my cake recipe and when i finished it didn't taste like chocolate cake!i went over to see what went wrong and it was the CAROB.  what a waste of my time and $70 + for the cake ingredients all because of this seller.<br />also i don't even think that the carob i just used is even food grade when i read the label on the back it say " bodybutter".
