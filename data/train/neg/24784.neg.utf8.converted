I love the way they all taste but, fruit roll up has got to be the most annoying fruity snack on the planet. Why do they roll it up? Can't they just leave it as a flat sheet, and place another sheet on top? Do you know how long it takes to unroll it? Only to have teeth snatching it up as soon as it's been freed from that plastic roll-up prison. The unrolling takes longer than the eating. I'd like to just get to the eating part thanks. Oh, and there's way more roll-ups than any of the other snacks in the package. You know, the more fun snacks.
