I have purchased Rich, chocolate Ovaltine since my now 15 year old was old enough to drink milk, but wouldn't because of the taste. Doctor said to add chocolate. Since Ovaltine has more vitamins than the others, we started using it. Now I have 4 children all considered under weight and loved that Ovaltine made their milk palatable. My youngest and most underweight refuses to drink milk without it. Bought the new recipe a few weeks ago. Kids opened it up and the smell was horrendous! I thought it went bad. The taste was not the same either (sort of like egg nog that's gone bad). Then I noticed the "New Improved recipe". Who's the marketing genius behind this one. Yes I see less calories, sugar and sodium in the new recipe, but if I was worried about that I wouldn't be adding chocolate to my milk in the first place! PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD RECIPE. My underweight children need it!!
