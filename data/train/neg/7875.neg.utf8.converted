I will NOT purchase these coffee pods in the BAGs again.  I WILL purchase this same coffee in a BOX where the pods are individually wrapped in sealed packets.  The first thing I noticed about the coffee pods that I got in the bags was they had less coffee in them.  Also, grounds had escaped from some of the pods and settled in the bottom of the bag.  What a mess - so I had to throw most of those out.  Check out the amount per pod that you get in the bagged coffee vs the boxed coffee.  The bag states 140 g in 18 pods which is 7.7 per pod.  The box states that the pods are 10 grams, which is a thicker pod and better coffee.<br /><br />Update on 6/6/12 - I should have stated that I have a Keurig machine that I have a holder for that the pods to fit in, instead of using K-cups.  The 10 gram pods are just right for that and it costs a lot less to make coffee this way.  I didn't know about the Senseo machine and that the smaller pods may work better for those. Thanks for pointing that out.  Still, some of the pods in the bags were coming apart in the bags that I had purchased.
