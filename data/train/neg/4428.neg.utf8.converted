My husband was really excited about these things. He read about them in a magazine over a year ago before they were available for purchase, and decided to buy them for me as a gift (now that they're available), to replace the two ice cubes I dump in my coffee every morning to make it "chuggable". Um, I'm not impressed. My coffee remained too hot to drink initially (just as it would be WITHOUT them in it), and was cold within one hour (again, JUST like it would be WITHOUT them in it). In fact, the only thing different about my coffee with these little Joulies in it is there was a LOT less room in my cup for actual coffee because they're quite large and you need several in your cup. Maybe they're more geared for those who enjoy their coffee in travel mugs? And because I cannot speak to this I thought one star would be inappropriate.<br /><br />I will of course lie and tell my husband they're miraculous and wonderful. But secretly I wish he'd saved the $50 because my ice cubes have been working just fine for years and are what I'll continue to use when he's not around.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I just realized these things cost him $60 and decided to return them!
