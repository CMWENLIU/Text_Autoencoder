I was drinking a bottle or two of these per day to help me lose weight (these got me off Pepsi).  I began to have very bad skin pain and muscle pain in my side and arms, wrists after about 2 weeks of drinking these.  I was going to the doctor for the pain and was about to be diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.  I started an elimination diet as a last resort because I had not always had this pain (only recently).  After stopping the Izze drinks just by chance because I ran out and the store I was getting them at did not have the flavors I liked, the pain went away.  This pain was very bad.  I was becoming a person who could not have my children or spouse hug or touch me.  My clothes hurt where they touched my sides.  It hurt to sleep and lay on the mattress with my side.  I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink.
