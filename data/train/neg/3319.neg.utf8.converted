A few weeks ago, I tried the illy issimo Cappuccino coffee drink, and didn't care for it. Part of it's probably because I rarely drink coffee, but I wasn't too thrilled about drinking what looked like brown water in a can. The Caffe flavor here doesn't fare any better, and I literally spit it out upon taking the first sip.<br /><br />Normally I'd go into the pros and cons about the product, like I do with my other reviews, but I can't think of anything to say other than I didn't like it. The flavor was an insult to my taste buds, it's still a gross-looking clear brown color, and while it might not be that bad for you as far as nutrition goes, you can still do better.<br /><br />I'm going to leave this one to coffee regulars who are used to this kind of taste.
