I ordered cashew roca as a gift. I was embarrassed to find the gift was opened and the lid was removed, all of the chocolate was bad. It looked dried-up and old. The wrappers were not even fully wrapped on each piece of cashew roca as they should have been. It was embarrassing and disappointing. The shipping was very expensive as well. I do not recommend ordering from this company- Penguin Caffeinated Mints & Specialty Provisions!
