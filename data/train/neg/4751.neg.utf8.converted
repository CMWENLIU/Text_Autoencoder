I received the first order from Amazon and the biscuits were so dried out that I couldn't even crumble them.  They sent me a replacement order and it was still very dry.  I could, with great difficulty, crumble them for my older dog but I doubt that I will try getting them through Amazon again.  When the biscuits are fresh, they are terrific for small or older dogs.
