These are very difficult to chew, and I am not that old, I am only 43. In each flakes there are tiny bits of something that are impossible to chew and feel uncomfortable while you chew. Would not buy again. Even after I left it soaking in soy mike for over 20 minutes it is still uncomfortable chewing, that cannot be good for your teeth.
