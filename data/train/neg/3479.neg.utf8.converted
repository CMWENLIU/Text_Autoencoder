This product is awful.  When I took a bite, they were slippery and slimy and there isn't any sauce or seasoning that will get me past that awful consistency.  I rushed to the trash can and spit them out, then dumped the rest, including the five unopened packages. These aren't noodles, they are stringy, stretchy globs of gelatin.  If you must try them for yourself, get a couple of friends to share a minimum shipment and save yourself some money.
