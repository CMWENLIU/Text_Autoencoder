I was looking forward to trying this product as it looks really good on the box. I was not pleased at what was in the box. I did not expect broccoli but what they package as broccoli is some sort of green dust-like substance.<br /><br />I decided to try but replaced the dust with real broccoli. I seasoned the chicken and cooked it separately. Once I had the broccoli and chicken ready I proceeded to use the product as stated in the box instructions.<br /><br />Once finished (and it is not fast) I served it to my family. The consensus was that it would be better to prepare it from scratch.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product unless you are starving and it is the only thing left in your pantry... better yet, go out and get something else.
