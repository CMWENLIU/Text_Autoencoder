This basket of products is a complete waste of money.  It costs about $35.00 and there is not enough food in it to say so.  I could have went to the market, bought a basket and filled it with a lot more and better products.  When I went to see about returning it I found out that it is not returnable.  I will never buy a basket like this again.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
