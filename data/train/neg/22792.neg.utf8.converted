This was suppose to be a 35 cup sampler pack. When it arrived(in a brown paper bag), I thought, OK this will be a good variety because I was happy to see that they were not spending a fortune on what I call useless packaging. But we were very disappointed when we opened it up. There were 35 K cups, but only 9 were not "Green Moutain" brand and of the 35, 18 were of 3 different flavors and a 4th flavor had 4 of it. That really does not give a very good sampling of flavors. Especially when 15 of the 35 are of a vanilla flavor(Vanilla creme, french vanilla, deluxe vanilla, etc.).<br /><br />I will have to think twice before we buy another sample pack, when it really does not give a very good sampling. No where even close to the picture that was provided. Keeping in mind that we did not expect exactly what was in the picture, but at least no more than 2-3 of any given flavor.
