Did a lot of research on these, but just can't get past the fact that it is all grown in China. That is enough for me. Do your research on the mass pollution they have there and how it ends up in the dirt. MUCH more than the US. No way is my little girl going to be eating these. It's a shame because it's the perfect snack. It's also a shame since the company just wants to save the extra money so they must be saving quite a bit if they still ship all this back to the US and STILL save money. No thanks. I will stick to organic ALL AMERICAN food.
