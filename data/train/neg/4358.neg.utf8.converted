The actual package received is not at all as shown in the product picture.  This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response.
