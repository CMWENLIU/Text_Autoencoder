These are no longer Colorado Spice Seeds. Colorado spice seeds were the best. Unwashed with a crisp, peppery taste. These are no longer those seeds. Otto's are just soggy, heavily washed seeds. Nothing good, just run of the mill stuff. Overpriced at this quality. I won't buy again. This ad is deceptive.
