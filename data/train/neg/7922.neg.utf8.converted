I have decided to try this based on good reviews. After about a week of taking it daily with a meal, I began experiencing severe, persistent stomach pains. I stopped taking the Maca, however I was still in pain for a few days after.<br /><br />According to numerous accounts found on Google, Maca should NOT be eaten RAW, which is what this product is. Apparently the only way this is eaten in Peru is cooked or in gelatinized form.<br /><br />As for the positive effects this is supposed to promote, I have not experienced any. This might be due to the short time I was taking this supplement, but again, the side effects prevented any extended use.
