This is another attempt at a sugar replacement that sadly doesn't taste like sugar at all. It is much less sweet than real sugar and actually tastes more like oranges than anything. Perhaps that's because it's mostly made from orange peel extract. If you like semi-sweet oranges, this is just the product for you. If you prefer real cane sugar, this will not cut it. I'd rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy. Pass me the sugar bowl...
