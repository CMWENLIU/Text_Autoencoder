I bought this last April (2011) thinking it'd be wonderful for my cat to eat food without the fillers found in cat food sold in supermarkets.  Up until the point I bought this, she'd eaten Whiskas, Friskies, Meow Mix, & all the rest.<br /><br />At first, she ate the food.  But as time went on, she began eating less & less of it & subsequently was not using her litter box as much.  Very worrying.  So I mixed in some new cat food from the supermarket.  She gorged herself, got sick, & after making her wait until her stomach had settled a little before I put her dish back down, all she would eat was the supermarket food.  If she got a mouthful of this cat food, she'd spit it out & eat ONLY the supermarket food.  This went on until recently, when I gave up & dumped out the remainder of this bag & switched back to her favorites.<br /><br />Now she's happy, & that's all that counts, right?
