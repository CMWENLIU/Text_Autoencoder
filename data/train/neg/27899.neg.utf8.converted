In Sept of 2008 I ordered my customary case of this popcorn....after realizing that the name had been changed but the ingredients were the same.  At least half of that case of 3-packs were dry and burned when cooking.  These bags were tough and tasteless, not light and fluffy as I had come to expect.  I have not received satisfactory treatment from the manufacturer, but I'll be persistent and hope to get at least half of my money refunded as half of the popcorn went into the trash.
