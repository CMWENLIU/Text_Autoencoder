In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.
