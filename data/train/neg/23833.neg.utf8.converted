Mauna Loa is definitely my favorite macadamia nut, and I've had a subscription for these so I could enjoy them on a regular basis. Unfortunately the price has now jumped a ridiculous amount, they went from $22 to $35!! Sorry, I can get them MUCH cheaper at Costco. I like the convenience of using Amazon but not at that kind of markup.
