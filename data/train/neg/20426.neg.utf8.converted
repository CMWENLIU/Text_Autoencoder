I purchased the orange chocolate bar and was disappointed.  They were were almost bitter tasting. I gave them away to a health nut friend of mine and she couldn't eat them either.  Unless you are very fond of carob, I suggest you skip these. I am so desperate for someone to make a really good tasting chocolate candy using stevia.  I've looked all over the internet without luck.<br /><br />There is big opportunity here for an enterprising entrepreneur to make some big bucks.  I know there are thousands of people like me who need to eat less sugar (or none at all) who are very aware of the dangers of all the other fake sugars out there.  I'd do it, but I'm too old and don't have the ambition.<br /><br />So until someone out there gets rich by doing just that, I guess I'm stuck with trying to make my own -  so I bought a stevia cook book on Amazon.
