Delighted to have found a GF brownie mix - only it got us sick as you get with a typical gluten allergic reaction.  Ate a brownie at 10 am, was sick at 11, bloated, gut pain.  Didn't realize it was the brownies - ate another and the same thing until i had a full blown colitis attack on top of the pain.  My husband who is NOT allergic to gluten had the same reaction.  There is something seriously wrong with this product.
