My wife & I religiously bought dental dinos for our corgi. He is a powerful, obsessive chewer that tore anything else apart that we gave him. He's been through many over the years. Recently, on a routine visit to the vet, they found that both of his molars on top were cracked & infected. They are currently performing root canals on each. If the root canals do not work,they'll have to pull his most important chewing teeth. The vet (who is a dental specialist) said that the injuries were directly related to this product. A $2000 bill and a pup with no molars. Sad day. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
