I wanted a product that was easier to travel overseas than with a ton of equal packets so bought this 6 pack of tablets.  They don't come out of their packaging very well and many times they are broken.  It is still not too bad when you consider that each tablet is half the strength of a regular equal packet so while overseas I can play around a little more to get the sugar taste just right.  Would I order it again?  Not sure but for now 6 packs will last quite some time and it is easier to use overseas.  Many European countries do offer sugar free alternatives but I am partial to the taste of equal so I am willing to put up with a little hassle to make it work - especially since European coffees are smaller in size so dealing with a smaller sugar content is okay.
