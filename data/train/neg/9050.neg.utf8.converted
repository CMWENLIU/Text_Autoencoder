I am a big fan of treats that are digestable.  I purchased this product thinking it would be safe to feed my dog.  I left the treat for my dog on my way out the door for work, when I arrived home 4 hours later the treat was fully gone and the poor dog could not control his bowel movements and had diarrhea.<br /><br />This diarreha lasted for 2 days, and was so bad that I had to take a trip to the vet which ended up being one of the most expensive trips I've made there yet to have him tested for various illnesses.<br /><br />I didn't attribute the diarrhea to the product at first, but a week later I again gave my dog this bone treat and a few hours after eating the bone the diarrhea started back up again.<br /><br />I'm unsure what exactly about this product is "healthy", and would argue against it being "edible".  Sure technically you can give this product to your dog and if he eats peices it won't require surgery to remove.  But you'll spend 2-3 days dealing with uncontrolable doggy bowel movements, and excessive dehydration.  And if your not quick enough to realize it's this treat causing your problems you'll spend a few hundred bucks at the vets office like I did.<br /><br />And don't get me started on how quickly these things can get eaten....<br /><br />From now on I'll stick with bully sticks.
