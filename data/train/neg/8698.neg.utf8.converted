Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition contains mostly grains instead of meat. The main ingredient is corn which difficult for dogs to digest and causes allergy and yeast infection problems. There little meat that exists are of low quality. In addition, it contains chicken by-products which is "a meal consisting of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice." (AAFCO definition) It also contains chemical preservatives which is banned from use in human food and unnecessary artificial colorants.<br /><br />Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition is unsuitable as a source of nutrition and should not be given to any dog. After reading up on proper dog nutrition, I have tossed my half-used 20lbs bag in the trash. Now feeding my dog "Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul" instead.
