I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to find that this product is produced on machinery that is shared with tree nuts. As someone with allergies to peanuts and tree nuts, it would be helpful and responsible if companies that purport to look out for consumers by bandying about the organic label would list this allergen information on their sale page.
