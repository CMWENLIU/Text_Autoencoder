I have been using Vetri-Science UT Strength Feline chews for over a year with no problems. This was the first time I got them through Amazon from Absolutely Pets. Sadly, the chews were either old product or a mistake. They were almost rock hard and had to be microwaved for 5 seconds and cut up with a knife before my cat could eat them. I think this is a great product and will continue to use it but hope that the supplier will either refund or replace the bad batch.
