Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee is one of, if not THE best coffees in the world.  Because of it's unique (and therefore valuable) flavor it is roasted very lightly.  It is one of the few coffees in the world that is smooth, when roasted lightly.  They should be almost cinnamon in color.  To my dismay when I opened the bag of Magnum, I saw oily over-roasted beans.  As expected, from their appearance, what I tasted was that over-roasted smokey/charcoal flavor overpowering any qualities of the beans.  IF these are truly high quality Jamaican Blue Mountain beans (which for the price they should be) it's a crime against nature to ruin them like this.  Leave this level of roasting to starbucks, to cover up the horrid quality of beans.  I bought these for less than half what they are listed for and even at that price, I give them a 1-star.
