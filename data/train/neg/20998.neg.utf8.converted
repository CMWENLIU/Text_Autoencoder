They mention the Healthwise Bakery  bagels are "dry" - very light weight. Really tastes like fluffy cardboard. Bought a Dozen, threw out 11.9 of them... god awful! even with a ton of butter and Cream cheese they were uneatable.. Also, their bread is terrible..... try Julian Bakery breads.. darn good!
