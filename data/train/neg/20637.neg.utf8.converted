Purchase with caution, this manufacturer has GROSSLY underestimated the calories, fat, and sodium in their dressing.  The Galeos label claims 14 calories and 1 gram of fat per tablespoon serving. That's where the problems start. The serving size required by federal law on dressing labels is 2 tablespoons, creating the illusion - even if those numbers were accurate - that the dressing outdoes other diet dressings.<br /><br />The laboratory showed the label should properly read: 120 calories, 11 grams of fat and 390 mg of sodium. The actual label claims 56 grams of sodium. Federal food labeling laws give companies a 20% margin of error.<br /><br />UPDATE (Nov.22): Here are the actual laboratory results before being broken down by serving size for Galeo's World's Best Miso Caesar:<br /><br />  * Carbohydrates, g/100g - 7.8013<br />  * Fat, g/100g - 38.32<br />  * Moisture, g/100g - 46.39<br />  * Protein, g/100g - 4.1387<br />  * Saturated Fat, g/100g - 6.0<br />  * Calories, g/100 g - 392.64<br />  * Total Sugars, g/100g - 7.35<br />  * Sodium, mg/100g - 1306
