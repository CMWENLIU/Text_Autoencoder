I just love Vita Coco coconut water and have been buying it locally for several years---I like the mild flavour and love drinking it after a workout. I recently moved to a more rural area and found that the price on Amazon was much better than what I could get at my nearby grocery store. I normally purchase the 11.1 oz boxes but decided that the best price was to be had on the 17 oz tetrapak. Unfortunately, my first case arrived a week or so ago and I was absolutely appalled! The coco water was virtually undrinkable. It was very sour, slightly discolored, and nothing like the drink to which I'd become accustomed. I immediately contacted Amazon, and they agreed to ship me another box at no charge. The second case was similarly poor in quality. I told Amazon that I'd like a refund so that I could order a different size. The case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita Coco 100% Pure Coconut Water, 11.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a> just arrived, and it has been only marginally better in taste, if at all. I don't know if Amazon is storing the coconut water improperly, if Vita Coco has produced a bad batch (they all have exp dates in October of 2012), or if they've somehow altered their source or coco water/Vit C mixture (all boxes say they are produced in the Philippines). I plan to contact Vita Coco directly to find out the problem, and will also be requesting a third refund from Amazon. These boxes taste so bad that I plan to pour them all down the sink in order to recycle the tetrapaks. Very disappointed.
