Please, please, please, do not listen to anyone who claims this is a decent product.  I have tried all sorts of foods designed to cut fat/calories, etc.  This is by far the worst I have ever experienced.  My wife and I could not believe this stuff was even marketable.  Seriously, a lot of folks hate fat-free mayo or fat free ranch dressing.  This is 1000 times beyond those items in terms of terrible!  I even tried to get my dachshunds to sample it; they wouldn't!  And they eat everything!  It's like a plastic goo!  We threw it all away.  We had low expectations when we bought this.  But it was so much worse than we could imagine.  Beware!  Save yourself some money.  Spread face cream on a slice of bread.  It will taste better!  Ooof!
