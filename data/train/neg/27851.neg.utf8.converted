The lid to this tea box detached after about 2 weeks of use.  The screws to keep the lid on are too short and stripped the pressed board the product is made out of.  So basically after opening and closing the box 1-2x per day it is ruined and there is no way to fix it.  I do NOT recommend this product.  Very disappointed.  Don't waste your money.
