I received an email from Amazon promoting this item and since my husband loves them I went to the website.  Not reading all the detail I assumed I would get three boxes for $7.73.  They are around $3 a box at the grocery store.  So I ordered 2 thinking I would get 6 boxes - a good deal.  Not so, one box for $7.73 - crazy.  My error for not reading the small print but the picture is deceiving and when ordering on a phone one doesn't pay as much attention.  Lesson learned but am going to try to return anyway!!!
