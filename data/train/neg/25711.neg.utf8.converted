I contacted this company and they would not tell me if their products contain Balsam of Peru. I am severely allergic to Balsam of Peru.<br /><br />What a shame, sounded like a great product.<br />Would you want to give something to your kids not knowing the ingredients?<br /><br />Sure, they list the ingredients, or so you think. If you call and ask them what is in the flavoring.... you won't get an answer.<br /><br />There are hidden ingredients in flavorings that companies do not have to divulge.<br /><br />I had horrible skin rahes over 7 years until I finally found out that I have an allergy to Balsam of Peru. Its a hidden ingredient in many, many foods, just listed as "flavoring" or natural flavoring, as it is natural, from a tree in south America.
