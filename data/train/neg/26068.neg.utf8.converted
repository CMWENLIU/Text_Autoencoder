I love these bars.  I basically live off of them.  HOWEVER, this is now the second time that I have ordered them from Amazon where the internal boxes of bars have had bugs in them.  They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.  Thank g-d Trader Joes and Ralphs are starting to carry this brand.
