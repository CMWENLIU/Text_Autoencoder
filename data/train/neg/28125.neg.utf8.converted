I should have listened to the other reviews and bought something else. I'm not sure why I went against other reviews and ordered this. It did not come as described just like everyone else said. They were little 2 oz. packages of cheese and did not have the variety described. I will not order this again. I do not suggest ordering this item unless you want a surprise. I thought it had different flavors of the summer sausage and it did not. there were 3 sticks of regular beef summer sausage and four 2 oz packages of hickory cheese, 2 2oz of the pepper cheese and 2 2 oz of the swiss blend cheese. the packaging was with the little shredded cardboard and the items were just tossed in. i had to arrange them and hope they stay where i put them.
