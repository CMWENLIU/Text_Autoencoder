My dogs love these too and I never thought to check where they were made.  They look all healthy cage free chicken, omega 3s, blah blah blah.. Someone at the store brought this to my attention as she was looking for treats not made in china.  To my horror just about all dog treats are NOT even made in USA.  So sad and disappointing. ZERO stars!
