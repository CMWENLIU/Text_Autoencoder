When I was a child, I was fascinated with pyracantha berries: the bright shiny skin over a white, dryish chalky something.  These dried blueberries reminded me of that childhood fascination.  Why?  Because they are dry and chalky.  Actually, it's more like sand or saw dust.  A previous reviewer indicated that they were too sweet.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to the point that I could tell if they were sweet or not.  My mouth was too busy rebelling over the dryness of the blueberries.<br /><br />I've been so happy with every other product, that I've tried, from Oskri, that I made the assumption that these would be just as good.  Not even close.  They are simply dreadful.
