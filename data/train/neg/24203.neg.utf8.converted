I received the Teaposy Garden Set for two & am terribly disappointed! First, the tea cups were no bigger than espresso cups- maybe 3oz., but the site does not state, so how would one know? Second, the tea pot was as tiny as one from a child's tea set, & sadly, is covered with Teaposy graffiti. Last, but not least & most important, I did not receive the flowering buds...pretty much the entire selling point for this set. I do not recommend buying this item, unless it's for child's play.
