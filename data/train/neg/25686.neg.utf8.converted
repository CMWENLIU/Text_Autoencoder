I'm so disappointed in this company! I've been drinking this water for quite a while now, but yesterday I saw my nutritionist and she checked my pH level which was acidic.  I told her that was surprising considering how much alkaline water I drink.  She suggested we test the pH of my bottle of Essentia,  so we did.  The pH was ACIDIC at 6.6!!  I was livid!  Now to be fair..I am a nurse and know that the pH strips can expire and should be stored and handled a certain way and should also be tested by buffers.  I can't guarantee my nutritionist followed these steps so I plan on purchasing my own pH strips and checking the water again.  I sure hope the strip was wrong and the next test will yield different results!  I will definitely post those results either way!
