The only reason I bought this was because I could buy it with a special 50% discount, therefore getting 6 boxes of it at half price of $ 20.80 seemed to be a good deal to me.  How wrong I was!  I was surprised to see its price jumped up to $ 22.15 when I wrote this review (cheaper when buy it via subscribe and save) which comes to about $ 3.69 a box, still cheaper than its price of $ 3.99 (plus sales tax) in my local Target.  However, the problem was when I opened its BIG box up, there were only five tiny packages: a small pack of hummus dip, a small pack of multi-seed crackers, a small pack (0.75 oz) of fruit and nut mix, a small pack of Dry Roasted Edamame and a very tiny (0.43 oz) roast dark 60% cacao organic dark chocolate.  Unless you eat like a bird, there is no way this box can serve as anything but a snack, a very small one.<br /><br />(1) Hummus dip and multi-seed crackers - there is 13 gram of fat (3 gram saturated fat) in the hummus dip, however the biggest problem is its large content of salt (450 gm sodium).  It tasted so salty (bitter) that it completely ruined the taste of the hummus.  If you eat this dip everyday, you would have high blood pressure for sure.  Now the crackers are quite good but there are really only a few of them.<br /><br />(2)Baja Blend fruit nut mix - I was surprised to see it has 5 gm of fat and 9 gm of sugar in such a tiny bag (0.75 oz or 21 gm).  It tastes quite sweet, a little bit tart and wow, spicy HOT! It burned my tongue.  A very strange mix, not too bad but very unusual and I am not sure I want to repeat the experience. I could not figure out where the hot spice comes from even after I read its package repeatedly.<br /><br />(3) Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame - quite healthy, only 150 gm of sodium and 4 gm fat (0.5 gm saturated).  It tasted pretty good but no different than any roasted edamame you can buy yourself.  It would be much cheaper.<br /><br />(4)Chocolate - yes, its is supposed to be organic, but strange enough it will not tell you how much sugar or fat it has.  The chocolate piece's outside is also whitish, to me that may be a sign of the chocolate becomes too old or? How does it taste? It taste like anything but chocolate.  I do not believe I can eat more than a bite of it.<br /><br />Therefore, not trying to bad mouth this product, but why would I want to pay about $ 3.69 to pay for a box of something that is not healthy, not filling, not tasting good unless, well, you want to lose weight.  I believe if you would eat it as your meals everyday, you will be almost guaranteed to lose weight because you would simply discard the whole box before you can finish them and will still feel hungry.
