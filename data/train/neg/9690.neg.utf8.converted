First of all, the maca powder comes in a package that looks very different than the one pictured - I was looking forward to learning more product information by reading about maca, but the bag is a metallic pouch with a nondescript sticker label on the front, and a similar label on the back (both of which just say that it is red maca powder and don't give further details).<br />When opening the package, the smell is overwhelming (it is a loamy smell which is very pungent and unfortunately, the maca powder tastes just like it smells).  The powder is extremely chalky in texture (although this isn't necessarily to be unexpected with supplement powders), and has a taste that is truly unique (I can't quite convey what it tastes like, but even when mixed in with various foods, the potent flavor lingers and the food begins to taste like maca rather than concealing the flavor).  While I believe that the health benefits of the product are impressive, with a taste that makes it hard to consume enough to reap these benefits, it may be easier to get pills (or work really hard to find a recipe that conceals the maca flavor). The one things that seems to help diminish the flavor is putting it in the refrigerator (this is also the best way to preserve the maca as this is a large package of it and it would be a shame to see it spoil).
