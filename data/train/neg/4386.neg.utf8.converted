Package arrived stamped "received in damaged condition" or something to that effect.  So Amazon recieved it from a third party, Cento Fine Foods, damaged and clearly leaking sardine oil, and delivered it to me anyhow.  What's up with that?  Upon opening, I found one of the 25 cans smashed - think pureed sardines all over the other cans - and 4 more cans badly dented.  So I really received 20 cans for the price of 25.  I hope they're reeaalllly tasty.  I guess it's better to avoid purchasing some things online.<br />UPDATE - Amazon rocks!  I have been told that they will be replacing damaged cans. (Hope they arrive in one piece)<br /><br />UPDATE 2-<br />Seller replaced my sardines!! I will certainly order them again knowing seller will replace broken cans.  Why can't I update my rating to 5?
