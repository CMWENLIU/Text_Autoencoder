The Wolfgang Puck pads seemed tighter than other pods and smells good, so I thought it would be great. However, it turned out to be wrong and the pods made a huge mess. Because they are too thick to be fit into Senseo system, you have to force it to close. The worse thing is that the cap of Senseo pops up and steam and coffee (from torn pod)came out, due to the build up of steam pressure by thick coffee pads.<br />I end up to open all the pods to make coffee in a regular dripping machine. Taste is good though.
