I recived my shipment of Marzipan yesterday 9/13/07 and I opened the package to find that the Marzipan had pieces or what looks like food or dirt. I have been picking these pieces out of the Marzipan. I do not have time to reorder from another company so I am stuck using this Marzipan<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002TVYWW">Biermann Marzipan 5 LB. Block</a>. I am unhappy with the Quality and I would not recommend buying Marzipan form this company. I also feel the shipping is very pricey.
