This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate.  Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers!  Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN!  Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers?  I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper.
