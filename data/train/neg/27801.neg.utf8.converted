This tea tastes cheap and artificial. One of the ingredients is "natural flavors" which is basically an additive. I would suggest getting a tea that doesn't resort to these flavor enhancers.<br /><br />The best chai tea I have found is from Peet's which has a strong, bold flavor. The Rishi brand is not bad either.
