I have four rescued cats...I give them IAMS...this said organic so I thought I would give it a try...ALL 4 turned up their noses and wouldn't even try it...mixed it with IAMS and eat around it or spit it out...had to cancel my subscribe and save subscription to it...was looking forward to not having run out of cat food but didn't work out.  :(
