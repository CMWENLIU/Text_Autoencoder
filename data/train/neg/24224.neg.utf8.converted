I really like the coffe-mate ceamers, especially the hazelnut.  I like the fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated since it lasts a long time.  The refigerated ones usually don't get used up and I have to throw some away and I hate to waste.  I only have one problem with this one and that is that this is the second bottle I have gotten that the pump doesn't work to well.  But, that is not enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />I forgot that I could edit my review or I would have been back awhile ago.  These are only good for awhile.  After a period of time the pump stops working and I found that I had to cut the bottle open in order to be able to get a spoon in to use the last 1/4 of the bottle as it is was thick to pour.
