Ha!  Jokes on me - there's not any actual Maple in this "flavor."  Ingredients: Glycerin, water, natural flavors (contains soy), malt extract (contains barley), caramel color.  No maple taste and does not even smell like maple!  To me, it smells very much like canned tomato juice.  I don't want to waist any other ingredients, so this is going back.<br />I actually ordered 3 flavors from Frontier.  Maple, Banana and Coconut.  The coconut is the only one that actually has coconut in the ingredients.  The banana smells totally artificial, like a cross between a fresh new Sharpie marker and a Little Debbie banana moon pie.  The coconut smells kind of like coconut flavored movie theatre popcorn.<br /><br />Update:  My product review remains the same.  I will refrain from ordering anything from Frontier.  However, just had my first ever "return" experience with Amazon.  5 stars for their customer service!
