I am looking for the one gallon plastic bottles of Arizona Arnold Palmer Zero, half & Half, ice tea/lemonade.  It is hard to find in local stores and when I find it, I can only find one or two.  The price for ANY Arizona Gallons is $3.00 retail in twenty local stores. (when they promo them, it is $2.50)!  How can this price be more than double!<br /><br />If I can get a reference to a site that sells gallons by the case, I would love to buy a few cases, but certainly not for $7.00 a gallon!<br /><br />Appreciatively.
