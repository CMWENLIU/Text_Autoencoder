I always take negative reviews with a grain of salt, especially when there are plenty of good reviews, and even with the one star ratings I read here first, figured I'd give it a try.  After pulling a dozen shots through my Gaggia Espresso, trying different grinds, tamp pressure, etc., I could not even drink this stuff.  This was the worst, most bitter, stale tasting coffee I have ever pulled through my espresso machine.  I was getting perfect 25 second doubles and the crema was wonderful but the taste was horrible.  I normally don't write reviews, but in this case, wanted to warn anyone thinking of trying this to think twice.  The rest of the beans will be going into the trash as this stuff is not drinkable in any form.  This stuff doesn't even rate one star.  Also didn't notice the "no return" policy on this before buying.  What a waste of money.
