Review edit: If you are looking for other opinions in this issue, Google Jenna Scribbles Can Green Tea Cause Joint Pain. You will be able to read over thirty comments from people around the world, confirming this problem.<br /><br />Many doctors and articles will state that green tea is good for joint pain. It's an anti-inflammatory and people suffering from lupus or arthritis are encouraged to drink it.<br /><br />I started drinking this lemon and ginseng tea last winter. I stopped drinking pop and wanted to avoid the caffeine withdrawal. About one month later my joint pain was so bad I needed to use ice packs on the affected areas. I racked my brain trying to figure out where this was coming from. I'd never had this problem before in my life.<br /><br />The only thing that had changed was I stopped drinking soda pop and started drinking this green tea. I guess you could add that I was two months older, but I hoped most people didn't dive into old age that quickly.<br /><br />So one day I decided to stop drinking this tea. Twenty four hours later I felt much better. Two days later I felt almost perfect. And one week later I was back to normal.<br /><br />I'm not a doctor. I'm not saying all green tea is bad... just analyze and take note of how your body reacts to this product or any tea. If you are experiencing joint pain - trying cutting out all tea and see if it helps.
