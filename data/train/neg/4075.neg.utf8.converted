I have been a big buyer of amazon goods and from amazon shops over the years and have already tried to be understanding of some of the more "niche" stores. However Bonsai Boy has been one Niche to far. They have been the most obnoxious customer service I have ever received. It was like the monty python sketch, This parrot is dead, no it is only mourning for the Norwegian fjords. This Parrot was dead ass as a dodo and to declare otherwise is pure chicanery.<br />The tree was nothing like the picture, there was no indication as too how it should have looked, it was damaged during shipping. On top of this there was no effort to redo, what is in my mind, a major wrong.
