I searched and searched for what I thought would be an economical pack of popcorn for my 8 oz popper.  We like the theater style popcorn and the coconut oil - if you know the hi-temp hopper style poppers, you are familiar with the different oils that can be used and that coconut oil is the preferred oil for many people who want that authentic movie-style popcorn taste.  The description on Amazon says that these packs come with coconut oil.  The cardboard case the packs came in also says coconut oil.  But in the fine print on the individual popcorn packs, the ingredients listing says that it may contain a variety of oils including coconut, canola, etc.  I'm crying FOUL play here.  If I wanted an oil blend or an oil that was not coconut, I would have bought that.<br /><br />So - for a $30 case of snacks, will I be returning it - probably not - return shipping will kill me and I will still be without popcorn.  Will I buy some accurately labeled popcorn from another seller - I reckon so.<br /><br />Last thing - I am rating this as a 1 star so that my review stands out and is read - I doubt my single star rating will affect the overall rating much - and that is actually ok for me.  Understand, I am not reviewing the taste of this product - telling you that this popcorn is a 3 or 4 out of 5 for taste is meaningless when to me 5 stars would be popcorn cooked in coconut oil - which it appears I am not getting with this product.  Kind of like being a fan of all beef hotdogs and ordering one but when you read the fine print, you find out what you are getting is an all-meat hotdog -- which may include beef or pork or chicken or who knows what.  The all-meat hotdog may be ok tasting and be a 3 or 4 out of 5, but that's not the point - if you order all-beef and are served something else then that is going to be a disappointment.
