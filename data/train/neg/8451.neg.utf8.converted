This tea does not work at all. I bought it considering the fact that it contains Valerian Root, which is the tea that aids sleep. Completely disappointed. Did not help me sleep at all after 2 weeks of taking it each night. It didn't even make me a little bit drowsy. If you want a good night's sleep without taking sleeping pills, take Valerian Root Tea. If your nearby food store does not have it (Whole Foods- been waiting for 3-4 months), then just get it online. Amazon has some really great prices. And yes, Valerian Root Tea Smells like straight up poop, but one bag knocked me out after 30 minutes and I suffer from MAJOR insomnia. Hope this helps. Do not get this tea!
