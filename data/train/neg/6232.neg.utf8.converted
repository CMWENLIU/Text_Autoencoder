The Xylitol is AWESOME & has NUMEROUS health benefits (i.e., benefiting diabetes, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, cancer, bone/joint disorders, dental diseases, bad breath, hormone levels) but the TITANIUM DIOXIDE is TOXIC.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it.  If you have a PC research it yourself.
