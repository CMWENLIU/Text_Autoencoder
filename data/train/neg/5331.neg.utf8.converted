NO CURRY.  These products contain "Red Chili Powder".  And too much of it.<br /><br />In addition, each package has over 30% sodium!<br /><br />Each package arrives with a free CD promoting their mission.  We now have 6 CD's of the same music!!<br /><br />The portions are NOT as photographed. Maybe for two people, maybe.  The "Spinach with Cottage Cheese" has 4 cubes among a small portion of spinach sauce.  Not even worth the time to heat.<br /><br />The flavor is good, with the above exceptions. And the ingredients tasted fresh.  The packaging is prepared for NASA...(sealed in a silver pouch) so it makes one wonder how fresh indeed it is. And made us lose our appetite.<br /><br />If you purchase this, you pay for the packaging. And a free CD.
