I have been drinking Keemun Congou tea for more than 20 years. My first taste of Keemun was from Harrod's and the bright red color and the fabulous bouquet of Keemun made me a fan for life. In my opinion, the taste should be slightly astringent but sweet on your tongue. I love to open my jar of tea in the morning and inhale the slightly smoky, winey aroma of my tea much like coffee drinkers enjoy the smell of a newly opened can of coffee. Keemun really is the Bordeaux of tea.<br />Then the inevitable finally occurred the company I normally buy my Keemun tea from (Special Teas) went out of business, selling out to Teavana and Teavana has chosen not to carry the Keemun I prefer. Alas I found myself looking for a tea to replace the now unavailable Special Tea's Keemun, so I bought two pounds of the Davidson's Keemun because the price was right. Unfortunately this tea is nothing like the Keemun I love and look forward to every morning. The Davidson Keemun smells green and unfermented, almost like a green tea or perhaps slightly fermented like an oolong. The brew does not have that slight smokiness to it and is not sweet on my tongue.<br />I tried brewing it with more tea but that tasted like I had just used more green straw (someone equated it to being barny) and was not at all pleasing even to my husband who is less particular. In the end I am wondering what to do with the enormous amount of tea I have left and have to give this product a thumbs down.
