We really wanted a product that tasted like coffee and this is slightly similar.  But we were disappointed because it just doesn't have that coffee flavor.  We bought three bags and we have 2 and one-half left.  We just can't "get it down."  If you do buy it, make sure you follow the instructions otherwise it will come out too "thick."
