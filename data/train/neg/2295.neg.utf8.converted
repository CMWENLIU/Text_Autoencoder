I bought this based on the great reviews. I appreciate that it's super healthy, but it tastes very bland and the texture is rock hard (think grape nuts w/ hard raisins). I feel like I'm going to lose my fillings w/ every bite. I tried soaking it in milk for a few minutes but to no avail. The box suggests serving it either cold or hot after cooking it over the stove. I can see why it should be cooked soft.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this cereal but I don't. My husband hates it too. We're wondering how we're ever going to finish all 6 boxes (I'm mixing it w/ other cereals for now).
