When I received this flour it was almost at its expiration date.  It already had a rancid smell.  I have bought millet flour elsewhere to ensure I received fresh flour.  For the price you pay for the flour, you would think the manufacturer would not sell old flour at full price.  I hope amazon does a little more to ensure the company is not selling old grocery items to its customers.
