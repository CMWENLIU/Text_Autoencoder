I ordered this product a year ago, and it was PURE DATES, just as described on the Amazon page.  But recently ordered again, it arrived and has all kinds of other ingredients in it!  It does NOT taste the same at all. Very disappointing!  I hope Amazon can find a supplier that offers date molasses with ONLY dates in it.
