We have 3 mixed breed working dogs.  We purchased these as a treat and they loved them. There have been several dogs in our area that have been sickened by tainted products from china. We recognized the issue immediately in our dogs, because other pet owners had written detailed reviews that clearly defined the symptoms. Thank you to all the reviewers on this site and others.<br /><br />We no longer purchase any pet food or pet treat that is made in China or contains products made in China (hard, you have to really check out the maker) to our dogs. They are willing to poison there own people to make a buck, so why should they care about animals in another country. We bake our own dog cookies (lots of great recipes and books out there) we recently purchased a food dehydrator and use locally grown chicken and beef and make our own jerky treats. It's remarkably cost effective if you buy meats and chicken from the producer, instead of a store.
