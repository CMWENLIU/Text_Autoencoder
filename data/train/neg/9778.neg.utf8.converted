This stuff is delicious. That said, there are other considerations. I had this on Eggo waffles for breakfast. It was all I could hope it to be. Then two hours later my stomach began to growl and roll and I developed cramps. I spent the next six hours running to the bathroom. It is sweetened with maltitol, which causes extreme gastric distress for some people. Check it out on Google. I guess I'm one of them. I waited three days and tried it again for lunch, thinking maybe it just didn't like an empty stomach. Same results. So if you are going to be "out and about" do NOT try this for the first time. Wait until you are at home all day. If it is agreeable with your digestive tract, it's as good as any sugared table syrup. I ended tossing the second bottle I bought in the trash.<br /><br />Terry
