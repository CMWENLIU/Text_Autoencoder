If you are a fan of peppered beef jerky then you are probably not looking for something sweet. More likely you prefer something spicy.  This is not it. I think this is one of the worst tasting peppered beef jerky i have tried. Way to sweet, but if that is what you are looking for, then go for it.<br />Ok, I hated that beef jerky. It was gross. I dont think you will like it. I dont reccomend buying it . Enough said.
