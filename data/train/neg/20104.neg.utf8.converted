This is a below average gum.  The flavor is mostly gone within half a minute.<br />If I had known ahead of time that it was made with raw materials from China I would have never purchased it.  Does it really contain Xylitol or is it laced with contaminants as other products from China have been in recent times?  Will not buy again.
