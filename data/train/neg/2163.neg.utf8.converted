The one lb. tin is well packed and melded together.<br />I had to bang it with a meat cleaver carefully to separate the clomps.<br />It all tastes strange because bits and bits of all the candies<br />are all over each candy.  So an orange candy first tastes of peppermint and/or<br />other flavors before it is the taste of orange.<br />Moral:  This is what happens when you dwell on Christmas Past.  HA!  Cheers!
