This gum only had 0.17 grams of xylitol which is a powerful sugar alternative for preventing dental carries. (see wikipedia)  Recommendations are to have at least 6 grams of xylitol daily for full efficacy.  At that rate, you would need to consume 35 pieces of this gum for it to be effective.<br /><br />Also this gum contains other products such as sorbitol which inhibits the effects of the xylitol.  I would look into other products such as &lt;...> or spry/xlear or zellies for pure xylitol gum.  This trident gum is only a marketing scam.
