I live in a rural area where it can be difficult to get even the store brand grated cheese, and so I was hoping to solve that problem by finding a good brand online. I certainly wasn't expecting gourmet quality, just something adequate.<br /><br />When I read the reviews of this product, I was very hopeful. I am not a fan of Kraft grated cheeses, and never buy them. So when people said in their reviews of this product that they felt this was better than Kraft grated cheese products, I hoped it might be comparable to the local store brand, which is actually quite good. I was VERY disappointed. This cheese is sharp, but lacks any of the richness and more subtle flavors of even a moderately good parmesan, and is extremely dry. I find I don't cook as much pasta as I used to because this cheese is so disappointing. Everyone who knows me knows that I really enjoy cheese on my pasta, but I will go without before I will waste my money on this again.
