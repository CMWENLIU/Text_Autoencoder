For some reason the makers of Twist have recently replaced their naturally sweetened waters (using Agave) with Stevia Extract so the product now has 0 calories instead of 9. The Agave sweetened product was great and I was drinking a couple dozen of these a month. Now its just like all the other flavored 0 calorie waters using artificial sweeteners with the typical aftertaste. Very dissapointing.
