I ordered two boxes of 6 VitaCoco water.  I only received one box, so clearly I was miffed that I was missing half my order.  Making matters worse, after opening the box that contained the six Vitacocos, the packing cardboard was clearly wet, and indeed a box had burst and leaked Vitacoco water all over the insides.<br /><br />According to the Amazon returns policy, the items could not be returned, but customer service was willing to refund the purchase.  So kudos to Customer Service, but jeers for everything else.
