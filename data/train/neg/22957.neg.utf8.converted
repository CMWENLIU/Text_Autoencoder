The product has changed, dramatically since I last purchased some about 4 months ago. It even tastes worse!! They've added High Fructose Corn Syrup and cheapened the taste. It now tastes just like their regular syrup found in all supermarkets. Even my friend said the same thing. It's no longer "special" and I won't be purchasing it anymore, a shame, it used to be very good!
