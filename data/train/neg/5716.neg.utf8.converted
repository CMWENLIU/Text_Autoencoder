I didn't buy this particular one, I bought the bigger one, it was on sale after Christmas. Oh my GOSH these candies are horrible. The chocolate is horrible quality to begin with. Then every single one is filled with a horrible crap filling. I know some people enjoy the strawberry or coconut filling, but EVERY SINGLE ONE has some sort of weird filling on the inside. I can across one where the filling was purple, I had already bit into it and there were little seeds, like maybe blue berry or grape? The fillings taste worse than the cheapest kind of jelly beans. There are no normal candies in these assorted sets.
