Larabars were recommended to me as a great gluten free snack.  I know that I need to alter my food expectations and stop to comparing to "real food" (that is the gluten containing food), but I couldn't even swallow the Carrot Cake Larabar.  I tried it and really wanted to like it, but I couldn't do it!  I'm still in search of some fabulous gluten free snacks.
