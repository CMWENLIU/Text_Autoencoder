This wasn't available at Amazon in August 2010 so I bought it online elsewhere.  I bought it based on the 5-star rave reviews here.<br /><br />I have to say I'm disappointed.  This product is basically a blend of peppers with a little sweetener added.  I find it kind of yucky.  I realize everyone has different tastes.  I wanted a salt substitute to sprinkle on a bowl of brown minute-rice, which I eat often.  This seasoning is not remotely as tasty as table salt, or as tasty as Onion salt.  To be honest, Onion salt (from Ralphs aka Kroger) tastes 10 times better.<br /><br />For this review, I sprinkled some of it on a paper plate in front of me.  I dipped my finger into it right now and tasted it.  First impression is a little bit of very light sweetness, followed immediately by a bitter taste in the mouth, then some pepper burn on the tongue, creeping back in the throat. I've got to drink some water.  I also tried it on rice 3 times earlier in the week.<br /><br />I'm a little irritated.  It doesn't deserve five 5-star reviews.  You can't sprinkle this all over buttered rice and get a nice tasting meal, like you can with Onion salt.  Maybe Chef Paul has something better than this (that is low salt), but this is not the  wondrous, magical panacea that I hoped it would be.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients from the label:<br />Chiles, toasted onion, brown sugar, dehydrated garlic, green bell pepper, dehydrated onion, red bell pepper, paprika, spices, natural flavor, vinegar powder.
