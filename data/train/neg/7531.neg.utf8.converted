I loved this product for about 4.5 months!  I used it to make batches of organic baby food several times each month and loved how easy it was to make healthy food for my daughter.  Occasionally I would notice dark particles in the lighter colored foods that I would make and just thought I was seeing bits of the skin from potatoes or carrots that I didn't peel with the greatest of care.  Two weeks ago, I noted a larger speck in the potatoes I was feeding my daughter and pulled it out.  It looked like a metallic flake.  I began to examine the machine and discovered that the interior coating of the water reservoir had begun to bubble up and was flaking off along the bottom of the tank!  I contacted the company asking for the chemical composition of the coating so that I may have my daughter tested, as I had no idea how much of this coating she had ingested over how long a period.  The company representative first said that there was no coating and that the tank was ceramic, so what I noted MUST be limescale build-up.  I am not unfamiliar with limescale, and absolutely know that THIS is not mineral deposits, but the actual darkish grey, metallic coating (underneath where the grey has flaked off, the reservoir is black).  I took pictures to send the company and spoke with other company representatives who finally admitted that yes, there WAS a coating and said they thought it was silicon-based over aluminum.  I asked again for the name of the compound and/ or the chemical make-up so that I could have my daughter appropriately examined.  They agreed to contact the company in China and get that information.  They called back days later and said that the Chinese company sent a letter saying that the "silver coating"  was tested and FDA approved.  That's it.  I asked AGAIN for the chemical composition, and was told that it would take an additional 3 days to get it.  In three days, they called me back and said that the coating was a silicone material approved for food contact.  In other words, they reiterated EXACTLY THE SAME THING that they told me previously.  This company is STILL refusing to disclose what the interior reservoir is coated with and it has been two weeks since my initial request with them.<br /><br />The company claims that they have never received a complaint like this, so if anyone else out there has had this issue, I suggest that you contact Baby Brezza (1-888-396-6552) and let them know so that they can possibly recall this unsafe product.  The lot number on the bottom of my machine is WSI-030.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Though this is a great idea and saves you some time and hassle in the kitchen, I recommend skipping it and making your child's food the old fashioned way - steam it on the stove!
