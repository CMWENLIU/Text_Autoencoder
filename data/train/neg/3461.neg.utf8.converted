I mean earthy, like dirt.  This tea is very woody, and earthy.  There is no Pear aroma, flavor, I don't know why it is even on the label. I don't hate it, but will find trouble trying to finish the 48 cups I bought.  I think anyone who buys this must have tasted Rooibos tea before. I love the organic part of this drink.  I did not find this tea weak, the flavor is just bland, except for the slight woody aroma, and an earthy taste.  It is unique alright, but not like a tea to me. Maybe it takes getting used to.
