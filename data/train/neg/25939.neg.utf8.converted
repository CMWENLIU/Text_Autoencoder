I've been ordering this for years. The first shipments were amazing. The most wonderful taste and moist and flavorful. The first order I think was in the low $20's for 24 cans. Now it's almost double. The last shipment was dry and hard and not at all the same as the wonderful tuna I used to get. I won't order this again as it's not the same product it once was. I just looked at the can and it said Thailand too. No thanks!
