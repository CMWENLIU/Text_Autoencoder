I've never had bake dried pears before but these were tough like leather and I had difficulty chewing them even though I have all my own teeth.  Small pieces of stems were left on.  The flavor was difficult to discern because of the difficulty I had chewing these dried pears. I would recommend their apple chips. They are small, but tasty and definately chip-like in texture and much easier to eat.
