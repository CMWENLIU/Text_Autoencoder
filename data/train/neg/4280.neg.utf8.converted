My Tulsi arrived, and happy to share it, I opened it up to share with friends. What a disaster! Not only did the Tulsi contain a few bugs, it is not "pure" Tulsi. Though it lists three types of Tulsi, it appears to contain other elements.<br /><br />The bugs also indicate that it was not stored properly. I will be getting my tea elsewhere!
