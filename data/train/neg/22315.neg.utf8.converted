I've been eating Knorr (Lipton) noodles for about 15 years now. They are simple to make, inexpensive, and tasty. This particular variety is rather lacking in the flavor department. As far as all the Knorr varieties go, this is near the bottom of my list. I will probably not be buying this one again. This flavor, along with the other two new flavors (Bacon Cheddar and Scampi) are rather disappointing. I would have expected more from Knorr. The discontinued Beef Lo Mein Asian side from Knorr was much, much better than this.
