Although I love the convenience of this coffee maker, I have been very disappointed by the flavor of the decaf coffee.  The coffee brews beautifully, creating an appealing frothy "crema" at the top.  However, the coffee itself is very bland.<br /><br />I keep hoping that Senseo will introduce a "bold" decaf option.  My husband, who drinks caffeinated coffee, quite enjoys their "bold" coffee pods.  In the meanwhile, I circumvent the problem by using two decaf coffee pods, while selecting the one cup option.  It concentrates the coffee, which significantly improves the flavor.  It bothers me, though, that I'm paying "twice" for one cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the reviews, it seems like a lot of people enjoy the decaf coffee, as it is.  However, if you enjoy a more intense, bold tasting coffee, you will need to use two pods to get some approximation of a distinct coffee flavor.
