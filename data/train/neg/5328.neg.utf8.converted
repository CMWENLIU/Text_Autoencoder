Coming from NYC, Ive had Indian food since I was in my early twenties... I found it to be delicious and amazing with many different dishes from Korma to Jafrezzi..<br /><br />These curries are some of the worst oily tasting gritty messes Ive ever had and I am not new to instant foods or curries that are out there on the market.<br /><br />I dont know what else to say but dont trust the reviews that seem too detailed and are clearly corporate spokespersons; these are not worth your time no matter how cheap and how steep the discount
