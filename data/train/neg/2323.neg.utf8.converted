I ordered this item by mistake.  I thought I was ordering the Pizza Crust which our family just loves.  When I saw that I have made the mistake, I decided to give it a try - we now had 6 packages.  But this was the worst GF bread we have ever made.  Had to keep putting it back in the oven because the middle was raw and outside was hard as a rock.  We tried to eat it, but just threw it out - the first time I have ever hated a GF item so much!
