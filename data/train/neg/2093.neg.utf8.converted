I tried it a few times. First to just try.  Then again to compare against Nespresso Capriccio (green pod) which has an intensity of 5 and is made like the ECC's Expressivo. Arabica and Robusto mix.  The Nespresso Capriccio is not my favorite because it is relatively weak.  Then I tasted the Expressivo, I was amazed how much weaker an espresso can get and to legally call it espresso.  Folger's makes much better coffee and I think Folger's is boring.  I like the environmental friendliness of this company, but it has to make a better tasting product.  This stuff was horrible.  I still have 48 pods to drink.  I guess I will give it away to my environmentalist friends as a gift.<br /><br />So disappointed.
