I don't know how well the insecticide itself works. I could not get the applicator itself to spray. There are two major problems:<br /><br />1 When you turn on the water, the part that you screw the hose onto pops off the rest of the sprayer. It is a press fit plastic piece that doesn't seem to be able to take any water pressure. Defeats the whole purpose.<br /><br />2) Two, there is a plastic safety tab that you have to press back to turn on the valve. When I bent the tab back (instruction as is molded in plastic) the whole valve fell apart.<br /><br />It looks as though no one at cutters ever tested one of these applicators before sending them off to the stores.
