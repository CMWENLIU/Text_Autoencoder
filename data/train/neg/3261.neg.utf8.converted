I was in a hurry when purchasing the item and did not check my local Asian Market. I trusted Amazon since I rarely had any bad experience with Products sold by Amazon. But I have to day I am extremely disappoited this time.<br /><br />As pointed out by a previous reviewer, the seeds are quite small. They are not all black in terms of the color. I'd rather say something else (regular white sesame seeds?) are mixed in. Even after roasting, the aroma is not nearly as good as those unroasted decent black sesame seeds I had back when I was in China. Most importantly, the flavor! Those seeds are bitter and I dare say, you must put tons of sugar to barely cover the bittness. Unhealthy on one hand, and bad-tasting on the other hand.<br /><br />I went to my local Asian market yesterday and I found the sesame seeds there, black and white, are of much better qualify and a lot cheaper.<br /><br />Bottem line: Would not recommend it to anyone else. Do not waste your money. As much as I like Amazon, you just fail on this one.
