Nuts are of above average quality, though strangely about 5% of the nuts have an almond taste to it. Better than most store bought brands. No real complaints.<br /><br />However, I have to put a low rating on this due to the price increase. I know this type of review note is frowned upon, but the nuts are not worth the money that they jacked the price up to. My total order one week ago was $34.48 shipped. Went I went to reorder, the price is now $50.90 including shipping. I do not understand the reason for the sudden price increase, but while the nuts are good, they are not worth this exorbitant price. At $10 a pound, you can find a better deal for pistachios on an equal or better level.
