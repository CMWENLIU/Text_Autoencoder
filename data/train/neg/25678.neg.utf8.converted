I ordered this gum from this same store before because they didn't sell spry with titanium dioxide in it. I read the ingredients again before I ordered this time and it still said ONLY "Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier) and beeswax (glazing agent)." Yes I copied and pasted it here to show you all just in case it gets changed. I refuse gum or anything else that has titanium dioxide in it. Why you ask? Here you read for your self. "Titanium dioxide has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as an IARC Group 2B carcinogen ''possibly carcinogen to humans''." [...] AND " Titanium dioxide is an inorganic compound used in a range of body care products such as sunscreens and makeup. It appears to have low skin penetration but inhalation is a concern." So I don't want to chew something that is bad if I breath it in. I am VERY upset over this discovery, being I give this gum to my kids. Now I have to find a Xylitol sweetened gum for my family, again. I have been chewing this gum for years and loved the ALL NATURAL ingredients, not anymore! By the way here is the ingredient list for the new bottle " Ingredients Xylitol, gum base, peppermint oil (natural flavor), vegetable glycerin (humectant), gum Arabic (texturizer), non-GMO soy lecithin (emulsifier), titanium dioxide (natural coloring) & beeswax (glazing agent). " I DON'T CARE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, I CARE IF IT IS HEALTHY!
