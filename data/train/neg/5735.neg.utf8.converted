I tried this product, I like the concept, but it's a waste of your money. Making coffee this way is just a big hassle and it doesn't even come close what the pods offer. It's a messy process, and you need to really pack it down to get any halfway decent result.<br /><br />From a reputable brand like Melitta, I found this very disappointing.<br /><br />Note on the pods;<br />I actually have my coffee pods shipped over from the Netherlands (Douwe Egberts) - the pods there are cheaper (even after shipping it to the US!), and they offer pods that have a much richer coffee taste.<br />A good backup for these are (believe it or not) the "Columbian" pods from Folgers.
