I have curry pastes from this company that are outstanding...but this particular product just isn't good at all. My hubby loves Indian, too, and he is not a picky eater--but even he told me to find a new home for the boxes we bought of this stuff! I don't know how to describe it...it's kinda vinegary and sour and it has big hunks of banana peppers in it. It isn't creamy and the texture is almost grainy. I tried to rescue it with coconut milk and it really didn't help. The "curry" in it is very faint and it's just...well...you might like it but we sure didn't. As I said, we've bought many other items from Amazon in this brand of Indian foods, but this is just the opposite of the other items. It just isn't good.
