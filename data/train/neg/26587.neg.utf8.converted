This tea tastes like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol.  Or at least, it smells like Lemon Fresh Pine Sol, and it tastes the way it smells.  I guess I can't actually say it tastes like Pine Sol since I've never actually drank Pine Sol.  I gave it one star for tasting like an industrial grade cleaning solution, and one more since it deserves credit for not burning my throat the way I assume true cleaning solvents would.  On the plus side, though, it has catnip in it so if you have hyper cats, it might relax them.
