Changing my review.  These actually really suck compared to the whole beans.  These nibs are all mixed up with stems and shell fragments; an occasional rock can be found as well.  Definitely overpriced for the quality.  If you're going to order cacao, get the whole beans and just break them up yourself, that way you can be sure to get out all of the stems and shell fragments.
