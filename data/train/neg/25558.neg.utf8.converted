Only two hot chocolate brands for the Tassimo and unfortunately neither one is made with real sugar.  Milka has the artificial (Sucralose) and the Suchards has HFCS.  The Milka is pretty bland with very little chocolate flavor, while the Suchards is decent.  Although, I prefer having milk in my hot chocolate, I will stay with Suchards until hopefully something better comes on the market.  I will use the rest of my Milka for Mocha Capuccinos and leave this one for the "Hot Chocolate Snobs".
