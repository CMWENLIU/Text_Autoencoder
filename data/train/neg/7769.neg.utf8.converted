I ordered this three times to be delivered to three different people for Valentine's day.  They had run a special promotion just for this occasion.  All three orders were canceled.  Seems like the should be ready for the increased demand a promotional price would cause.  At least I learned of this a day beforehand as opposed to my friend who found out Valentine's day their orders would not be delivered.
