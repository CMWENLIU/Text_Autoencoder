This is the worst low carb bread I have tasted. It is tough and chewy and has a horrible aftertaste. I was going to use up what I had bought and just not not buy it again. But I can't even force this stuff down. It's that bad. If you want low carb buy the Health Express, Carb Crunchers or Julians Bakery low carb bread. They are all excellent low carb breads.
