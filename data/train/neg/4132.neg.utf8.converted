I just received my shipment of this mochi yesterday and it tasted weird, not good at all. For clarification, I got the red bean and it comes with six in the package (I couldn't find anywhere how many were inside). I ate the first one, didn't like it, tried another and then threw the rest away. I'll stick to my Kohaku kind, just figured I would try out another brand now I know better.
