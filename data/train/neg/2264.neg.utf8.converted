I purchased these pods on Amazon because they were a good deal and a dollar cheaper than in my grocwery store and now I know why.  When I open the package I noticed that the Senseo watermark was very faint and hardly visable.  When I made the coffee, it took me 3X the pods to make a decent cup of coffee. What's the point of making pod coffee if you have to stand there all day to make a good cup.  I am back to buying pods at the local store now.
