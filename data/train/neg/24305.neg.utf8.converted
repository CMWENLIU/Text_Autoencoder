My apologies to all who give this particular Hormel Compleats good reviews.  I've tried several in the Compleats line, gobbling all six in the box myself.  This is the very worst of all I've sampled.  Really sorry.  Please remember, these all are personal opinions.<br /><br />The chicken is tasteless; but would be so-so when compared to most Compleats.  The dressing is...well, I don't know really how the dressing tastes because any flavor is "compleatly" wiped out by the true culprit in this disaster.....<br /><br />That would bring us to the gravy, or whatever they call that stuff on top.  I don't know how the good folks at Hormel accomplished this; but they produced a substance that not only is tasteless in itself, but draws flavor from everything around it.  That had to be quite an accomplishment, scientifically; but not good, gourmet-wise.  Certain brands of glue might be better, I'm afraid.  At least you could taste them.<br /><br />While doing this, let me again apologize to the dressing.  Just too much gravy to have any idea what it might be like.
