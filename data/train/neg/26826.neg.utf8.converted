I was so excited when I found these cookies online, they were perfect for my sister's hello kitty themed birthday party, i was going to pass these out as favors. When I received them, I was less than thrilled. They are defintely a lot cuter online. I wasn't expecting them to be perfect (after all they are just cookies), but I wanted them to be made with more care/time. In the entire box, there are about 3 that I like. The rest it looks like someone made them very quickly. About 90% of the black outline of the face are jagged as if they did it on purpose, but only a select few have a nice smooth outline like in the picture. Many of the faces have tons of black marks from the black frosting, but the marks are extrememly noticeable on the white face and I'm embarrassed for the people who end up with a MESSED UP LOOKING HELLO KITTY. Also, many of the pink bows are mixed with black so much that it bothers me. I am not a picky person, but when I order Hello Kitty cookies, I expect them to be done decently. I am a person who makes things for parties and I put a lot of time and detail into my work. Next time, I will make these myself. Such a disappointment. I had high hopes for this item. Oh well. If you want to order these for a party and don't really care what they look like, then go for it, but if you want them to pass out as favors, I would suggest you think of something else. Hopefully by adding cute packaging and some ribbon I can salvage these. Next time, please make products that look more like the pictures. There needs to be quality control. Thanks.
