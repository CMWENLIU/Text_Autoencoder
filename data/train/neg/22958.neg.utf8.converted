Pros:<br />- Dark as Advertised<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Lacking any hint of chocolate flavor<br /><br />I'm comparing this product to two store brands by Kroger and Walmart. Both of which have a distinct bitter-sweet chocolate flavor. This syrup has no hint of chocolate flavor, in fact no flavor at all. This is simply dark goo with nothing to excite my taste buds.<br /><br />Hershey . . . back to the kitchen!!!
