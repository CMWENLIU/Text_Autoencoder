This is by far the best tasting high fiber product out there... but it gave me horrible gas throughout the day.  It was so troublesome that it interfered with work.  :-(  I rarely have gas, even with eating legumes, so there is definitely something going on here...  I saw another review mentioning the gas problem, so I'm glad I'm not the only one.<br /><br />Maybe there are people out there who can digest this without having gas... then lucky you.  But just wanted to get the word out there in case anyone was wondering why they suddenly started having gas problems... :-/
