I have purchased the macadamin nuts in the past and they were very tasty these are blaaaa and taste like they have a powder on the outside of them. I would not buy these again not on line that is for sure to spend almost 20 bucks including the shipping for something not good at all. I purchased these for my husband for a surprise well it ended up being a surprise but not a good one sad to say. I have purchased from this seller before and they have always been great just not this one
