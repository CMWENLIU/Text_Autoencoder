I bought this product because I wanted to eat a healthy cereal and at the same time add more fiber to my diet.  I chose All Bran because it did not contain aspartame.  I got home and started reading the ingredients & realized the second ingredient is sugar and also contains high fructose corn syrup. It has 8 grams of sugar per serving, but they list a serving as only 1/3 cup.  Who do they think they are kidding?  An average American eats more than that for breakfast.  Do they think consumers are stupid?<br /><br />A box of Kashi 7 Whole Grain Flakes with Black Currants & Walnuts cereal lists a serving as 1 cup and contains only 10 grams of sugar for that whole cup.  Uncle Sam cereal with Real Mixed Berries contains NO added sweetner of any kind and 1 cup of it contains only 2 grams of naturally occuring sugar coming mostly from the berries.  Wow!  You mean a cereal manufacturer is brave enough to make a cereal without adding sugar?  Yes and it is good.  In comparison eating 1 cup of All Bran Buds would be consuming 24 grams of sugar.  No thanks!<br /><br />If anyone at Kellogg's is reading this please know that people who are buying these types of cereals are not buying them primarily for the taste but for the health benefits.  We are not the "Kindergarten Crowd" who needs sugar added to everything to get us to eat it.  If I want to consume extra sugar I'll eat a cookie once in a while as a treat.  If I am going to eat a cereal everyday to incorporate fiber into my diet it is not going to be one that has unneeded amounts of sugar.<br /><br />Why can't the big name cereal manufacturers use stevia as an alternative sweetner?  It has been used for years in Europe with no known side effects. The consumers buying these types of cereals who are trying to watch their sugar consumption and increase their fiber would gladly welcome less or preferably no sugar or a healthy sweetner such as stevia.
