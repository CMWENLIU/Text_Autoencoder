I buy a lot of If You Care brand products & was very pleased to see they make environmentally friendly gloves.  I ordered them through the subscribe & save program thinking I wouldn't worry about household gloves again!<br /><br />I am so disappointed in these.  I am canceling the subscription with amazon.  The cotton flock lining is a joke.  I certainly cannot feel it.  The rubber is stiff & the fit is poor.  I ordered the size small & have to keep tugging them up because they are too long in the fingers.  They move down a bit making matters worse.  For some reason the pinkie finger in particular is way too long; more so than the extra length in the other fingers.<br /><br />My hands start to sweat in these pretty darn fast.  When I need to take them off, they don't come off easy despite the fact that they are too long/big.  I have to practically peel them off.  They are not comfortable.  The only thing to like about them besides being environmentally friendly is that they are a pretty cheerful green color.<br /><br />I am going back to my old gloves by Casabella.  I have yet to find a better pair of household gloves.  They fit well, last long & are very comfortable.  They also have more meat to them for protection when you are using really hot or cold water.  Don't try using the If You Care with scalding hot water!  Amazon sells Casabella & Casabella is what I recommend.
