I tried a bottle today and it was a waste of money. I drank the whole bottle and it tasted very gross, I almost gagged on the aftertase even though I chased it with water. Felt a tiny energy boost but less than normal from coffee. There was a "crash." Slight but still, they advertise that there isn't one.
