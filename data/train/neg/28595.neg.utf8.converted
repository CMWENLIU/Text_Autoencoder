I can't believe what they are charging for this peanut butter!! I just bought it the other day at my local Hanneford here in very rural Maine where the prices are not usually that great, and I payed $2.89.  Seriously...that is just absurd.  Why would anyone by this through amazon????  I was checking out of curiosity if I could get it via the subscribe and save program thinking that perhaps I may get a better deal...but I guess I will be sticking to my local market for this. As a whole I have been very shocked and disappointed at some of amazon's prices for everyday items. I think that if Amazon is going to offer these products, especially through the subscribe and save program, they have a responsibility to be competitive and fair for the public.  Buyer's should definitely beware!!<br />Oh, and by the way, this is fantastic peanut butter.  The best natural peanut butter out there in my opinion.  Look for it locally and give it a try.
