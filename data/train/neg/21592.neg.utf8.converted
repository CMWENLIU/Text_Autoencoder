Sadly I had a terrible experience with Timothy's brand K-Cups. Only occasionally (1 out of 5) would these cups work properly in my maker--never had a problem with ANY other K-cup we have purchased (and we have 5-6 brands in the drawer at any given time). These cups would almost always back up into the maker creating a huge mess and half an undrinkable cup of coffee complete with most of the grounds from the K cup.<br /><br />Look like I just got a bad batch, but by the time I realized these were problem cups, the Amazon 30 day warranty had run out, leaving me no recourse other than to give them a negative review.
