With a family that loves smoked food, I had high expectation for this product. The description states that it adds smoked flavor to any food. Instead, it tastes more like ASH-very distasteful. However, the biggest problem surfaced when I gave one bottle to one of my coworkers to try (she's the one who introduced me to smoked salt and I wanted her to know how bad this one was). She found small greenish dots (three of them to be exact) growing inside the bottom wall of the bottle. I didn't notice them when I gave it to her because the smoky color of the salt that muted the color. But after examining them under the microscope (we're in that industry), we found the coloration of the dots to be distinct from the colors found in the normal salt content (they had a tint of dark green and were adamantly stuck to the wall even after heavy shaking!). We didn't know what it was but considering that it grew despite the strong alkaline environment inside the salt bottle, we didn't want to risk using them any further. Furthermore, there is no return policy for this product so I just wasted almost $20 on something that I cannot even use.
