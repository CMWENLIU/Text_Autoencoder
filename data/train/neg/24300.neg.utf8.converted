Items received weren't damaged or defective, merely reflective of bad advertising and labeling. The sampler pack is described as "6 tins (Pu Erh, Oolong, Jasmine, White Tea, DragonWell Green Tea & More!)" What came were two Oolongs, one "Black"  that I guessed would be the Pu Ehr, two Green  and one Jasmine. No White, and no explanation of what kinds of Oolongs and Greens were sent. The labels on the tin had only these descriptors and some Chinese labeling. Fortunately my son is fluent in Chinese, and I sent him a photo of the tins. He replied, "Well, you have one that just says Oolong tea, the other Oolong is a Tie Guan Yin, a nice flowery Oolong (unless its a Taiwanese Oolong, in which case it will be a darker).  You were right about the black tea, it's pu-er.  The green tea on the top middle just says Chinese green tea, so its anyone's guess what that is.  The other green tea is West Lake Long Jing."<br /><br />I've tried all the teas, and they're not bad. In fact, I really like the one that is labeled as just "Chinese green tea" and would love to know what kind of green tea it is. I just learned that Long Jing is another name for Dragon Well. So for $12 I get to taste a good variety of decent teas, but gain little knowledge about what I am tasting. I'm really disappointed I didn't get a white tea, since this is where my education is really lacking. If I'd been sent a white tea and told the exact kinds of green, jasmine and oolongs I was getting, I would have rated this a 5 star purchase.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they refunded my credit card $2.50. OK, that's something. I hope they have this supplier deliver what they advertise and clearly label what their teas are.
