I had the Passionfruit tea on regular order and loved it.  I thought this might be a nice substitute.  It was not.  I felt as if my taste buds had been bludgeoned by the berry flavor.  If you like very strongly flavored tea then this is for you.  However if you are looking for a delicate flavor to compliment the tea then avoid this tea at all cost.
