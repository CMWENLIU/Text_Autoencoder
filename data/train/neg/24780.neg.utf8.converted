I'm not saying it's poor quality coffee.  What I AM saying is that it's not French Roast.<br /><br />It's not double roasted.  The beans are not double-roasted, dark and somewhat oily.<br /><br />There are at least a half dozen brands that are close to or nearly French Roast.  Another coffee available from Amazon.com, San Francisco Bay French Roast whole bean coffee, is what I prefer.
