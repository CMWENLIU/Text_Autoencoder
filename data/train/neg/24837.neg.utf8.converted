I found this sauce to be underwhelming in flavor, all sweetness with a less than lovely aftertaste.  I tried smaller and smaller amounts in my espresso and could never get a comparable result to using the ghiradelli chips.  Also, the companion pump didn't keep it's prime and had to be pumped several times to be reprimed every day and so the amount released was inconsistent which made it difficult to "measure" easily.  (1 pump, 1/2 pump, etc)<br />One ounce in an espresso was VERY strong and not pleasant, and a half ounce is just sweet without a white mocha flavor.
