I am the queen of alternate, reduced-calorie foods, with an affinity for diet sodas, Splenda sweetener and everything substitutional.  This being the case, I have developed a taste for the artificial.  But even I cannot bear the flavor (and attributing the word flavor is being kind) of this product.  There isn't even a hint of peanut taste.  I took one spoonful and had to spit it right back out.  Even went so far as to try to re-flavor the product with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar-free maple syrup.  Nothing... absolutely nothing... will make this product edible.  Do not waste your money.  Try PB2 powdered peanut butter instead.  45 calories for 2 tablespoons, but tastes even better than full-fat peanut butter.
