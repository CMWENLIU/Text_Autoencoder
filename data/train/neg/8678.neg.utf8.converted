Our 6-month old had been eating rice cereal for 2 months when our order of Earth's Best Rice Cereal from Amazon arrived.  He has not had any major illnesses in the past.  Upon his first feeding of this product, he became ill (vomited).  We tried feeding him cereal again in an hour, and he vomited profusely- drawing a fever.  After a visit to the pediatrician, we were told he had a "virus" (code for, "we don't know what it is").<br /><br />We switched him back to breast milk for the next 2 weeks, expecting his tummy couldn't handle cereal while he had a virus.  The fever itself had passed the same day as his vomiting.<br /><br />Fast forward to last night- all is well and we attempt to feed him a small bit of the Earth's Best Rice Cereal.  He began to vomit profusely to the point where we had to rush him to the emergency room for fear of dehydration (we were told he needed an IV).  He had a fever and was extremely pale and floppy.  We were scared.<br /><br />After 3 hours in the emergency room (waiting) we were able to breastfeed him and he kept it down with no trouble; color returned; no fever; he's back to his old self.  Doctor wasn't sure WHAT was going on (virus or otherwise).<br /><br />We realized that the ONLY three times he got this sick was when he ate this cereal.  He is not allergic to any of the ingredients on this box.  He is fine now and we've contacted Amazon about this.  They claim they may pull this product.
