I have been a Mallomar fan since I was a kid.  They were always a special treat that we truly enjoyed.  Honestly, I don't know if this is a new formula, if they changed any ingredients, or cut back on using tastier ingredients.  Upon opening this box, I could see that something was amiss.  They weren't as dark as I recall, almost looking aged, or old, although that's really not possible since production only starts up in the fall.  My first bite was also a disappointment.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate, or the marshmallow.  The graham cracker tasted awful and was a lot dryer than I remember.  Some of the cookies were broken and separated from the graham cracker.  I will be purchasing a box locally to see if production has declined or if I just received a bad box.  I'll post back with my findings.<br /><br />EDIT:  Purchased a box yesterday at Shoprite and the first cookie out was mouth watering, as it should be.  Perfect blend of chocolate, marshmallow, & graham crackers that I remember.  This indeed was just a bad box...
