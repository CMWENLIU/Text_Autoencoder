There are no instructions included with the product to indicate how to apply the mineral oil based therapy treatment beyond -- massage into hair and scalp. No guidance regarding quantity to use or length of time it should remain on the hair before it is rinsed out or if the treatment should be left on the hair, etc.<br /><br />And, the label states  --  provides light non-greasy nourishment to scalp and hair. Well, that is patently ridiculous. I tried it on dry hair and was left with a greasy mess. I tried it on wet hair and was left with a greasy mess. The first ingredient in the product is mineral oil, and it makes a big greasy mess. On the plus side, the scent is light and pleasant.<br /><br />If there is a trick to using this product that would permit a decent result I don't know what it is. As it stands, I'm a little put-off that decent instructions aren't provided. Why are we left to guess how the product should be applied?
