The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.
