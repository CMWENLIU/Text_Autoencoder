I expected to receive a mix of the four cereals advertised, but I received eight Special K (advertised cereal), eighteen Special K with Red Berries (advertised cereal) and twelve Smart Start Healthy Heart (advertised cereal).  This comes to a total of thirty eight of the cereals that I can eat.<br /><br />The balance was twelve Special K with Fruit & Yogurt (NOT ADVERTISED) and ten Granola with Almonds (NOT ADVERTISED), which I cannot eat due to serious allergies.<br /><br />Additionally, there was no Smart Start (my favorite) and the carton looked like the bowls were dumped into the carton.  I had purchased this item before and received product as advertised and the carton was properly packaged.<br /><br />I had originally subscribed to a case every three months, but I have canceled due to this unadvertised product mix.  I am deeply disappointed that I paid for sixty cereal bowls, but will only be enjoying thirty eight.
