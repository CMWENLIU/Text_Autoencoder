A great disappointment.  Having read about the excellence of vintage Pernod products, I was eager to try their modern concoction.<br /><br />What a fall from Grace!  Not only the green color of the drink is obviously artificial; when louched, the potent green is still present, making the final product greenish instead of the white it should be.  You can only taste a strong anise flavor, and a burning sensation when you are finished.  No hint of wormwood at all!<br /><br />I would not recommend this absinthe even to beginners.  Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.
