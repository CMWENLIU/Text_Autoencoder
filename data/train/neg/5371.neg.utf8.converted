Last week we bought this product to replace "PediaSure" powder for our 2 year old. Out of three times our baby had this he threw up thrice and yeseterday's was the worst as we had to run to urgent care and spend 4 hours there. Finally as his system has cleaned up, he has stopped throwing up. Initially we thought the root cause of something else and now we are pretty sure it is because of PediaSmart powder. We are done with this product as we are not going to give this to our baby anymore.
