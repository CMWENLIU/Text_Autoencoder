The first one of these I tried last year worked fine. It sprayed fine and in conjunction with the Mosquito Magnet I have, kept the mosquito population down. However, the second one I tried had a head malfunction and ened up pushing water into the bottle instead of sucking the insecticide out. Luckily I still had my original bottle and swapped the heads over. This year I bought a third bottle thinking that last year's malfunction was a one-off. After 5 minutes of spraying I noticed that the bottle contents weren't going down. I tried resetting the on/off a couple of times but it still wasn't delivering the contents. I tried several more tricks to try to get this thing to work but after around 45 minutes I gave up having effectively watered my entire garden. This one will be going back to the store for replacement and next time I'll be using something other than Cutter.
