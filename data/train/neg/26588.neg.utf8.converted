Well, I guess I should have read the description better, but I didn't see the warning about the color of these 'oozing eyes' being only on the plastic bag that each piece is in.  The candy itself is a plain white marshmallow.  They taste pretty disgusting, too.  The combination of them not looking anything remotely like an eye (even in the plastic bag you have to know that they are meant to be eyes) and tasting bad makes this a pretty useless candy for halloween.
