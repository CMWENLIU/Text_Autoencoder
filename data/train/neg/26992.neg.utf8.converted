I'm trying to cut out soda and aspartame and so tried this as a substitute. Yesterday was my first day. I had 16 oz in the morning, and plain water for lunch. In the afternoon I made another 16oz bottle.<br /><br />By 2pm I was starting to get a headache. This was probably from caffeine withdrawal. I made another 16oz around 2:30 and could only drink half of it. I started to grow incredibly nauseous and had the flavor in my mouth like I get when I have too much diet soda. The headache intensified as well.<br /><br />I'm having the headache today as well so I blame the headache on the caffeine withdrawal, but the nausea and the overdosed soda flavor I blame on the Crystal Light Pure. I'm not feeling nauseous today and I've had no Crystal Light Pure.<br /><br />Drink this in moderation. Don't be like me and drink it all day. The flavor was excellent, if it weren't for the nausea I'd rate it 5 stars. But the awful feeling I got killed it.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/28/2012<br />I decided to give it another shot with the Lemonade flavor, unrelated to any caffeine ceasing. I added the packet to a 24oz bottle of water and I drank probably 6oz and started to feel nauseous. A quick google search reveals that vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea are common side effects of truvia/stevia based sweeteners. It's likely an allergy, where it will be fine for some people, but troublesome for others. WiseGeek has a particularly helpful article detailing the side effects. Give this guy a shot, but monitor your symptoms. I really wish Crystal Light would just product a low sugar version - I don't need it to be so sweet, just a touch of sweetener to add interest.
