Omaha Steaks shipped these quickly and the product was well packaged.  It cooked up well in the microwave when following the directions.  Broccoli & cauliflower was absolutely yummy and delicious, but I was left wanting more.  The serving size is ridiculously small considering the hefty price....and I even got it on sale. The sale price is WAY too high for the two tiny servings.
