Nothing wrong with product as Planters nuts are always a favorite. But the box arrived with one flap pulled up and after counting the packages inside I discovered that it was one short of the salted peanuts (should be 12). Because of the limitations of contacting Amazon about problems - you must repackage item and return everything - I am keeping the item because it is part of a care package for my Marine nephew in Afghanistan. I am just so disappointed that someone was so hungry they had to steal from my shipment and I wish there was a direct contact with Amazon where you could share this kind of incident instead having to return everything for replacement or credit.
