My experience with Always Direct on the order of this product was unbelievable.  The prodcust arrived melted.  The Company would not respond to my request for replacement of the purchase.  Finally, I left negative feedback on Amazon.com to which they immediately replyed asking me to remove it and that they would give me a FULL REFUND. I removed the negative feedback and have not heard a word from them since.  That was over 3 weeks ago and no FULL REFUND has been posted to my account.  I would NEVER order anything from this company again. What ever happened to standing by a commitment and customer satisfaction? There should be a negative "Star" rating.
