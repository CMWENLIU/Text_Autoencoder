Wanting to indulge myself, I recently purchased a box of these at the local store. Unfortunately, contrary to the descripton on the box, I discovered the hard way that there is nothing "fine" about these assorted chocolates from Russell Stover. Not only are the creamy centers so sugary that they overpower the chocolate shell and make it difficult to tell what flavors they're supposed to represent, each chocolate piece has an underlying chemical taste. At first I gave the company the benefit of the doubt by assuming I'd gotten a box that had been sitting on the shelves too long, but another review of the smaller-sized version of this item (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZF13VI">Russell Stover Fine Assorted Chocolates Handcrafted in Small Batches 2oz</a> had the exact same complaint about the taste.<br /><br />So if you're ever in the mood for gourmet chocolates and you see these, run-- don't walk-- the other way! You're better off just grabbing a Ghiradelli, Lindt, Toblerone, or even a Willy Wonka instead. These are flat out nasty!
