We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.
