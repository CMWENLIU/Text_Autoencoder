In case anyone doesn't know, eating foods with hydrogenated oil is like injecting tar into your arteries. I was so excited when the pods came -- the flavor sounded so good and even smelled good, and I'm sure it tastes delicious, but before taking a sip, for some reason I read the ingredients right after brewing. I think because it came out all creamy which made me wonder what was in it apart from the spices, etc. I had to throw the rest of the unused pods out because I wouldn't want to give them to anyone else. Anyway, my own fault for not thinking to look into the ingredients. Hopefully this helps someone else not make the same mistake. Only reason I'm even giving this 1 star is that zero is not an option.
