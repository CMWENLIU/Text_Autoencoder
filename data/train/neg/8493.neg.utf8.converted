The chips by themselves are edible, but mediocre.  What really hacks me is the fact that all the calorie and nutrition info is based on "serving size".  The little bag contains 1.5 servings.  That is true "word-magic" rip-off.  Such distortion may be legal but it completely skews the information for those of us on low-carb diets.  Shame on Kay's!  I will never buy anything from this company again, and urge you to do the same.
