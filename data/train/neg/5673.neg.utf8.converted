The product came attractively packaged in a vacuum packed flat resealable plastic pouch. The tuna had a strong tuna smell, which immediately brought our cats running over to inspect. At 4.1 ounces, this is more of a meal than a treat. While you could cut off a piece and save the rest for another time, this isn't what I think of when buying kitty treats... Kitty treats to me are crunchy and small, so that I can shake the container to call our cats over and then sprinkle out a couple of treats at a time.<br /><br />With this prodcut, we replaced our usual Fancy Feast dinner and served our 2 cats the entire 4.1 ounce pouch. I found that it looked a little dry, but I will say that the cats gobbled up the food like it was their last meal.<br /><br />Overall, our cats seemed to like it, but I have some issues with the way the product is marketed. If this is to be used as a treat, it needs to be easier to serve in small pieces. If it is to be used as a meal, then the price needs to be lowered ALOT. I would never purchase this product as is.
