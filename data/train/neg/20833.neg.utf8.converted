I LOVE these!  I have been eating them for lunch everyday for most of the last 5 years, and still love the taste.  Best mac and cheese I have ever had!  And you can find them for great prices, but Amazon's current price ($16.80/12 which is $1.40/each) is not so great.  I just bought them at Target for .89 each, and Rainbow and Cub both have them for $1.25 each.  I was looking to see if I could find a good deal on buying bulk for 2 reasons- 1. To save money and 2. To have a case and not have to buy them individually for the amount I go through.<br />I work downtown and any restaurant I could want is within a couple blocks... the reason I make these and don't go out to eat is to save money and keep lunch as cheap as possible (I don't want to spend $50/week on lunch when I can have something I love for only $5/week).  So I guess I will stick with buying it individually in the stores, because I'm not paying that much for something that is cheaper at stores I will already be in anyways.
