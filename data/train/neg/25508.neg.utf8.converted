When I buy a 5 star item from Amazon, it is always a good product. In this case, the product may be just fine quality wise, but for some reason my cats hate these flakes. Of the two cats, when presented with the flakes - one gave me a "are you stupid" look and the other one gave me a "why did you do this to me" look. Both of the cats like all other cat treats and are not picky eaters. Don't know why they don't like these, both of them go nuts for seafood. Given that all the other reviews are very positive, perhaps I got a bad batch of flakes and it is just an aberration, but both cats are very much "Do Not Want!" on these flakes.
