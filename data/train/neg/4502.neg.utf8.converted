First I must say until recently I have never found a diet soda that actually tastes good enough to drink regularly. I was very excited to receive the Zevia All Natural Sodas because I have insulin resistance and I'm not supposed to have alot of sugar. I use the Truvia and Stevia sugar and I thought it would be a good idea to try the soda. I ended up giving the sodas away to a coworker and I'm sure my coworker threw them away. The taste is awful. The "coke" soda is way too sweet. The only flavors that I tried to convince myself that I could drink were grape, orange and cream soda and even those are not really good. If you are looking for a good tasting diet soda a coworker brought me a can of Sprite Zero, and it was actually good. It's not far off from the original Sprite. Oh, and my coworker was drinking Rockstar which I guess is another diet soda and he said Rockstar tastes better than the Zevia soda.
