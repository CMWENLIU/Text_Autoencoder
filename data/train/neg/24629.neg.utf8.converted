I like the idea of a chemical-free cleanser (especially if it smells good). But it didn't. The first day I used it, I got PAINFUL acne! I've never had painful acne before or since!!! It broke me out big time and it smelled like rotting pineapple. Gross. Please save your money and don't think twice about this product.
