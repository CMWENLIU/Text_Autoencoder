I, too, bought a bag of these treats - not even thinking twice about where they were manufactured.  My dog loves them.  When I came to Amazon to order more - much to my horror (but appreciation to reviewers who made me aware) - I found out these treats are Made In China!!!!  Why would Dogswell do that?  They claim some of their other products are manufactured in the US - so why not all of their products?  Obviously China was the lowest bidder.  I hope Dogswell will move their facilities stateside - so until them - I will no longer buy, support this product.  Too bad.  Dogswell - are you listening  - do you care?
