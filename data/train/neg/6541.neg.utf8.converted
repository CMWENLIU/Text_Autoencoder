I have 3 indoor cats and I also feed a stray. None of the 4 cats will touch the food. The food smells like multi-vitamins. It has to taste awful... For such expensive food, I expected better quality. My cats will eat cheap cat food no problem, but I feel like a bad mommy feeding them a junk food diet. Others have mentioned that EVO works for them, I guess I will try that. I have also tried ACANA and ORIJEN with no success. I like what those companies are doing. it is unfortunate my cats won't eat the food.
