I had purchased this basket of goodies to give my bf for our 2nd year anniversary. The basket was beautifully presented, but the food items in it was OLD and Nasty. The crackers were stale and so was everything else. He said that the only thing good about it was the cheese...but what can you eat from that basket with that cheese??
