I really wanted this to work. It looks nice and is a little more narrow than some of the other K-cup drawers. First of all this says it holds 35, but the box it came in says it holds only holds 30. That is not the problem. It looks very nice, I like the material on top, BUT the entire thing slips and slides. The Keurig (B70) slides on top even with a full water reserve. When you pull the drawer the entire drawer, Keurig and all slides as well. That's not the worst part, however, I could get past that and use rubber shelf lining to fix that issue. The worst part that you cannot fix is the fact that even with LESS than 30 K-cups in this drawer it WILL NOT OPEN. The K-cups in the middle column get stuck and jammed due to a metal rod along the top of that column. The K-cups on the ends get stuck on the metal pieces that bend over the top of the columns. This will RUIN your k-cups as they get snagged and pressed by the metal. It took me several minutes to remove K-cups that jammed in the drawer and the drawer would not open. AWFUL. Completely unusable and worthless. I returned this product and instead bought a larger one with rubber mat on top that slides easily (from Bed Bath and Beyond for $20 w/ 20% off coupon. Cheaper, holds more, slides easier, doesn't damage k-cups and won't slide off your counter.
