I love Brachs butterscotch & they are so hard to find so when I found them in my local albertsons I was ecstatic. Well that was short lived because the original Brachs butterscotch that has the yellow wrapper with blue writing no longer exists!! The new version sucks!! The taste is different as well as the texture and I hate them! Ill never understand why companies feel the need to change products that are not broken. I'm very upset bc the original was amazing and anyone who loved them will notice the horrible change in the new version. Bad move Brachs!!
