I wouldn't feed this to a pet.  Though the nutritional info shows '0 Trans Fats' the ingredients list shows "Partially Hydrogenated" oils... that is Trans Fats.  Basically, natural oils that have been modified by attaching two hydrogen molecules where they don't occur in nature.  The end result... the oil is solid a room temperature and creates a crispier product.  The impact to your health is that your system thinks it is oil (fat) and lets it into your blood stream where it is handled like a plastic.  You system doesn't know what to do with it and it is plastered on the walls of your arteries where it stays for a long long time.  Folks... if you care about Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol problems, altheimers disease... maybe more.  Keep these Trans Fats away from yourself and loved ones.  Also this material is hidden in names like "shortening" and "margarine".  Don't buy this... find a wafer that is safe.
