As I was removing mayo from the jar with a tablespoon, I noticed a large hole in th bottom of the jar! I took out the shards of glass: they are no thicker than the glass one would find in a standard house lightbulb!! BEWARE! I have emailed the company and await their reply. Needless to say, I threw out my bowl of potato salad-in-the-making!
