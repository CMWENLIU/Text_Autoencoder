First off, let me repeat what a few other reviewers have remarked:  different people are likely to have somewhat varied reactions to this product.<br /><br />And some background:  In the past I've had both Red Bull and Sugar-free Red Bull.  Red Bull works wonders for me.  If I take it at 10pm, I have great focus and concentration and I can stay up working all night long through to the morning.  But Sugar-free Red Bull has no effect on me whatsoever.  I can take it at 10pm and fall asleep 10 minutes later.<br /><br />'5-Hour Energy' has a very similar effect on me as Sugar-free Red Bull.  Which is, basically, nothing.  That said, '5-hour Energy' appears to be more likely to (1) give me a headache, (2) make me lethargic, (3) and make me want to go to sleep.<br /><br />So, if you are like me and need sugar for Red Bull to work for you, then likely this '5-hour Energy' drink won't do anything for you either.
