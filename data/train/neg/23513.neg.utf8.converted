Do not order from Taylor's!! I placed a Christmas order on December 16th and received notice that my order was confirmed.  However, on December 21st I received another notice from Taylor's stating that the item I had ordered was mysteriously "out of stock".  No phone call or personal apology, just a random email notice.  As a result, my Mother never received a Christmas gift from me and my family.<br /><br />I will never, ever place an order with Taylor's as this vendor is extremely shady and unreliable.
