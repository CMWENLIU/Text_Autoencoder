I love the pumpkin spice lattes from Dunkin and Starbucks.  This product is spicy and no hint of pumpkin at all.  It left a very strange after-taste.  This was quickly poured down the drain.  I've tried DaVinci and also left strange after-taste.  Where is the pumpkin flavor?  I want pumkin as well as spice. Tears
