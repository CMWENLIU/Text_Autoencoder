cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin B12 is in the product.<br />We wonder why cancer among kids is raising...we are not eating food anymore<br />but synthetic toxic crap.<br />Despicable! Bought it ounce will never buy it again!<br /><br />You better off with an organic egg/yellow preferably from a real farmer<br /><br />answer: methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin (that is the best of the best)<br /><br />Do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the FDA if you do not want to be flamed<br />do you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you.
