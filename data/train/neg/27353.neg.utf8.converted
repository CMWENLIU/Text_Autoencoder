I was excited to find Kale chips. I make them at home in my oven.<br />I thought these would be the same. I thought I was paying for a box of several, insted I got 1 container and paid 5 $  for shipping. My fault for not reading. In total I paid 14 $ for this snack.<br /><br />They looked kind of funkey, but what health food dosent? They were covered in this powdered chese like the kind got get in a Kraft Mac N' Chese box. All I could tase was the chese.<br /><br />I am going to stick to making them in my oven.<br />Strip Kale from the stem, place leaves in mixing bowl, add some salt, cayan pepper, and olive oil.<br />Place in oven @ 350, back for 20-25 min<br />Turn a few times and cook until crisp, but not too crisp.
