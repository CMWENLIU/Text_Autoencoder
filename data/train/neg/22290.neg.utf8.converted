These bags do eliminate the mess in the compost kitchen caddy.  But they don't bio-degrade after the kitchen scraps are transferred to the main composter.  You still see the bags, largely intact, months (and, maybe, years) later.  When you try to mix the compost, the bags get stuck on the gardening fork or whatever implement you are using and make it hard to turn the pile.  All in all, a good idea that doesn't actually work.
