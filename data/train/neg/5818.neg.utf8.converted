I just received my order, unfortunately I ordered (6).  I am so disappointed.  I only had 1/2 a bottle left of my old (different) brand and decided to order some more before I ran out.  I can't believe I didn't check the details out on this before ordering as I do take the time, normally, to do my own research on things.  Sort of messed up this time.<br /><br />Here's the thing.  This Wholesome Brand Organic Raw Blue Agave  has 16 grams of sugar in one TBL!  I called the company and learned it is under 35 on the Glycemic Index....still high.  The brand I had before had only 9  grams of sugar per TBL  (the lowest I've found yet) with a rating of 27 in the Glycemic Index and, according the the company's website, it is never heated above 118 degrees.<br /><br />Now, I'm stuck with 6 unopened bottles of this stuff and not sure what to do with it.  My fault.
