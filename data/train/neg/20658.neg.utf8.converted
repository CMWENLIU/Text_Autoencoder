I know for a fact that you can purchase these for a lot less because I recently did so.  Darn near ate the whole 2.5 pounds by myself over a 2 week period. (For shame!) They were that good.  Purchased them at Costco for under $15.  Unless you must, I'd shop around.  They are delicious though.  Unlike another reviewer, I didn't have a single peanut in the bunch!  Great mix.
