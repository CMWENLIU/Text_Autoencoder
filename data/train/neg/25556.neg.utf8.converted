What they do not tell you on this product description that sounds oh so healthy and doable for my daughter on the specific carb diet for a medical condition...is that it's not JUST honey and sesame seeds, but sugar AND corn syrup as well.  Because one sweetener wasn't enough they needed to throw in 2 more for good measure.  This might be tasty, I'll never know bc I'm sending it back, but it's no better than eating any cheapo candy off the grocery store aisle.
