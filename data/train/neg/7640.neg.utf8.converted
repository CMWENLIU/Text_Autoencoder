I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.
