In very small quantities this tea made me feel really hungry, and if I drank more I started feeling really nauseated having other uncomfortable gastrointestinal symptoms.  I finally did some research and found out that some people are sensitive to sceletium tortuosum, and I guess I'm one of them.  I tried it a few times to see if I would desensitize, but it didn't appear to be happening.  I understand some people have benefits from this plant, but would recommend trying a sample first, with caution.
