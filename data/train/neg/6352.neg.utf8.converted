This product contains partially hydrogenated soy bean oil.  Partially hydrogenated vegtable oils are trans fats.  Trans fats are artifical fats that health professionals agree are unhealthy and should be vigorously avoided.  Trans fats are not normally found in the human diet to any appreciable degree. The lable states that 2 grams of trans fat are present in each serving.  I would never eat this.  Unfortunately the container was opened before we figured out it was such an unhealthy product.  Now it is in the trash.<br /><br />For your healths sake, please don't eat this.
