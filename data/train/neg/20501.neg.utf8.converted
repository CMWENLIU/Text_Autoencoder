I bought several bags of these at a warehouse store and was very sorry when we got home with them.  High fructose corn syrup (worse than just corn syrup) and blueberry "flavor" is not what I was looking for in dried blueberries.<br /><br />Not only does it have questionable ingredients these are WAY too sweet - like some have said more like candy than a dried fruit.
