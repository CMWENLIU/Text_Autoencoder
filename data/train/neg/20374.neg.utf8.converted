purchased this in a 3 pack from Nutricity  for $27.00 +  weight is not true, cans were dented and dusty.  Olives meaty, but very small and many broken from pitting.  Vinegar pack not disclosed and even after soaking before smoking, end result was bitter. Could have bought $7 worth of Linsay greens in water at the market and done better.  Dumb me. Product photo and declared weight shown quite deceptive.
