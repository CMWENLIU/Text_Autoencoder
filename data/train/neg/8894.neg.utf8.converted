This is my first 1 star review.....I can't believe I'm writing it.<br /><br />I wanted to like this bar.  But I couldn't. The texture of the bar is repulsive and there's very little real flavor.  The idea of an organic strawberry bar really appealed to me.  Until I took a big ol' bite of this bar...can you say gag reflex?<br /><br />Organic foods can taste good....this one doesn't. Pass on the ProBar Fruition.
