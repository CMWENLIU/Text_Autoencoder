I love flavored K-Cups and was so excited to see a variety package offered on K-cups because I just couldnt decide between pumpkin spice, chocolate donut, cinnamon pecan, butter toffee and vanilla cupcake!!<br />So when the 24 count variety pack was offered I was excited to get a small sampling of everything.<br />It arrived today with only 23 cups, and like 3 or 4 of the same flavors, and not good ones!!<br />4 Blueberry mountains(yuck) 3 irish cream blah!<br />I guess I should have realized this could happen but still wish I had gotten at least 15 different flavors and ones I wanted try and that.<br />Buyer beware.
