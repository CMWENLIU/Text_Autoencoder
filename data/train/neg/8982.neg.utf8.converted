The bag says "Pecan Halves" but very few halves are intact - most are broken (so if you want to decorate the top of a pecan pie - good luck!).  It should be called "Pecan Pieces."  There is a fairly high percentage of shriveled nuts (that are chewey) and too-dark nuts (that are bitter).  Speaking of bitter, I've encountered a few little bits of shell.  And, overall, they are not very fresh.
