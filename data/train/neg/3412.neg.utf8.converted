I love cashews, so I was intrigued by this product. However I found it very disappointing: there is way too much salt on the nuts, which covers the flavor instead of highlighting the natural sweetness of the cashews.<br /><br />Also, they could have chosen a more environment friendly packaging, like recyclable see-through plastic, which is also less likely to leach into the foods contained within.
