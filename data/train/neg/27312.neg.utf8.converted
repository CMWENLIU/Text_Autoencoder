This is a nice salt block, but beware that the dimensions are not listed.  IT IS SMALL!!!  I thought it would be like the nice large blocks you see in Williams Sonoma that are a few feet wide.  This one is a little bigger than the actual photo (it's small!!!).  Kind of feel ripped off since I was expecting a thinnger flatter blick like the one in the photo, not a small super super super thick block like I got.
