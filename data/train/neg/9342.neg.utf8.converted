So.. Our family got a gift card for Christmas for this company. We paid a small amount for shipping over the<br />gift card, but what a headache it has been!<br /><br />The Steaks were nothing to write home about, nor were the hamburgers or baked potatoes.<br /><br />We have have just as good or better from the grocery store butcher.<br /><br />The killer is, once you order something they call your home like every freaking day. Even on Saturdays.<br />We just got a call like 2 mins. ago and nobody was on the line and the caller ID says 'Omaha Steaks'. What<br />is up with that?<br /><br />Save yourself the hassle and go to a real butcher ( but don't give him your phone number either ).
