I received a 6 pack of these apples from amazon.com because I absolutely LOVE this brand because of the taste and lack of sulfuric additives.  However, the quality of apples I received is substandard compared to what I've experienced by buying them in the normal grocery store.<br /><br />These apples "look" as if they have a coating of dust/grey around them.  At first I thought they were coated in a light sugary substance.  I had to double check the front to make sure it said unsulfured.  Then there was the taste--they didn't even TASTE good!<br /><br />Don't waste your time buying these from AMZ.  It seems to me that they're selling the bad batches that go through Quality Control and are deemed insufficient for normal store shelves.  BLYEACHK!!!!<br /><br />I've opened three of the 6 packs and they're all the same.  I double checked the expiration date and they all show Oct. 23, 2009.  I also am wondering if they use different apples depending on the season because these taste NOTHING like the ones I bought back in early November (the reviewed ones I'm discussing were purchased in Jan. 2009).
