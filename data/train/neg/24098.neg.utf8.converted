...and that's the most positive thing I have to say for this product.  There aren't a lot of choices for decaf for the Tassimo at the moment, but this is not the choice I'd make again.  I brewed a cup, immediately added some sugar and real half & half, stirred, put the cup to my lips and I tasted... bad noodles from Panda Express in liquid form.  Now, normally I would make decaf Cafe Verona or decaf House Blend from Starbucks either in a regular coffee maker or a french press, but I'm not terribly picky; I will drink a cup of decaf from Denny's or Friendly's or wherever, and enjoy it.  This was not remotely enjoyable.<br /><br />I was originally going to give it 2 stars since it nearly tastes like coffee, but after writing this review I've realized there is not a redeeming quality to it.  I will only serve this to someone I don't like when I want them to leave my house.
