Not only this thing is way overprice, it is no diet food. Each piece of wrap has 25 grams of carbohydrate! And I bought it to replaced my regular flour tortilla wrap. When checked, my regular flour wrap only has 8 grams of carb each. Also total fat in the flour wrap is 2 grams compare to this at 2.5 grams. The only good thing I can say is that it taste better than expected, but with all the fat and carb this is no diet!
