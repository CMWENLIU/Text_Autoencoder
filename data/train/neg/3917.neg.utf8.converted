Just recieved my order. The kibble is now flat dots, not X's. The formula/ingredients is very different. Now Chicken, chicken meal, cracked barley, chicken fat, turkey meal, white rice, potatoies, oatmeal, millet, natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulgate egg product..................<br /><br />I called the phone number on the bag and only got a recording to "leave a message". This is bait and switch.<br /><br />My cats looked at it and walked away.
