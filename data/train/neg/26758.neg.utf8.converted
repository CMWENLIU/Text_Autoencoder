I bought the David Sunflower seed. I thought I was getting already shelled seed, but<br />they are in the shell. They are so small that when shelled there is very little meat.<br />I would never buy them again. I guess I will need to chew the shell and all. This is<br />the only product I have bought from Amazon that has not been satisfactory. The peanuts<br />I ordered are great.
