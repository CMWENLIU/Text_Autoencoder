I love M&M's and I love pretzels, but this combo is nothing special. The chocolate doesn't taste like a regular M&M, it tastes like cheaper chocolate. The whole thing together reminds me of the taste of malt balls.........it doesn't remind me of a chocolate covered pretzel. I was expecting better. Peanut M&M's are way better.
