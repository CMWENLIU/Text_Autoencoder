On Feb. 9, 2011 I went to my Subscribe and Save page and requested an extra shipment of my regular order;  when I checked on them today (the 10th), I saw I was charged an extra $5.75 per unit (3 cans).  Since I ordered 4 sets, my bill went from $39.03 (Jan. 15 order) to $58.58 (Feb. 9 extra order), an increase of $19.95 for the exact same amount of product.  What's going on??
