I decided to purchase this product based on a blog by one of the<br />supplement oriented doctors on the internet, hyping erythritol as<br />superior to xylitol, which I use regularly and find the closest<br />to sugar in taste with almost no aftertaste and no side effects<br />to my knowledge.  The problem I find with erythritol is its lack<br />of flavor.  On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, even<br />when I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal size<br />bowl.  When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, it<br />has the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion.  Don't get<br />me wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very little<br />sweetness relative to how much you use.  Not worth the price unless<br />you want just a hint of sweetness compared to what you get with<br />sugar or xylitol.
