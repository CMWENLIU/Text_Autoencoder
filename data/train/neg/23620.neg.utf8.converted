I was raised in a house that always had at least one cat being fed Meow Mix. Owning my own cat now, I've done some research on available food choices. Meow Mix is one of the cheapest--and one of the worst.<br /><br />Not quite like humans, cats will eat until they are nutritionally satisfied *or* full. The problem with cheap brand cat foods is that they use synthetic products, carbohydrate-based fillers, and processed meat by-products. Cats are obligate carnivores. The first two ingredients on Meow Mix's list (the ones used in most abundance in the product) are corn. As a result, cats are getting fewer needed nutrients per serving, causing them to eat until they get full and to eat more over the course of the day.<br /><br />Healthy food results in a healthier cat. Weight control, shedding, disease development, and more are all influenced by a cat's food. The excessive use of carbohydrate-based fillers in cheap cat foods, as part of this reality, can lead to weight gain and a higher risk of diabetes. Many cat owners use Meow Mix without experiencing some of these problems--but very few will use it without noticing *any* of them.<br /><br />Brands sold in quality pet stores start with Iambs as the "baseline," and even Iambs isn't what I'd call good for your cat. Many of my local shelters feed their cats Iambs as the least expensive acceptable cat food. Even better, companies such as Orijen and EVO make premium cat foods made with very little or no grain content, which are ingredients cats would not naturally eat. Whatever you decide, check the ingredients list. Make sure some kind of meat is listed as the primary ingredient with other meats as close to the top of the list as possible. Also make sure those are actual meats. Meats are better then meat meals, and meat meals are ok (and usually unavoidable).  Meat by-products are what you want to watch out for.<br /><br />The reality is that your cat is not biologically designed to eat a diet consisting mostly of corn or grain. Healthy cat food is more expensive, but your cat will eat less of it, helping to mitigate the cost a bit. I recommend premium cat foods for this reason. They're better for your cat in every conceivable way, and they won't break your bank. Even if you are on a budget, consider the cost medical concerns due to obesity or diabetes could incur. If you are currently using this food, maybe it's time to switch.
