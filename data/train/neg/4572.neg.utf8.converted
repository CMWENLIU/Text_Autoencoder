Warning to dog owners! This product has caused many dogs, including mine, diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My history with this product:<br /><br />My dog was very ill for 3 days: violent diarrhea and vomiting. Called vet after first day, they instructed me to keep him on a bland diet, and to bring him in if this persisted more than 3 days. Luckily, he got better and I didn't have to take him in. I thought, maybe it's just my dog and he has a sensitive stomach?<br /><br />I went to the web to research the product and found others had experienced the same thing. So I wondered...why is this product still on the market? I contacted Purina, and after no luck with them (who claimed they never heard of any complaints), I contacted the FDA, which currently has this product under surveillance.<br /><br />By the way, my dog is not a toy breed, he's a 20 lb. mutt. So say what you want to say about the latest 'not meant for toy breed' disclaimer on the package, he doesn't fall into that category.<br /><br />Sure, some dogs can tolerate this treat, but why take a chance on your pet's health and life?
