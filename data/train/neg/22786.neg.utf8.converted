DO NOT ORDER THESE!! Im EXTREMELY disappointed!! I was told I would get an assortment that included several varieties in the product description, and was only given HALF of what I was told I would get! They left out a LOT of the flavors I really wanted to try. I cant return this per the policy on this product which is stupid since its the fault of the packager (it was shipped to me in a brown bag...someone obviously puts them together, so its not prepackaged), and I cant apparently contact the seller either to tell them to make it right. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN!!!
