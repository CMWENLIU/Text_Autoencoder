I ordered $40 worth of product.  When it arrived the chocolate was hot and completely melted.  It tasted bitter.  I immediately sent an e-mail to the seller.  They wrote me back requesting photographs.  I took photographs and sent them to the seller.  I have never received any response.  The final result is $40 spent and nothing to show for it as the chocolate was inedible being bitter and melted into the wrapped with a non-responsive seller.
