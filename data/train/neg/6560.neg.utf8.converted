What follows is a statement of personal opinion, an opinion formed based on published reports from the FDA and other credible sources, and widely available on the Internet.  I am a (recent) former user of Evanger's pet food products, and have no affiliation with them, or with anyone else in the pet food industry.  I deeply regret having ever fed any animal Evanger's products, especially animals I love and care for.  Of course, you must do your own research and draw your own conclusions about these matters.  Evanger's has made an explanation of their side of things in some of these matters, although I personally found their "reasons"  entirely unconvincing.<br /><br />I would strongly urge you to research this company for yourself.  In particular, read about the FDA's revocation of their permit for failing to process the food properly, and read about the arrest of the owners on charges that they committed millions of dollars worth of utilities fraud by operating their plant for years with the gas and electric meters bypassed.  If, as alleged, they were operating with stolen utility service, what shortcuts would they be willing to take with your pet's health and safety to reduce manufacturing costs?  And in the vein of cutting costs, read about the successful lawsuit by employees for just under half of a million dollars in unpaid overtime wages.<br /><br />I can't post web links here, but my sources include a Chicago Tribune Article dated March 25, 2010, titled "Lincolnwood couple charged in utility theft scheme" and two articles on the FDA web site entitled "FDA Orders Pet Food Maker to Obtain Emergency Operating Permit" and "FDA Suspends Temporary Emergency Permit of Pet Food Maker".  I would also mention the lawsuit against Evanger's by their employees, which Evanger's appears to have lost.  (Source: web site "Truth About Pet Food") The Northern District of Illinois Distric Court, Case: 1:09-cv-00227, filed 9/15/2010, Final Approval Order Francisco Barragan and Liberto DeLaRosa, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated persons (Plantiffs) versus Evanger's Dog and Cat Food Co., Inc., Holly N. Sher and Joel Sher (Defendants).  Don't take my word on this, find out for yourself.<br /><br />The picture these events and reports formed in my mind was one of owners who were willing to do anything to make a buck, without regard to the legalities, consequences to their employees, or to their customers.  Maybe you will come to a different conclusion.  Maybe I  am over reacting.  But I want everyone considering their product to learn the facts, read the articles, and make an informed decision.<br /><br />I hope you find this to be useful.  If anyone can point to any error of fact in my review, please let me know, and I will happily correct it, it is my intention to be fair and accurate.
