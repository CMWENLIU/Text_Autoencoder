I am a long-time fan of butter toffee peanuts.  Nowadays, the only place I can find them is at WinnCo in their food bin section.  I LOVE the flavor of their peanuts but am skeptical to buy food in bins.  As an avid Amazon shopper, I discovered these peanuts and thought I'd give them a try.  The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition.  However, the flavor was blah.  The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all.  For the price, I expected them to taste at least as good as WinnCo but no such luck.  Won't be buying these again.
