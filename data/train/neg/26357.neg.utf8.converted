I love beef jerky and I've tried almost every brand on the market. I just went to my local grocery that specializes in Organic and All Natural foods and picked up a package of Golden Valley Natural Beef Jerky black pepper. It is without a doubt the nastiest food I've ever put in my mouth....Save your $ buy something else! I'm taking it back to the store and demanding my money back.
