I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.<br /><br />I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.<br /><br />Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase.
