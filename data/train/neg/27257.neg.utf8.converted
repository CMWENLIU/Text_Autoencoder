I have enjoyed other Hodgson products but this was awful.  Heavy, dry, tasteless and unedible.  Also, plastic packaging on mine wasn't sealed on some. I may report that to Amazon.  I thought that was why they were so bad (stale possibly?) but after seeing other reviews...they are just bad.  They need to change the recipe...healthful doesn't have to taste like this.
