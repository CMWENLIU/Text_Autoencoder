I ordered this coconut milk (24 cans!) before and loved it ... lots of creamy coconut fat that was as delicious in my morning cup of coffee as it was in curry dishes.  I didn't hesitate to order again, but will have to try another brand next time.  Multiple cans were dented on arrival, and every single can we've opened has contained a thin watery liquid (with less "substance" than skim milk!) with a small, hard, waxy piece of solid mass that can't even be broken up with a spoon. This was a very disappointing purchase.
