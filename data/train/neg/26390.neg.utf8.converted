I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! SIX English Breakfast Teas, 5 Nicaraguan Fair Trade, 4 French Roasts & 3 Island Coconuts and various multiples and singles but NO Jet Fuel, NO Lake & Lodge, NO Nanatucket Blend, NO Southern Pecan, NO Breakfast in Bed, NO  Hawaiian Hazelnut, NO Rodeo Drive, NO Sorrento Vienna Coffee House; NO India Spice Chai Tea; NO African Rooibos Tea!!!!!  I got this in order to try these varieties!!! There is a variety of unknowns - but really dislike the multiple multiples! Was planning to order other samplers -- but now -- FORGET IT!!!  By the way - Thirty one dollars for 35 pods -- mostly tea -- is NOT all that great a price!!!
