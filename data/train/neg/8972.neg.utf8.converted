My baby really did enjoy these .... However, I was horrified when I read the box and found they are made in China!  The standards aren't the same in China and the risk for me aren't worth it.  If you have a Japanese store close by .... they have the exact same type of rice crackers with much higher standards and BABY LOVES THOSE AS WELL!
