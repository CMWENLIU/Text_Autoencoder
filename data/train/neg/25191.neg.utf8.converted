I fell in love with these cookies when I discovered them a few months ago, and wrote a positive review. I had them special ordered when I couldn't find them in the store anymore. Unfortunately, the order delivered to me was a completely different cookie. Late July changed the recipe, and they tasted awful. I emailed the company and they replied: "We did have to make some changes to our sandwich cookies, as we had to switch to new equipment which is a slightly different production process.  We are using the same ingredients but it is not exactly the same.  EXCEPT, to further complicate things we had an issue where, towards the end of the most recent production run, we moved to a new supply of our organic vanilla extract and have now come to learn that the concentration level was higher than we normally use.  We truly apologize for that which causes that sensation at the back of the mouth, liking a spicy or burning. The cookies are a little different in texture and taste, but pretty close without that extra vanilla extract. We did take the opportunity to make some improvements to the base cookie, with a better texture and increased the whole grains and reduced the saturated fat in the cookie. I'm sorry you are disappointed; but it was an equipment change we had to make.  Although we realize you may not like the new version, in addition to your refund I would like to send you a coupon to get a free box so that you may try them as they are intended to taste." So, I am awaiting my refund, and plan to try the cookie again later to see if it tastes better without the vanilla problem.
