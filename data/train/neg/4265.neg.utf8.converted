I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others.
