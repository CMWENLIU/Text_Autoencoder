I tried one and the taste was okay. The drink gave the jitters and at the end of the day had a pretty bad crash. The product also gave me dry mouth all day long, no matter how much water I drank afterward. I have tried allot of energy drinks and and have drank as many as 3 Amps in one day and have never experienced anything like I did after trying this product. I do not recommend.
