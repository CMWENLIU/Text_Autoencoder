I am all for nut and grain milks and have been drinking them for 12 years.  I am now looking for a good almond milk but unfortunately this one is not going to be it.  I think that this company's large cartons (half gallon) of organic almond milk have more almonds than sugar, but unfortunately these small cartons seem to not be made of organic almonds, and, more importantly to me, seem to hardly be almond milk at all, but rather water and sugar with some almond flavoring (according to the ingredients list).  Also, they add "other natural flavorings" which I try to avoid because usually that's food-industry-speak for msg and stuff like that, which gives me headaches.  I understand that the company wants to make this drink more palatable to children and to reluctant health-nuts, but I think it's the wrong way to go to put more sugar than almonds in it, and the wrong way to go to add all kinds of "flavoring" when almonds are so beautifully flavored on their own.  I wanted this to be a product I could order from Amazon, but I'll need to keep looking.
