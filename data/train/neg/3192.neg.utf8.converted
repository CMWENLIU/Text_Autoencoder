Drinking anything that causes headaches should be avoided and prevented.  This drink gave me a whopper and I had to leave work early.  This was given away for free at our company last week, and many were concerned because of potential side effects of sucralose.  I gave it a try, but needed a headache pill and only felt normal - ironically - 5-hours later.
