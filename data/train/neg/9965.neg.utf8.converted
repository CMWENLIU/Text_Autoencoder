Like I read on another reviewer's summary - some of the artichoke hearts were tough and I had to discard parts of the hearts. Not the best quality I have had. What they should have done was trim them a little more so that the hard tough parts were not there - I guess they wanted to cheap it out a little and include parts that would have been thrown out if you were making them from fresh Artichokes. I liked that they were not in oil but I did have to wash some of them because they did have a salty flavor.
