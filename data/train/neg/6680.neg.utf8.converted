Despite the label "wheat free, gluten free" on the packaging, this product is neither.  It caused serious illness when prepared and eaten, and it tested unequivocally positive for gluten when tested on an ELISA gluten test kit.  If you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, don't buy it.  Really too bad since buckwheat is a naturally gluten free product, but this company contaminated it during it processing.  The company has been informed of the problem, but has taken no action.
