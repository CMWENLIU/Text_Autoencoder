I got two bags of this sea salt after I had a small sample shaker that I really loved. It has excellent flavor, is genuine sea salt, and you use less sea salt than regular salt when seasoning food because it is a stronger flavor. All good things.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after many, many tries to ensure it wasn't my imagination...both bags contained sand as well. Something must have been wrong with their filtering system to eliminate sand from the salt during manufacturing. But, because it happened in both bags I had bought I felt it must not be too uncommon.<br /><br />Imagine when I cooked an egg dish to share with the office at breakfast...you know how it is when you eat something at the beach and, no matter how careful you are, some sand gets in so you bite down on grit? That was take one.  Then I made soup...with sand...take two....After two more tries I knew it wasn't a fluke of the kitchen or the dish or some odd salt. After all, salt dissolves in cooking. I tried both bags and gave up.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's awful. The taste was good and I might try it again in the future...but this is a fairly exceptional flaw so I gotta pan the cooking results it produced for now.
