Okay, basically this is not a good product based on simple logic and I really didn't want to give it any stars but Amazon makes you put at least one.<br /><br />Cats and dogs mark their territories with their scents, such as spraying/peeing on certain areas/objects and rubbing their bodies up against areas/objects.<br /><br />This stake is treated heavily with pheromones, which is a fancy word for smell.  Since each animal has their own smell, then this product is more likely to keep your pet from going anywhere near it.<br /><br />For this to actually work, the pheromones would have to be equivalent to that of your pet(s) and in high enough concentration for them to be drawn to it.  Like when a dog continuously pees in the same spot/area when you take them out on a walk (given that it is the same path).  Also, the same reason puppy pads (newspaper) and cat litter boxes work for training.  Plus, why you have to put a heavy duty odor eliminator on top of a spot that you have just cleaned when your pet makes a "mistake".  If you don't, then they will continue to go to that spot.<br /><br />Suggestion: If you really want your dog to go in just one place your best bet would be to collect your own dogs pee (don't forget to buy rubber gloves, a RubberMaid container w/ a lid, and possibly a face mask for the smell). Then soak some wooden stakes in it for a few days - the longer, the more the stakes will absorb, but watch that the stakes don't start to become too moist - w/ the lid on tight. After a few days, stake them in the spot you want your dog to use.  They will be attracted to the high concentration of their own scent and you shouldn't have to do it any more b/c they will go in that spot from then on.
