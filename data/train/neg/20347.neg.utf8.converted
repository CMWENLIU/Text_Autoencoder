Don't think the previous reviewer is wrong, jaded, or somehow a veggie jerky competitor.  These things really are rubbish.  What's worse?  This good deal through Amazon means you'll have plenty of these meat flavored sponges to impress your friends with how bad it can get.  I will say that my friends and I found that if you leave them out to dry for about 48 hours, they do get a little better in the texture department.  But to quote one friend, "well, that made them easier to spit out."
