I thought I had read the info carefully enough prior to purchase, but I hadn't.  I am HIGHLY allergic to ASPERTAME and while this is NOT listed as a "diet" soda, obviously it is or someone somewhere does not understand that aspertame contains quite a number of neurotoxins that are not healthy for the human body to ingest.  I believe that any product which uses aspertame as an ingredient should be required by law to indicate this is LARGE PRINT on the front of the container.  Sugar is a great deal safer.
