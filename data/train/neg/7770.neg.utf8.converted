My experience with this vendor was absolutely horrendous.  They offered 2 dozen roses for a decent price with a Valentines Day delivery guaranteed.  After placing the order, and moving on to other Valentines purchases, I felt confident that I had all of the pieces in place to make it a special day for my wife of 10 years and my daughters.<br /><br />Shortly before Valentines Day, they canceled my order without providing any explanation other than "it was a price mistake."  As such, I was left scrambling to find roses that were not going to cost an arm and a leg to deliver on the holiday.  I was not able to locate anything, and spent a lot more than I had anticipated.<br /><br />This company provides horrific customer service and I would discourage anyone from considering making a purchase from them!!!!  They truly go against everything that CUSTOMER SERVICE is supposed to be.<br /><br />Stay clear of these scammers!
