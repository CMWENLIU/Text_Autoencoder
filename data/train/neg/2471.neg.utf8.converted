Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting "it" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on "coconut water laxative" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you "run", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p
