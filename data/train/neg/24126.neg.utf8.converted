I used to buy Ghirardelli white chips specifically because they were the only ones that I could find that contained cocoa butter.  A few years back they changed the formulation to not include white chocolate/cocoa butter, and removed the word "chocolate" from the product name (Amazon needs to update their title too).  Recently I was able to find "real" white chocolate chunks (not chips) at Whole Foods and I buy them for my cookies instead now.  Ghirardelli, if you are listening, the only reason I bought your brand instead of your competitors is because you used to use cocoa butter in your white chips.  The White chocolate chips are what introduced me to your brand and now I buy your baking bars, your milk and semi sweet chocolate chips, your candy, your hot cocoa and more - easily spending $200+ annually on Ghirardelli products.  If these chips were on the market without cocoa butter 8 years ago, I wouldn't be buying anything from your brand today.  Please reverse the bad corporate decision that was made and restore cocoa butter to this product.  Having no cocoa butter in your white chips changes your image from a premium brand to just a regular brand.
