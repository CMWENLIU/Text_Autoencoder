As far as I know Ovaltine is a great product with all kinds of nutrients, but the price offered on Amazon is absurd.  Locally, I don't spend more than four dollars per 12 oz. container and Amazon wants you to pay more than double that in a pack of four!!! Even the 3-pack 18 oz container is way overpriced.  What's the deal?
