I agree with a lot of the other reviewers -- the bars were not as "fresh" as when purchased in a store, specifically, Trader Joe's.  The chocolate had a "chalky" coating.  I feel like they may have been stored improperly.  The chocolate on the bars purchased at Trader Joe's was creamy and just looked "fresher."  I'd rather pay more for the ones at Trader Joe's as they appear to be fresher.  Having said that, however, the bars themselves are actually very good and I will purchase them again, just not through Amazon.
