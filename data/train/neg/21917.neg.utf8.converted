Smothered in oil is the only way to describe these Cashews.  It looks nothing like the picture online, there is messy, oily goo on the inside of the container from all that oil.  Haven't you ever heard about DRY roasting?  I prefer to have no salt, but what's the use when you drown the &$#@!ig things in Oil!? Cashews contain enough natural oils. Stop soaking them in additional oil!  I ordered these only because my regular brand was sold out on Amazon.  What a disappointment!  I will continue to order Cashews from Amazon, but not this brand.
