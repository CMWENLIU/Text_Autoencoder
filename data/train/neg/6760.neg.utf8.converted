Can I give it no stars?<br /><br />The bag arrived and I was all excited. Coffee does that to me. I'm a coffee snob. There I said it. It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it, a slight hint of vanilla through the packaging. The best coffee I have had always manages to smell like the addictive bean no matter how it's packaged. That is nothing to hold against Starbucks vanilla though. Great and even good coffee sometimes only release their fragrance after opening. When opened, the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla. So strongly in fact that my head popped back, it smelled like cheap vanilla perfume that I got as a child at the five and dime.<br /><br />I got down to business, packing my coffee maker, frothing the milk and setting out the mugs. Once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing. My first sip was confusion. It tasted like coffee made with old milk. I looked at the container of milk which was fresh. I dumped out all the coffee and cleaned the pot again. Second pot same thing.<br /><br />So I left it all for another day. I bought new milk, made my first cup from my favorite brand and it tasted wonderfully. The second pot I made from the starbucks bag. The same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk. It was tangy, off and repelling. I asked my friend to try it. No prompting from me and he asked "Something wrong with the milk? You want me to go downstair and get some?"<br /><br />3 tries from me and one with a friend, each cup was horrid. My regular coffee tasted great. The $1.99 a pound brand that my friend bought to "test" the pot and milk was a good solid cup of coffee.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy something else. This is horrible.
