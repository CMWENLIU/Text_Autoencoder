I recently bought the Nespresso Totem for my Nespresso capsules.  I did not buy it through Amazon, but was compelled to leave a review.  Out of the box the product looks decent enough, however, upon taking a closer look, I noticed that the clear piece (I believe it's acrylic)  gets scratched easily.  The piece is basically a clear tube that sits on the black plastic bottom.  It is not held into place and sits loosely on the base.  Additionally fingerprints, water spots, and dust are very visible on the "tube.". Finally, when capsules are added into the holder, you have to be really careful because the weight of the ones higher up in the tube can easily push the the ones in the base right out of the holder and onto the table. Oh, and one other thing, the base doesn't turn.  The carousel for Nespresso is much cheaper, looks nicer, is more sturdy, and is on spinning base.
