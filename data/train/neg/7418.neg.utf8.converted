Well this review is as much to inform.  Henry's Blend is indeed gone, replaced by "Level Four" that states on the package "Henry's Blend."  It is NOT Henry's Blend.  It is similar in that it does not have a bitter flavor and there is no aftertaste and is smooth, but it has lost all of the nutty character that made this medium dark roast coffee my staple. I have no idea how I will replace the classic Henry's Blend, everything I try is a reminder of how great the old stuff was.  Fortunately I have 12 bags from an "auction site."  After that, I just don't know.  This is a classic "circling the drain" move.  Seattle's Best will either go back and consolidate product lines the right way, or they will be gone by this time next year. They have lost my business until they bring back "Classic" Henry's Blend.  If anyone has found a good alternative, I would love to hear from you!  Good luck fellow "Classic Henry's Blend" lovers!
