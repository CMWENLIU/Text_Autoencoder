I bought this as christmas gift for my husband he absolutely loves these things but it had arrived today and i thought it would be big but no way it was wayyyyy too small! Wal-mart sells bigger ones for cheaper! I am so disappointed it wasnt worth the money it was a total waste! The sausages are 3in maybe even smaller than that but no bigger same with the ham! Next time i am defiantly getting one from someone else i wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless you like them small and want just a little but. But wasnt worth the money at all.
