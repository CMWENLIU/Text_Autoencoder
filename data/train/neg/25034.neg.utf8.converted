Every 5lb bag of whole beans I've bought off of amazon has been tasty and worthy of 5 stars (even outside of subjective preference, they are GOOD coffees, if maybe roasted too dark or too light for my tastes, etc). This product defied that standard. The beans were dry and dusty. Many of them were broken into smaller pieces already, and the coffee brewed is distinctively "bad." I suspect that my 5lb bag may have been old stock, but it was a huge dissapointment. I soldiered through the last cup today and felt compelled to prevent others from making the same mistake I did. Go with something else.
