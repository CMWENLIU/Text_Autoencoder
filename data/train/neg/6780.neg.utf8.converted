I read the great reviews this product got and was encouraged to try it, but when I did I could barely finish a bite.  It has a horrible bitter taste that lingered.  I would like to return for a refund but the site says it is not returnable.  Not happy at all as I am now stuck with 11 unopened cans of the stuff.  Maybe I'll give it to a food bank and somebody else might like it.
