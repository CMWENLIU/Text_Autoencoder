We've bought Jennies macaroons for years now, so when we saw they had almond flavored macaroons, we didn't bat an eye. Bought 'em right away. When my daughter and I tasted them, we had to spit it all out. Maybe they were expired? There was no way to tell, but they were sickening. Due to them not being returnable, we had to throw out all 6 cans. The whole experience was hard to swallow.
