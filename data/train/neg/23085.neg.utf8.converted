We usually cook our own dry beans, but sometimes you need something quick.  So, I always keep a few cans of beans on hand. We usually buy Westbrae Natural Vegetarian Organic Brand Beans at our local Co-Op, but I bought a can of this to try since it was on sale.<br /><br />The first impression was not great, but then odd bitter aftertaste and an earthy "dirt" sort of taste made us pause.  And then the texture - it was all wrong- there was something other than beans in our can, like roots or something... it was gross enough that I could only eat a few bites of mine.  My husband stopped at bite one. What a waste of money!<br /><br />I wanted to give this one star - but my husband said to give the company the benefit of the doubt - maybe not all cans are as bad as the one we bought. Either way, I'm not buying their beans again!
