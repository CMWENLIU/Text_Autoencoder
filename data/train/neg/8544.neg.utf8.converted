I am still a fan of old school cold breakfast cereal, the kind that just needs milk.  Even as an adult I still love it.  I have my favorites, mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market.  I would say that Kellogg's Raisin Bran would be considered a favorite from childhood.  Therefore when I saw this new spin on "Raisin Bran" I was quite interested.<br /><br />This "Raisin Bran" has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon.  Well I cannot express my disappointment with this cereal. First and foremost the cinnamon, I am not sure I would use the term "dusted with cinnamon" rather "dumped with cinnamon".  This is all I tasted was cinnamon and it was very, very sugary.  Secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent, which is sad considering it is promoted on the box.  Thirdly this is "raisin" bran right?  Where are the raisins?  Did the two scoops that Kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops?  The taste itself isn't bad per se, if you love cinnamon.  I would rather just have a bowl of normal "Raisin Bran".<br /><br />Kellogg's did a find job with their "Raisin Bran Crunch" so I am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal.  And not for nothing, but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small.  This seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging, higher prices.  But in the case of this cereal there is some major deception.  The cereal is supposed to have almonds, raisins and cinnamon.  Well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon.  So it appears that Kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product.  Simply by charging more, making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes.  I would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months.
