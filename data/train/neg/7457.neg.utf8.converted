I was really excited to order these crackers because my toddler liked them when a friend of mine gave her one, but I didn't realize that they were made in China. They dissolve really easily and are individually packaged, but come on now, do you really want to feed your child snacks that are made in China? It's up to you, but I know that I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew where it was made.
