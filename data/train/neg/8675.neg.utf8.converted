We had read good reviews for the Earth's Best baby food line (including a recommendation in the Baby Bargains book).  So, when we began feeding our 6 month old baby boy solids, we were prepared to feed this exclusively except when we could cook for him.  He had been getting the whole grain rice cereal and the jarred fruits and vegetables.  Two weeks ago, I was making him cereal from a new box (the second time he had been fed from that box) and I found a live beetle larva in the bowl.  I looked through the rest of the box and found an outer skin of another.  Today, I was talking with a co-worker and she said that they had the same experience with the Earth's Best Whole Grain Rice cereal and now the beetles have infested their home! We suspect that theses are khapra beetles and have alerted the USDS and the FDA.  The manufacturer offered to send coupons and said that this is rare, but now I am doubtful that this was just a fluke since my co-worker had the same experience and these were purchased in different states.  I am disappointed that it is difficult to find good organic baby food.
