This was a staple for me - loved it - but the prior reviewer is right - it is sour now and not spicy - just bad!  I should have googled this a while back, thinking maybe I just wasn't remembering correctly, but felt much better after I read that I'm not the only one who has noticed the change.  I won't buy it again.
