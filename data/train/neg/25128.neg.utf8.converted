I just bought a can of this product from my local grocery store as I am very into chocolate, and love to try new cocoa powders.<br /><br />I have to say that I was very disappointed.  It doesn't have much of a chocolatey flavor.  After reading reviews on here, I am not surprised Hershey's bought and now owns the Dagoba corporation.  Hershey's cocoa powder is lifeless...some people would of course disagree, but they are also the people who haven't tried too many of the "higher-end" powders, like Perginotti, Droste, Valhrona, or Green and Black's Organic Cocoa powder (my favorite).<br /><br />Anyway, save your money for a better product.  I think I will donate my can to a less discerning and grateful friend.
