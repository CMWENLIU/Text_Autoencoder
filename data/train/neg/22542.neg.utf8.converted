This candy interested me - something different for trick or treat - because it was mentioned in an article in "People" magazine (I have written to the Editor of People).  We live on Harbour Island (Tampa), a neighborhood with many children, so it is fun to put forth an extra, creative effort each year. So I looked on-line and found these Fish Kabobs were available from a company through Amazon.  Amazon's products have always been well-packaged; sent on time; and to my satifaction.  What a surprise when I received these and found they are made in China!<br />Apparently, to send them back, it must be done through that seller - who has some odd practices.  The return postage had to be my responsibility (more than $10 sent the cheapest way); there is a 15% re-shelving fee!; and the man at TheOnlineCandyShop was nebulous as to the return address.  He thought it was on the package, but the one on the package was not right.  He gave me a different one, and I can only hope that is correct.<br />If I do receive a credit to my card, it will be very small at this point.  I was tempted to just throw the candies away.
