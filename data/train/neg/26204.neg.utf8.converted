As far as taste goes, these are great... but of course they are, they are loaded with sugar!!!!! Organic dried cane syrup sounds like it's okay, but it's just a fancy way of wording the fact that these are made with SUGAR. There are other brands out there (would name them, but do not want the credibility of my review to plummet in case someone thinks I'm "working" for one of these other brands) that sweeten their puffs with fruit juice, a MUCH healthier option over these Plum brand puffs made with sugar. I am disappointed that I bought FOUR of these... save YOUR money and look elsewhere for a healthier option for your child :)
