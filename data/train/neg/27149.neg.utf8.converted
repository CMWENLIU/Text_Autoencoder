I got this as a Christmas gift and wow, what a disappointment!  If you enjoy a strong, full-bodied coffee, for heaven's sake, get yourself to Starbucks and buy one of their expressos instead of this. The script on the bag was full of hype, none of which added up to high-quality coffee. I'm donating most of the bag to my church, where they will eat anything.
