First of all, I didn't buy this product from Amazon. We ran out of our favorite "Colombia Bellavista" and ended up buying Starbucks' Espresso Roast at our local store.<br /><br />After we opened the package, we smelled the beans and thought that they were burnt, but it didn't stop us from brewing 2 cups. Well, it was indeed burned and tasted very bitter. Actually, it was disgusting, and I don't remember the last time when I was so disappointed in a product. We couldn't believe that Starbucks would sell such a horrible coffee, so we double checked the expiration date to make sure we didn't get some old batch. Oh well, according to the label it was good till March 2010, but in reality it should have never passed a quality control (if there is any).<br /><br />If it makes any difference, we have Jura-Capresso Z5 machine, and I don't know how this coffee tastes if you pass it through a regular coffee maker. Anyway, this was not a quality coffee by any standards. Bitter doesn't mean bold/strong/dark roast; bitter means poorly roasted coffee. The stronger you roast the coffee, the more harsh it tends to get. There is a chance we got a bad batch, who knows, but for now I have to say goodbye to this Starbucks product.<br /><br />P.S. If you really love coffee, go to your local Target and try Archer's Farm coffee in a silver tin which has a label "2009 Cup Of Excellence Winner". You will have to pay $14 for 10 oz of coffee (2d place winner), but considering Target paid $13/lb for it at the Cup of Excellence Coffee Auction, they are not making that much money on it.
