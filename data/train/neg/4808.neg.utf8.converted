I have eaten many brands of soynuts over the years and have come to enjoy the ones that are crunchy (as opposed to hard). I bought this bulk package because my trips to Whole Foods are a bit spread out. Many of the soynuts in this product are extremely hard to eat, and I end up spitting them out. The ones that are good are usually just fine, but it is disappointing to find so many inedible soynuts in a package. I think I will stick to Whole Foods 365 brand.
