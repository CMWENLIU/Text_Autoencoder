We hate to leave this kind of review especially when we have enjoyed this product so much in the past.  Purchased this item in June 2011 and placed it in our kitchen cupboard upon arrival.  Two weeks ago, we were watching a movie and decided to have some popcorn.  Grabbed the new bag of Wabash (purple) and opened it.  Moths came flying out of the bag.  Yes, moths!!  Quickly closed the bag and to our dismay saw many, many moths crawling around inside the bag.  Did some internet research and found the moths are called Indian Meal Moths.  We have never seen these critters in our kitchen before and are sure they came with the popcorn.  We did a complete clean out of our cupboards and have not found them in any other products.  We wrote an email to Wabash Valley thru Amazon about this incident two weeks ago and have heard nothing back.  We would have thought they would pony up and at least offer an apology, if not a complete refund.  We realize that this kind of thing happens and are saddened by their lack of response and responsibility.  It's just not good business.  They have our money after all.
