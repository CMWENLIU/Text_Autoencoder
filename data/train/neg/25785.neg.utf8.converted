I have lots of bugs everywhere: under my deck, on top of my deck, beyond the deck, in my front yard, in my bushes, in my flower bed.  So I was given this by a neighbor and sprayed both her lawn and mine with it.  The only thing that this seem to bother were the black thatch beetles (not japanese beetles)that apparently don't do much harm to lawns.  I just saw them scatter about with a few dead ones on the lawn after I sprayed. Other than that, the little black ants are still everywhere, as are spiders, and springtails.<br /><br />All in all, if you have a really bad bug problem like I do---don't use this because it's too weak.  This made no real difference in killing the bugs I wanted to kill.
