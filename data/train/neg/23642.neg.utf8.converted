Sorry folks, I bought this out of curiosity.  It's exactly what you think it is -- REALLY FAKE TASTE!  It ruins your potato soup with a fake bacon taste that leaves a bad aftertaste.  I was not impressed.  The worst part is that there are 4 bottles that I now have no purpose for.  Guess what the in-laws are getting for Christmas???  :o) I LOVE bacon, as does my husband and neither of us liked it.  It's loaded with MSG, so be careful.  If you want to add a bacon flavor to something, ADD BACON, there is no substitute.  If you are vegan or vegetarian - you shouldn't WANT the taste of bacon on anything, so get over it.  I really do not recommend this product.  If you REALLY want to try it, I have four barely used bottles I'll send you for the shipping cost.  I want them out of my house!
