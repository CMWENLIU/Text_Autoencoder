Be careful when reading reviews.  If you were a company selling 'magic beans' it would be well worth your time to salt the reviews - not unlike people employed by a carnival who loudly shout "I won!" every five minutes at games of chance.<br /><br />A 'burst of energy' is not in a cup of this tea.  It fails the 'gum test', where you can feel a slight numbing from the alkaloids.  However, you may fail a drug test if you use this because the minute chemicals in here will appear to show that you use Cocaine recently .. but, it will not be because you enjoyed the benefit of the alkaloids that were originally in the leaves.  I was looking to replace caffeine, this particular item will not do it.<br /><br />Jim
