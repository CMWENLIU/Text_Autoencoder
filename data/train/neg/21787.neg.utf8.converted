I bought these for my 2 yr old and 11 month old. WHile I love EB products, I bit into these and said OMG these are SALTY!!! Salty like you can taste the granules of salt on your tongue! Come on, you expect EB to be a healthy alternative-yeah right. Wont be buying these anymore and mad I spent my money on them. Like the other reviewer said 'save our children's kidneys and skip these'.
