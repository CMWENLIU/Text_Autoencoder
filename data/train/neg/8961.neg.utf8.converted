My mom turned me on to Alba milkshakes in the '70s and I remember them tasting pretty good. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon after all these years. So I ordered this item, which is a massive quantity. Now I'm trying to find people to give them to since I can't force the fake, aftertaste-laden stuff down my throat. I don't know if it's different ingredients or my faulty memory, but the stuff is terribly disappointing, and borderline disgusting.
