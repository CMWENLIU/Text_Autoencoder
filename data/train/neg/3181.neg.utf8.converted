nice light tasting green tea.  Enjoyed it as part of a variety pack bought at my grocery store so ordered the same tea in bulk here.  However, the packaging of tea shipped by Amazon is inadequate and makes this tea nearly unusuable.  Each tea bag opens at the top when the tag/label string is pulled apart from the bag just before using the tea bag. The adhesive holding the top of the tea bags together is not strong enough to withstand even tiny, gentle pull from trying to "unstick" the tag and string from the bag.  Other than that the packaging is normal Lipton packaging (white paper outer envelope for each bag, thin cardboard box.  But this one defect is enough to make the tea unusuable (unless you like sifting it through your teeth as you drink) without resorting to self help such as personally stapling each tea bag closed after loosing the tag.  While the tea itself is ok and a nice light green tea for those who don't like the really strong kind, this is too much annoyance, I tossed these and will not reorder this brand of tea online, especially in bulk.  I am a lifelong tea drinker and have not experienced this problem with any other teas with anywhere near such frequency as I have with each box in this 6-pack of boxes of Lipton Green Tea.  The similar tea I purchased in a store had no problems.
