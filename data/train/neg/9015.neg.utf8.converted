These cookies are small, and initially taste good but then after you swallow you realize there's an odd aftertaste.  It's a strong chemical, preservative type flavor.  The kids wouldn't even eat any more, they said they'd just eat another one to get the fake taste out of there mouth but then they'd have it again.  The chocolate megafudge tastes like burnt coffee or bad grape juice.  They're just awful cookies, very small and lots of calories. Skip these.
