I have been buying raspberry Emergen-C for a long time and loved it.  This time when I reordered it, the package was different and it boasted "new and improved" flavor.  Well I can tell you that it is disgusting!!  It is so sweet it  makes me sick.  I mix this every morning with spirulina, and this new stuff, I can't use, it is simply awful.  I am hoping that I can return it.  If this is how Emergen-C has changed its products, I will be looking for another vitimin drink
