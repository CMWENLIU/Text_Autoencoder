They put the SKU right over the directions on how to rehydrate. There are no directions on their website and I am stuck with a product I can't use. What good is a label if they cover it up? I can't read the ingredients or the directions. Barry Farm had plenty of room on the package for the sku, so why right over important information? Very unhappy.
