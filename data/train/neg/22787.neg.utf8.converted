I too am disappointed in my "variety pack."  I too think the description and pictures are misleading! Shame on you Amazon! I thought I was getting the assortment pictured with two surprise flavors.  I spent a lot of time looking at the pictures of different listings to figure out which assortment I wanted. I received the shipment, no real complaints there, but was disappointed that 40% was French Vanilla from two different companies. Out of 35 cups that's 40% of total. I also had 6 flavors I didn't like at ALL (Holiday leftover flavors like Pumpkin Spice and Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog).  Take 6 I don't like and didn't think I was getting (thought it was TWO random) and I really didn't save any money from buying in a store in town. I think the deception comes in the picture of k cups with two pictures of "surprise" flavors. I did go back and read the actual listing and to the sellers defense it says AT LEAST two random flavors.  First time Shame on ME, Second Time Shame on You AMAZON! The product SHOULDN'T be listed as a Variety Pack with specific pictures but rather listed as a GRAB BAG of random flavors from a variety of companies.  I will NOT purchase again as I am throwing away the six terrible flavors. Next time I will get with friends and have a swapping of flavors so I know what I am getting and not pay shipping!!
