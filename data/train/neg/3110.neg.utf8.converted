I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good, aspartame tastes good, sucralose (e.g. Splenda) tastes good, saccharin tastes good (when you don't overdo it) but this was just weird.  It was sweet for sure, but it seems like most of the sweetness didn't register until a few seconds later.  I also registered an almost bitter taste, but just for a split second with each sip.  It's really hard for me to explain, but I'll just say I had no desire to finish the rest of my iced tea.<br /><br />I tried it again later and did a few experiments with it.  First, I poured a little on my finger and tasted it by itself.  Again I thought it had kind of an odd taste and slightly bitter.  I poured a slightly larger portion on my finger and tasted that.  Yuck!  Maybe it's like that because it's sweeter than sugar, but I got the same sensation when I mixed it in my tea.  I also tried adding it gradually to my tea and the best I could do was a neutral flavor.  Once it started to get sweet I could taste that same funny and slightly bitter taste.  Another wasted glass.<br /><br />This is the first stevia product I've tried so I can't say the sweetener itself tastes like this, they do add other ingredients.  If you want to try this product you really need to get the cheapest/smallest that you can.  I'll be throwing out about 95% of this stuff and I'm regretting that I ever used 5% of it.<br /><br />I would, however, recommend agave nectar.  It's a low-calorie sweetener with a low glycemic index and it's natural (usually organic).  It has a smooth taste, a pleasant aftertaste [if any], and even when I use too much it doesn't taste terrible.  I've tried two different brands and I have yet to be disappointed.
