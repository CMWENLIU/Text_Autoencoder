Be aware that these treats are made in China. We received them as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.
