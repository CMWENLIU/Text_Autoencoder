I'm looking for a bold decaf and this was suggested to me.  Seeing the words "Espresso" and "Extra-Bold" in there I figured it had to have some "punch."  Sadly no. "Extra-Bold" it is not.  I'd have trouble even suggesting "Boldly-Mild."  I have to set my machine to the lowest of the 3 settings and it's still not a satisfying coffee.  I wish it was possible to have a mixed box of decaf coffees to sample: Buying 24 or 48 K-cups at a time is not the best way to try out the unknowns!  :-)
