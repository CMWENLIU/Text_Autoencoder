Wow.  What a disappointment.  My son and I loved the Dairy Free Shells and Chreese, so I had high hopes for this alfredo sauce packet.  I thought it would be nice for a more grown up meal than the kid's mac version.  The first turn off (and again, totally different than the shells packet) was the aweful color. I've been a vegetarian for 25 years and a vegan for most of that, so I have a pretty high tolerance for these things.  The color was a very unappetizing greyish green, like sliced avocado that's been left out too long.  The smell and texture weren't very appealing either.  My husband will eat anything, he's a human garbage disposal, so he had no trouble with it.  But I doctored it up with some sauteed mushrooms, olive oil and a little almond milk for creamyness and it was a passable sauce on top of pasta.  But I was looking for a no fuss packet and ended up having to get creative and work with it.  I spared my son from having to eat it and opened a jar of marinara sauce for him.  I guess I'll use the rest of the packets as a thickening ingredient in sauces because they certainly aren't edible acording to the package instructions.
