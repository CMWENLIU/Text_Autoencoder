Holy Mother of God.<br /><br />I experienced this affront to all five senses via my girlfriend, who had, admirably, attempted to use an enviro-friendly product to collect her cat's bodily excretions. While it may or may not be friendly to the outdoors, it fails horrifically as a cat litter.<br /><br />1. Clumping. If, by "clumping," you mean "forms a heavy, dough-like glutenous paste," you have found your litter. The back of the box, where Calvin piddles, was instantly and constantly filled with a reeking, lava like mudslide, of such dense and sticky consistency that it was nearly impenetrable to a standard scoop, and clung tenaciously to the wall of the box. It was like making a modeling clay from heavy sand, flour, and corn syrup. Two scoops valiantly gave their lives trying to pry this nightmare from it's perch.<br /><br />2. Odor. Now, let's establish something. I have a high tolerance for messes. I've worked in food service, hauling Summer-ripened bags of trash, half food waste, half cashew-sized maggots, dribbling their secretions across the floor, me, and anyone unfortunate enough to get near, for a period of years. Not my fondest memories, but I dealt, heck, I got a kick laughing at my fellow employees if their constitution prevented them from lending a hand.<br /><br />That said, this product generates a hellish stench. The box was scooped daily, or nearly so. I have no idea how the cat stayed in their long enough to commit his excretory functions. The smell of urine and ammonia battered my nose like a pro boxer built from pee. Of course, given the sludgy consistency (see #1), I was doomed to enjoy this assault for several minutes at an eye-watering stretch.<br /><br />The pee smell, however, was only the tip of the stinky iceberg.<br /><br />Ever gotten sick from over-eating, or maybe a plate of food gone bad? Say, for example, lobster. Dinner's over, you're thinking "mmm, tasty, butter-soaked, sweet lobster meat," when suddenly, your entire digestive tract is pummeled by several MMA expert bacteria strains, and you spend four hours in the bathroom, as your stomach competes with your large intestine in a race to wring out to total vacancy. The worst part: the overwhelming taste and smell of the digestive-fluid washed tainted lobster is clearly identifiable as your original meal, the sweet, greasy meat now blended with bile and the overwhelming aroma of your failing bowel. That will be the last lobster you order for a decade or two. This isn't a derail, there's a point upcoming:<br /><br />2(a). The odor. Just the stench of urine fertilized by wheat byproducts would be unbearable, but the olfactory insult to injury is that this is, in fact, wheat. You know, the stuff they make bread, noodles, pizza and so on from. The smell of raw, warm dough is comprehensively integral with the overall stench of this ghastly substance. Imagine for a moment, you came across a bread recipe: 2 cups flour, 1tsp sugar, 1 package of yeast, and 1 cup of warm cat urine. Mix well, and place in a warm oven to rise. Now, hover your head 10" over the bowl, while you exert yourself mightily trying to pry a silicon putty-like mass from the wall of a litter box without shattering your last litter scoop, your elevated respiration drawing the deadly waft of rancid bread into the base of your lungs with each gagging gasp. Good times.<br /><br />3. Everything else. It's absorbency is poor. A side effect of the piss-poor clumping is that the liquid waste spreads around, tying up a massive amount of litter. Price. Yay! It cost far more than regular litter to begin with, and you toss out half the box every day? Where do I sign? Dust. Fortunately, after scarring your sinuses with yeasty ammonia, powdered chaff is almost pleasant. Tracking. No advantage over regular litter.<br /><br />Avoid this trash, you are better off not keeping a box, and let your pets do what they will. It will take less time to clean the mess than the box, the smell won't be as bad, and you won't have to quit eating bread.<br /><br />I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
