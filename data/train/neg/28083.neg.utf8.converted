I went by all the great reviews and saw people giving to 15 pound dogs and that is what my Pom is. When it arrived I see it says for dogs under 11 pounds only. Since I buy tennie Greenies for my dog and this is in overall length larger I gave him one. He tore into it and almost choked. Now for 20 min he is breathing heavy, if he doesn't calm soon I'll be calling the vet. I think I will be cleaning up vomit soon. I hate that I have given my dog something to hurt him when I wanted to help.<br /><br />Also what I didn't notice before I purchased it says wash your hands after handling. Now why do I want to put something in my dog that I have to wash my hand just because I touched it?<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon about these issues and they are going to update the page so that it is clear not to give to dogs over 11 pounds.
