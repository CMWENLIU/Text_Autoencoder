(I have had roughly 30 cans of this. ) 2 stars stands for I don;t like it. 3 stars is "it's OK". But I don;t think what I have been experienceing is OK for the price and hype.<br /><br />There is no denying how good this salmon is, it's premium wild salmon. But! The quality varies can to can. Which is unfortunate.<br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />Can 1: A nice almost single filet with medium chunks.<br />Can 2: Medium Chunks of fillet with some flakey tiny tiny pieces. Big pieces of struvite.<br />Can 3 and 4: Like Light tuna like consistency (gross and not warranting this high price), basically like filler. Lots of small struvite particles. Like biting into rocks, glass, crystals, etc.<br /><br />I decided not to buy this stuff anymore, as I like more of the fillet, or medium size chunks. I got too many cans that were flakey stuff, the same consistency as light tuna is. WAY too expensive for the inconsistant quality. Addressing the struvite, while it is commonly known that it is a mineral and natural, and that it is rare to get...I tend to doubt it...unless I have won the struvite lottery.Conistantly with my order of 4 cans, there are two cans that contain it. Generally the ones that have the flakey filler in the whole can. While most if it is small, I have had what looked like a geode, about .75 inches long, and .5 incles high, fanned out crystal. No way my teeth could crunch it. This is entirely too high for me, and nothing ruins an almost $5 can of salmon like crystals inside.<br /><br />My theory is that they noticed their salmon had huge struvite particles (Can 2), and started to almost puree the stuff (can 3 and 4) to save from a loss, or to pass the buck the the consumer. Which does not go unnoticed.<br /><br />This is how I view it and it is my opinion. If it was $2 a can I would buy more, but the supermarket alternatives are less expensive, and while most of those do not have the occasional fillet piece, I feel it is a better value over all. If the quality control was better on these, I would be buying them every week, but consistancy needs a lot of work, and company either needs a better QC supervisor, or to lower the price. The quality does not match what is advertised in the 30 or so cans I have had. You be the judge.<br /><br />Enjoy!
