Surely the banana bread is priced wrong?  $35 for 4 boxes of 8?  The other flavors are half that price.  I have been wanting to get this flavor again since they stopped doing the single flavor boxes in the supermarket and I am keen to add it to my cart but can't justify paying nearly $9 a box for it, especially when I am buying in bulk now too!
