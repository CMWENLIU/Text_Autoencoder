Inside the undamaged Amazon shipping box, we found an already opened, but undamaged, 24 can Roland case container. The end had been cleanly cut from that box and then re-fitted over the opening, without being taped. Inside the Roland box were 24 damaged cans. Not a single can was not damaged in some way, the majority of them being severely dented. The sheer number of damaged cans, and the variety of that damage, in an undamaged box, was such that we concluded these were previously damaged cans collected into the case container we received. We contacted Amazon and their response was immediate and gratifying, as has always been the rule with them. As for the product itself, it is not one we would consider ordering again.
