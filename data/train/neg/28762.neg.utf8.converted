I Purchased this and Mad Dog 357 ghost pepper sauce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B9HC6I">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce</a> at the same time. I love hot sauce, but this had no flavor.<br />The makers wanted the consumer to use as much as possible in one sitting and so the bottles were designed with a open neck slightly smaller than a catchup bottle and used xanthan gum apparently to thicken the product, making it pour out in globs, like steak sauce. This sauce also had vegetable oil and tomato paste in it.<br />Because of the cost, lack of flavor, ingredients, and bottle engineering, I would not recommend this sauce...jim
