Disappointed in this purchase. The product is advertised as whole cashews, but I still got a lot of bits and pieces. Maybe they got broken in shipping? Also, the whole nuts seem smaller than the whole roasted cashews that Costco sells for about the same price. Finally, the Planters cashews are noticably saltier than the Costco cashews. I'm not opposed to salt for health reasons, but that much salt does mask the natural taste of the nuts (and taste is why I bought cashews instead of peanuts).
