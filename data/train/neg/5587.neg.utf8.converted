My parents have one.  On Easter I just had to ask:<br /><br />"What is that constant clicking noise"?<br /><br />Well, it's the Aerogarden.  Over a few days later and reading the manual, trying to clean the (non-removable) pump out, but same problem.<br /><br />Also, I know they had it a month at least, but I couldn't begin to get enough basil to add to a vegetable dish I was making - woulda taken all off the plant.<br /><br />The tomato plant is taking over and everything else seems shadowed by it.<br /><br />But even if you could cook like crazy off it, I couldn't bear the noise.
