I'm a strong coffee drinker and thought to myself that a French Roast is a bold coffee. Well, I didn't find this to be very "bold" so I can't rate it well according to my taste for coffee.<br /><br />If you like strong coffee like we do - consider these:<br /><br />1. Timothy's Midnight Magic --> BY FAR my favorite!<br />2. Green Mountain Dark Magic<br />3. Emeril's Extra Bold<br /><br />That being said, some people don't like the strong taste of coffee so take my advice only if you are a strong coffee drinker.
