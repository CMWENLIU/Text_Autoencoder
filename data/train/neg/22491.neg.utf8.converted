from reading all the reviews about black gunk and mold i have decided to forgo this product and i have lucked up on the baby brezza. it's a wonderful machine and it cooks and steams without having to do 2 steps. simply put the food in chopped, press the steam and puree button 1, 2, 3, or 4 times depending on how long you want the food to steam, and it purees or chops the food for you. you can also use the steam only or puree only button. save steps, and money, this product is only $99 and has adorable useful tools to buy separately for under $8. the website for the product is great, with instructional videos as well.<br /> i'm really glad i found this before i spent the $$ on something that might disappoint me in the long run. i hope they offer the baby brezza on amazon soon. i hate that i can't support amazon's great service by buying from them.
