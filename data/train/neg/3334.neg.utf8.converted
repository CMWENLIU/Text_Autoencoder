i want to first of all start off with the fact that i LOVE bobo's bars.  they are amazing and this is not a review of them, by any means.  this is a review on the actually seller of the bars here on amazon.  the bars, which are pretty much the same price to get at the store and from bobo's directly, arrived hard and overly sticky and not crumbly, as they should be.  when you buy them as they are meant to be, they are soft and crumbly and moist and amazing.  when i purchased them here, they were hard as a rock, sticky, and not crumbling in the least.  so disappointed since they are not cheap.<br /><br />i recommend the bars themselves, just not through this seller.
