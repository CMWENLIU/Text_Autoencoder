I really wanted to give this coffee 1.5 stars, but Amazon does not allow half stars.  This is a fairly light brew with a sickly chemical vanilla flavor.  When we are paying nearly $.60 per cup, you would think that these companies would actually put out a decent product.  I can be pretty picky when it comes to food, but I am far from a coffee snob.  If you want a decent cup of french vanilla coffee, don't order this product.
