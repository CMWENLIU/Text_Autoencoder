i just got the Brezza today and tried to prepare some food. It steamed food nicely but did not blend properly. after reading instruction i realized that blades do not fall down for blend cycle as it suppose (based on the instruction). the maker definitely goes back.<br />Since all reviews are so great, i think my product is defective. i will try to order a replacement, see if it is going to work.
