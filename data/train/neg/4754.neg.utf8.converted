See that photo on the cover of the cheesy skillet? Your dish will turn out nothing like it. I had feared that this product would be too cheesy, and in actuality it was not cheesy at all. In fact, it lacked taste and was incredibly bland. I was shocked at how awful it tasted, and even my very hungry family did not like it.<br /><br />The Velveeta package is what confuses me here, because as soon as you add it to the noodles it seems to disappear and you're left with plain noodles and hamburger. Besides the cheese sort of disappearing, there is no taste with this product.<br /><br />The traditional powdery cheesy Mac n' Cheese you get out of a box (which I actually can't stand) is better than this.
