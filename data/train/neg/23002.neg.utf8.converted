First, the package did not come with the items as described, they used substitutes.  I chose this basket because of the items that were supposed to be included - there were no chocolate covered cherries, no pistachios.  Next, don't send the package directly to the gift recipient - the treats were still in their bags, so you'll have to arrange them yourself - which is contrary to what is stated that they are "hand arranged".
