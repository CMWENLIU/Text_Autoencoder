The title of my review says it all.  I have high blood sugar, so I am always on the lookout for sugar free or relatively low sugar foods and snacks.<br /><br />I saw 3 stars on the product without reading the actual review, which I should have, and ordered these.  I am not going to lie to you, these taste great, and that's where all the pros end.  Ate about 30 of them and about 3 hours later, the merciless gas attack began.  Gas-X, Imodium, nothing helps at this point....  just had to deal with the gastrointestinal pain, flatulence and diarrhea.<br /><br />These would make a great prank candy.....  if that isn't your goal, these delicious gas inducing candy isn't for you.
