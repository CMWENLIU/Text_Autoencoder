Warning flag!!!!<br /><br />Hydrolized proteins, the so-called comfort proteins, are broken down in a process that adds MSG!!!! That is what hydrolized means...<br /><br />They are not legally obligated to list MSG as it is part of a process and not just an additive.<br /><br />Be aware of this!!!!
