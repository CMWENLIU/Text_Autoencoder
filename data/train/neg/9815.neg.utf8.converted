I ordered this for my sister because we used to eat these when we were little. Three months after she gets them, I visit her and see that she only ate about half of them and was planning to give the other half away part of xmas gifts.  Why you ask? Because I purchased them on Amazon, not knowing that they were sour squeeze pops.  Everyone likes the sweet ones and the sweet ones were the original squeeze pops.  All the other vendors title the sour squeeze pops "sour squeeze pops", but these guys didn't even have the decency to put the word "sour" anywhere in the description.  The only way to know that you are ordering the sour version is to enlarge the picture of the item and hunt for the word "sour" on the box.  I felt deceived, and would rather do business with another vendor for a buck or two more than a dishonest one.
