After lunch, I drank about 1/3rd of the bottle (the flavor is pretty good) and stopped when I started feeling like my world was closing in on me. I started getting a headache and felt really drugged.  Not a good thing when trying to work...typing was something I had to really concentrate on.  I'm finally coming back to normal after about 45 minutes but the headache still lingers.  Unless I'm sitting on the couch with nothing to do but eat, I won't be drinking it again!
