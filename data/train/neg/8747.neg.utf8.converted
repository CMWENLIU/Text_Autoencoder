In reading the three reviews written thus far, I more fully appreciate the reasons why voters of the United States elected George W. Bush to serve a second term as President of their country.<br /><br />We like what is familar and often lack exposure to options and the set of skills needed to guide us in developing discriminating taste.  Nostalgia governs our feelings about food.  When I was growing up cheese-like particles in cardboard cylinders were the only alternative to orange squares of individually wrapped processed cheese.  Thus, I was content to shake the stuff on top of my bowls of Campbell's soup.  Life was fine.  Even better when the surface where the powdery substance fell was pizza or spaghetti.  It offered an interesting textural contrast and proved a relatively inexpensive source for sodium.<br /><br />Then as I grew up and the world changed along with me.  I met people who spoke different languages and visited and lived in their countries.  I learned the difference between the processed and highly industrialized foods I grew up eating and the kinds of fresh produce I could find on a market street in France or a piazza in front of a church in Italy.  After becoming comfortable inside foreign supermarkets, I explored small cheese shops, bakeries, charcuteries and butcher's stores.  Back home, brave, determined souls with more vision than I began businesses, farms and urban markets that translated what is good about European artisanal foods and farms into American terms.  Immigrants from around the world also enriched our culinary lives by bringing their beloved traditions here.<br /><br />However good a goat cheese from Vermont can be, it is not the same as a living chevre from a small region in France.  Even if Kraft were interested in making that kind cheese, the size of the corporation prohibits such a process.  Nor  could it ever reproduce the exquisite character of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  The craft of making this regional cheese from Parma has been refined over centuries by a consortium of cheese makers.  It depends upon great skill.  Cows eat grass and breathe different air, factors that contribute to the kind of milk they produce.  That milk becomes enormous wheels that are aged for a minimum of two years, preferably three, until pale crystals form in the golden surface that cracks unevenly as a trained cheese monger thrusts a pick into a newly opened cheese.  The taste is pronounced rather than sharp to the tongue, buttery, sweet yet mellow, nutty and utterly one of the best things one might ever experience in life.<br /><br />I urge you to take advantage of the fact that you are able to buy authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano imported from Parma, Italy these days. Look for the words "PARMIGIANO REGGIANO" perforated on the surface of the rind in black dots with a red insignia.  These are signs that you are getting the real thing.  It's not inexpensive, but then again, it isn't cheap either.  Price is a lot less than the bill for a new flat-screen TV.<br /><br />Serve it in small chunks, room temperature, with ripe fresh pears or grated on top of your favorite dishes where it actually melts.  Let Kraft continue to corrupt American culture and prepare our country's citizens for years of obesity, mediocrity and high dental bills.  You, on the other hand, can lead a better life without the shiny little green cylinder of cheese-like  processed goods.
