Be aware that Kraft changed the recipe for this "new" mac and cheese! What used to be called the "Old World Italian" flavor, which came with a bread crumb topping, has been replaced with a creamy alfredo cheese sauce (with no crumb topping option). The picture which appears above is the older version; however, if you purchase this item, you will receive the new, updated "formula". I made the mistake of purchasing this thinking it was the old kind and it wasn't. (As a side note, you can't typically return grocery items!)
