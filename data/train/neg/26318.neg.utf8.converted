We have used arrowroot flour successfully in our gluten-free cooking/baking before but this brand has a very strong odor to it - like a mixture of chili powder and spices.  Normal arrowroot flour/starch has no odor to it.  The smell affects the flavor and my daughter, who has always been fine with arrowroot flour/starch, had an allergic reaction to this brand.  I can't use this product.  It smells so bad I can't even use it to make gluten-free play clay for my younger son.
