I bought this chili powder with the intention of using it around the kitchen and for making chili. I recently tried using chili powder (not this one from Amazon, but one from a grocery store), and didn't feel like paying the higher price per pound buying it from a grocery store, so I found the one here on Amazon. There is an ingredient in here that I am not fond of whatsoever, hence the 1 star review. This ingredient is SILICON DIOXIDE.<br /><br />Here are a couple links with some general info:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Regardless of how "safe" some say it is to ingest, the fact that I would have potentially eaten something that is used to make glass or breast implants doesn't really sit right with me. Amazon should have disclosed ALL ingredients in their food products that they offer. I'm a bit upset that something I looked so forward to using now has to be returned, which means I now have to order a different one and wait several more days or so.
