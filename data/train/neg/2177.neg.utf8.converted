Some colors worked OK on melted chocolates, but others would only write for a short time and quit others never seemed to work at all. The black I used on the white chocolates never dried and came off on the hands of anyone that touched them and the color didn't want to wash off - VERY MESSY. Going to look at returning them - not worth the hassle or cabinet space.
