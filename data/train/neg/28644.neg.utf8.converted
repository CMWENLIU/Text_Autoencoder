The sardine are hard and dry and have an off, metallic taste to them. The sauce is nice, but not what's swimming in them. The sardines don't fill the can, and really are unpleasant. These also contain MSG, maltodextrin, and xanthan gum which isn't mentioned in the ingredient list which of course is incorrect. I saw a brand name and really expected better quality than these. Avoid!!!
