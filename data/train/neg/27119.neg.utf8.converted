Reviewed by my girlfriend:<br /><br />I'm a type I Diabetic, and I was very hopeful when I tried this product. My favorite soybean pasta has been discontinued, and after a search on the web, this seemed to be a good alternative. However, this affected my blood sugar exactly like regular pasta would. The claim of "lower digestible carbs" didn't ring true. My blood sugar was through the roof. I don't recommend this for diabetics. Unfortunately, I've yet to find anything out on the market that will substitute for the real thing.
