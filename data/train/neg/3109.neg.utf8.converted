If you are looking for oatmeal cookies do not buy these as they have the same texture and flavor as Keebler's other cookies. I purchased these in hopes of having delicious oatmeal texture and flavor however what I received by what I could see was a standard keebler cookie with oats on top. Now I know some of you might be thinking, if you find their other cookies appetizing why did you rate it one star? Simply because when I purchase an oatmeal cookie, I expect an oatmeal cookie where the oats are a dominant flavor in the palate. I paid for an oatmeal cookie and I received a repackaged re-branded keebler cookie. The second major reason behind my rating is the packaging is absolutely worthless, if you must buy these purchase a ziplock bag to keep the cookies from going stale or eat them in one sitting.
