Like others, I found the effect really weak with these, even with two tablets per person. It was the same for everyone who tried them. I've used both the real fruit and the pure miraculin granules from the UK - both work much better. The fruit is great but expensive so you're probably best off trying miraculin rather than miracle fruit tablets.
