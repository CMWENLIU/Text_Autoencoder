I can't believe that I have to search for these on amazon. Like srsly double u tee eff kellogs? Why can't I buy them at the supermarket like a normal human being? Spoiler aleart: these are the best pop tarts on the planet and all other pastries will taste like chocolate starfish after you have tasted the deliciousness. I miss u wild berry. U never call. I wish you the best... But I have to let you go. I don't wanna cloooose my eyes! No wait! Come back! I didn't mean to only give u a one star review... I was just hurt. That's all. Please kellogs give us one more chance to show you how much we love you. You don't have to say anything for now. Just think about us. What we had. When you're ready I'll be waiting here for you... In the pastry isle... At Von's. We can watch power rangers together like old times. I know u miss me because I miss you. I'm sorry. I'm drunk texting. Don't let things get weird ok? I hope you the best wild berry.<br /><br />-Chris Isaac
