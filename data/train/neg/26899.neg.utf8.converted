Tastes good..convenient little packages...<br />However, I went out of my way to buy this product in part because I have been on the search for milk alternatives as a way to make sure I am getting calcium.<br />Well, the website information on Amazon says that this almond beverage is enriched with calcium--so woohoo!  I ordered it.  I had been drinking it for a couple days and enjoying it when I took a gander at the actual nutrition facts and saw that calcium is listed as 0%<br />That's right a big goose egg--like I would go through all this trouble just because I like almond milk!  How frustrating!!!
