I was very disappointed with the bonsai from Brussel"s.  I ordered the plant as a gift for my niece who was opening a new office.  She said that the plant was delivered to her in a very "sick" state.  I immediately contacted Amazon to see what I could do to get my niece a new plant.  They were very helpful and detailed in telling me what I needed to do to receive a replacement.  Unfortunately, when the replacement plant arrived, my niece said that it was in worse shape than the first one!!!!  She said that there were three leaves that were yellow; one was about to fall off.  She tried to nurse it back to health, however, after she told me the condition it was in, I immediately contacted Amazon for a refund.  Why spend money to buy a sick plant!!!
