Ordered the Pork Jerky and loved, loved loved it!  So I figured this one must be as good as the pork jerky.  Boy, was I wrong.  Much more chewy and really didn't like the mandarin orange flavor, of course I'm not sure I tasted that as much as I felt like I was eating leather.  My cat won't even eat it!  I say skip this one, and save your money, I wish I had.
