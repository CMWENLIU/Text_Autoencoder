My wife and I have used this product for some time now.  When it first came out, they claimed no dust.  Well, there was always dust, but because it was natural and scooped, we decided to keep using it.  This was a big mistake.  This litter tracks all over the house and has ruined 2 vacuum cleaners because the dust is so fine it bypasses the bag and enters / cloggs the motor mechanisms.<br /><br />We have 3 cats that all are suffering terribly from respiratory issues caused by the dust from this litter.  If you don't believe that there's dust, as some of the reviews have claimed, then just simply OPEN YOUR BLINDS on your windows, allow the sunlight to come into the room / the boxes you're scooping,  and then scoop it,  or move it around in the box.  You won't believe the huge amount of micro-fine dust that billows out of the boxes.  You can't see these "dusts" in standard interior light, but if the sun is bright enough shining through the window, it's amazing how far up this stuff travels.  Imagine being inside a box, scratching away @ this litter, and breathing in all that dust.  No wonder why our cats always appear sick.<br /><br />Google Swheat Litter and respiratory issues and you'll find others who've had the same problem.  I've caused my cats enough grief, and we're switching to something better.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I'm editing my review without changing anything written above, as I've read more of the other reviews posted here about how "wonderful" this cat litter is. I need to reiterate my thoughts, so whomever buys this product gets to make a better "educated decison" for themselves on how "wonderful" it is ...based upon factual evidence that they can create and see for themselves, and not just go by some BS review of praise.  Yeah, it clumps, and it saves money, but there's more to it than that.<br /><br />Buy a bag or box or whatever size you like of the litter.  Put it in a cat box, and let it sit for a day, hour, week.... it doesn't matter.  OPEN YOUR BLINDS ON YOUR WINDOW AND SHAKE THE BOX IN THE SUNLIGHT !  Move it around with a SCOOP !  do whatever it takes to make the stuff move around in the box, short of throwing it around.  WATCH THE DUST BILLOW UPWARDS like a cloud rising up from a fire.  You won't believe it.  These particles are so "micro-fine" that they lift upwards and into your face as you're scooping. Now imagine how your cat is doing, being right in there in that dust.  You can't see the dust, as it's too fine, unless you move it around in sunlight.  You'll be horrified at how much it just billows up out of the box.<br /><br />After trying this "test", you can now make your own decision based upon your results that you see before you.  Personally, I'm tired of constantly bringing my cats to the vet for respiratory problems.  They're indoor cats that aren't exposed anything but this litter.  Since we switched to a "pine pellet" type, our house has stayed clean, and our cats are back to breathing normally.  Id never use the swheatlitter again.<br /><br />Nuff said.
