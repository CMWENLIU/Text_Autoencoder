I bought these because they advertise this as 100 calories per serving.  Well, there are almost two servings in a bowl which puts this at roughly 200 calories and 40 fat calories.  Plus, the chichen has lots of chewy parts that I typically would cut off if I were eating a whole breast.  This is very high in sodium also...close to 900 mgs in total.  This is anything but a healthy bowl of soup.  If you are going to sell food in a single serving size, you should only be serving a single serving.  I am so disapointed that I am actually going to take this product back to the grocery store and get my money back - something that I NEVER do.
