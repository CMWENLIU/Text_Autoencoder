I bought this when I saw them on Good Morning America, thinking they would be a great sub. for pasta.  They are low calorie, low carb and looked as if they would be at least ok to try.  I was WRONG! When I got these I was excited to try them, but when I opened the first bag, I got the fishy smell others have described, so I rinsed them until it was gone.  I then, blanced them in boiling water (as directions stated) and when I took them out they were congelled together in knots.  Well I thought I would still give them a try, hey how bad could they be? I put pasta sauce on them, and onto my plate (still excited to try!)... but when I put them in my mouth.... it reminded me of a frozen pasta (like a Healthy Choice) but much worse!  I threw the whole plate of food away and the other bags of the so-called "Pasta"!<br />I would all in all not recommend these!  Save your money, and just limit yourself on the real thing, trust me it's worth it!
