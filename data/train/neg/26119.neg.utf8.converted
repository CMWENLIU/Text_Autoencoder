Well, shame on me. I saw the "Natural" on the label, assumed that it was just ground peanuts (not reading carefully enough), and wound up with 6 jars of regular old american peanut butter that's loaded with sugar. Of course it tastes good, is mixed well and stays mixed, and lasts long on the shelf, but you pay for those things.
