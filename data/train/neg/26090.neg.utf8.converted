I love Hodgson's bread mixes for the bread machine and keep almost every flavor on Subscribe and Save so I'm never without. When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it. The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent, the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy. Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread, even those made gluten free or wheat based. This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil. The second try I used butter, but achieved the same results. Because I figured it was Hodgson's and it would be great, I ordered a case of 6 boxes. Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen. I just did not like the flavor, texture, appearance or indescribable after-taste. I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it.
