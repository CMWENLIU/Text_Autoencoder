I've been using Stevia for several years now... until buying this type, I had always purchased the clear Stevia.  I just threw out the rest of the bottle of this brown Stevia today.... I use Stevia to sweeten iced tea, and the clear works like a charm.  The brown, however, seems to congeal at the bottom and also adds a bit of an "off" taste.<br /><br />I'd suggest you stick with either the clear stevia or the powder.
