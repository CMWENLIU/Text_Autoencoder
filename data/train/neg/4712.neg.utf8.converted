I have never had good luck with Pro Flowers.  Flowers/plants came in boxes, knocked around, bashed, wilted.  Tried 2 or 3 times, for awhile(10-15 yrs ago) they were THE big online floral service.  Not anymore, and certainly not for me.<br /><br />Update:5/17/11<br /><br /> Mother's Day Special 2011:  All day long Neal Boortz was pushing the $19.95 Mothers Day Special: "A Dozen Roses, click on the microphone at website, type in Neal (Boortz)  get free vase!"  Well, I did all that, and clicked submit, but right before it submitted I noticed my total was over $63!  I immediately went back to the website and cancelled.  I saw the $10 shipping fee, bringing the total to $29, approx, but failed to see the fine print: $10 Extra charge for Saturday shipping, $16 extra charge for a pink vase instead of clear, and whatever extra shipping/handling fees they added bringing the total to  almost $64.  I apologize hugely for missing all that fine print, but will NEVER use Pro Flowers for anything, advise you look elsewhere for florist needs.  Words of wisdom: find a florist in you hometown that you like, use them for everything, even out of town stuff.  If they treat you right at home, chances are they will treat you right for out-of-town orders.
