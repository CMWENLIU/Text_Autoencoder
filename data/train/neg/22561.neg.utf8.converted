Deer Off deer, rabbit and squirrel repellent may actually repel deer if you can get the repellent on the plants. I carefully followed the dilution instructions, poured the mixture into a sprayer, and started to use it. Within a few minutes the sprayer was clogged. I ended up putting the mixture into a sprinkling can and sprinkling it on the plants -- a very inefficient way to use it. I tried to clean the sprayer and finally had to throw it away. It was a sprayer I had used successfully with other sprays. I would not buy this product again.
