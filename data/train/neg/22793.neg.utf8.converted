If I had wanted 8 Spicy Eggnogs I would have just bought a box of Spicy Eggnog.  The same for Butter Toffee.  This was truly dissapointing.  I would sure like to know how you plan to fix this.  I chose this for the many different types, so i could try them without buying an entire box.  I guess I got scammed big time.  When I saw the list, I knew it wouldn't be exact, but mine looks like a Winter Seasonal variety. Lots of Gingerbread, Eggnog and Pumpkin Spice.  I want my variety.
