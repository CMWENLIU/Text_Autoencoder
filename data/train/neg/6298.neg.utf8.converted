My bull terrier loved this toy. It's long lasting and the only toy that my dog didn't destroy in 10 minutes. I thought it was great until he came down with a fever and intense diarrhea and a low grade fever after getting a piece of it out of the toy.  The vet said that it was recalled a few years back but couldn't find out why. She said to stay away from any pet things made in China as there are no regulations on the making of them.  I won't be giving them to my dog - please be warned and make an informed decision before buying it.
