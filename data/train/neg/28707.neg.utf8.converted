I got this as a joke gift for Christmas to the entire family.  Having previously spent $10 on 1 pound reeses peanut butter cups I thought this was a way to 1-up myself.<br /><br />It was on sale for ~$22, which I would pay no more for honestly.  It arrived a day early!  I was surprised as it would have been close for christmas but arrived with enough time for me to inspect it and wrap it.<br /><br />I opened the box and slid it out, very large impressive chocolate bar.  Have not tasted yet but I assume will taste like good chocolate.<br /><br />HOWEVER:  ARRIVED BROKEN INTO 6+ triangles.  If you order this you can pretty much guarantee it will arrive broken.  Guaranteed broken into small pieces.  However I am passing it off as a joke and would've passed pieces to everyone, but the impressive image is far less impressive when its a bunch of pieces.<br /><br />I enjoy this purchase just because I was able to cross 6 people off my gift list with a massive cheap bar, but if you expect it whole like the pictures you are sadly mistaken.
