With all due respect to those reviewers who think this stuff is good - to each his own as they say - this stuff is dreck.<br /><br />I usually buy green beans and roast them myself although I do also buy roasted bean coffee and there are several very good brands of each on Amazon.<br /><br />But sometimes my wife has to go into work very early and she hates running the somewhat noisy grinder so I'll buy a bag of ground coffee to have around which is how we ended up with this stuff.<br /><br />Frankly, it's barely drinkable. Maybe people who feel otherwise don't drink much good coffee but if you're looking for something in the "specialty" or "gourmet" genre I strongly suggest avoiding this stuff. It's about as "Jamaican" as my Labrador retriever. Muddy color, bitter, no subtleties, flat, dull and surprisingly aroma-free, I've had better from the stale coffee urns in hospitals.
