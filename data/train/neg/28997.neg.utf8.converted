On the plus side, this is a big, heavy plastic jar full of colorful jelly beans. On the negative side, so many of the flavors are  "spit-em-out-quick" nasty. My wife and I thought only about a third were actually pleasant. A better idea would be to get a big jar full of just a few "normal" flavors.
