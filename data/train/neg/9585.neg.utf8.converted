While I am not an expert in Bonsai, it appears that neither was the person who was growing this tree. The tree that I received had very little if any resemblance with the tree that is shown in the photo. I would be careful before buying bonsai tree's online unless you are seeing the actual tree that you are going to get. This tree was just a chop job of trimming and there were a few scars on the trunk where wire had been left on too long and too tightly during the training process. I would invite others to think twice before buying this tree.
