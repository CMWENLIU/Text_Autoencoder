I can't say how the macaron tastes because my groupon order never arrived but I can comment on the companies lack of customer service.  It appears by the other reviewer that I got lucky that the macarons never came but it was completely frustrating that I was waiting for them for a birthday present.  The birthday came and went and finally found out after that the macarons were delivered elsewhere.  I called and emailed Dessert Hub repeatedly, no one answered the phone, called me back or responded to my emails.  I would never deal with that company again.
