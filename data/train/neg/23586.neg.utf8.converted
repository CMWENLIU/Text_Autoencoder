I'd like to be the first to congratulate Skippy on reducing the size of its product from 18oz to 16.3oz. This demonstrates the same proactive business philosophy as its continued use of trans fats. However, I am forced to deduct 4 stars for the inclusion of .3oz of unnecessary peanut butter. Since 16oz is a comfortable number for consumers it is completely unacceptable to include more than 15.5oz. This is especially unfortunate since Skippy already sells its "natural" peanut butter in 15oz jars. Fortunately, we can look forward to this 16.3oz jar being phased out for the already introduced 12oz size. Someday soon I hope to see consumers buying a two dozen of 1.2oz jars of 25% pure peanut butter for only one week's wages.
