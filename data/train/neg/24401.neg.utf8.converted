The rice had mold and what appeared to be spider webs inside the package.  After opening the plastic bag, you could actually smell an old oily odor.  This rice was the worst product I've ever purchased anywhere.  I will never purchase this product or anything from this company again.  It is cheaper in the long run to purchase this item from Whole Food Market.
