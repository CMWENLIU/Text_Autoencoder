I switched from Iams regular dry kitten food to Iams Healthy Naturals a few weeks ago, after my cat turned onem thinking it would be better for him. After 2 days of eating it, he started having diarrhea and used the litterbox 4-5 times a day. This went on for a week. At first, I thought it was the canned food that I give him once a day, but he had had no problems with it before. I stopped giving him canned food anyway, and only gave him Healthy Naturals. He continued to have loose stools, and this continued for a few days after I had stopped giving him the Healthy Naturals. It was horrible! My whole apartment stank of cat poop, and I had to wipe and clean his rear end everytime he used the litterbox or there'd be stains everywhere he sat! I don't know, but maybe it just doesn't suit his digestive system. I've had him since he was 7 weeks old and he has never had diarrhea until I fed him this dry food. So, if you want to switch to this food for your cat, I'd suggest getting the smallest bag first.
