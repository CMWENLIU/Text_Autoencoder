Have used Betty Crocker Potato Buds for years. Grabbed a box off the shelf recently and didn't  notice that they had changed the product until I went to make them last night. Well, they are terrible compared to the old version. I told my husband that now I will have to try and find a different brand to use. I much prefer homemade mashed, but like to have boxed on hand for emergencies. Did a web search and found Honest Earth All Natural Mashed potatoes on Amazon none the less! The reveiws are GREAT and I will be placing an order for them. Betty Crocker, like the other reviewers, you just lost my business.
