Taste is OK; texture is something like straw. It might respond to cooking the same as angel-hair pasta; but then again, maybe not: the instructions for preparation are not helpful in this regard, which is too bad for a relatively unfamiliar product not described in most cookbooks.<br /><br />The package does not re-seal or re-close; however, it contains only about 3 servings, so would usually be used up all at once anyway.<br /><br />Aside from providing a gluten-free food for those who need it, this mis-named "vermicelli" (angel-hair, more like) is healthful from the standpoint that it incorporates brown rice rather than over-processed wheat (or white rice, for that matter); however, similar health benefits, for the majority of people who are not gluten-intolerant could also be achieved in a whole-wheat product.<br /><br />With better packaging and instructions, I could give this a mild recommendation for the general consumer; as it stands, it's only for those who must avoid gluten.
