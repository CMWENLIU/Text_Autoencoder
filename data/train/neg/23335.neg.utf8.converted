I bought these for a cute celebration of St. Patrick's Day for my Team Members.  I was trying to decide between the little boxes and these and chose the cup over the box because of the convenience of just adding milk to the cup.  Though the idea was still cute, each cup had very smudged artwork and the cups all had black ash on the outside of them while sealed in the General Mills box.  It was so bad, I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  The cereal seemed to taste the way it should, but since I bought these for their branding and aesthetics too, I was disappointed. Next time I'll get the small boxes instead.
