This is a Thailand made product and includes Vanillin (a petrochemical derivative and substitute for vanilla) - a fact that is missing from the product ingredients listed on the page as of 9/6/2012.<br />"Ingredients<br />Malt Extract, Milk, Cocoa, Whey, Tapioca Syrup, Palm Oil, Vitamin Mix, Calcium, Thiamine, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin A, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin D3, Iron, Lactose, Manganese, Potassium, Magnesium, Folic Acid, Zinc."<br /><br />Totally overpriced in the US for a product that has worse ingredients. Should have walked to a local grocery chain and bought the american product - at least would have known the ingredients before.
