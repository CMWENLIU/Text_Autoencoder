I like this product.  I had previously ordered the pack of three but it was discontinued on Amazon for a few weeks.  In the meantime I checked out the two pack which was more expensive plus a high shipping cost. The site didnt tell me how large the two bottles were but when I read that the weight was 8.8 lbs, I knew they were substantially larger.  I really needed the product as I have enjoyed using it,so I ordered them.<br /><br />What a surprise when I received two 10 ounce bottles.  I dont know how the company could claim that it weighed in at 8.8 lbs.  I was totally mislead.  I have contacted the company for a refund or to return the two tiny bottles.  So if your interested in this product which is a good one, DO NOT buy the pack of two as the weight is not TRUE.  Check out the pack of three from Amazon - that is the best and TRUE deal.
