This item is NOT as shown! NO "sweet potatoes" were used in the making of this product!!<br /><br />What is shown on the box is "Sweet Potato Pancakes". "Sweet potato" means sweet potatoes or yams. I believed I was ordering a pancake mix made with SWEET potatoes.<br /><br />What I got is - the box is identical in appearance EXCEPT - it says "SWEETENED Potato Pancakes"!  BIG DIFFERENCE!<br />Absolutely NO "sweet potatoes" were used in the making of this product!<br /><br />I am EXTREMELY disappointed. If I could give it "0" stars I would. Will not order it again!!
