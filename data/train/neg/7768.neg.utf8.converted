Falcon Farms cancelled this order and many others, despite a promise from an Amazon CSR Supervisor that the roses would be delivered. Apparently what appeared to be a special sale was claimed to be a glitch, and refunds took several transactions - during which many customer email addresses were shared with others, already resulting in spam. In trying to mitigate the damages from either the glitch or decision to void the sales, customers were treated differently - some received the value of the sale, some were given future discounts, some were given nothing but an apology that was mass-emailed with many email addresses in the CC field, exposing customers to others despite having a published privacy policy that states they will never share customer data with others.
