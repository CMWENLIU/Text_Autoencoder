I thought I'd check online to see if buying energy drinks in bulk would be cheaper than buying the 4-8 packs in my local grocery store. Well they're not. At all. In fact the cost of this 8 pack, when you add shipping, is over twice what you'd pay if you bought 8 individually in a convenience store ( give or take some for tax)
