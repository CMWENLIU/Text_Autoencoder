For almost twenty years we are in a power struggle with carpenter ant colonies that comes out of the woods and try to take over our log house. Until now I kept them at bay with borax and ajax scrubbing powder. While it does not kill the ants they really don't like to cross any treated areas. After reading all those glowing reviews I wanted to see if Terro would once and for all get rid of those pests. No such luck. I applied the 'killer' following instructions directly on a invading brigade and their surroundings. They did not even stop, flinch or otherwise acknowledge my attempt. Absolutely nothing, even hours later they were still advancing towards our home walking over this dust without any hesitation. When they finally came within critical distance to the house walls I got nervous. Out came the borax and the ajax and within minutes the ants were gone into hiding. They will like every year try to find another way to move in with us but I've got a stockpile and it is not THIS product. Sorry.
