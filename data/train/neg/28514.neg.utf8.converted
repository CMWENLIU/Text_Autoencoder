I ordered this hoping that it was the lower fat&air than typical American style Ice Cream, with dense favorful gelato that you can get in shops throughout Italy.  What I got is delicious ice cream yes, but I can get that locally.  if I let this rise to the temp gelato is at it's best to eat, it would be soupy, not silky smooth.  My search for real AUTHENTIC mail-order gelato continues . . .
