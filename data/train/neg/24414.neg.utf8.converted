AMAZON ORDER: Ordered the 3 pack Verona after reading + reviews AND bec. I wanted to start ordering as many non-perishible items as possible on-line.<br />I have no gripes w/ the Verona (it's nothin' special) BUT I was disappointed in ordering THREE bags in Jan. & they arrive w/ a "good by" date of April. That's waayyy tooo close.<br />Just doesn't sound fresh enough to me. I felt like they took advantage of an on-line orderer to send the dregs to. Oh well, live & learn.
