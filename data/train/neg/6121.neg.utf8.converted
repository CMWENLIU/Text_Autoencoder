This is a cruel joke for cats owners. 1. the pellets are too big for poop scoops, so you can't get the poop out without "playing" in the crap!  2. pellets are too big to smother the stink from poop, when your cat goes #2, YOU'LL KNOW! 3. older cat wouldn't use it. I bought this stuff at walmart last night, I come home to a house that smells like it's been painted with manure! I tryed to get the ONE pile of poop out and just smeared it all over the end of the scooper. on my way to the store for my ARM AND HAMMER SCOOPABLE right now.
