Expecting soft and delicious caramels, I was very disappointed when I couldn't even get the foil off the candy because as they dried up, some of the foil got stuck inside the candy. Giving them a second chance, it only confirmed my suspicion, these were hard as a rock. So much for my idea of a perfect stocking stuffer :(
