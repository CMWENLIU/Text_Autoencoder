Started to order Chocolate Malt Ovaltine on here, but read some reviews first.  Then went to my cupboard to see what I had, as it still tastes like the real thing.  Well, I'd had several jars on hand, all with the new look, but now I'm using the second-to-last jar, and it has the new design, but doesn't say "New Improved Recipe".  Still good.  However, I always try to keep an open mind.  Decided to open the last jar which says "New Improved Recipe" on it, had some last night, and it had the worst, fishy-tasting, disgustingly awful flavor!  Will be calling Nestle right away to beg for the original recipe back. Needless to say, I won't be buying any until they do. (Their phone number is on the jar 800-442-0099 M-F 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern) OR OvaltineUSA.com<br /><br />Update: Just spoke with a Nestle rep. He says the vanilla they used in the batch I had was too strong, and they now have corrected that.  We'll see.  Also, he bragged that the new recipe has 12 vitamins (as opposed to the old recipe's 8 vitamins)  I had to point out to him that the new recipe may have 12 vitamins, but they all have only 10% of the RDA, whereas, of the old recipe's 8 vitamins, 5 had 45% of RDA, 1 had 50%, 1 had 60%, 1 had 15%, and they also list Calcium & Phosporous as 8% each (so that's 10 added vitamins).  He said he would tell the "marketing" person what I said.  I had hoped he'd tell the cook!  I'll try another jar with the coupon he's sending me, and then post an update.
