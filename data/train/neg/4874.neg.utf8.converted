I got this at the same time I got Davidson's Assam tea. While I love the Assam and would recommend it, I cannot say the same for this Earl Grey. There is a lemony citrus taste, not the smooth Bergamot flavor I am used to in a good Earl Grey. It is way too bitter because of this. I wish I could like it a bit more as the price was great, but nothing is good about the price when you cannot enjoy the product at any level.
