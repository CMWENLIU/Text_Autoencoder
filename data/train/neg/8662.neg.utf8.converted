How irresponsible that a reputable baby food producer like Gerber would add hydrogenated oil to a snack for toddlers!  After all we know about the health problems associated with trans fat -- cancer, diabetes, heart disease, infertility, even Alzheimer's -- why would we want to expose our children to these horrible diseases?<br /><br />This product should be recalled until Gerber straightens out the problem.
