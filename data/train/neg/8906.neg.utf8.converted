I have received two cartons of this macaroni so far.  The first had broken open in shipping and arrived with one flap hanging open.  Fortunately, all 20 boxes of macaroni were still in it, and only 3 or 4 of them somewhat damaged.  The second arrived taped together with clear plastic tape and only a little over half full, with eight boxes of macaroni missing and a couple of the remainder damaged.<br /><br />This macaroni is packaged too poorly to be shipped - in cartons just glued together, not particularly well.  It may be a good buy, and very welcome in the food pantry for which I order it, but I won't be buying it again.
