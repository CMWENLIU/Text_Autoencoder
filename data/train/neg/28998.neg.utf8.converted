I bought this online thinking that it will be cheaper but went to Costco the same day I received it and found the same jar and same Kirkland brand but less than 16 bucks. I paid 22. We bought a lot of candies for Sunday Easter. Maybe returning the most expensive ones and buying at Costco or Walmart, we'll still save money.
