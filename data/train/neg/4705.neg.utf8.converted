I tried the Lemon-Lime and is was ok but when I tried the Mango, it tasted ok but as I swallowed it, it began to burn all the way down my throat and into my stomach.  I did not have this problem with the other flavor and my husband did not have a problem with the Mango he drank.  Perhaps it was a bad bottle.  It has been over a week and with eating very bland light meals, my throat is finally feeling close to normal.  I'm sure this is a good product, I must have gotten a bad bottle.
