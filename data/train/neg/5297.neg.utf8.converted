I was going to buy the 3 pack Torani Sugar Free Caramel Syrup offer from Amazon, but decided to try one bottle first, from my local grocery store. Glad I did. The reviews are right, not sure how to put it, but the taste is "off". Kinda makes my coffee taste like ther're is a chemical in it. Kinda bummed, but glad I did not get 3 bottles! Stick with the sugar free vanilla, it is very good. Ill give another flavor a chance in the future, but Sugar Free Caramel is off the table for me.
