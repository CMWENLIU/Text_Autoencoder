When I first saw this product I was so excited that there was a sugar free option to this tasty candy.  I have had sugar free products containing Sugar Alcohol in the past, so I did not expect this product to effect me the way that it did.  The taste is great but the side effects are terrible.  About two hours after eating the recommended serving size I began having severe stomach cramps, as if I had taken a laxative.  Not too long after the cramps began I had to literally run to the restroom.  I thought that one trip to the restroom would have sufficed and proceeded to go to the gym...BIG MISTAKE!!!  Let's just say I had several trips to the restroom following my (what I thought was) a harmless snack.  This product is really not worth trying to satisfy your sweet tooth.  You are better off eating a peice of fruit!!
