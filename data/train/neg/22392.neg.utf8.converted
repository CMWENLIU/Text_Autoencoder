OH MY WORD are you SERIOUS... these were the BEST bars...i take the green drink packets on trips with me...and I eat these bars once or twice sometimes a DAY. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE when i happened to look at the calorie contents... 240!!! for the natural?????? it USED to be 162 have another bar right her to prove it. and the chocolate...used to be 175. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!!!!<br /><br />That said...if you see this as a meal bar, then great...250 calories for a snack after working out is a little much for a woman like me...but they are amazing taste and no hunger afterwards and you don't crash, really really great.  I just am really disappointed they had the calorie change and no response on their website or to the consumers as to why. I have loyally bought these for a long time....<br /><br />Take the calories into account, but without that context they are the best bars I have ever found, and I feel like I have tried everything!!
