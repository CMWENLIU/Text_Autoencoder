I have been receiving this jerky via subscribe and save for a long time now.  I just opened the second pouch out of my last order and there is mold on the jerky!  The sell by date is 8/28/13.  The first pouch I opened out of this case was fine.  I went to return it, but it is not eligible for return!  Needless to say, I will be canceling my subscription to this product and looking for another.  This is too expensive to risk waste because of mold.
