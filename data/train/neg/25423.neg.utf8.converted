I have had other freeze dried fruits (like brothers) and wanted to get some for snacks. These sounded more interesting so I bought them. Big mistake. They are disgusting. As soon as you put them in your mouth, they turn to paste and get stuck in your teeth. They are heavily bananas, instead of being a good variety. The package says they are all natural but the flavors on the fruits taste artificial and very acidic. Amazon doesnt take food back so these are all going in the trash
