I am disappointed. They work as advertised: quick, clean, and easy. However, more important to me is taste.<br /><br />While individually wrapped, the freshness of beans ground just for that moment is missing. The pod itself uses less coffee than I would in a single shot. Since I more often will make lungos, the sheer lack of coffee volume produces a weaker drink. Instead of pulling twice as long, I pull it 80% as long for a short shot, but it takes longer to get it all into the cup.<br /><br />The crema is impressive, equal to any regular Illy.<br /><br />The cost-per-drink is poor. I already knew this, but hoped I would be impressed enough by the quality so as to tolerate the price.<br /><br />I regular buy cans of illy's dark roast whole beans for grinding into espresso. These ESEs are not as good as the real thing. Because of the high standard illy otherwise supports for its products, I cannot give my full support to the illy Caffe Scura Coffee, Espresso, (Dark Roast, Black Band), 18-Count E.S.E. Pods.<br /><br />--Brockeim
