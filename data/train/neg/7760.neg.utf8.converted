Great almost expired bread,<br /><br />if only it would arrive with a little longer expiration date.<br /><br />SUGGESTION FOR YOU ALL: ONLY BUY ONE PACKAGE!<br /><br />The trouble is, I like to order several packages, and for some reason Amazon is sending out the bread with only very litte time till it expires.<br /><br />This style bread is supposed to hold for years, and is good to keep in stock for emergencies like hurricanes here in FL, or would be, if it would arrive from Amazon even half fresh!<br /><br />This time I got the bread with expiration date 01/2011 and 02/2011 I ordered in December 2010<br /><br />The expiration date, when it leaves from factory, and arrives to wholesale, surely is more than 2 weeks, probably has 1-2 years if not 5 years on it!<br /><br />I am getting the feeling you are buying some old expired wholesale bread cheap!<br /><br />I am hoping to order this bread in the future with at least 3, rather 6 months stamped expiring date on the package!<br /><br />this is SECOND TIME AMAZON is sending me OLD bread = bread that expires in 1-2 weeks<br />NOT HAPPY! It is only so much crisp bread a person can eat in a week or two<br /><br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Bad Bad deal!
