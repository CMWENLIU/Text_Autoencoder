Indeed, this nonsense product parading around like it's real cappuccino is right up there with that swill you get out of the gas station machine.  High in calories, low in quality, you get what you pay for.  I had to take and mix one of these with a cup of regular coffee to make it drinkable.  Granted, I've only had 2 cups of it but I'm going to give the rest of the box away.  Save yourself the disappointment and the money and avoid this garbage.
