I love Now Products and have always been pleased with the quality.  I am giving this product one star because somehow I missed in the ingredients list that this item contains rice maltodextrin - which is an issue for some folks which need to be gluten free (not sure based on the research if maltodextrin is gluten free for sure or not....) or for people who have issues with carbs or don't want to eat anything derived from corn, rice wheat (paleo, primal), and also, isn't adding maltodextrin to stevia kinda like mixing sugar with stevia?  Or am I wrong? Maybe it's added in for pouring ability.  Anyway, I am disappointed, I just wanted pure stevia.  I went with the Sweetleaf product after returning this.
