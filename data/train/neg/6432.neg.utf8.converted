This used to be about the greatest thing you could buy for less than $50. Really. What other product could you purchase and credibly say, "this is the best in the world"? Lindt 70 actually became difficult to find at the grocery stores I go to because the secret was clearly out. Now there's plenty, so Lindt screwed up the bottom line as well as on purist grounds. And for those of us with soy allergies, the change is of course a disaster, as it's practically impossible to locate chocolate or any other dessert without some form of soy. I'll spare the reader a review of the new recipe. Why bother? It tastes like every other mediocre or worse dark bar out there: waxy, non-descript, and let's face it, a little too "American," like American cheese is "American."<br />What should we do? A great gourmet store in Ellsworth, Maine (Rooster Brother)has the right idea. I hear the owner took one bite of the new recipe and sent the entire shipment back to Lindt. Perhaps other suppliers will take up the cause. Meanwhile, here's hoping that somebody at Lindt actually cares enough about quality and distinction to put the good old stuff back into production.<br />P.S. Amazon should change the image associated w/this to reflect the New Recipe packaging, lest people think we're dissing the old stuff.
