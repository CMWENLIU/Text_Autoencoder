Purchased one of these for our Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, a couple days after eating this he started vomiting and refusing food. Turns out he had to have surgery for a blockage in is small intestine. A piece of undigested jumbone was removed from his intestine. Do more research and you will find numerous cases of this. Please DO NOT BUY if you value your pet.
