My wife is a coffee drinker, I am not so I got this for her to try and her immediate impressions, it was terrible. She tried another of the illy issimo drinks and felt that tasted watered down, this however was strong but the taste was terrible. Now taste is all subjective so while she hated it you may like it. That being said she does love the starbucks drinks you can buy and this was not on-par with the taste of those according to her. I believe if she wants canned coffee in the future we'll be staying away from this brand.
