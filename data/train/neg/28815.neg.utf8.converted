These cookies came in what looked like good packaging. The box was undamaged and there was air filled padding inside. This leads me to believe the cookies must have been smashed before they were sent out. I was shocked to find only 3 at most whole cookies in the package. They were completely crushed. I was hoping to use them for a birthday celebration on Saturday too. I couldn't use them at all.  I paid way over retail price plus shipping and then realized I couldn't return them as food items. I feel ripped off. They don't even deserve one star!
