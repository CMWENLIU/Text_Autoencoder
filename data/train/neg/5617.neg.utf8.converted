This is the first time I had the opportunity to experience Taste Nirvana's Real Coconut Water and I must say what a disappointment. This has to be absolutely one of the worst products that is being marketed as Real Coconut Water. The very first thing I noticed when I opened the can was a chemical odor coming from the coconut water. This was the first indication that I knew I would not enjoy this product and probably was a waste of money. The second issue I had with this product was the taste was way off when compared to real coconut water actually comes from the tree.<br /><br />This product is a real waste...Zico, One and Vita Coco are way better products.
