I was recommended this product by a pet store employee who told me about the benefits of reducing carbs in my cat diet. Incidentally she also said that the best way to control litter box odors is by buying quality food like this. The smell of my cat's number 2s are absolutely horrendous. It is something the litter box cannot contain and it smells the entire apartment. It is something I cannot take and was glad that I bought the small bag.<br /><br />Incidentally my cat didn't seem to like it either. He would be hungry at dinner time and when this would be poured in would nibble at it. Or he would eat the wet food and leave this until he was forced to.  He has been sleeping much more and has been less playful.<br /><br />Never again!
