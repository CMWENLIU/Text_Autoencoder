Sorry but these things taste horrible and look even worse.  The packages are quite small too.  I had most of my family (seven of us) sample this and none of the kids could stomach it save one and they weren't eager to eat it more than the one time.  It was a terrible waste of money.  I suppose a very small child (under 2 years) who isn't capable of complaining or doesn't know any better might eat it but I can't believe the other reviewers can get anyone to eat this stuff.<br /><br />Sorry but it isn't mine or my families bag of fruit and I can only give it a rating based on my experience with it.
