The Matcha came promptly.  There is plenty of it.  Those are the positives.<br />The color of the Matcha looks nothing like the photo.  It is a deeper,  darker more muted green.  It tastes similar to what it looks-muddy,  sort of like dirty,  grassy, water.<br />I have purchased much higher quality Matcha at very reasonable prices ($18.00 for 8oz.) in Japanese markets in NYC and L.A.  I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute).<br />I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck!
