I have been drinking Twist Waters for over a year, buying them both at my local grocery and online to keep my supply steady. What a shock when the new bottles arrived with a new formula that made them virtually undrinkable. I am sad because I have loved these waters and now I will have to stick entirely with True Lemon products to provide some variety in my drinking water. Hint Water is too expensive although I love some of their flavors, too, and virtually unavailable in my Nashville area. True is more economical and tastes great. Twist Waters were my indulgence over sodas and other artificially sweetened waters. I loved the old Twist water flavors--especially the Lime and Strawberry--as well as the Pomengranate Blueberry and Mango Acai. Now they are all ruined. I won't be buying or drinking this brand again unless the old formula is returned. I prefer nine calories over calorie free Stevia based drinks that leave a bitter aftertaste.
