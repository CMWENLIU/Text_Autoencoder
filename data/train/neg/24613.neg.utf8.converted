Have to agree with bella voce. I've been using the KAL Stevia very happily for a couple of years. Saw this and did the math, and instead of 6 dollars (approximately) per ounce for the KAL, this worked out to a little more 3 dollars per ounce. Sounded good.<br /><br />Well, using the same small spoon that comes with the KAL Stevia (one of those nicely sweetens a good sized Cafe Americano or double shot of espresso), this Now brand Stevia was NOWHERE near as sweet. Had to use 2.5-3 times as much to get the same flavor. Also, and this is subjective, the flavor of the KAL tastes better to me.<br /><br />Still, it's Stevia, and not sugar or one of the artificial sweeteners, so it's got that going for it. But if you're looking at this as a bargain compared to the KAL, it's not: You get what you pay for.
