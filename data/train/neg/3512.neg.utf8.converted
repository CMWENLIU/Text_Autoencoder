This is not what I ordered. Indian spiced chai comes in a brown-orange type box. I can get it in the stores but the closest store is 2 hrs away. When I ordered this, it pictured the box I am used to buying. Now while boxes can change, the taste changed a well. In a tiny corner at the top it says "used to be indian spiced chai". I am now stuck with these boxes and had to travel 2 hrs to get what I wanted. By the way, I have ordered this before with no problem. NOT HAPPY at all as I wasted my money and Amazon does not refund for this type of product. Maybe they could send me a coupon torward a different purchase.<br />N
