This drink should get ZERO stars.<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased the Tassimo Suprema machine.  We mainly drink cappuccinos, but we were excited about some of the other drink options.  To add variety to our selection, we tried the Twinings Chai Latte T discs.  I was the first one to taste the chai latte.  I looked at my husband immediately and remarked, "It tastes like it has Splenda in it!" We were both incredulous at first, but then he tasted it as well.  It did taste like it had Splenda.  I took the packaging out of the garbage and read the ingredients of the Twinings Chai Latte.  To our very severe disappointment, the very last ingredient was sucralose.  My husband and I detest Splenda - it has an awful aftertaste and it gives us headaches.  We are extremely disappointed that Tassimo/Twinings decided to put Splenda in the Chai Latte recipe. We did not purchase our Tassimo system because we wanted low calorie drinks - and if the product contains Splenda IT SHOULD CLEARLY SAY SO ON THE PACKAGE. Furthermore, we are perplexed why, if this one product contains Splenda, there is no other Chai latte option.  Why in the world would someone want to spoil the wonderful taste of Chai with a manufactured sugar substitute like Splenda?  If customers ASK for a low calorie substitute, it should definitely be made available.  But why make your only version "low calorie?"<br /><br />We cannot bring ourselves to finish the rest of the package that we purchased - it tastes so awful. We're very disappointed that the money we spent on the package of Chai Latte T discs was wasted.  If we had seen on the packaging that it contained Splenda we would not have purchased it - we automatically assume that the sweetener is not artificial unless the label indicates otherwise - all customers do.<br /><br />Of course, if you don't mind the taste of Splenda then you might really enjoy this drink.  Otherwise, spend your money on something else - and make sure you read the ingredients before you buy it!
