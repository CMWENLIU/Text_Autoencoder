Ok folks, so I didn't listen to the other reviews about how poor this product was and decided to buy it anyways. My girlfriend likes hot cocoa, so I figured, what the hell, give it a try. Boy, the others were right. This stuff tastes foul. It doesn't even have a chocolate flavor at all, especially once you add the milk disc in. Really. This stuff is crap. If you want some, I will send you mine.
