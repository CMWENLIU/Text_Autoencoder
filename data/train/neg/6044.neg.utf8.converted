I do really enjoy many of the Walden Farm products, but this product taste really terrible in my opinion.  I am not a picky eater, but this product doesn't even taste like food.  The smell, texture, and taste are so way off, it's almost impossible to describe.  It's definitely a very artificial flavor, which wouldn't be so bad if it tasted in anyway like peanuts, but it doesn't even remotely taste like a nut of any kind. I tried mixing it with other things to mask the flavor, because most Walden Farm products don't taste great on their own, but are good mixed with the right foods. That didn't make it any more palatable, it just ruined whatever I mixed it with. Just know that you are taking a chance buying this product, you will either really like it or end up throw it in the trash like I did.
