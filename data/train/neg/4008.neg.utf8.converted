I can't tell who this is targeted to, but it doesn't seem to fit kids or adults, in my opinion.<br /><br />It's a small, skinny can - just 8.3 ounces, compared to a typical soda can at 12 ounces.  It's all juice and there's no sugar added, as promised.  But there's still 33 grams of sugar, compared to 35 grams in a full sugar version of regular Coca Cola.  They also aren't kidding about not full carbonation.  It's not exactly flat, but it's close to it, and it actually needs the carbonation to cut down on the sweetness.  This is some seriously thick-tasting juice to my palate.<br /><br />This is something like an amped up Welch's, according to my taste buds - slightly more complex tasting, but not as interesting as a Snapple or any one of the similar individually bottled fruit drinks out there.  It's hard to describe, but with a less sweet juice, you can pull the flavors apart and say, tell the kiwi and strawberry apart in the drink.  This isn't that kind of juice.<br /><br />The "black cherry" is made up of apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices - reconstituted - with filtered sparkling water, so it's not particularly bad stuff, but aside from the 100% daily dose of vitamin C you get, there's nothing here to recommend it over a glass of orange juice either.<br /><br />Sorry, if I want a carbonated fruit drink, I'd rather add ginger ale to a Snapple or Sprite to CranApple or something - this is just way, way too syrupy, even for a kids' drink.  Maybe it's being targeted as something convenient and fun for kids, but it's an awful lot of sugar for an alternative to soda.
