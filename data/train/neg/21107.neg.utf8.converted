It looks like puke, off white and grainy and probably tastes similar, too.<br />I can't find any peppers that I could recognize.<br />It looks like yogurt based sauce that anyone can throw together blindfolded.<br />It is very mild.<br />It has no recognizable flavor of any Indian spice.<br />Worst thing is that it is not returnable so I am stuck with it.<br />I will never by this brand again.
