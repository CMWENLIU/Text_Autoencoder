The coffee I received looked blended with something an had numerous burned beans and char. I have no hesitation calling it the worst Blue Mountain ever. I would NEVER buy from this seller again. A friend of mine bought some at the sane time I did and his package was the same. Dried out, burnt in some cases beans and a harsh stagnant flavor.
