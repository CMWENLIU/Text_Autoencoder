This product is not pure palm sugar and consumers need to be aware of this.  Amazon.com should be required to list the ingredients of all their food products, otherwise consumers don't know what they are truly buying.  This Thai Palm Sugar is mixed with white cane sugar and for consumers looking for a pure palm sugar, this product is very deceiving in it's name.  There is another palm sugar sold on Amazon.com that is pure, which i suggest for consumers who want an unadulterated palm sugar.
