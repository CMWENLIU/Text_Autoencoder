I received this order of Duke's Mayonaise today.  All four jars have a best used by date of 2/17/11 that's like in 2 weeks! Obviously they sent me the old stuff.  The jar I bought six mounths ago in a supermarket while in Maryland is still good till July 2011! I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again.
