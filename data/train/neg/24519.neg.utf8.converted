We have brown tiny ants all over our kitchen.  This didn't have any effect or make a dent in the population.  I put the entire can around where I saw them traveling, outside where I thought they might be getting in...everywhere.<br /><br />The only thing that finally worked was vinegar.  Way cheaper and safer too.
