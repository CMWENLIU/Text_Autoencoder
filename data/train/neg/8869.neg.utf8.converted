this is what we used to call honey cream. it tastes soooo processed to me and takes forever to dissolve in tea. Would be good with peanut butter I guess though the consistency is the same for both except pb is more spreadable. Maybe cooking. I thought I would try for the convenience of having it shipped but I'm back to my favorite bee guy and the organic farm - now thats GOOD raw honey
