I ordered two cases for my Mom who loved (past tense) this tea.  They really did not improve this product like they claim.  They took out the Hibiscus and added white tea "for a smoother taste".  It does not have the fantastic raspberry taste it used to have at all.  Now we have two cases that nobody wants to drink.  I did manage to scour my local grocery stores (7-8 of them) and find the last 5 boxes in my area.  All I can say is that I/we hope that Celestial Seasonings comes to their senses and goes back to the original formula.  And yes we did contact Celestial Seasonings and make complaints with them.  Why do companies have to go and mess up a good thing?
