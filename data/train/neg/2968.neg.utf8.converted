I purchased a bottle of this in 2/12. Expiration date on the bottle was 9/1/12 so it wasn't sitting on the shelf forever or something.<br /><br />Absolutely no relation flavor-wise to beet juice.... more like Goldenseal. Absolutely bad bad icky.<br /><br />I thought that maybe the storage or concentration process did that to the juice so I bought some dried beet juice.<br /><br />The rehydrated dried beet juice tasted like.... surprise! Beets.<br /><br />I don't know what the story is with the flavor, but the guy at the health food store had told me to buy the dried kind instead of this because "people preferred it" and I should have listened.<br /><br />If the manufacturer reads this and wants to dispute the review please contact me and send me a sample of what this product SHOULD have tasted like and I would be happy to modify this. But from the expiration date I suspect this was supposed to taste like it did.
