Like many other people here, I bought this based on a lightning deal on the site.  Even at a sale price, this wasn't worth it!  I was hoping this would be a dessert for 4-5 people, but it is barely a snack for 2 people.<br /><br />There is a lot of cardboard and air in this "gift tower".  The portions are small, and packaged like in-flight snacks.  The few pieces there were tasty, but it was mostly a let-down.<br /><br />Based on this, I'll just stick to regular "non-gift" samplers from now on.
