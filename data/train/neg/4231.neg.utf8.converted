I like white cheddar.  I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting.  I like soy.  I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.<br /><br />But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack?  It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.<br /><br />As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours.
