I previously read submitted reviews, and I should have listened.  Especially to the one that stated he didn't get the organic product shown in the picture.  I too did not get the organic product.  I have seen it in the stores, and it has a much lower sodium content per serving.  I haven't been able to find it in a while so I thought I would buy it through Amazon.<br /><br />The product was the old stuff with an expiration date of 6 months from now.  Usually the product in the store carries and expiration date of a year, so that tells you something right away.<br /><br />The noodles are okay.  My family is not that particular, so it's a good side dish on ocassion.  If you are an expert on peanut noodles, this dish is not for you.  It's slightly gummy and thick.
