This is a poor excuse for a gopher trap. I have lots of gophers and have used other traps. I recently bought 8 (four sets) of these traps. They are ill designed. The gophers are able to trip them without getting caught and have even managed to push the set trap out of the hole. The problem is the sweep of the pincers is too wide and the mechanism too easily clogged with sand or dirt. Don't bother with these traps.
