I bought the Kashi GOLEAN cereal from Amazon because I couldn't find it at my local grocery store the last time I went...<br /><br />I really like the cereal, it was the packaging for shipping that is getting the bad review:<br /><br />The boxes were all taped together with packing tape, and the tape ran accross the top of all of the boxes, rendering the resealable closing tab on the top of the box useless, as it basically had to be ripped off to get the tape off of the top of the boxes.  The same thing happened along the sides, now I have 6 boxes of Kashi with half of the box ripped and destroyed, including the nutrition facts on the side.
