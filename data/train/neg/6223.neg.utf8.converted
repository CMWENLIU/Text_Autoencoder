I bought this product n hopes of an easy and less expensive way to make crab cakes. It always takes so long to crack the crab open and the cost of fresh crab is also a drawback.<br /><br />When I opned the product is was almost as minched as tuna. no crab chucnks and it had a bad seafood smell. I tried opening another can and the same thing. I was to leary to make the crab cakes out of this product (we were having company over) so I had to run to the store and buythe real crab to be safe.<br /><br />I was hoping this would be good, but I am sticking to fresh o crab or refrigerated products like this.
