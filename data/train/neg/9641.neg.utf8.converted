I've owned a couple of these for several years, and have had to repeatedly replace the upright support arm (about $15 a pop about once a year). The arm has two copper-covered contacts which erode (NOT corrode) to the point where the copper covering entirely disappears. The company REFUSES to acknowledge this problem, so I've left there customer pool for good, and mm spending my time and money researching far, far cheaper alternatives using good old aquarium air pumps and air stones, soda bottles and LEDs -- you can get LED grow lights now that work in regular lamps. (I'll probably also try a hack involving the old basins from the AG 7-pod units, but -- now that the upright arms are worthless -- using an external aquarium air pump and air stone, and a separate LED. You can find other self-contained table-top hydroponic systems for less than half the cost of these, if you don't want to goof around with soda bottles. Yeah, the AGs are spiffy gadgets (until the copper connections fail), but the Customer Service stinks, and you can do everything this does on your own for much, much less cash.
