My children and I have eaten Annie's macaroni & cheese for over ten years and loved it. So it was to my dismay when I began to notice in the last year that the flavor was obviously reformulated to be much weaker. The directions were also reconfigured. It used to be 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of milk; now it calls for 1/4 cup of milk, which is why the outcome is so runny and yucky. My children have never eaten Kraft mac & cheese, so we were comparing the difference in taste with the original Annies. I honestly expect that my family will wean themselves of Annies mac & cheese because the flavor is that disappointing and bland.
