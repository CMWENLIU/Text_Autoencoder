First let me say I'm a health nut most of the time.  I eat fat free popcorn, fat free butter, fat free cheese, I use artificial sweeteners and I get the leanest meat I can at the super market.  The problem I had with this cereal is that it's way too dry and has no real flavor.  If you look at the label it's 100% all natural and it tastes and feels that way.  I added a bunch of artificial sweetener to my cereal and I struggled to put it down.  I love the super market healthy cereals that have granola, nuts, raisins but this is for the super hearty folks I guess.  I have a 1/2 of bag still and I think the rest is literally going to the birds.  My honest review and I review items less than 1% of the time.  I just had to post something other than a 4 or 5 star for something I just did not like.<br /><br />Taste = 1.5 outta 5  / Too Bland literally tasteless<br />Price = 2.5 outta 5 / Good price too base taste is lacking<br />Recommend = No / Even a health nut has his limitations<br />Buy Again = No / Sorry, I can't do it!
