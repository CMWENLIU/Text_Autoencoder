I have two vines producing passion fruit in my yard, and can't seem to get enough of the stuff. I was excited to find this syrup until I actually tasted it. The syrup tastes fine, but very little like passion fruit. The strongest flavor note is pear, with a vaguely tropical flavor underneath. Decent, but not at all what I expected.
