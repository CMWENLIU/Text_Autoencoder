I had fed my springer spaniel and english setter Innova for 6 years, and they never itched.  However Naturapet, maker of Innova dog food was recently sold to Proctor & Gamble in June of 2010.  Shortly thereafter, both my dogs were furiously biting at their shins and feet in July and August 2010.  After several vet trips and medications (benadryl, steriod, antifungal) did not work, we switched to A Taste of the Wild dog food.  13 days later, the dogs are no longer itching.  This is not a coincidence - I believe either the ingredients or sourcing of ingredients changed when Innova was sold to P&G causing a severe food allergy for both my dogs.  I will never feed Innova again.
