I ordered this product on June 27, 2012 and received it June 29. The best by date stickered on the package is "030712". Assuming traditional month-day-year dating, that's almost four months past. Even if it's day-month-year dating, it's still close. I would not have even questioned the age of the product if the sticker wasn't there, but why add a 'best by' sticker if it's not needed...and why send it out if it's out of it's freshness period? Because I'm not the one consuming the product, I can't say if the product is bad or not, but I did notice that so far only ONE out of three of the treats I've used actually fits in the Romp n Chomp bone that I bought it for. This totally defeats the purpose of challenging the dog and giving him a treat that takes time to consume when I leave. Instead he grabs the refill treat and wolfs it down. Disappointing since he otherwise likes the bone. I'd hoped to be able to use it as intended with a treat insert once in awhile.
