These are not premium ingredients, glutens are not something I feed my dogs, and the poultry is not one of the first ingredients...I'll stick with pizzles, tendons, raw bones...that actually do clean teeth.<br /><br />Everlasting Treat Ingredients: Wheat Gluten, Gelatine, Water, Glycerin, Poultry Meat and Bone Meal, Natural Flavoring, Corn Gluten Meal, Garlic Powder, Brewer's Yeast, Lecithin, Sodium Diacetate, Vegetable Gum, Titanium Dioxide, and Natural Coloring.
