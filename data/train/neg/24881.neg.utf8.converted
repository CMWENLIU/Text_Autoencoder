Mine worked for a while, but then seemed to start to stick, which made it impossible to pump anymore.  I tried soaking the entire mechanism several times in soap and water, but it still doesn't work.  I initally liked the clicking feature and sleeker design of this model, but have gone back to using the old version, since this one stopped working.
