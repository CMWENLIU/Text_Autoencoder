I just burned my finger while i was trying to hold this failed cup noodle. There was a hole on the side, so the hot water leak out and burn my finger. i would never buy or eat any nissin cup noodle. i mean how fail can the company be in order to make a cup noodle with tiny hole on the side, so your customer can burn their hand. FAILED
