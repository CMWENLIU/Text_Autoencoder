I wanted to write a review to let folks know that these are duck LIVER treats, not duck meat. I bought these before the review posted by "vivere" who also warns folks of this. It is very unfortunate that this ingredient information is not listed for this product, it's important for buyers to know.<br /><br />I did not want another liver treat for our dogs. I wanted regular meat because you can only use a few liver treats per day for a dog. So, while you can use these as a treat, you really wouldn't want to use a large quantity for a larger training session.<br /><br />Anyway, other than the issue of this treat being liver.... Our dogs love them. But, even if they were meat, I would not order again because they are too "crushed" in the package. There was a significant amount of "dust" instead of treat bites in our bag. Amazon packaged it well, with plastic pillows, but I think the product soft-side packaging just doesn't protect it well enough. For our standard liver treats, we buy  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Stewart's Pro-Treat 21 ounce Tub Freeze Dried Dog Treats, Beef Liver by MiracleCorp/Gimborn</a> that come in a hard bucket that helps protect the treats from destruction.  Of course, the reason I didn't want more liver treats is because I already have this one liver treat, and that's plenty.<br /><br />I'm rating this 2 stars because it is different from the standard treats, therefore our dogs love them as a special reward (e.g. used for recall command).  But, I feel like I have to rate this lower because of the lack of ingredient information. It's an important missing fact.<br /><br />Hope this info helps.<br />c-
