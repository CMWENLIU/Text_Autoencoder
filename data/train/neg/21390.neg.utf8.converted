While the ingredients may be organic and healthy, the soup is bland and impossible to eat without having to basically re-make it. It has no flavor at all, except perhaps a nagging sweetness from the corn. If you are interested in a savory treat or something healthy AND delicious, then find something else, or be ready to whip out your pot and start over. I'll never buy this again. The only reason it gets an extra star is because it's good for you, but that is its Only redeeming quality.
