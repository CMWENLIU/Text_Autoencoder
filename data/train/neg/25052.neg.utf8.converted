I just got this drink at the retail store I work at. This drink doesn't even deserve 1 star. I can honestly say this is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. It was so bad, I kept it to let my friends taste and share my worst drink experience ever. After tasting this, I immediately went online to see all of the hilariously bad reviews. It's labeled a Thirst Quencher. It's more like a gateway drink because it makes you want to immediately drink something else to get the taste out of your mouth. The #1 ingredient should say vomit because that is what you are highly inclined to do. This is worse than cancer.
