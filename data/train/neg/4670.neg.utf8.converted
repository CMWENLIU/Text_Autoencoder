I have heard these are so tasty and great.  The whole box I received had gone bad.  All the chocolate was old, when chocolate is old and goes bad it starts turning a white-ish color.  Every bar had turn  ed in color to the faded color,,,,, I even tried to eat one anyway thinking maybe it would taste fine and had I had to spit it out.<br /><br />Awful
