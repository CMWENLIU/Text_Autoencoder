Having purchased the Soulistic "Gelee" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the "Gravy" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.
