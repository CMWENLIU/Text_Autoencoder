I had used this product and my dog loved it and it relaxed him. HOWEVER, I realized it was made in CHINA, where there have been catastrophic problems with the quality of the ingredients (especially the chicken) that has caused fatalities.<br />This item was sold in a store that claimed it no longer sold items from China and I am very disappointed.  This website of course does not make that claim, but it is difficult to see the miniscule print on the packaging that says 'Made in China' given that all the other print is very large and clear making it look like a top quality product.<br />I will not be buying Mellow Mutt again unless it is wholly manufactured here in the United States. Choose wisely, your dog trusts you.
