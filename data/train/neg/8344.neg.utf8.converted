I've tried a lot of things in the name of lower calories, but I couldn't even finish one spoonful of this stuff. Definitely better to eat a regular serving of low fat frozen yogurt that is tasty and satisfying for 100 or so calories than an entire pint of this for 150.  Maybe I picked the wrong flavor, but it was horrible.
