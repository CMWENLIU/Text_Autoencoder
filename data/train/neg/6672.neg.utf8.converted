I've been drinking Amazing Grass' Chocolate version for months and just ADORE it.  I decided to try the Mango Amazing Meal and was very turned off by the texture and flavor.  I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!
