This peanut butter contains added sugar, which is not what I'm looking for in a "natural" peanut butter.  Additionally, they remove some of the peanut oil and replace it with palm oil, which is cheaper and environmentally suspect in its harvesting.  I understand that these are all products that are of a nature-based origin, but adding ingredients to something that is already quite natural (blend your peanuts - you've got peanut butter!) makes it not natural in my eyes.
