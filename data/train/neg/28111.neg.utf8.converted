I got a simple philosophy with food.  If the food is bad for you, it better taste good.  Why else eat something loaded with carbs and fat?  These cookies follow the model of bad-tasting and bad-for-you, so why eat it?<br /><br />Don't be tricked.  These things are packaged as "gourmet," are from a small company that made me believe it was some small but caring mom-and-pop company, and who doesn't love flan?  I can't see how these are gourmet considering how bad they taste, maybe the company is caring but the cookies don't taste like it, and the best things about flan are the texture and the decadent sweet fatty taste.  You don't get any of it with this.<br /><br />These cookies taste like there's too much flour.  They're like butter cookies where someone took out 1/2 the sugar and put in too much flour.  It's got a pasty texture and the taste doesn't compare to real flan.  The closest comparison I can give is they taste like bad shortbread. If figure if something is going to be close to flan in cookie-form, it's got to be real flan put into some type of pastry to keep it from falling apart.  These cookies are just pasty and dry.
