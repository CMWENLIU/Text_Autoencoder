I was very excited when I read reviews about the product. I read about the product with an expiration code of March 2013 will be BPA free.I waited for a while to order this product for that reason.<br /><br />All cans I received were "Expired January 2013", and yes, it is BPA liner in.<br /><br />Maybe the Amazon warehouse had a lot of stock of the products, but I could not believe the canned food I received has expire date within 6 months.
