These look, smell, and taste vile.  I try each food first before I give it to my baby and have been very happy with all of the Earth's Best varieties we've tried so far. The bananas however are quite disgusting.  It could be the citric acid used, but it smells and tastes like it is spoiled.  I have been feeding fresh banana up to this point, but bought a 12-jar variety pack of fruit which included banana, so I decided to try it today.  So much for saving money by purchasing the variety pack.  I will be throwing away all four jars of the banana.  I will not feed anything to my baby that I wouldn't eat myself.  Like one of the other reviewers said:  do not stock up on this before you try one jar first.  It's just nasty.  I wouldn't give it any stars if that was an option here.<br /><br />Update:  I still won't buy these bananas again, but I wanted to say that I contacted Earth's Best to complain.  They ended up sending me coupons for a dozen free jars of baby food.  So, I just wanted to add that I really am happy with the company.  Just not this particular product.
