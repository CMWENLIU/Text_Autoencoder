I was very disappointed with this product. I ordered it because it was highly recommended on the Food Network and also on the Travel Channel. I did not think the cake had much rum taste (sort of like it had been sprinkled very lightly with the Carbbean rum) and it was much more dense than I thought it would be. I tried "doctoring" it up a bit with more liquor, whipped cream, etc without success. Although one could eat it, it was not the best and I wound up throwing half of it out. I would suggest saving your money and making your own Bacardi Rum cake. You will be much happier with the product.
