I bought these crackers and I did not find anything "natural" about them. What is "natural" about "enriched unbleached flour"? Some manufacturers think we the buyers are too ignorant to tell the difference. When I read the list of ingredients (that the manufacturers conveniently hide from the online buyer) I was appalled. I will never buy these UNnatural, WHITE flour crackers with a little amoung of added vitamins of those that were removed when the flour was refined. On top of the poor quality and the misleading information provided, 70% of them were smashed to pieces. If you are really looking for natural, healthy crackers, look somewhere else.
