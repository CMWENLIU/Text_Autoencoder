I bought some because I love mac and cheese, and lived off the kraft ones in college. However, I became concerned about the laundry list of chemicals kraft uses,including Yellow # 5. This box uses annatto and beta carotene for coloring.<br /><br />Its difficult to put in words what this taste like. On one hand its utterly bland and flavorless, yet it also leaves a weird sharp chemical like aftertaste in your mouth. I've tried the white cheddar one as well and it had a similar taste. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I like the fact that it does not use yellow #5 for coloring, but I don't think I'll be giving Annie's pasta another chance.
