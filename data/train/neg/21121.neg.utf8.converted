I was excited to get this product for review.  Yes, I am a sucker for nuts, raisins, and walnuts.  To have all three in a yummy chewy bar sounded like heaven.  Then I looked on the back of the package.<br /><br />Carbs.  TONS and TONS of carbs.  Now, I admit I am biased since I have Type C Diabetes.  But it is because of my diabetes that I check labels.  Pamela's may SAY that these bars are healthy, and the ingredients listed are pretty good -- but it was the carbs and sugar contents of each bar that deterred me from being able to fully enjoy my sample.<br /><br />Size.  Pamela's Products Whenever Bars are small.  Very, very small.  The bar itself is chewy and tastes great.  I don't agree that it would keep a person from being hungry or that it could be used as a meal.  Did I mention that the bar was tiny?<br /><br />Price.  These babies are expensive.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the couple of bites I was able to experience, the excess of carbs in each tiny bar and the expensive retail price will definitely keep me from buying more.<br /><br />Natalie S.
