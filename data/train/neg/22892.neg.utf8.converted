I'm tempted to leave a video review of the sounds coming out of my intestines from these.  I had 20 of these delicious little guys before bed last night.  Then, I had to wake up every 2 hours to sit on the toilet and have them spray out of me. Do yourself a favor - unless you are buying these as some tool of revenge for a cheating boyfriend or arch-enemy DO NOT BUY THESE. I have been dealing with constant diarrhea for 18 hours because I had around 20 gummy bears.<br /><br />It's not worth it.  Just buy regular gummy bears.
