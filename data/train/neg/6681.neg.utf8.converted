These crackers taste great and we like that they are organic. However, the texture is too soft to make it through shipping. We buy and enjoy other Late July products at the local branch of a popular grocery store that features lots of imports and organics, such as their cheese flavored and whole grain crackers. Perhaps if that store carried this type they'd be okay to purchase from there, but when we opened the case of these that arrived on our doorstep from Amazon, about half the crackers in each box had been reduced to fine crumbs during shipping.
