I really enjoy organic foods, so when I came upon this item I was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially Newman's Own, a brand I've liked in the past.  I have to agree with the other poster, the popcorn is bland and almost flavorless.  There are other brands of organic popcorn that I've found more recently that are far better.  Don't waste your money on such a vast amount of product!!!  I would suggest even making your own popcorn- it is still going to be healthier than this and you can flavor as you like so it will taste much better than this!
