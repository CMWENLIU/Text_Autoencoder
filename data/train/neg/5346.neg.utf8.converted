I bought this product because of appreciation of a tin heather tea (loose leaves).  I couldn't find a same one around but found this tea bag package. Because of my trust to the company I just bought it.  Unfortunately, the product is not as good as I expected.  Most importantly, the tea bags are in paper bags, which are in a soft cardboard box, not sealed so that the tea has lost its favor.  Secondly, I don't see as much heather flowers as they were in the tin heather tea I use to have.  Too bad the package include 4 boxes I can never consume them.
