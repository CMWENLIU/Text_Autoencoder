Before I get into my commentary about the Orijen 6 Fish, I have to say that I have fed my dogs and cats raw for many years. We bought a 9 week old Pekingese recently from a breeder. She provided us with a 2-3 week supply of the food. I went ahead and fed it because I didn't want to change it too fast. His stools were big, soft and stinky. I found a shop that was selling it here and went out there. By coincidence they were going to have an Orijen rep there. So I talked with the rep who said that a puppy shouldn't be eating the 6 Fish and he recommended a puppy mix. I bought it and took it home. Basically I had the same results. I switched him to raw. I think  he has a bit of a nervous stomach as he has a few problems but nothing like with the  Orijen.<br /><br />I have read a lot of 5 Star reviews from people who seem to be conscientious and observant. I have also read some 1 and 2 Star Reviews from people who also seem that way. The only thing I have to say is that it is not for everybody.
