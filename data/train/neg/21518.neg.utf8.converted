This stuff smells bad,and looks worse. My cat will eat anything and is not finicky. She was hungry but wouldn't eat it. We disposed of it, and replaced it with another Newmans Chicken product. She disposed of it quickly. I now have 23 tins of useless stuff. Normally, I try before I buy in quantity, but I thought the brand would be safe.
