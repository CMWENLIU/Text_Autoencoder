Rather disappointed in Amazon... This is not "Comvita" honey but"Kiwi Kosher Parve" and does NOT taste like Manuka honey whatsoever. It is cheap for Manuka but expensive for the regular honey it actually is. I guess that he problem is that hey changed the source and kept the ratings for the old, Comvita product, which is incorrect practice from Amazon... I ate Comvita brand Manuka honey before and it definitely tastes better than this one!<br /><br />It is incorrect practice changing the product and keeping the ratings for the old one.
