We have been buying Senseo Dark Roast for years.  Lately the quality has been varying - in batchA599269100 with a date of 11-24-12 - the resulting cups vary from great to watery.  Having used the Senseo for so many years, we can recognize when the coffee is going to be weak by the color of the flow.  The color varies from very light to dark in the middle of the process.  With the above mentioned batch the majority of the outputs has been light tan throughtout the run.<br /><br />This has happened once before.  We maintain our Senseo so the quality is not affected by the condition of the Senseo Unit.  Since I also have another Senseo at work, I took the pods to work to test.  Same result - watery coffee.<br /><br />I just bought 18 packages of dark roast if I continue to see watery coffee, then I guess its time to change from Senseo into another process.
