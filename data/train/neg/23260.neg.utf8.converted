This is labeled: "Great River Organic Milling 100% Organic Bread Flour Unbleached Wheat"<br />This I evidently mistook to be ordinary bread flour made from wheat. What I got was 20 pounds of Whole Wheat Flour which I have no need for and can not return.<br /><br />The label should have read: Unbleached Whole Wheat Bread Flour.
