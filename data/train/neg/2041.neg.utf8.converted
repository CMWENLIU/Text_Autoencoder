Yes, this formula does reduce the amount of spit up.... but at what cost? This formula caused my poor daughter to be so constipated that she cries every time she poops. She also pushed so hard that I found blood in her diaper! And it took her half an hour to finish only 4 oz because it's so thick and frothy! I just returned a bunch of this formula and bought Similac Sensitive for Spit Up, that has much better reviews in regards to it's effectiveness and no constipation. It only comes in Ready to Feed but it's worth the extra money not to see my baby in pain all day! I would not recommend this formula for any baby!
