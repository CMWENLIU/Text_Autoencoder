I ordered this item and paid extra for two day expedited service and it arrived six days later! The whole timing of the gift, which is pretty much like flowers, was lost! I am sorry for the money I paid, and will not order any Candy Depot products again.  Thirty three and a half dollars, completely wasted.  I'll try flowers next time!
