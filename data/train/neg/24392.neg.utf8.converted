I thought I was getting K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer but instead this was nothing more than packets of hot chocolate mix to add to my hot water.  I don't need a special brewer for this and the chocolate is the same as if I'd bought the regular Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix.  Granted, Ghirardelli makes really good hot cocoa but don't spend the extra money just because the description says "specially designed for Keurig".<br /><br />I haven't tried them yet, but Green Mountain has recently come out with real hot cocoa K-Cups.  I just ordered a box from another website and if Amazon carries them later, I'll let you know if they're good.
