This is not a bad apple snack - definitely not crispy, but not rubbery like dried apples. I thought the taste and texture were quite nice. My problem, like many others, is that the product comes from China. The various scandals involving the use of toxic or otherwise harmful chemicals (most notably in baby formula scandal) has shown that the country's regulatory system is simply not up to guaranteeing the safety of their products.<br /><br />Therefore, while I did like this product, I will not eat it again, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone. Check the back of your food's packaging, and avoid products made by countries who do not ensure the safety of their products.<br /><br />(Review of Brothers-ALL-Natural Fuji Apple Crisps)
