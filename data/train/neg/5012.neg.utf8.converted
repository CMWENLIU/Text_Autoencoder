This is our favorite Crystal Light flavor! While we down gallons of it during the summer, we also drink it year-round as a flavor enhancer for our nasty-tasting tap water. However, the Amazon.com price of $22 (for 4 pkgs) is WAY more (almost twice as much!) than the $2.79 per pkg that I pay in the grocery store. Would love to buy it in bulk on Amazon.com, but it has to be a better buy!
