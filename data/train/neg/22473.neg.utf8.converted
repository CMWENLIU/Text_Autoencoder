So many people, usually diabetics, buy sugar free cookies/snacks "because they can't have sugar".  These may not have sugar, but they have sugar alcohols which DO affect blood sugar, and they're mostly white flour which gets turned into glucose quickly.  These cookies have more calories and more carbs per biscuit than the regular ones!  The regular ones are actually not bad in the carb/sugar department (3g total carb per biscuit, 1.6g is sugar) and you don't have to worry about unpleasant gastric side effects from sugar alcohols.<br /><br />If you're thinking of buying these because you're diabetic, do yourself a favor and get the regular kind and account for the carbs which will be LESS than the sugar free ones.  Unless you're going to be a total pig and eat the entire package it won't make a difference.  I have Type 1 diabetes and count carbs, and I take the appropriate amount of insulin for however many biscuits I'm going to eat.  The regular Kedem biscuits are fantastic with a hot cup of tea, and you couldn't pay me to eat the sugar free kind which would affect my blood sugar even more than the regular ones.<br /><br />Oh, and the sugar free biscuits are more than twice the price of the regular ones.
