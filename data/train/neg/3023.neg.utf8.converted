Not only did it get to me after several weeks but the amount was so much smaller than anticipated as the jar was 3/4 filled. I can go to the most expensive gourmet food purveyor in Los Angeles and get better quality salt from Il de Re for far less money. Also, there are far better quality Il de Re versions of this salt. It is not white and flaky as it should be but grey with large crystals.  Poor quality, slow to send, expensive. Never again
