The verbage on the ad read "try 25 different flavors without buying 25 boxes!" My bag (Yes, it was just a paper grocery sack with a bunch of k-cups tossed in) only had 10 different flavors. And of the 35 k-cups I received, 25 were 1 of 3 flavors (Green Mountain french vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge, and Caramel Vanilla Creme). Then there were 1 or 2 of a few other flavors thrown in.<br />I contacted Amazon Customer service, who was very helpful and directed me to the seller directly since Deals for You is a 3rd party seller. They emailed me back and said that they had just changed the ad, that when I ordered (a week prior) the ad didn't specify 25 different flavors (it did, I specifically checked that and ordered because of that promise). They then blamed the issue on Amazon, saying Amazon puts these orders together and they can't control it. So they lied to me, called me a liar, misrepresented their product, and then refused to do anything to make the situation right when it was called to their attention.<br /><br />I have never left a negative review on this site, but after the service I received here, I have left negative reviews for both the seller and product.
