I agree with another reviewer, Silverdrake: this is NOT "almond butter," it is an almond spread made with almond butter AND palm oil, sugar and salt. If they just call it "Barney Butter" with a sub-text of "a tasty almond-butter-based spread" I would not have purchased it.<br />I didn't see the fine print, which is my bad...however, they should change their label...and Amazon should change their description.<br />I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it IS tasty...but it is more of a dessert than it is a healthy alternative to natural peanut butter (which IS 100% peanuts, by comparison). If they re-labelled it and sold it as a spread, I'd give it 3 stars (because it is too pricey for a spread, even though it does taste good).<br />People wanting real almond butter would be better-served by the real thing eg <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SHYCQQ">Maranatha Natural Almond Butter 26oz Lightly Roasted</a>
