So I just received my 2 bottles of this stuff...  I looked at the ingredients list... you will not believe what I read....<br /><br />So the first 4 ingredients that Amazon list for this are: "Red Raspberry Puree, Blackberry Puree, Beet Sugar, Tea Infusion"<br /><br />Sounds good right? Yes, that is why I bought it because the first 2 ingredients are fruit puree.<br /><br />So this is what the first 4 ingredients on the actual package are:<br /><br />"INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, WATER, SEEDLESS BLACKBERRY PUREE, SEEDLESS RED RASPBERRY PUREE"<br /><br />guess what the 5th ingredient is?  "NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"<br /><br />some other ingredients on my packaging that aren't listed on Amazon are "CELLULOSE GUM, MALIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE, CARRAGEENAN, GUAR GUM, XANTHAN GUM, RED #40 AND BLUE #1"<br /><br />Hold on a second!!!  That is a HUGE difference, I thought I was buying a product that was mostly puree with some "beet sugar" to sweeten it but instead I bought 2 large bottles of Sugar with water in it and a small amount of fruit puree added, and then artificial flavoring!  Bait and switch technique for sure!  Amazon.... why????
