This is actually instant coffe in a k-cup.  I was so irritated that I was sold instant coffee under deceptive practices that I informed Amazon how unhappy I was.  They immediately refunded my money and I threw the coffee out!  Maybe if enough people let Amazon know how unhappy they are they will stop selling this brand.
