The unpleasant smell and greasy appearance were apparent as soon as the can was opened. The caution to not overcook was too late; it already bordered on mush. The vegetables had lost their colors and texture. I didn't know an unground garbonza could be mushy, but they were. It was difficult to imagine why a no-meat soup was SO greasy, and even more difficult to understand why veggie-bean soup needed any kind of vinegar, and this stuff was loaded with the Balsamic variety. I managed to eat 3 spoonfuls before tossing the rest. I will never again subject myself to Amy's GROTESQUE SOUP. I give this a one-star rating because the system will not accept a no-star rating.
