i was very excited, i love coffee, i mean i love it.  my first hint was the beans did not shine with their oils nor did the smell excite me.  second hint, it is just AVERAGE coffee it didn't blow my sox off at all, will not buy again, will attempt to return the second package also.  it is possible this seller sent me old product.
