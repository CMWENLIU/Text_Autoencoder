My dogs love these treats and by reading the label you think they are wonderful.<br />HOWEVER in really really really small print at the bottom of the package, it says made in China. I don't trust anything made in China and will not be buying this product again.<br />Seems Dogswell is not proud of this fact and aware it is a problem also, otherwise why would it be in such small print and at the bottom of the package?<br />Maybe if everyone complained about a product from China, DOgswellwould be forced to have it made here in the USA. Its not like its low cost or anything.
