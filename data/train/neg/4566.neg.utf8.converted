The shipping from Amazon was great as usual.  However the product I received was not.  These truffles were almost past the expiration date and obviously had be stored in a non-climate controlled place.  The chocolate had been melted and the peanut butter nugat inside had melted down to blob in the bottom of the sphere.  These truffles were not a bargin at the price I paid for them. I will buy my next ones locally where I can be assured they will be what I am paying for and not something somebody is trying to get rid of.
