My wife tried Cutter Advanced over a period of 2--3 weeks, and found it to be completely without any mosquito repellent qualities, despite slathering the spray on in hourly doses.<br />Today,I got Deep Woods Off with 25% DEET, and THAT product worked well,no mosquitoes or other bugs even landed on her. I called our local Agway and told them what they had sold us<br />was useless,the Manager said ours was the first complaint he had heard.<br /><br />However it works for other people,it sure didn't work at all for us. Deep Woods Off 25% was very effective, and next year we'll try the Avon Lady's "Skin So Soft" which is supposed to be even more effective. Maybe I'll mix up a combination of that Avon, plus some DEET 100% and REALLY get something worth putting on..
