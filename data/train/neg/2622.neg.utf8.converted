I would have given these zero stars but, they are organic and that is important to me. Which is why I bought them. However, they don't taste very good and 30% of them were broken out of the package. The rest broke when you filled them even after following the directions. Until I find another organic taco shell, I'm stuck with these. Also, 144 taco shells is a bit much, my husband thought I was crazy.
