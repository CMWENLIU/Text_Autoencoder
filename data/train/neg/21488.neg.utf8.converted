We had a horrible infestation from a contaminated sweater that was a birthday gift.  We knew we had moths, found three nests with thousands of eggs and hundreds of pupations, and a horde of adults...none of the adults went in the trap.  We caught not a single moth. Don't waste the hope, time, or money on this product.
