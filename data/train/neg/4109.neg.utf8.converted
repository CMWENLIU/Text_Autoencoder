I've been drinking loose leaf tea for several years now and I appreciate the variety of this sampler but this is not high quality tea. Many of the teas have the same underlying smokey taste when they shouldn't.  It will do in a pinch but I don't think experienced tea drinkers will be pleased.  I moved from a large city to a rural area so I decided to try a different product since I no longer have access to the quality loose leaf tea a large city offers. I will not purchase again.
