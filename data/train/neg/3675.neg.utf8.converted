Decided to try this on the Vine.<br />It tastes like weak strawberry flavored koolaid.  It would even be better if mixed with soda water to give it some kind of soft drink appeal.  I tried serving it to the rest of my family including kids and not a single glass was more than half consumed.  Save your money and try another kind/flavor.  I keep 'sticks' of lemonade flavored Crystal Light in my purse.  This is so disappointing in comparison.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect green tea to taste strong like black tea, but the tea in this drink is virtually flavorless.<br /><br />Bottom line:  wouldn't buy it again.
