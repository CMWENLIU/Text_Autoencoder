I bought this product believing it to be a healthy product.  While it may be healthy, the salt does not dissolve--or maybe it's sand others have referred to.  Eating a casserole or pasta dish with this salt is horrible--it ruined the dishes because it was so gritty.  I prefer not to feel like I am chewing something that sand was sprinkled on.  The salt (or sand?) does NOT dissolve in meals where it's added & cooked with the meal.
