The Newman's Own peppermints are very poor quality, hardly any peppermint taste. I anticipated their being good, and bought a few packs. I was so disappointed, I threw away 2 packs. Why can't they add enough peppermint flavor to make them not taste like carrots, which is what they taste like now. Terrible.
