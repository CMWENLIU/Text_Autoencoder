I have happily used Health Valley products for as long as the company has existed.<br /><br />My problem is not with the company or the product but rather with Amazon's shop. I have ordered cases of the beef broth twice from Amazon and both times at least 50% of the cans were significantly damaged. Its as if I was being sold factory seconds. But at a premium retail price. I am very reluctant to buy again because I feel that I am being abused by Amazon's distributor.
