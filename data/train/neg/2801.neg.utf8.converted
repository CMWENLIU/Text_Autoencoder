It's like flavored water, but not actually coffee.  I know when it was MARS FLAVIA it used to be great.  When the switch was made to ALTERRA, they promised the same quality coffee, but -honestly -it's quite different.  There's none of the aroma I enjoy about coffee in this stuff that's brewed.  Just buy your coffee from the grocery store -any of them will rank better than this Alterra junk.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Maybe if they bring back Flavia coffees I will venture to try it again.  It's a real shame, because now I have this $200 machine sitting in my office that serves no purpose except to maybe lend a "contemporary" look to the office decor.  Well, I guess it still makes hot water.
