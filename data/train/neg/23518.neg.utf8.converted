I opened the bag and thought I'd walked into Santa's Potpourri Shoppe--ack! I have tried almost a dozen chai teas over the years (Numi, Yogi, Choice, Pacific, and small, independent makers at their own tea shops.) Nothing has ever smelled like this: a horrendously strong/concentrated dose of clove and cinnamon. It was strong to the point of making my eyes water and irritating my throat, and my fingers as I handled it.<br /><br />I handled it in order to sift out the big chunks of cinnamon. There was a bit over a whole cup of cinnamon pieces (that smelled stronger than any cinnamon sticks I'd ever cooked with), and 4 cups of tea leaves (that stank to the heavens of clove.) I couldn't bring myself to taste this stuff--I brewed a little of the leaf part but couldn't bring myself to taste it--it would be like drinking clove oil.<br /><br />I called Davidson's to give them feedback and ask, basically, "what is that awful smell?" It seems I had missed the "Product Details" that came after the "Product Features" before I ordered. If I had seen any sort of oils listed I never would have ordered--THAT's what makes this stuff so overbearing. Good Chai is made with bits of actual spices not concentrated oils.<br /><br />But the contents differed from detail here of "natural flavor oils". On the bag it says "Ingredients (*Certified Organic Ingredient): Rooibos*, cinnamon* & natural flavor." Note the "natural flavor" is not organic, and there's no way to know what's in it or how the flavorings were processed. It could be more than oils. "Natural" just means it's not gmo or petroleum-based/synthetic; it does not mean it's not MSG, hydrolyzed wheat protein, or that it does not have plants-processed-with alcohol-until-they-become-chemicals-that-work-as-preservatives in it.<br /><br />Amazon issued me a refund but did not want the product back. There's no way I'm ingesting this, and I don't want it in my compost...maybe I could give it away as sachets of xmas potpourri a TEASPOON per room.
