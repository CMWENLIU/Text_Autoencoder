I've had my cat for four years now, and I've almost always fed her Meow Mix because its inexpensive, and its what my family used to buy to feed her and other cats we've had in the past. Since she seemed to favor it, I continued to feed it to her after I had moved out of the house, taking her along with me. Although I'd clean up her messes before, she tends to vomit almost all the time (or maybe I just notice it more?)<br /><br />What I've come to realize that she vomits up this food at least once or twice a month. Once I did some research on cat nutrition, and then looked at the ingredients in this food, its really not what you want your cat to be eating...<br /><br />I know it'll be more expensive, but I'd rather give my cat something that she can digest and enjoy, with quality, than give her something cheap that makes her sick.
