This product contains non-organic MonSatan soy lecithin (banned in Europe, causes cancer and organ failure in lab rats). Organic sources of soy lecithin are presently available - no good reason to use this poison. Most of the companies that use it have been bought out by the same mega-corps that make junk food, etc. USDA organic products are allowed to contain 5% GMOs.
