Sadly, this case (or unsealed bag) of dried mango really is too good to be true. They don't even taste like actual mango and considering that they're an unnatural bright orange color makes us wonder if these are actually mango at all. I'm extremely disappointed with this product...and now we have 11 lbs of gross orange garbage. Maybe we can give it away to our neighbors.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017RLGX0">Phillippine Brand Naturally Delicious Dried Mangoes Tree Ripened Value Bag 30 Ounces Dried Mango</a><br />If you want some REALLY GOOD dried mangoes, go with a dependable brand like Phillipene Dried Mango.
