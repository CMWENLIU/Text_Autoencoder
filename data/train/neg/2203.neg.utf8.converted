I believe the title says it all.  The original box was obviously damaged and taped with packaging as if a third grader had done the job.  Upon receiving it and seeing it's appearance I then counted the number of bones which ended up being eight short....about 15% off.  I then contacted the vendor and amazon and never received a reply back.  Therefore I am very disappointed with both the condition of the product, the vendor, and amazon.
