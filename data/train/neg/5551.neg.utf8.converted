I recently purchased this item since these are the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I usually eat one for lunch every couple of weeks. Unfortunately, these noodle bowls arrived with an expiration date of January 2009. So now I have to eat 24 noodle bowls in the next 4 months, which averages out to 6 a month. Don't get me wrong, these are great noodles. I just don't want to have to eat them so quickly. If I had known that these were going to expire in 4 months, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time...
