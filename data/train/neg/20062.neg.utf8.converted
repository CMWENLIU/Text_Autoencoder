I have no idea what the actual coffee is like.  This is because, even though I specifically searched for Keurig cups, Amazon displayed these.  And I bought them because Amazon led me to believe they were k cups, only to discover I can't use them BECAUSE THEY DON'T GO IN MY MACHINE.<br />I'm writing this as a warning since I've ALSO just found out AMAZON DOESN'T ALLOW RETURNS OF GROCERY ITEMS.<br />Awesome.  Money down the tube.  Watch me NOT get more grocery items from Amazon in future.
