We have found one cat and one dog who like this jerky.  Every human I've pawned this off on thinks it stinks, so the two animals keep having the opened packages offered to them. I added a couple torn into bits to a squash stew last night, and it almost snuck into the family meal.  It added a "meaty" texture as it rehydrated and the flavor fortunately was minimized.  Straight out of the bag, these little disks are nasty in flavor and the texture is very, very spongy.  The diameter is larger than a nickel, smaller than a quarter.  The two animals give it a star, but be careful you only give them one at at time so they don't get sick.  Humans polled don't even give it one star.
