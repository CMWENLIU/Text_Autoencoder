OK. I admit it. I didn't scrutinize the full product description nor study the picture of the bag before purchasing this product. I purchased this product thinking that it was 100% Kenya coffee. Nowhere in the product title or in my invoice did it say it was a Blend. You had to look at a closeup of the bag or read through the romance description in order to get an inkling. Even then, they use the word blended in the description which can have a different meaning than the word blend.<br /><br />Why is this important? There are no worldwide standards for what percentage of a coffee's orgins are needed in order to make a claim. For example, Kona coffee does have a standard for blends, where at least 10% needs to be sourced from Kona in order for it to be called "Kona Blend". In this case, as long as there is some Kenya coffee in this product, Copper Moon can call it a Kenya blend. Amazon should make this clearer.
