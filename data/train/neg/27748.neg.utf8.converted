Because of the unhealthy ingredients in this product I would have rated this a ZERO, but that wasn't an option.<br /><br />I bought this product thinking it would be of the same caliber as Mariani cherries, which contains "dried cherries and sugar."  I'm not a fan of white sugar, nor do I buy or use it in my home, but at least it's the only other ingredient.<br /><br />After I received my delivery I read the ingredients for this product- "Mariani Wild Blueberries, 3-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)", which I neglected to do so before my purchase, but I have done with almost every food item have purchased over the past 25+ years, and I found the following quite disturbing!<br /><br />In addition to the blueberries there are the following ingredients:  1)"Sugar" (who knows what kind. I can only assume it's refinded white sugar, but it's not as bad as the following 3), 2) "High Fructose Corn Syrup" (Nasty stuff this is!), 3) "Corn Syrup" (More nasty stuff and also useless), and 4) "Sucrose" (also known as "Splenda" with the Blueberries, and linked to health problems more than the previous 3 ingredients).<br /><br />ALL 4 of these are unhealthy and should be baned from all foods!<br /><br />I was looking for something natural and healthy. There's 'nothing' natural and healthy about white "Sugar", "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and especially "Sucrose" (better know as "Splenda")<br /><br />There is quite a bit of information available that proves these 4 ingredients are unhealthy.  Search each one, or search "artificial sweeteners", and you will be surprised at the negative effects these have on the health and well being of both humans and animals, despite what the manufacturers claim.<br /><br />Had I read the Amazon product description of the ingredients I would NEVER have bought this product!<br /><br />I will NEVER by this product again, nor will I ever buy "Mariani Berries 'N Cherries, 6-Ounce Units (Pack of 12) again!  They contain the same 4 NASTY ingredients as the "Wild Blueberries" product does!  And they taste awful!  NOTHING like real unadulterated dried fruit.<br /><br />Mariani:  You should have left nature alone, not tampered with the taste of fresh fruit, and only added some sunflower oil or Vitamin E.<br /><br />P.S.  I wonder if "High Fructose Corn Syrup", "Corn Syrup", and "Sucrose" are Kosher?
