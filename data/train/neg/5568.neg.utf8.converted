As much as I like the AeroGarden, I have to say I did not have any success with eh Tomato kit.<br /><br />Herbs seem to work great, but when it requires pollination(shaking the plant as per the instructions), it does not work.  I had tried the snow peas and they did not grow either.<br /><br />I am going to go back to herb kit(s),<br /><br />Sean B. Halliday<br />www.tricitiesguide.com
