This product rarely works unless you get the seed packs and immediately plant them...Very expensive, and maybe 50% of the time,you may or may not get anything to grow.  I've had this for 3 years now and rarely had but a few things grow...Much easier to go to the garden shop and buy the plants and put them in your garden.<br /><br />I've had tons of their kits sent to me, and only half of them seem to work...I'll call customer service, and yes they will send more....but by then, the 3 that worked are growing big and you cannot start the new ones.<br /><br />Sorry to say, this product is for "rich people" who have the time time play.  I'm only wanting to plant foods to eat and survive.
