Careful if you take fast acting insulin before meals.  Those protected carbs must loose their protection sometime between dinner and waking up the next morning.<br /><br />This happened three times, had two serving in a 60 carb dinner, went to bed with a blood sugar 140-150, but woke up with my glucose near 300!<br /><br />Theory, the carbs took too long to digest and my fast acting insulin, Humalog, couldn't catch it.<br /><br />Taste great.
