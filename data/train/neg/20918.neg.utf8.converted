I was excited about the chance to try 20 different flavors since I'm new to Keurig, but there were only 12 different flavors in my box. The worst part is neither of my top two flavors shown in the photo of the product and listed in the item descripition were included. I was torn between these two flavors (glazed chocolate donut and cinnamon roll) and almost order a single flavored box...but I couldn't make up my mind on which one to order. You'll get 20 cups, but don't think you're going to get the 18 flavors listed + 2 different surprise flavors.
