I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible.  Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE!  And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.<br /><br />I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.
