I bought these carob chips with the intentions of using them in carob chip cookies.  They taste great but the quality of the chips for baking purposes, is poor.  The chips melt out of the cookies and burn on the pan.  These chips would be best used in trail mixes or other snacks.  I did however, melt them and drizzle some over the cookies.  That was ok except that the carob never really fully dried, but instead made the cookies tacky sticky.
