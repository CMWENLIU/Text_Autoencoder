The taste and texture of this cereal just doesn't excite my taste buds.  I would agree with another reviewer's point that I would need to add fruit, nuts and sweetener to make this tolerable as a cereal.  However...I tried a recipe on the bag for whole grain muffins that ARE TO DIE FOR, so all is not lost.  Another reviewer adds it to her bread, so today's experiment is with my honey wheat bread recipe.  Might also be good in my whole grain pancakes. It is excellent as a source of whole grains and fiber, but not a winner in the unadorned cereal category.
