Made from Chinese apple concentrate.  Chinese apples are bitter from all the chemical sprays and pesticides used on the trees and soil.  China makes the juice marketable by turning the apples into powder concentrate and shipping the powder in industrial drums.  Any juice that uses chinese apples is of questionable quality and we all know the chinese record for producing safe products.  Please see the FDA's testimony below this review.<br /><br />I bought this brand for years.  You can definately notice the difference in taste and quality from the chinese concentrate and other additives.  Still not too bad tasting, but I only drink it when no other USA grown apple brand is available.  You can save a few dollars now by buying these chinese juice imports and save the money for the cancer treatments and nursing home bills when you get older.<br /><br />Also stay away from Tree Top, Welch's, Motts, and store bought brands.  Check the bottle, if you cannot find USA or Canada as country of origin on the bottle, do not buy it.  If it is fresh squeezed or 'not from concentrate' you should be safe.<br /><br />FDA website 'Testimony on Food Safety before the Senate Committee on Commerce"<br /><br />"During the 1980's through the late 1990's, FDA encountered several serious compliance problems with Chinese food exports, including lead and cadmium in ceramicware used to store and ship food products, and staphylococcal contamination of canned mushrooms."<br /><br />"While improvements have been made in some Chinese products with which we have had concerns in the past, there is unfortunately still a pattern of substandard products that continue to be shipped to the U.S. As all of you are very well aware, this pattern has continued, and the safety of food and other FDA-regulated products from China have become a concern for FDA, Congress, and U.S. consumers."
