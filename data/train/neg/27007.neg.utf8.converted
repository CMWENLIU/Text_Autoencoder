These bull sticks carry the same name brand as the Costco standard, Cadet Bully Stick, but are not as uniform in shape or nearly as large.  Instead of smelling like dead animal, these bull sticks smell like dirty underwear.  The smell didn't bother my dog... at least at first.  My dog threw up each time after chewing/consuming the bull sticks.  Her dumb owner (me) wasn't sure what was making her sick at first, so we had three opportunities through the week to chew and clean up.  The rest of the bag went to the dumpster.<br /><br />If your dog has a sensitive stomach or anyone in the family has a sensitive nose, avoid these rawhide chews.
