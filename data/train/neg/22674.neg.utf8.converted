This is the only Dr. McDougall's soup cup I've tried, and I will never try another one. You know that taste all fast food has? Sort of a weird mix of grease, salt, and an MSG-like flavor? That was the taste this had. That combined with the classic Pad Thai flavor just made this completely inedible for me.
