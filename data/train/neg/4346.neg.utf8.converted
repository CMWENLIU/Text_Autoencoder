Positive: Gardenia Bonsai arrived in good shape and packaged well.<br /><br />Negative: Did not look like a Bonsai at all, they advertise they are suppose to be 4 yrs old?? Mine looked like a normal Gardenia bush that was pruned way back and stuck in a small pot. I plan on returning it, my wife was disappointed because it was a christmas gift for her!
