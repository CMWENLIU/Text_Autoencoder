This product was shipped from Amazon with the expiration only two months out. I contacted Organic Valley directly and was told that they ship the milk with a six month expiration date. That means it sat in Amazon's warehouse for four months, at least.<br />Also, although technically not expired, this milk has an off taste. I will not purchase this product again.
