This has no beef in it at all. It is made from soy.  I believe it's labeling is totally misleading however I now see the ingredient list on the Amazon page, wish I would have read it before.  When something is labeled "Beef Broth Concentrate" I expect it to be exactly that.  I was so excited to find this under an 'English beef tea' search, but so disappointed when I smell it and did not smell a hint of beef.  That is when I read the ingredient list and saw no beef listed. I added lots to my pot roast gravy and it did not add to the beef flavor at all.<br />Only buy this if you want to support sellers who falsely name and advertise their items.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ52P2">Smithers Beef Broth Concentrate, 32-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>
