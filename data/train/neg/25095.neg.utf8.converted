I'm very disappointed to have to write this review, I had higher expectations for this product. I love pomegranate, licorice and prefer organic products whenever possible. One would believe that I would love Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice. Not so! I found it to be bland and tough with a slightly stale flavor that does not taste like pomegranate. I almost lost a filling on these! I would not recommend them at all.
