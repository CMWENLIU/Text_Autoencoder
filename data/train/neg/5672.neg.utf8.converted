All four ounces of this tuna is stored in a single pouch. Once you open it, the entire four ounces are exposed. My two cats will only eat about one-sixth of this between them. I would rather have smaller, individually wrapped portions so I don't need to refrigerate the most of it to save it for later.<br /><br />The heavy plastic, recloseable bag is hard to open and hard to seal. I used another ziploc instead.<br /><br />I don't see the point in the product though. I'd rather buy a can of tuna for much less and feed my cats that when they need a treat while I eat the rest. I suppose I could eat the rest of these treats, but it's not that appealing.<br /><br />My cats liked it just fine though, but they like the regular tuna just as much.
