I have two diabetic cats and this is one of their favorite flavors.The price here on Amazon was very good and I thought it would be nice and convenient to have it shipped to my home.<br /><br />I received the case quickly and it was packed well.However when I opened the first can I noticed that the "meat" was much darker than the cans I purchase locally. My cats would not eat any of the Amazon Cans.I purchased some locally to check to see if perhaps my cats had tired of this flavor. They quickly devoured the local cans. The dates were good on the Amazon cans so that was not the issue.<br /><br />Anyhow, I am going to cancel my subscription for this product.
