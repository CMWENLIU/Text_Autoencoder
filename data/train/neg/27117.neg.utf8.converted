Purchased the cucumber dill lentil chips with high hopes, especially after reading the reviews.  I wanted a snack chip made from something other than white flour or potatoes, and lentils are healthy, & cucumber dill sounded like a great combination.  However, they were disappointing on all levels.  First, the flavoring is sparse, some of the chips have a coating of the seasoning, some have a small amount of seasoning and many don't have any seasoning at all.  They are very bland w/o the seasoning.  Second, the ingredients!  Lentils?  Yes, but...here's the ingredient list in order, bean flour (lentil, garbanzo & adzuki beans) that's good, but the next ingredients are POTATO and/or pea starch & POTATO fiber, then oil and seasonings.  These are lentil chips, NOT potato chips.  Why is it all these "healthy" other grain, multi-grain snacks always have potatoes in them?  Serving size is 22 chips, 110 calories, 3 grams fat, 19 carbs & 3 fiber.  But the flavor is so disappointing, can' even tell they're cucumber dill for the most part, and the price is a little high for styrofoam chips.
