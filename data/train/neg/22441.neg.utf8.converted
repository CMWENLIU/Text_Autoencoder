My vet and almost anything I've read recently suggests never buying dog food or chews, etc from China. While the products that are made in the USA cost more, I certainly don't mind paying more. I was disappointed that this product wasn't described on the website as made in China. Chinese manufactured dog food is not inspected with the same scrutiny as American products. And needless to say, they've travelled quite a bit to get to my door. Please, Amazon, include place of manufacture. The dog seems to like the taste though.
