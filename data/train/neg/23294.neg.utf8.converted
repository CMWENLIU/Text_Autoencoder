Like another reviewer, I am disappointed that as of 2010, the wrappers no longer float up into the air when lit. In fact, I've written this review only because we had gotten some for a 60th birthday dinner party we hosted and were curious why they didn't work.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are light in texture, flavorful (very...H-bomb department), and crunchy. But they are so sweet your molars will explode on contact.<br /><br />To many people these are good things. But since I do not like extreme sweetness, I'm not one of them. Too bad, because the texture is very nice. Anyway, you folks who are averse to sugary stuff should stick to your favorite biscotti.<br /><br />We would serve these cookies on the side with the "main" dessert, exclusively on special occasions when we wanted to do the delightful little trick with the wrappers. Without that ability, we have no reason to buy the cookies.
