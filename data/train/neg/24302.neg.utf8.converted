Received this e-mail back from the seller after contacting Amazon customer service. Tea was shaken loose all over inside of package, the tins were very tiny and instead of Dragonwell and Pu Erh, I got 2 Oolong, 2 Black and 2 Green Tea.  I assumed one of the two greens was the Dragonwell but nothing was labelled Pu Erh...in English that is, and Pu Erh was why I bought the assortment.<br /><br />From seller<br />"Hi, we are sorry that you are not happy with the tea. However, Pu Erh (in Chinese) Tea is inside, it is labeled as Yunnan Tea.<br /><br />Since  the tea was not made by us, it is by the local Chinese people, whose English translation is not as good as it should be.  Sorry about it.<br />However, the Pu Erh is definitely inside.<br /><br />We have authorized the Amazon to give you the full refund , and we would appreciate you to have a kinder feedback"<br /><br />Cannot recommend this seller.
