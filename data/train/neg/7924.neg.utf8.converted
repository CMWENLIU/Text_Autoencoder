I thought I'd try this stuff since it got so many positive reviews.  Unfortunately, to me, it does not taste good either by itself or blended with something else.  I tried it in a berry smoothie and blended it into a green tea latte, and sadly, neither was positively augmented.  It does have a unique taste as other reviewers have suggested, it just isn't a GOOD taste.  I'm guessing a spoonful of powdered dirt would not taste much worse than a spoonful of this.  And the flavor is too overpowering.  You cannot sneak this into a smoothie without noticing it.  I'm glad I tried it, just disappointed I don't like it.
