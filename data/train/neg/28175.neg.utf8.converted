HORRIBLE company with HORRIBLE customer service!!!  Hey everyone be careful when ordering from this company!! Where to begin.... first and just to start with what reputable company runs off of a cell phone that has horrible service let alone a cell phone alone, then when speaking to the one customer service rep (which is horribly rude) and the OWNER ( just as rude) you can barely understand them and they can barely hear you, do to the lack of service there phone has and amongst other things (which in order to make sure this post stays on to warn you I will not mention).  (Hey Barry farms if your going to be out in the woods with no service you should probably invest in a land Line we are in 2010.) Barry farms are phonies they order from other real farms then put there low budget label on it and try to take the credit.  Perfect example of this is when I ordered Blue cornmeal THREE WEEKS ago and still haven't received it...are you kidding me maybe I should order some now for next years dinner...or more like I will pass.  So in brief let me tell you that when I first ordered it on 5/6/10 I spoke to the rep and she insured me that they had it in stock after I made it a point to stress if they had it because originally I was going to order it on amazon and they didn't have any.  The rep said at that time (which was rude so I am sure it was the same one and perhaps the only one) "our supply must have run out for amazon but go to our website and order from us directly".  Without hesitation I went to there horrible website which again must represent who I am dealing with and ordered a large order.  The website says if you order a large order then you get a discount which I DID NOT get and had to call back to question the transaction.  The rep (again very rude) said " oh I don't know what happen, oh did you order from us"..blah blah and muttered a bunch of other nonsense in which I finally got the discount after much wasted time on the phone.  So about a week passes and I call to find out where my order is and call "Barry Farms" RUDE rep picks up and I ask her for the status of my order she says "bulk orders can take up to two weeks and we are only on week one it says that on the website so you should be receiving it by next week" with a super rude attitude and such conviction. So I have no problem taking part of the blame on that by not reading the "term and conditions" which they do not have, it and would take two weeks.  So I wait my two weeks PLUS an additional week and still no sign of my order, or even an email or phone call so I decide to call "Barry Farms" myself. When the customer service rep answered not only does she sound like she is miserable with the few words that got threw, I could not understand her with the lack of service her phone had. I then had to call back hoping she would perhaps climb a tree or go to a place where she can get some service(no luck).  After repeating myself 5 or more times to try to communicate to this person about the status of my order she then tells me again with attitude "your order can take up to two weeks" in which I had to inform her that we are now ON WEEK THREE she then loses the attitude for a second, then tries to give me a story about the owners have problems so no one was putting orders in and blah blah blah.... (that is real NICE.)  Why should I have to hear about there problems I paid for blue cornmeal not three weeks of you having my money and then telling me your problems, and what sort of business's customer service tells their customers company problems.. a REALLY BAD ONE AND ONE THAT IS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS! Spoke to the owner Linda or Lint Barry (since again service was constantly breaking up the call) just as rude, tried to give me some more of her/his problems and that I would have to wait another week which means I now would have to wait FOUR WEEKS and who knows if that is even true.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WHICH THEY WILL PROBABLY TAKE WHEN THEY GO UNDER AND CANCEL THERE ONE CELL PHONE. ORDER FROM A REAL FARMER/BUSINESS.
