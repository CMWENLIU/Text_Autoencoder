I bought these because they were on sale. I thought it'd taste like the tuna salad that comes in the cans, but it tastes like nothing of the sort.<br />the salad is creamy and stringy with no texture of the tuna left in it like it's been mixed too much.<br />I will not buy this product again. Maybe I'll buy the individual tuna cups that are only tuna.
