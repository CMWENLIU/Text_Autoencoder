My baby really did not like eating this. I got this for the DHA thinking it would be so refined it wouldn't taste fishy. Well, my son usually takes regular rice cereal fine. I fed him this and at first he would gag and most if it came right back out. I tasted it and holy crap is it gross. It definitely has essence of fish. I tried his other rice cereal before too. It was just bland, rice cereal. This was just disgusting. Although, it might not be the taste that's making him gag. This stuff has a seriously weird texture. It must be the gelatin. It was really frustrating to me to mix up. I'd get it to what I thought was a good consistency and a few minutes later it would turn into this runny mess, sort of like paste. Awful! I threw the rest of the can away and went back to the regular stuff.
