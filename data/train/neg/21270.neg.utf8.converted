I'm a big fan of many gummi candies -- especially the Jelly Belly version of this product, but it can be expensive and harder to find. I thought I would give this brand a try -- BUT WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The candy is giant, the "seeds" are waxy balls, and the gel inside has no flavor at all. The red ones especially have a chemical taste. Amazon issued a refund and I'm throwing these away. Save your $$$ for the real thing!
