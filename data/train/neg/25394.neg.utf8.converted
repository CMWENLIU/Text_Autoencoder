Sadly for me and the time i spend cooking ground turkey for my little darlings, they really didn't like the Sojos complete food. They love the add meat variety (LOVE LOVE LOVE) but this- they ate when they were starving, but otherwise ignored. I wish they loved it it would be so much easier! They are little yorkies - perhaps it's a breed thing.
