A BAD mix from a GOOD company. Hodgson Mills makes many good products. This IS NOT one of them. It is NOT the "gluten free" version of Bisquick or any other quick baking mix. There is nothing quick about this. All that is in this product is a few varieties of Gluten free flours. There is no sugar, baking powder, baking soda, egg, guar or xanthan gum (nothing to hold the finished product together for those of you who are new to Gluten Free Baking). Items you try to make with this mix as is will fall apart and taste bad. In other words, this is a mix you HAVE to experiment with in order to make things come out looking or tasting good at all. Most of us who have to eat Gluten Free foods are looking for shortcuts like every other busy person on the planet. This mix will add to your busy time, not relieve you. Try Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix or the Gluten Free Pantry Baking Mix for a better experience.
