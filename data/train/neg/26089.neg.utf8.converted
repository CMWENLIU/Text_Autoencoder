I had never tried marzipan, but had always wanted to.  While shopping on Amazon, this caught my eye, so decided to try it.  I hope this is not what marzipan is supposed to taste like.  I can taste the almonds, but have to get past the old, stale smell and taste first.  If marzipan has a "best if used by" date, the one I had was WAY past that date.
