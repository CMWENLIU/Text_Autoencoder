I recently purchased this orgeat, as well as two other orgeats available on Amazon: Monin and Ferrara. I tried them in various cocktails and Teisseire came in last--a distant last--in every test. Compared with the other two it is thin and its flavor is too weak to stand up to other ingredients in a drink. I do give it bonus points for the nice bottle and pour spout, but it's certainly not worth its price and I do not recommend it for cocktail enthusiasts.
