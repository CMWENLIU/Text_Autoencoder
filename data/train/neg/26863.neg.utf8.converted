I usually use another 9 grain mix with no problem whatsoever. Maybe I have a bad batch and fortunately I know a builder short of corner stones!! For the first time in 5 years of bread machine baking I am producing loaves that do not rise and come our rock hard, heavy and with a dry flour taste.<br /><br />Reading the other reviews I am inclined to think that I have been unlucky, however considering the cost and shipping I will not be trying again with this brand
