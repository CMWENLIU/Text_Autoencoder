It takes alot of this to TASTE it in tea or in food.  If you put it right on TOP of the food and don't mix it in then you can taste more of it.  Also, look up Agave Plant online.  You will find it high in oxalate acid and well, "the juice" of this plant on my hands did leave me with contact dermatitis.  The other problem was the oxalate level.  I happen to have to watch mine, and this is too high because the amount you have to use is well, alot to really get a sweet taste/as sweet as sugar.  Right, it doesn't raise blood sugar - but considering there is no real nutritional benefit this is one dietary "extra" I'm passing up.  I'm not diabetic so I can't speak for that situation, but I suppose if you were diabetic without a weightproblem (this is not low calorie) and no oxalate issues (kidney stone), then you might consider this product.  If not diabetic, don't bother.  Too pricey when a teasp of sugar is only 16 calories and sweetens much more easily.
