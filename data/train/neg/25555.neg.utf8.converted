I'm giving this more than one star only because eating Cracker Jacks in a bowl with milk may sound like heaven to you. Personally, I think this cereal is wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet. Here are the ingreds. in order of highest content:<br /><br />1. Milled corn (think Cracker Jacks)<br />2. Sugar (ditto)<br />3. Peanuts (ditto)<br />4. Honey (more sugar)<br />5. Malt flavoring<br />6. Molasses (more sugar)<br />7. Salt<br />8. High Fructose Corn Syrup (you know . . . sugar)<br /><br />It is deceptive because it says it only contains 11 g of sugar per serving. However, a serving is only 3/4 cup. I actually measured this out today, and trust me, I will be looking for something else (a doughnut?!!!) in about an hour, and if you stick with the serving size, you will be, too.  3/4 cup is probably about 6 spoonfuls. And then you're done.<br /><br />This is so much like candy I can actually feel it cementing itself to my teeth. So if you give this to your kids, make sure they brush brush brush (and floss).<br /><br />They've managed to fortify this with some vitamins (although not a whole lot), so is this better than skipping breakfast? Probably. But could/should you find a healthier alternative? Definitely.
