There is hardly any of the herbs advertised on the box in the actual tea leaves.<br />Jason Winters wrote a book about how this "Miraculous" discovery saved him from TERMINAL CANCER.<br /><br />Too bad this same "Miraculous" tea didn't help my sister one iota.<br />Sadly we bought this tea out of desperation. It tastes like nothing, really.....and it does NOTHING.<br /><br />What a shame.
