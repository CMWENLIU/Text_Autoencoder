This soup is okay on flavor for the most part, but is skimpy on the main ingredients: chicken and rice. Also, the can wasn't completely full. Furthermore, it contains soy protein isolate, a cheap filler, not something I expected from Muir Glen. And with that cheap filler you'd think they wouldn't skimp on the ingredients, but they did. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised since Muir Glen is now owned by General Mills.<br /><br />If you have soy allergies or like to avoid soy and over processed ingredients then I'd steer away from this soup. Wolfgang Puck's Chicken & Wild Rice is superior in every way: much more rice and more and better tasting chicken. I think the chicken in Muir Glen's soup has been mechanically processed to combine it with the soy, giving it an odd texture that's not at all pleasing. It also looks a bit wrong with its rectangular shape. Puck's soup has actual recognizable pieces of shredded chicken.<br /><br />I might have given it three stars for flavor (it didn't taste appreciably bad), but everything else knocks it down to two. It's also very low in fat, which makes it a bit flat and less filling. I will not be buying it again, let alone a 12-pack. And especially not since I felt a mild MSG reaction after eating this soup, though, that's not conclusive. I can't say for sure that it does have any.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend this soup. Ounce for ounce it is far more expensive that Puck's soup since it provides less calories (a paltry 160 for the entire can), less protein, less fat, less carbs and less nutrients. If you want to pay more for a lot less then Muir Glen's soup is for you.
