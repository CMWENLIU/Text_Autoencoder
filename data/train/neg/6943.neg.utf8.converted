Amazon has been out of Lifeboat Tea (my all time favorite tea so far) for months now and since I am running really low on my supply, I decided to give Welsh Brew a try. I found it flavorless, not at all hearty or bold and bland and boring. It taste like hot water to me, no kidding. I'm was thinking, "How am I supposed to get my morning "jolt" from this stuff if I can't even taste it?" I didn't.<br /><br />I'm a hard core, leave the tea bag in the cup while I drink it, tea drinkin' fool and found that I'd been fooled by Welsh Brew. Bummer!
