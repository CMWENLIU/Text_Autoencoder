I love Kitchens of India and have ordered many of their mixes (esp. the butter chicken curry mix) and ready-to-eat items, but was very disappointed in this one.<br /><br />There is very little rice compared with the amount of grease and spices (strong taste of pumpkin pie spices like cinnamon and clove) and it just doesn't taste very good. The 8.8 oz package says it is two servings but is really only one serving -- and has TWENTY FOUR GRAMS OF FAT, 10 of them Saturated Fat, and 580 calories. I did enjoy the free Indian music CD, but that comes with their other food items as well.  Pass this one up!
