I had purchased the Juniper Bonsai Tree as a Christmas present for my husband.  By last month, April 2010, it was dead.  I would like to know how do I get a replacement for it from the people we bought it from.  I can't remember who we bought it from.  Otherwise I will not get another Bonsai tree. How do I find out where I purchased it from?<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Diana McLemore
