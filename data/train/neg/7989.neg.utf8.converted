Hard to believe hostess would even release something as bad as these.<br />They kinda look like twinkies (if you dont look too close), but thats where any<br />similarities end. The cake texture is way too dense and theres really too much of the fake tasting chocolate filling. If you like twinkies you wont like these. Dont waste your money.
