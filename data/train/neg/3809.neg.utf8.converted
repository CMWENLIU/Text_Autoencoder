The pack I received from Amazon has another Nutrition Facts sticker put there to cover or hide the original one.  Out of curiosity, I pilled off the sticker, and found the following:<br /><br />Ingredients as: prunes, potassium sorbate as a preservative.  Product of USA, Argentina, Chile, and France.<br /><br />So the prunes I got is not only not organic grown at CA but also contains preservative?  Is it an okay practice to put another sticker on original nutrition facts label?
