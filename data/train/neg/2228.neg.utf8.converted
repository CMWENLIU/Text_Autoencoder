I love cookies because I'm a fatty.<br /><br />These are not cookies though, they are the cookie version of sin. Ever held sin in tangible form? Well if not these "cookies" will do the job! If cookies had a religion, these would be their anti-christ. Hitler could not make a cookie that tasted this bad and look at his cooking attempts. These things taste like you grabbed the shells of peanuts from the floor of a 1930's stadium and shoved them in your mouth with the intent of assaulting your taste buds. Have you ever wanted to assault yours or your friends taste buds? Behold the compact way of doing so! Please keep in mind that a chaser of some type of liquid is a necessity when attempting to eat these. I unfortunately did not have any present and had to man up while trying to over come these dastardly doom disks. Speaking of which, after eating one of these I was compelled to the bathroom by some satanic calling from my belly. Upon making it there I vomited profusely. For the first time in my life, the taste of vomit was welcomed. On that note, these should never be allowed near anyone whom ever was or is bulimic or anorexic as it will give them ever more incentive to vomit.<br /><br />Did you know if you threw these out the window of your car you'd be ticketed for littering? Why? Due to the simple fact that they lack a trait know as biodegradable. Bacterial could not even be bothered to touch these. I could go on and on about how bad these are, but alas I have to finish taking care of these cookies.<br /><br />I'm going to take these and have the bag, with the remainder of the cookies, laminated to seal them in forever. After doing so, I will be shipping these to NATO with the intent of having these cookies be banned from war. I will edit this post upon receiving an update from NATO about these cookies.<br /><br />Little known fact, these cookies were first made in 1986. Know what else happed in 1986? The Chernobyl disaster...yeah think about it.
