I contacted the people at Cultures for Health and asked about real-man-of-genius. I was told that real-man-of-genius is NOT Cultures for Health and that it is not even their product. This is a man in Kentucky who uses their picture on Amazon to promote his kefir grains. He sends about 1/2 the amount that Cultures for Health does, packaged in a ziplock bag.
