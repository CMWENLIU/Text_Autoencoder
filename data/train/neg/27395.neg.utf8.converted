all of my order came just as stated,but the chocolate was past the due date and some of it had white spots and tasted bad.thought i was getting quality for my money but got squat for my expense.will not buy any foodstuffs from amazon ever again.espeacialy not chocolate,no quality control just old stuff that was bought cheap and stockpiled.and foisted off on unsuspecting customers.good day.
