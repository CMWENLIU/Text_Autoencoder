Dude, seriously, this price is for ONE PACKAGE.  One a bad day it will run you 25 cents at the grocery store, but here at Amazon you can pay anywhere from $3 - $5 dollars!  Yes, I wasn't paying attention.  I read "Baby Pack", saw the price, and assumed that there would be some sort of pack of bags.  Nope.  Just one.  DON'T BE FOOLED!  It ain't gold plated!
