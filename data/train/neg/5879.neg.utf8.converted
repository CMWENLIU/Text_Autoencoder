Even though the picture of the product shows the little Recaldent logo, the gum I have received is in fact the old "recipe" and does not contain it. Newer packages don't have the Recaldent logo on the front anymore, but do list it as an ingredient on the back (as "calcium casein peptone calcium phosphate"). The box of 12 packages I have received was the older stuff, with none of that.<br /><br />If you're specifically looking for Trident White with Recaldent... Be warned ! :)
