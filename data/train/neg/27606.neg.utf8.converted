I was disappointed in the flavor of this coffee. Frankly it does not compare with the true Blue Mountain Jamaican Coffee Beans which of course are much more expensive.  I have found the Eight O'Clock Columbian Whole Bean to be the best flavored for a reasonable price.  You can get it direct from the manufacturer on the Internet.
