After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.
