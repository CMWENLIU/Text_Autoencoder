I was very excited to try this food.  We have an older JRT who is not a finicky eater, but isn't crazy about dry food.<br />I was hoping to find another healthy food to rotate.<br />When my order arrived, it contained 2 rolls of Natural Balance and a 5# bag of Natural Balance dry food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag of dry food, I gave her a few pieces to taste and she loved them.<br />So I mixed the dry food with the remaining other dry food in a large container.<br />Then I switched her morning food to the roll instead of her usual canned or pouch food.<br />Again, she loved it, but became very ill within a few hours.<br />She was throwing up and developed loose stools.<br />Our girl was completely listless and wouldn't eat anything but grass.<br />Today I switched her back to her previous food and she seems much better.<br />She's still not back to normal, but obviously feeling much better than yesterday.<br /><br />I know it sounds like I'm jumping to conclusions, but I searched for complaints on this brand and found many similar and worse stories at [...].<br />We're not going to use the rest of this food.  I only wish I hadn't mixed the dry food with another high priced food because now I'll have to toss all of it. I had also purchased some of their canned food.  It's all going into the trash.<br /><br />The food looks and smells great and our dog was nuts about it initially.<br />Just be careful if your pet shows any signs of illness after introducing a new food.<br />I'd rather waste a few dollars than risk the well being of our beloved pet.<br /><br />Too many companies who make food and treats for our beloved pets have been compromising quality to increase profit.<br />Our pet is going to be fine.  She hadn't eaten much of whatever made her so ill and I'm not going to risk repeating it.<br />In the future, I will research complaints before trying a new brand or just start making our own.
