I hate it when manufacturers chose to use misleading terms and try making the product more desirable than it actually is.<br />Yes, Natural it is, but not really when its got added 'natural' unneeded crap. Can't stand when some live-and-eat-by-manufacturer americans who couldn't care less or are ignorant upvote an unhealthy product. Unhealthy only because they add unneeded sugar and palm oil..heck they could have just added HFCS and these same reviewers would have given them 5 stars still ! Wake up America !! Get off the coke !! "NATURAL" my &&&
