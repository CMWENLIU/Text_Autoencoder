Sprayed several days in a row but it did not keep my irrigation feeder lines from being chewed through.  I replaced the feeder lines four times and sprayed each time and the "varmints" would not stop.  I finally raised the main and feeder lines about three feet in the air with stakes and bars and so far it seems like they got the message and went away, hopefully.  At any rate, the spray did not do me any good.  Sorry.
