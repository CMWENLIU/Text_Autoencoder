I bought 2 boxes of these K Cups and they were a total waste of money.  At least 3/4 didn't work.  They would kind of explode in our keurig and we'd end up with only 1/2 a cup of coffee and that would be full of grounds. When we opened it up, there would be coffee oozing out the top of the k cup and all around it was covered in coffee grounds. They worked a little better if we  punched a hole in them with the keurig, opened it up, rotated the k cup and then closed it again so there were multiple holes in the bottom. Many of them would still explode though. At first I thought that it was a fluke but it happened to k cup after k cup and with both boxes of cups.  The Timothy Columbian coffee k cups did the same thing. Other brands work fine so I know it's not our machine.  I won't be buying them again.  Too bad because the coffee itself was very good.
