The 2 stars is for the price, not the product. Peet's Major Dickason's Blend is one of my all time fave coffees. I buy the 12 oz. whole bean bags at my local Vons for 9 bucks a bag all the time. So unless you're agoraphobic or paralyzed save the extra 15 bucks or so that they're charging here and buy locally. It makes a great cup o joe as well as espresso, just grind accordingly.
