Although I've never had Lavazza before, I've certainly had a lot of espresso in Europe and in Italy where Lavazza is supposed to be very big.<br /><br />These beans barely rate as what I would call a "medium" roast. Quite blonde in color. They also lack body and intensity of flavor, with high acidity (and I suspect very high caffeine as well).<br /><br />If you like a very mild, light roast, and low intensity flavor for your espresso, you might like this stuff. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere.
