I really like these sets with the meats and cheeses.Unfortunately this one was way overpriced for the size of the contents.The photograph really makes it look like you are getting a deal but you cant read the weight of the products for a reason.The set should be less than 20 dollars because after shipping your paying 40,i am sorry that i got it.In this economy when you don't get what you pay for it hurts a litle more, i work for my money and to see this kiddie sampler arrive made me feel like a moron.I write reviews a the time this is my first bad one and i hope i save someone a buck.<br />  I will say that the ham was very good,the tiny sausage was o.k,the mustards were stellar,block cheddar is mediocre and the spreads were suprisingly tastey.The candies and chocolate did hit the spot,it was a good way to add a little extra to an anemic set.All in all the food wasnt bad if you can find out the weight of each item you can figure out and compare.This set is awful do not buy it but the product is average to good.Having had different brands i will stay with what i know, it really is the best.
