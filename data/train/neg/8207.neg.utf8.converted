Every person is different and therefore react differently to products. I bought this product last night. Well, I started drinking it from a mug tonight and just from 7-10 slow sips of it (it was hot) I threw up yellowish/greenish liquid stuff. Only liquids came out and it gave me a violent headache. Granted, it does taste good especially with two teaspoons of honey. But just about a half hour after those said sips, I was in my bathroom spewing not only the tea, but what seemed like tons of water/fluids. I have NO idea where all of the liquids came from given that I really have not eaten anything all day today (except for a cheese sandwich at 7am this morning and it is now 9:32pm) and I have only taken 7-10 small sips. This all happened within a matter of 25-30 min! :(<br /><br />I'm slowly recovering now because for some reason, it gave me a really bad headache as well. This may sound a bit over dramatic, but I kid you not, this is what just happened to me. :(<br /><br />If you're looking to lose some weight, your contents may spill out from your mouth and not from your behind. Good luck.
