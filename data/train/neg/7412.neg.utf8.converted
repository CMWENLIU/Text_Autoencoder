I'm very disappointed with this product. It doesn't fit well on the Phillips Senseo coffee pod machine. I typically do 2 pods for 2-cup brew so I had to do it twice with this one. Produced tasteless watery coffee. Tried this product just for a change from the Senseo coffee pods. I suppose I should just stick with them. I'm just very pleased that Amazon gave me a refund for it.
