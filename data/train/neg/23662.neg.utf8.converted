I thought this fish oil would be a great supplement for my cats after one of them began to overgroom and created bald patches on her stomach and legs. All four of my cats refused any type of food with this fish oil added. I tried for many days in many ways. Finally switched back from a newer dry food I thought would be better for them, back to their old dry food, which obviously had more oils in the ingredients. Bald cat is getting her fur back.
