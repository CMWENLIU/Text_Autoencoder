But this concoction manages to do just that.  The taste is neither coffee nor chocolate nor cake.  German chocolate cake has those two tastes plus big dollops of grated coconut. Tim's brew lacks the coconut too. What it does have is an artificial taste that's unpleasant and lingers on the palate like an oil slick.  I was hoping for dessert in a cup and got a caffeinated science project instead.<br /><br />A better alternative is Vietnamese coffee, which usually has a hit of dark chocolate in its composition.  Brew it your usual way (but do it in one of these small single-cup Vietnamese coffee filters if you want really really good). Add some sweetened condensed milk and just enjoy. It's like the grown up version of a chocolate chip cookie.  If you have a very sweet tooth, add sugar.  Or drop a few pieces of chocolate into your cup and microwave them until they melt. Pour in your coffee and say "aaaaaahhhhh."  But leave this ersatz chemical composition alone.  It's just not good.  I'm giving it two stars because if you were desperate for coffee and the nearest supply was a 3-day hike away, this might be a somewhat acceptable substitute. .
