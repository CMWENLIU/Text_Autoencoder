I wanted to try this product to see what all the buzz was about with the "5 Hour Energy" drinks.  Seemed like everyone is using them.  I had trouble finding them in local stores, so I ordered this box from Amazon.  The price was good and there were no problems with the shipping.  There is only enough caffeine equivalent to one cup of coffee in each bottle.  I'm a huge coffee drinker, so this product did not work for me.  I did not feel any more energy when I needed it and it did not keep me awake or alert.  In fact, I got stomach cramps and diarrhea for several days after using this product.  I'm physically fit and do the P90X workouts. I eat healthy food and rarely have abnormal bowel movements or diarrhea.  As a test, I did not use this product for a week and felt fine with normal bowel movements.  I then used another 5 Hour Drink and the next day, diarrhea again!  It may work for other people, but it did not work for me!
