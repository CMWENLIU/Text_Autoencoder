I was looking for a chicken/duck dog treat that isnt made in China (most of the popular ones state that they are on their packaging). This one, with its dual French/English labeling and Free Range title, appeared to be a North American free-range organic-type natural product. Especially given the price. But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives. I feel duped, and I am returning.  I can get the same China-quality for half the price without being taken for a ride.
