It has been over a month since I ordered.  Although they billed my credit card, I have yet to see the product delivered!!! I e-mailed them about 3 weeks ago and was informed my shipment was lost and they would file a claim and re-ship.  Have not heard 1 word since.  Very poor customer service.  I cancelled today and will not order through here again!!!<br /><br />Karen Adams
