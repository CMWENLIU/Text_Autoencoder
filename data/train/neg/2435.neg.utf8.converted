I sent these flowers to my mom for her birthday. The arrangement that arrived wasn't much like the online picture. There was hardly any baby's breath & mostly greenery. The only similarities were that the flowers were carnations & pink (although only 10, not 24 like in the picture.) Turned out to be quite a dissapointment... BUYER BEWARE!
