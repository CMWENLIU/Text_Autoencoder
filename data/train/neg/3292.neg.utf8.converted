I bought these based on my previous purchases of other India Tree products that are naturally colored, i.e. artificial dye free. Amazon even has this product blocked off with India Tree's natural food coloring... These sprinkles are cute and have all kinds of fun colors all of which are artificially colored(FDC Yellow 5, FDC Yellow 6, FDC Red 3, FDC Blue 1). Unfortunately, we cannot use them as my daughter is allergic to artificial dyes and the company will not accept them as a return. $11 for nothing :(
