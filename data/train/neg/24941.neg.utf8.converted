I'm a fan of other baked chip products (such as Doritos and Lays Potato Chips) so I picked these up. They taste terrible! They are bland without much flavor but what there is sort of reminds me of sawdust. I'm sure they might be healthier as they are a Baked product but I'd rather eat less of the real thing. I threw them away. Yuck!
