Expected something different. Unable to view entire ingredients before ordering, something I always do. I took a chance ordering because of the name, thinking that the use of the product name "Trappist Monks" would not put ingredients detrimental to health in the product. I am health consious and oppose partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and high fructose corn syrup. If you have no objection to these ingredients, than I guess the product is O.K. I personally would not purchase again.
