At $16.49 a case, that's $.68 a can. NOT a deal. Even if you sign up to have this product delivered regularly for $14.02, that's still $.58 a can, which is still no bargain. PetsMart sells this product for $.53 if you have a PetPerks card; Walmart sells it for $.53 period. If you live in an area that has no Walmart or PetsMart, I suggest shopping around a bit -- there's bound to be a better deal somewhere on the Internet.
