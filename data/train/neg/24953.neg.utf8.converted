I am a huge fan of Jelly Bellies and tried ordering them from Amazon since I usually am very happy with my Amazon purchases.  Big mistake!!  They came in a plain white square box (which was unsealed and nothing close to the bag shown with the product listing).  Inside the box was an unsealed bag with what I assume were Jelly Bellies.  The bag was only twisted closed with the end tucked into the side to keep the candy from spilling out.  It was in no other way safely sealed - it didn't even have a twist tie closting the bag!  On top of the safety issues with a food product being unsafely packaged the Jelly Bellies were hard as a rock and just looked old and stale...I obviously didn't eat them and intend to return them to Amazon.  In addition there was no indication of the brand, flavors included, a list of ingredients or any other information (which I believe is a requirement of the FDA).<br />I definitely don't recommend anyone purchasing this product from Amazon!
