With shipping, these come to more than 28 cents a piece. At Cracker Barrel, they are less than 13 cents a piece (8 for a dollar). Eighty sticks would be $10 (and no high shipping cost). At Cracker Barrel, you don't have to worry about broken candy and they are always fresh. Cracker Barrel is where I'll be getting mine for the candy buffet for my daughter's wedding!!!
