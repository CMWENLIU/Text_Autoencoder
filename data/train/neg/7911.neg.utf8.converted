I am guilty of not listening to other reviewers' warnings about the horrible smell. I bought it thinking I could overcome the smell given the health reputation of macca. But I was wrong. I could not get rid of the smell no matter how hard I tried to mask it. Plus, I researched some more and found out that there isn't any hard evidence backing up the health claims of macca. Too bad I have a pricey bag of powder sitting in my freezer!
