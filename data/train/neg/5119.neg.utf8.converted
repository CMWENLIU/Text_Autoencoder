I'm surprised at how many people have given these cookies a high rating.  They are huge.  One I just pulled out of the box is 3 inches long by 2 inches wide.  I use treats to train my puppy and reward good behavior.  The StarMark Clicker literature suggests using a treat the size of a navy bean!  Dogs don't really seem to have any concept of size, and treats are for training not supplementing food.  If I try to break these down in size, a good part of the cookie turns into unusable crumbs.  Also IMPORTANT:  The first two ingredients in these cookies are wheat, and I goofed as I NEVER buy any food products for my puppy containing corn nor wheat.  I have tasted them, too, and at least for a human they aren't cloyingly sweet.  Of all the treats I've tried, both my puppy and I much prefer Paul Newman's organic cheese dog treats which contain things like barley, chicken, carrots, apples and rolled oats.  More expensive for sure, but they break easily and are great for training rewards.
