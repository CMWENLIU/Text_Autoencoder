Be prepared for enormous amounts of aggitation, frustration, and RAGE if you buy anything from Prepared Pantry and you want to phone them. I have been trying for HOURS to find a service number. I bought a bread mix. It said that although it is for a bread machine, can also be used without a machine. HOWEVER, the only instructions were for a machine, and very dictatorial: e.g. water must be x degrees, use a thermometer to assure accuracy. Not one word about using the mix without a stupid machine. All I wanted to do was find out how to use the mix so it could be baked in a normal oven. I have given up but will never again buy anything from Prepared Pantry.<br />charles g.
