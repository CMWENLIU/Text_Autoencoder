My family has liked so many of the Chunky soups that when I noticed this one - at a very inviting price - I pulled the trigger quickly. Too bad because my family - young and old, male and female - has let it be known they don't care for this soup. I can't disagree with them, and it's nice to have all of us agree on something, for once. From now on I'm sticking to the types with which we're familiar.
