My veterinarian recommended these because I was having a hard time getting my 17-year old beagle to take her pain medication. I had tried all the usual ways (sticking the pill into cheese or dog treats, putting it on the back of her tongue and holding her mouth shut, etc.), so I was willing to try anything.<br /><br />There's nothing unusual about these treats that makes a dog eat them any differently than anything else. So, I stick the pill in, my dog starts chewing the pill pocket, and soon she's foaming at the mouth because she bit into the pill.<br /><br />If your dog wolfs down food without chewing, this product will work, but is probably unnecessary. If your dog chews food, it just won't work.
