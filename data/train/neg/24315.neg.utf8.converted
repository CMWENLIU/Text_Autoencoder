Reviews are for the product, yes, but since this product is put together by the seller I will be reviewing both.<br /><br />Everytime you order a product that isn't under Prime shipping you receive a date range for earliest-latest shipping. 3 Days after this time frame expired I had to contact the seller and ask why I hadn't received a shipping notification. I was e-mailed back within and told that they were waiting to ship because the dropper inserts were on backorder. This is something you let the customer know immediately; you don't let the shipping time frame expire and make the customer contact you to find out what the heck is going on. The product didn't ship until a week after the shipping time frame expired.<br /><br />The product arrived and was missing the recipes that were promised in the product details. I e-mailed the company and received a PDF version within 24 hrs; so they did make up for it. Still, such oversight is a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />Next the dropper inserts aren't actually made for these bottles. With the dropper inserts on, the bottle cap does not screw on. It is definitely the inserts. I bought the exact same bottles in bulk from another company and the inserts provided by the other company work perfect. I contacted the seller and explained that the dropper inserts don't work since the cap won't screw on with the dropper insert. The seller contacted me and told me that they do work and refused the acknowledge the problem. They just kept saying that it works.<br /><br />Horrible seller. Defective product.
