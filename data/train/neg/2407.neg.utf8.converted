i love these, but what you order here is not fresh-<br />i always get these individually wrapped, sugary, ec<br />this looks like someone grabbed a few and threw it into a bag and shipped it<br /><br />for the amount sent, and the quality- i would not buy again from this place<br />did i mention half the bag was orange. there was not watermelon which is the best. there were manly lemons and oranges- the flavors nobody want.<br /><br />major disappointment
