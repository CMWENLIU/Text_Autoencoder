They don't explain you not only have to take the can out but then find and put the straw on..not easy with 1,2,3 or 4 dogs on leashes. Then the item does freeze the mess but also the grass. Also you need to turn the item over and freeze the back "according to the instructions".. I have been unable to do this. I guess its an art... like... flipping pancakes.<br />The freeze spray does help but don't expect it to be anything like the commercial
