Just call me a sucker!!!  Ordered a bunch of steaks, burgers, hot dogs, potatoes, and fish from Omaha Steaks.  Poorest meat I have ever eaten.  We can get better quality at Walmart and even better yet at the local butcher shop.  Then we are bombarded with phone sales calls and junk mail.  Wished I would never have fallen for "Best Steaks you have ever eaten".  Will never purchase again.
