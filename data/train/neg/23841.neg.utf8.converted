I have used this yogurt culture many times before and it makes great yogurt. However, my local store stopped carrying it, and I ordered these cultures from amazon. I am a prime member and chose a 2 day delivery. The package arrived steaming hot (it was over 90F outside) and was not packaged any differently than a non-grocery item. I did pick up the package as soon as it was dropped off by the UPS carrier. First batch failed, and so did the second batch. I am assuming that improper delivery destroys the culture and do not recommend purchasing it from amazon. A local store had it in the refrigerated section with yogurts and probably had it delivered accordingly.
