I have always loved just about any product that Newman's Own has put out but for once, I am disappointed. Everybody in our family sampled Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists but and the response was tepid at best and 'yuch' at worst. It's not that anyone hates pomegranate either as we often buy pomegranate juice or whole pomegranates.<br /><br />Our biggest complaint is that there was too much chewing involved for too little flavor and even then there was an unpleasant aftertaste. Sad to say, we are not likely to buy this product again.
