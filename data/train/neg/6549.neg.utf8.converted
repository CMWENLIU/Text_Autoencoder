I had switched to this food due to the possibility of another food intolerance in one of my cats.  My cats have never been picky eaters, but none of them were particularly thrilled with this food. They used to run to mealtimes but that basically ended with this food and it was like pulling teeth to get one of them to eat at all.  I was not a fan either--the food basically crumbled to dust, and who wants to eat powder? I switched them to the Wellness salmon-based food and they LOVE that.
