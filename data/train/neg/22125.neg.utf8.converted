My dad and I love moon pies, so when father's day came I decided to order him a box. To my dismay the box came and we opened it up to find 12 melted, crushed, and smooshed moon pies that looked completely inedible. I felt horrible and was very upset at this. On top of that, my father says it tasted like they were 10 years old. I will never order this product again.
