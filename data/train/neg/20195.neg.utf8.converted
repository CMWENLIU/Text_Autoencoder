Of the other Lavazza coffees we've tried our opinion of them goes from very good to excellent so I did not hesitate to buy a can of Lavazza "drip coffee" when we needed a can of coffee in a hurry. A mistake.<br />The first thing you notice when you open the can is the color of the coffee - it's more of a cinnamon color, has an uneven course grind and looks very, very dry. After brewing a pot we found the flavor to be just awful. The flavor would best be described as sour.<br />So glad that this wasn't the first Lavazza product we'd tried as I would not have taken the chance to try the other, much more enjoyable coffees produced by them.
