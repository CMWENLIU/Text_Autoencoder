I purchased the variety pack excited to try all of the great sounding flavors, and now that I've tried them all, I'm appalled that Amazon even allows this garbage to be sold.  This is, by far, the worst coffee I've ever tried.  They all taste exactly the same.  Like dirty water with a hint of mocha.  I don't know if these are instant coffee rather than real beans like some others have tried to sell here, but this stuff is just awful.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, don't ever try this stuff.  Regardless of how cheap they make it or how appealingly their friends review it, don't waste one penny on this stuff.<br /><br />To qualify my opinion, I've tried just about every k-cup out there - thousands and thousands of k-cups have gone through my machines in my office and at home.  I can tell you which brands are stronger in general and which are weak.  I can produce a review for just about every k-cup flavor immediately, including the teas, hot chocolates, iced coffees, etc.  Really, I've tried it all.  I've even tried (and been much more satisfied with) k-cups that were expired for over two years.<br /><br />And this coffee is several notches below the worst I've ever tried.  Every flavor.  Just unbelievably bad.<br /><br />Avoid it.
