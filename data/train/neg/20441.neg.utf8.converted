I purchased this 'Premium Popcorn' about one month ago when the store in which I was shopping didn't carry Orville Redenbacher products. The 'Best By' date on the bottle was 22-Sept-2011 yet every attempt to pop this corn produced the same unpleasant result--difficult to chew with a tendency to cling to one's teeth. The bottle cap was tight at all times during storage in a dry kitchen cabinet at room temperature (nominally 68 degrees F) and the freshness/safety seal was intact when the cap was first removed. The corn was popped in a heavy bottom pot with the recommended amount of popping oil. After the first attempt to pop this corn did not turn out well, I decided to try slightly higher and slightly lower temperatures ranging above and below the recommended medium high setting.  I also tried an air popper without oil.  In each case the result was about the same.  Was the corn stale?  Had it been on the grocer's shelf too long?.  The answer to both these questions should be 'No' according to the Best By date.  Our local squirrels will enjoy the remainder of this product while I go shopping for my preferred Orville Redenbacher popcorn.
