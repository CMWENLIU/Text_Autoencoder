After finally caving into the commercials and all the rave reviews I finally caved in and bought this shampoo and conditioner, the one labeled Damage and Color Repair, it's been a month now and I just finished the bottles and I'm not at all impressed, in fact I'm disappointed and almost angry. I have fine dry hair that I color once a month, now this shampoo, wow, it strips the color right out of my hair because of all the sulfates in it. I've NEVER seen a shampoo do this to my hair before. Because of this my color faded terribly and I had to recolor my hair. The shampoo also dried my already dry hair out even MORE and caused more shedding.<br />Problem two, the conditioner, I felt like I couldn't rinse it out, I didn't use a lot, maybe a tiny little dime sized and still when I dried my hair it felt like there was still a weird sticky film in my hair that weighed my hair down, leaving my hair with no life, no shine, nothing.<br />2 stars for it being pleasant smelling and having a good bottle design.
