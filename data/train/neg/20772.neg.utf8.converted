A person I work with highly recommended it. He said he solved his mole problem with his tulips. It may work for the smaller critters but did not help with my dog or cat. I sprinkled it all around my vegetable garden and my dog didn't even notice it and I used the whole big bottle. The day after I sprinkled it the cat was sitting right in the midst of it.
