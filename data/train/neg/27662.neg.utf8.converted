I have little luck with this seed and am very disappointed. I have tried several batches and get 10-15% yield from them. I do not know if the is old seed or what the problem is. Wheatgrass will usually grow no matter what so I gotta believe the seed is not optimal. Very expensive waste of time and money for me = (
