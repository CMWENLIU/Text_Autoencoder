More than doubling the retail price is hoggish.  I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer.  I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this.  By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website.  I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up...
