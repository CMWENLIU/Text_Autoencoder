I purchased 8 jars based on reviews I read.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the ginger compared to what I get in restaurants and what I buy at the store.  The ginger was much thicker that what I considered normal and not the "pink" color I was expecting.  The taste also was not what I consider to be "premium".  Maybe I just got a sub standard batch, but I definitely would not reorder this product.
