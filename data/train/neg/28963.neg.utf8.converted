The ordering and delivery process was painless and efficient, very well handled. I do have a problem with the product! The "Original" Necco wafers they have come out with bear no resemblance to any product that I have seen in the last 63 years. The colors are washed out, muddy and difficult to tell apart! The only flavor that is distinct is in the ,now gray, Black licorice wafer,the licorice flavor is volatile and flavors the rest of the package. The rest of the flavors are too weak to compete! Another once dependable product gone to hell!
