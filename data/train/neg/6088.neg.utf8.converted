We had given our dogs (two beagles) beneful for a while.  They had *constant* gas.  We wrote it off as just normal.<br /><br />Well, we had to switch dog food brands for health reasons, and the gas stopped IMMEDIATELY!!  Do not give your dogs this dry dog food unless you own and want to constantly wear a gas mask!
