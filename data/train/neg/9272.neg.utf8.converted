This product -eg the 35 lb bag- just DOUBLED in price, from 35 to 63$ for a 35lbs bag. Strangely the price for the 17 lb bag has remained unchanged..<br /><br />Delivery was prompt (prime), but on opening the bag the rancid smell was overwhelming. Granted it is still summer, but this bag must have been in a warehouse storage for some time.<br /><br />Aside from the rancid smell, it looked as advertised, small kibble without coloring, ingredients said to be all from the US.<br /><br />However, there is no justification to grossly overcharge for it.<br /><br />I will not reorder for that reason. And because the heavy rancidity of this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Hi-Tek-Naturals-Chicken-Formula-35-Pound/dp/B004TMGRLG/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-<br />supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1348333106&sr=1-2&keywords=hi+tek+dog+food
