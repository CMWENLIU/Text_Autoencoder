Oberto should be ashamed putting out jerky like this. I am embarrassed calling this "jerky". thin, completely flavorless, aside form hints of soy sauce and STALE.  YUCK.  We used to buy a lot of oberto's jerky, though switched to turkey jerky lately....tried this,,,,,,,,,,,and NEVER AGAIN.  This jerky is garbage that even my dog would not dare chew.  Since my family of 6 all eat jerky and ALL have different taste for jerky - we end up buying a lot of different brands/types - but no one liked this one, not even remotely close.  too many other comparably priced jerky brands out there to be wasting money on this junk.
