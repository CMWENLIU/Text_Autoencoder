After reading so many glowing reviews, I was expecting a really special taste experience. It just goes to show how different people's tastes are, b/c I found it to be weak and hardly tasty at all! I brewed it on the "small cup" setting to get the strongest brew (b/c I know Gloria Jean's flavors tend to be on the weaker side) and still found it to be nearly tasteless. It doesn't have a BAD taste, just not enough taste. This is not the coffee for me. I'm just glad I got it in a sample pack and did not get stuck w/2 whole boxes!
