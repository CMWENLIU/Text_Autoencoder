The olive oil tastes OK for the price. I gave it two stars because the oil comes in a plastic bottle, which is the type of container in which cheap olive oils come in. Plastic is known to leak chemicals into the product, especially oils. This not only affects the taste but has negative health consequences. Oil should neither be stored in plastic, nor in tin cans (sometimes treated with BpA). Oil should come in glass.
