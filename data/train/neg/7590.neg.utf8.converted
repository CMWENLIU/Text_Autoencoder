I ordered this to try because of all the great reviews, but was not pleased with the outcome.  The color didn't seem to be any different than what I could get using Wilton icing coloring.  Also my icing started to separate in the bag while I was trying to decorate the cake which also made it darker than the icing I had already put on the cake.  I guess it was separating from the heat of my hands holding the bag.  I have never had this problem with the Wilton colors.  I guess I will continue to look for a coloring that can make my icing brighter and darker shades.
