By the letter of the description, the order was accurate--I got 11 "different" types of coffee. That is, if you believe that regular Donut House, Folgers Lively Columbian, regular Caribou Blend, Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade, Newman's Own Extra Bold and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend are different types of coffee. They're not. (I also got five other cups in four actual varieties: pumpkin spice, gingberbread, french toast and eggnog.) Furthermore, they all came shipped loose in a box. Again, no special packaging was promised, but I was planning this as a gift, and it's not really gift-appropriate.<br /><br />All in all, I have no grounds to stand on in asking for a refund, but this isn't what I was expecting.
