This tea used to have excellent raspberry flavor.  They have now reformulated it with white tea and it may be more healthy, but it has become flavorless.  I have asked several friends to try it and all agree it essentially has no flavor. Unfortunately, I haven't found any replacement as good as the ORIGINAL Raspberry Gardens.
