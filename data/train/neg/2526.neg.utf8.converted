I was excited when I saw the picture of this plant and the price.  Even with shipping being a lot more than the cost of the plant itself, the overall price I thought was still a steal.  Then the plant showed up today.  Yes, it's the same kind of plant but it looks like a little baby version.  Nowhere near as big and full as the picture.  It's EXTREMELY misleading.  I would have given this one star for being so misleading instead of two, but if I hold onto the plant long enough and take care of it, someday it may look o.k.  It's a nice plant for $4.95, but I would not have paid this plus shipping to get a plant this small if I had known.<br /><br />Update - I reread the information in the plant description, and it does say the plant delivered is not pictured, so I apparantly missed that.  However, it is kind of buried and still slightly deceiving.  Very nice plant though and I found a great pot for it - just don't expect anything huge to start with.
