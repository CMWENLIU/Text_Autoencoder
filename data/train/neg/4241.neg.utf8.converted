When most reviews are so  good, I tend to be suspect of the  rare poor one. Unfortunately, after trusting the good reviews (and figuring the negative one was an outlyer of sorts), I purchased this ginger.  Extremely disappointed!  It is very thick - which to me is not a problem. But, it is unusually hot...I've never had HOT ginger before (spicy -yes,fire HOT- no).  Moreover, the balance of the spices/ingredients is just weird, leading to a very nasty bitter... almost chemical, lingering aftertaste, which I'm attributing to possibly (??) the type of or an overuse of preservative, since the nasty aftertaste isn't consistent with any of the common ingredients. If you must, try it for yourself (as did I), but be forewarned. Hopefully, I'll be able to send it back and get my return shipping reimbursed. This is NOTHING like the wonderful ginger served in a restaurant with sushi.
