This did not have any likeness to Lemon Verbena and was very disappointing. Taste like Lipton tea to me.  There is no Lemon Aroma which is one of the best parts of drinking this tea.<br /><br />Also, my husband hates Lemon Verbena tea and this tea doesn't seem bother him.  It's so plain.  So I don't know what they put in there.  Makes me wonder if I should even drink it.  Yeesh.<br /><br />I am glad I also purchased the plant along with this bag tho, at least I can have the aroma of Lemon Verbena while I wait for my leaves to grow...  Will not purchase from this company again.
