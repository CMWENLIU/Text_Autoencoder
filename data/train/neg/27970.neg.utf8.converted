Wow I'm not sure what Chai people are used to drinking but this is not good.  I couldn't even stomach more than 2 sips before I had to throw out the rest.  Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the k cups I have left.  I was really wishing that these things would turn out great so I could save money on the coffee shops but this one is a no go.  Please don't waste your money.  It leaves a horrible after taste and definitely taste like dehydrated nastiness.  Save your money and buy some regular tea and poor milk in it, it will by far taste better than this stuff.
