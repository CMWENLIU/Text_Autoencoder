I have been a huge fan of Jack Links beef sticks, and thought this might be a larger version.  Boy, was I wrong.  It was extremely greasy, not very tasty and difficult to chew.  I gave up trying to eat them after two sticks.  I just couldn't take it.  I'll stick to the regular Jack Links beef sticks from now on.
