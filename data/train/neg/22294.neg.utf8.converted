We thought we were doing a good thing by going green with our garbage bags, and unfortunately, these don't work.  They tear SO easily, the only way to avoid a tear is if you filled it only with laundry lint or something equally weightless.  Almost every single time I have pulled this bag out of my garbage can to take it out to the trash, it has ripped.  Then, if I do ever manage to get it out of the can in one piece, it then rips when I try to tie the top in a knot.  Great concept, poor execution.
