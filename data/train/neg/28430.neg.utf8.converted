so my family was looking for something similar to peanut butter but w/o the peanuts.  we were also looking for something that did not use roasted nuts b/c roasting is not as healthy compared to raw nuts.  after looking on amazon i came across this brand.  i wanted to find out more about how it was prepared so i wrote to their customer service on their website. after you submit you question a friendly message pops up basically saying "we'll reply within 24-48 hours" etc.<br /><br />days passed.  no reply.  so i try another time.  more days pass. again no reply.<br /><br />since we wanted to order some soon i go ahead and buy some based on the picture they posted on amazon.  i trusted that their picture listed an accurate portrayal of their item they were selling.  the picture did not show anything about roasted nuts.  well we get the item in and open it up.  what do i see?  their packaging changed.  on the front of the label lists roasted and blanched nuts.<br /><br />as far as taste? nothing exceptional. tastes just like all the other stuff we've bought before.  needless to say we wont be buying this product again.<br /><br />ps. we bought this item on july 3rd and have yet to get a reply from this company.  i would have to say that their "customer support" is truly pathetic.
