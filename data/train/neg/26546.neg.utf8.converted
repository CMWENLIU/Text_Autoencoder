Equal and NutraSweet were the exact same product, with the same exact ingredient, made by the exact same company. Consumer Reports blew that cover a few years ago.<br /><br />Next time you go to a grocery store, look at a box of both of them and note the company and address on both boxes!  Note the ingredients and amount of product per box is exactly the same.<br /><br />The ONLY difference is that the company charges DOUBLE for the Equal than it does for the NutraSweet!<br /><br />Even Consumer Reports never got an answer from the company as to WHY that is.<br /><br />Since then, the company that produces Aspartame is no longer "Searle" (then headed by CEO Donald Rumsfeld!) but instead Monsanto, the same company that produced the toxic "agent orange" for Vietnam!<br /><br />If you are looking for a substitute natural sweetener, because you are a diabetic, then STEVIA should be something to look into. Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a "sweetener" it has to be labeled a "nutritional suppliment" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />One thing to remember.  Aspartame (Equal & NutraSweet) Sucralose (Splenda) AcesuflameK and Sacharin all have WARNING labels on them.  Stevia does NOT.  Because only Stevia is natural, the others are harmfull man-made chemicals.
