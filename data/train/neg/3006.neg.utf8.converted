I discovered Nutrisoda a couple years ago on a cruise to Hawaii.  I was delighted to find it available here on Amazon when I got home.  I ordered several cases of the assorted "rainbow" flavors and was a happy camper UNTIL Nutrisoda changed everything  -  the cans and the flavors!  The "new" flavors, even if they call them by the same names as the originals, are NOT the same.  There are fewer flavors - only four as opposed to the original seven, and these newer sodas, even with the same names, do not taste anywhere as good as the originals.  My favorite was this one  -  the Energize  -  but it's just not the same drink that was in the pretty orange can.  Not sure why Nutrisoda decided to make the changes, but I'm not buying any more.
