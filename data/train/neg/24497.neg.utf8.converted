I love figs, fresh and dried, and I've loved every Oskri product I've tried...until this one. The expiration date says 2012, but either I had a bad batch or these bars were intended to taste very bitter and sour. They're not sweet at all and even kind of burned in my throat on the way down.  I am not in any way a picky eater, but this is definitely one of the worst foods I've ever experienced.  Don't say you weren't warned.
