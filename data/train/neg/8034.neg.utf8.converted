I've been purchasing this item from Digit pet for quite a while, I have spent hundreds of dollars on these treats. This last shipment the treats were discolored and they did not smell right. I was not going to risk my dog's health. I called Digit pet to let them know this batch was defective and/or old. They said I could return the item but I had to pay for the shipping to return to them. Seeing that I was a long term customer, I think they should have sent me a return label and covered the shipping expense to return the item. I asked if they had to pay shipping to return this item to their vendor, and she said no. At this point I will not purchase from them again, they just lost a very good customer.<br />dissastified customer
