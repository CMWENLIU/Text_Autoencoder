I enjoy rooibos tea very much and drink it all the time.  Usually loose tea is fresher and better tasting.  I was wrong.  This tastes like stale wood shavings.  I think this sat around in a warehouse for a while.  Odd that Amazon did not have this product in the "leave feedback" email I received.  I had to do a little search to leave this post.
