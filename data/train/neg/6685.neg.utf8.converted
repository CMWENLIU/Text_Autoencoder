I must be genetically able to taste a chemical in this product that the people who gave it stars can not.<br /><br />This substance tastes like screaming death.<br /><br />The chocolate I could at least swallow, my body rejected this whole sale.<br /><br />"Walden Farms" is a lie.  There was no farm even remotely involved in the production of this product.  There is nothing in it that is food.
