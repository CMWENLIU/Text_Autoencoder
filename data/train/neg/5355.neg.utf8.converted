I like Dunkin Donuts, Starbux, peets, and pure Kona coffee (for weekends, when I can enjoy the cup). 8 O'clock Coffee is horrible. It tastes like office coffee, even when freshly brewed. It has a rough texture, unsatisfying aroma, and very light beans in general. I'm giving away the coffee for free becuase it's horrible.
