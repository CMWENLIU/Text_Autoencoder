after reading all the reviews, I thought this is a good to buy, after it arrived, I gave it to my son who is 7 month old, but he doesnt like it at all.  Then I found out it is too dry for his mouth.  I tried it by myself, the taste is ok, no suger taste which is great.  It reminds me what I had when I was little back to china.  However, I can find the same stuff in a nearby chinese store for much cheaper price.  If you have any chinese store nearby, I dont see any reason to have it for this expensive price.
