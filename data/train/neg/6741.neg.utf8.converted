I guess we got a stale batch- the product was still supposed to be good, according to the "sell by" date.  This was the worst dried fruit product I have ever had.  It was very tough- like real leather, instead of fruit leather.  We like the Cliffs fruit ropes, and the Target organic fruit leather (always soft and delicious), and I will never take a chance on this brand again.
