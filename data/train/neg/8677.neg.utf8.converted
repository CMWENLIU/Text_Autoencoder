We ended up in urgent care last night and I'm 99% sure this product is why. We fed it to him two weeks ago mixed with breastmilk and he loved it! However, hours later he threw up a couple of times. It wasn't a large amount so I wasn't too concerned, however we decided to wait another 2 weeks to try again as he just turned 5 months old. We tried sweet potatoes a week later instead of cereal and he did fine with them for 6 days so we decided to give cereal another shot so he could get the iron from it. Well, about 2-3 hours after eating the cereal he got really sweaty/clammy and threw up a MASSIVE amount of vomit to the point he was throwing up bright green/yellow bile. I called the on-call doctor as this was in the evening and she said that if he threw up again to go to urgent care or the ER. He threw up again at home and once again in the waiting room at urgent care. The nurse checked his vitals and wasn't sure what his problem was and sent us home and just told us to push fluids. He nursed fine all last night and today and hasn't thrown up since. I'm throwing this crap out. I thought I was being a good mommy by getting "organic whole grain brown rice" cereal. I probably would've been better off with Gerber. If I try rice again, I'm going to mill it myself! But, I'm honestly kind of scared to even try it again after the nightmare we went through last night.
