The product, as listed, is a CASE of 24, 1.5 ounce boxes of pudding mix.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to find ONE box (1.5 ounce, 6 servings) instead of the expected 24.  This leads to a call to Amazon with a customer service representative who unfortunately didn't know what Jell-O pudding was and was having a hard time understanding that there had been an error in the number of items shipped.  Ummmm...<br />who would pay $30 for six 1/2 cup servings of pudding???  This was finally understood and another order was placed (kindly, they did not require me to return the single box of pudding).  Low and behold, several days later the package arrives... AGAIN another single box of pudding instead of a case of 24 boxes.  Another phone call to Amazon, another rep who doesn't quite understand but finally decides to just credit me for the order and not require that I return the single package.  It was decided that we would not try to place the order again, as it would appear the warehouse has a problem filling orders for this item.  I orderd the chocolate flavor case of 24 and it arrived without problem... a carton of 24 boxes of pudding mix, as expected.
