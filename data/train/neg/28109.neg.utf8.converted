I don't understand why some of the other people rated this product high. After making tea out of both of the packages I got only slightly murky tea. The results were mild, almost like seeds bought from Safeway. Maybe they started washing the seeds recently but I was really disappointed. Buy these only if you will cook with them. I wanted to complain to Frontier but then I realized they ll probably say that these are not meant for making tea.<br /><br />Will not order again unless they assure me that these are truly whole, unprocessed seeds. Such a waste of money.
