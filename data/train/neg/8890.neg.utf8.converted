Living like trillionaires, for what the high cost of Keeblers is. I found that the taste was a bit better than the store brand and there is no question to that, but the cost is just not worth the small difference.<br /><br />I wouldnt suggest a hit and run over one elve,  may decrease the cost as there productivity should go up with fewer working elves.You know like the rest of us in this country, that need to work ten times as hard, to just make ends meet.
