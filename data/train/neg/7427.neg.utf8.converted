I was so excited to finally find this candy this year because it is my guilty pleasure from childhood and I could not find it locally this year.  I bit the bullet and ordered two bags for $11.50 with my Prime shipping.  When the box arrived the package was WAY smaller and so were the eggs.  For the price and quanity you would think this was a premium candy.  I am very disappointed with Brach's this Easter season and not sure I will ever buy these again.
