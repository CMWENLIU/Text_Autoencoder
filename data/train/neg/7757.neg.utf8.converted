I have been buying Friskies dry cat food, mainly their seafood flavor but sometimes others, for 4+ years. My cats liked the taste and for the cheap price compared to others I was satisfied.<br />Until they changed the bag design, that is. I say bag because that is what the label said. "different bag, same great taste" or something like that.  When I picked the bag up from Target, I had expected to see the same food I had always bought.  When I opened it, I quickly realized this was not the same food.  The shapes were the same, but the colors were noticeably brighter and more vibrant.  It was eye-appealing, but apparently not taste-appealing.<br /><br />My cats barely touched it, one of them didn't eat it at all.  And when they munched it down reluctantly, they threw up and got diarrhea. ALL of them. We had to throw the junk out and buy a bag of something else.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my lack of money has forced be to purchase Friskies on and off frequently over the past year, though I no longer buy that flavor, OR the flavor of the bright orange bag. The other flavors seem a bit milder, and the cats only throw up every once in awhile, though they still get cases of diarrhea too often. If I had enough money I'd check them out at the vet (along with getting the cat-food tested).  Recently though I found another bag of dried cat-food that was a bit cheaper than Friskies and there's been a definite improvement in their stools since they tried it. No one has thrown-up. I may just stick with this one.<br /><br />I've looked up information about Friskies, and while I never expected them to be top-quality for the cheap price, I was more or less disturbed by the constant complaints customers had.  Almost every site I looked at concerning Friskies had people saying their cats died or were throwing up/getting diarrhea. Calling the company does little good, as their standard reply seems to be: "orly? This is first we've ever heard about it!"
