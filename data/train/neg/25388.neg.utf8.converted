I much prefer the original Cholula hot sauce. This variant adds a heavy dose of lime to what was and is a good hot sauce.  Buy the original hot sauce and if you want to add some lime -- then add it yourself. At the very least, then you can control the amount of lime added.<br /><br />The original Cholula hot sauce was and is quite successful and for good reason -- it is really tasty. Unfortunately some marketing "genius" came up with a lime and garlic version of the original sauce. In both cases ---  the lime or garlic versions are so heavy handed that they obscure the finer nature of the underlying sauce.<br /><br />Try the original version before even considering these heavy handed variants.<br /><br />PS: Watch out for high shipping charges that do not decrease even if you are purchasing multiple bottles at the same time! Review the final shipping charges before you check out here on Amazon. They may be much higher than you where lead to believe. Some companies on Amazon attempt to profit by offering very low prices combined with very high shipping charges. Buyer be aware!
