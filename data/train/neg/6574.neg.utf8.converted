I love this tea and drink several cups daily.  I just bought 4 packages of Freshpak rooibos tea with an expiration date of Dec 18, 2009.  These are packaged differently and do not reference South Africa on the top.  The taste is very different however!  The tea is much milder and actually a bit sweet.  I am very disappointed that the formulation seems to have been changed.
