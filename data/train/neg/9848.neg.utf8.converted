I'm sure this stuff tastes fine, based on other reviewers, but my mistake was in assuming this came in a #10 can like other powdered milk products I've purchased in the past. 400gms in the can and 17 servings per container works out to $1 US dollar for a 14oz glass of milk.<br /><br />Do the math!!...Crown Royal & Coke is cheaper than that for a tasty adult beverage.<br /><br />Couldn't believe it when the smallish package arrived for my 4 cans, and they are as big as the smallest coffee cans you see at the grocery stores. Oughta return it, but too much hassle. Live and learn<br /><br />I realize this is a European (Holland) company, but you'd think Amazon would show actual US measure - size of the container...and info on # of servings this item will provide.<br /><br />Fool me once....
