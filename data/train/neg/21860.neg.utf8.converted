I received this item in record time, but the item looked like some one had took a rolling pin to it and beat the crap out of the candy!! I had a hand full that survived the shipping process. So much for decorating with them. Now I have to find a different seller who ships their candy in the appropriate packaging for such a fragile item.  I would not recommend this item.  I am one upset baker!
