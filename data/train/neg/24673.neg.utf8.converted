I love pumpkin seeds.  I love them so much I never thought a company that claims to offer them "simply" could ruin them.  "Go Raw" is probably a company filled with nice people, but I found this product absolutely disgusting -- that's how salty it was.  I didn't want to finish even the 1st handful of these pumpkin seeds; and after forcing myself to try several handfuls in case the first one was not representative of the whole bag, that was it.  No more for me!  I tried to give them away to other "healthy eaters" amongst my friends -- & I didn't tell any of them what I disliked about these pumpkin seeds, either.  Turns out I didn't have to.  Each one discovered the problem on his/her first try, too.<br /><br />Hence no one wanted them any more than I did.<br /><br />Any food this salty IS "junk food" -- and EXPENSIVE junk food, at that.
