I ordered because it was supposed to be a variety of 25 different flavors without ordering 25 boxes. However, I only received 20 different flavors not counting the ones that technically are same flavor just a decaf version. I also received 4 of one pod when I thought it could have been a little more diverse. The product did not match the description given and that's what is disappointing. I would have at least like to have been shipped what I thought I was paying for and not ripped off about 5 more flavors to make the most of the variety. With that being said, I do not think I will be ordering from amazon again.
