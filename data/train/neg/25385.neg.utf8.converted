I love the lime/chili flavor combo, bought this popcorn thinking it would satisfy my craving. I was wrong. The popcorn has a faint lime/chili taste and smells awful. In addition for the 5 bucks total with shipping, you only get 1 bag. Actually for that I should be thankful because now I don't have to throw out 15 bags of b.o.
