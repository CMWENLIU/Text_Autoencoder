I love the idea, a flavoring for water. I try to drink a lot of water and usually add a large splash of pure, unsweetened fruit juice (Trader Joe's Cranberry, Pomegranate, Blueberry, etc.) to a large glass of water.<br /><br />This product has the look and taste of Hawaiian Punch but since there is no sugar, to me the artificial sweetener is over powering and off-putting. Given that the current medical understanding is that daily vitamin supplements do not help and maybe harmful, the only reason to drink this product would be for the Caffeine it contains.<br /><br />Back to the real thing for me.
