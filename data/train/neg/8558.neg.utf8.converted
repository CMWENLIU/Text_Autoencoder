When in the hell did this coffee skyrocket it's prices??<br />Previously we had bought some for the same price as all their other flavors (around 36 bucks or so).<br />Now this medium roast is over 95 dollars for the same thing?? WTF?!<br />This just totally stops me from ever getting this brand again.<br />Heck, it's cheaper in the long run to switch over to another style of coffee maker (with the small cups)<br />and forego this.  I don't know what caused this price increase but I am willing to bet it will kill sales.
