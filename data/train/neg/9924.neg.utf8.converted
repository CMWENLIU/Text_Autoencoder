I subscribe to "Subscibe and Save"  the price for this product at the time was about $43.00.  AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF WAITING FOR THIS PRODUCT. Amazon shipped 15 cases to me without notifing me that the price was now $70.00.  They should have least do a courtsey email informing me of the price and giving me a choice to cancel order.  NOW I AM STUCK WITH 15 CASES AND NO WAY OF RETURNING THE PRODUCT...THAT TRULY SUCKS....<br /><br />AMAZON THIS IS UNFAIR...THE CUSTOMER SHOULD BE INFORM OF A PRICE CHANGE...<br /><br />I AM VERY UPSET AND WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN
