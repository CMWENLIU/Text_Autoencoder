I read that you must make sure to wear your face mask while performing the simple operation of mixing this stuff. You don't want to be something that makes your blood clot abnormally. It is transglutaminase, an enzyme in powder form, derived from beef and pork blood plasma. Europe has banned this. Do you want to be eating it either?<br /><br />Frankenstein food. Scary stuff. I see why more and more people are going vegan and not regretting it either.
