this is  a herbal tea from the mellow bush. I do drink herbal teas, and like them, however this one I dislike. There was no sothing vanilla for me. When the hot water hit the tea the strong scent of Licorice came about. I still steeped and added agave and tried it. Unfortunately all I could taste was Licorice and I had to discard mine. I prefer these red rooibos teas.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027MGQN4">Twinings Of London African Rooibos Red Tea(pack Of 20)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SATGHK">Davidson's Organic Tea South African Rooibos, 100-Count Tea Bags</a>
