I was ready to give these bars a middling review based on taste, until I read the ingredients.  That was the end for me, but I'll come back to that later.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the crust around the fruit filling resembles a pop tart.  Not my idea of a quality product I'd want to imitate.  The crust is dry with not much flavor except sweetness.  The filling is even more disappointing  - also dry, thin and not really tasting of blueberry at all, but also sweet.  So, OK, the flavor is mediocre at best.  But, if you want a portable sweet snack, I thought these bars might be acceptable in limited quantity.<br /><br />But then I looked at the ingredients and it was all over.  What are the FIRST TWO ingredients?  high fructose corn syrup and sugar.  Well, that accounts for the sweetness without much other flavor.<br /><br />So the bottom line is:  Poor flavor and hazardous to your health.  It doesn't get much worse than that.<br /><br />Zero stars if I could, but, in Amazon's system, one star is what I give.
