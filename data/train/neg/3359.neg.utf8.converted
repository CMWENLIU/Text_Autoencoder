Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for making a great cherry pie using these cherries. Sour cherries are hard to come by where I live.  However, I was very disappointed.  The cherries are a light, pinkish color and are bland and tasteless. I followed the recipe directions inside the label for cherry pie filling, but it still came out a little watery.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think I'll try making cherry pie again unless I can get my hands on some fresh cherries.
