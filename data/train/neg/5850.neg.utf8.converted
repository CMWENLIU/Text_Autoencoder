I bought the vanilla, orange, mango, lemon and peach flavors of these.  They are OKAY in hot foods - I used them in herbal teas and to punch up my orange chicken.  However, these were only good in hot foods and in very small quantities.  They were extremely bitter and were completely useless in cold foods because even a couple drops made the item so bitter the food was inedible.  Even in hot foods the bitterness came out after a couple drops.  Save your money and use a better brand like truvia and just flavor your food with pure extracts from the baking aisle.  No bitterness and you get to control the level of flavor.
