After watching a popular health show on TV recently, I decided to order cactus jelly for its health benefits. I did not find much flavor in it. Perhaps the actual " cactus" flavor IS super sweet, or maybe cactus just has little flavor.  I have not compared this brand with any other, similar product, so I cannot say if this is a good or bad representation of what cactus jelly is like. I read an article that described the flavor of prickly pear cactus to " cold green beans", so maybe sweet and bland is better than a green bean taste on my toast! I also doubt that there is as much healthy stuff in this once it is turned into jelly. I will seek a different product in the future.
