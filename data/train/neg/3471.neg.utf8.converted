I have ordered Madhava Agave nectar many times and never had a problem, but in this order a couple of the bottles had a black grainy substance in them.  I don't know what it was so I threw them out. I have tried to contact the company and Amazon, but no one has returned my emails.  I hope either the company or Amazon corrects this problem as I really love this product, but it is too expensive to be able to throw a bottle in the trash.
