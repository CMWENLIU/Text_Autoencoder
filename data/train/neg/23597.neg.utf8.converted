Cafe Verona is my favorite of the Starbucks coffees and I was delighted to see it available in K Kups; however, I do not understand why the price is so high on Amazon when it's available at Costco for $34.95 for the 54 count package.  This price difference boggles my mind.  I've also noticed the Starbucks KKups available in grocery stores for a lower price per unit than Amazon.  This is why I gave the product one star only.
