After having the privilege to test Emerald's Marcona Almonds, I was very much looking forward to testing their Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews.  In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible.<br /><br />My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper.  There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts.<br /><br />I love cashews.  I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years.  This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds.<br /><br />The salt with citric acid combination is terrible.  When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition.  Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse.  A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth.  It is almost repulsive.<br /><br />The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well.<br /><br />I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way.<br /><br />I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more.  The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter.  I do not like these at all.<br /><br />If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these.  However, if you love cashews and prefer the seasonings to COMPLIMENT them instead of overpower them, pass on these.
