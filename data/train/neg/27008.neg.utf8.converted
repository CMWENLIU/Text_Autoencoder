A friend gave me a sample of this product and I liked it, so I purchased two bags.  What a disappointment! The sticks are unevenly sized (some very thin, some very thick, some tall, some short) and smell awful, even through the sealed plastic bag!  When my dogs chew them, we can't stand to be in the same room, because the whole room stinks.  I don't know why the sticks from the bag I sampled were evenly sized and smelled fine and this order was so different.  I will look elsewhere for bully sticks from now on as I need to be able to depend on the quality of the product.  My friend also ordered a bag with the same poor results and won't be buying from this company again either.
