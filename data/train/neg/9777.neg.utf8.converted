I purchased this product shortly after being diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I have to agree with the other reviewers concerning the taste and texture of this syrup - it's amazing! BUT, for those of us who follow a strict diet and have an understanding of the glycemic index - the maltitol syrup used in this product has a GI of 75 ( table sugar = 100 )- which means that a sharp rise in blood sugar can be noted after consuming even a normal serving size of this syrup. The first time I used it I was very upset by my blood sugar test results 2 hours after eating but attributed the rise to the sugar in the pancake mix. The second time I used it, I had the same result but this time there was no sugar in the french toast....... So if you are only trying to use this product to lose or control your WEIGHT, then I'd say go for it. But diabetics, be cautious, and check your blood sugar levels.
