This cereal is made in the same facility as wheat containing raisin bran. The amount of gluten in it appears to be low, but it was enough to cause a family member to miss 40 hours of work over a several week period!<br />What really makes me angry about this cereal is that the info on the box makes it seem that Erewhon is a small family owned company dedicated to healthy products.  It may have been at one time, but Erewhon is now owned by U S Mills and they are NOT dedicated to your health. It took weeks to figure out what was making our family sick, because I trusted the brand...BIG MISTAKE. If you want to be strictly gluten free, DON'T EAT THIS CEREAL!
