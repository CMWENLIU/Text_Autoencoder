ALTHOUGH THIS TEA TASTES GREAT, THE BAGS ARE VERY FLIMSY.  WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED, I SAW LOOSE TEA UNDER THE CELLOPHANE.  I OPENED THE BOX AND FOUND SEVERAL OPEN BAGS.  I STAPLED THEM SHUT AND HOPE THEY WORK.  THEN I CHECKED ALL THE OTHER BAGS AND THEY LOOKED OK UNTIL I PUT THEM IN WATER.  SO FAR, I HAVE 7 BAGS THAT SPLIT OPEN WHEN PUT IN WATER.  I MAKE SUN TEA AND I HAVE TO STRAIN EACH BATCH BEFORE USING.  SO IF YOU DON'T MIND STRAINING 50% OR MORE BATCHES OF TEA, BUY THIS PRODUCT, IF NOT, DON'T.
