I ordered these noodles in bulk after trying them out first. I really like the taste of them especially when I add spaghetti sauce. I would not recommend ordering in bulk, unless you plan to eat them all in a month. My entire box had an expiration date approximately two months after I purchased them. I ended up sharing them with friends so that I didn't have to throw them out, when my intention was to have it for months of meals. I rated them on the low end only because of the early expiration date.
