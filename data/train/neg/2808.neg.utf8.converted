They taste fine, but don't be fooled by the package into thinking this is American-grown and natural. It all looks good - "Woodstock Farms" name, company based in Connecticut, bucolic image of a rustic farmhouse, "Caring about the Land" slogan, all the pseudo-natural, pseudo-green trappings companies use to hook you into buying a product that's not as good for you or the environment as you could wish. I doubt that Woodstock Farms has any actual control over how these pumpkin seeds are grown or processed, and we all know from the news that China isn't overly concerned with food quality control or truth-in-labeling. I will avoid all Woodstock Farms products from now on.<br />I will also not buy any more food products off Amazon unless it is explicitly stated where the food was grown.
