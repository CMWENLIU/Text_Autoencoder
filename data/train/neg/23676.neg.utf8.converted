I had no idea a product could be so bad.  I bought 24 cans when they were on sale for $29.  The label says "chunk."  If I ran canned tuna in my food processor for a minute, I could not get the pieces any smaller.  I call them pieces, but it really is a tuna puree.  The taste resembles tuna, but honestly after a dozen cans or of varying uses, the thought of eating this stuff was so revolting that I put the unopened cans in the garbage.
