Just a word of warning?<br /><br />Lots of celiacs have trouble with this--it will depend on how sensitive you are to gluten.  Bob's Red Mill is probably legally gluten-free--20 ppm, or close to it--but it makes enough people sick that you have to wonder.<br /><br />If you are still getting sick and you are eating this, or you are feeding this to a gluten-free kid who is still getting sick, either you and a substantial portion of celiacs on various websites are ultra-sensitive to the small amounts of gluten in this, or it's not actually gluten-free.
