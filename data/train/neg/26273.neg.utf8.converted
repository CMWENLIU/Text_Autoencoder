Unbelievable. I don't know if this water actually comes from Fiji but I do know that anyone who would buy it is a fool. Not only is it ridiculously expensive, but the environmental impact is unconscionably high. You've got not only the plastic bottle, which will be around virtually forever, but you cause water - WATER!!! - to be shipped from the other side of the world to you. Which do you think is greater... the number of gallons of water moved or the number of gallons of fuel burned in this preposterous venture?
