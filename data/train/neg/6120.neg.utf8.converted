Picked up a bag of this on recommendation from the lady at our neighborhood pet store.<br /><br />This litter consists of large sawdust pellets that are too big to fall through the scooper, and as soon as they get wet, they disintegrate into damp sawdust that smells rather piny and neutral, but is impossible to scoop because it doesn't clump whatsoever. This is the opposite of how I want my litter to act. The dirty stuff falls through the scoop, while the clean stuff gets stuck in it?<br /><br />I don't think my cats like the damp sawdust either. They ended up peeing on their bed even though this litter was "clean".
