I've only been on a gluten free diet for four months, so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid.  The worst part is that Amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this.  I'd put it out for the squirrels but I'm not sure they'd eat it.  If you're expecting something that tastes anything like bread, you're in for a shock.
