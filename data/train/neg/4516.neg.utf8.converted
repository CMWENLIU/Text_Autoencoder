I am German but have lived in the United States for almost 13 years now. It truly pains me to see what Haribo has decided to sell here in the US under the "Gold-Bears" brand. Anyone who has ever tasted the real thing will know immediately how fake these are - by simply looking at them!<br />You can tell right away that their German tagline "No artificial flavors or colors" does NOT apply here.<br /><br />Imported from Turkey? If you're going to ship all the way from over there, why not give the American consumer something worthwhile...?
