They changed the size of the box from 16oz to 13.5.  A drop of about 20%.  Its the lack of integrity that concerned me.  If the price of something is going to increase, state it.  Don't lower the quantity and keep the price the same.  It is a insult to our intelligence.  I called dreamfields and was told that most consumers aren't as aware as i am.  Wel. AMERICA, BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY.  That is a 2.5 oz difference.  Out of 16, that is a lot.  Buy something else.  If a company can decide that i would be stupid enough to not notice, well, guess what, i did.  Now, they lost a customer because of their corporate Greed.
