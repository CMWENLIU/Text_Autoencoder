I started on the hcg diet recently and thought miracle noodles would be my favorite thing. I can eat pasta by itself and really like ramen noodles as well. These noodles have a fishy smell and are slimy. I bought 8 packs and had to throw 7 away. I tried them with grilled chicken but they arent very good at absorbing other flavors. I wouldnt recommend buying them.
