and this Brand is simply the worst. i normally get this type of product at Trader Joes, but it's been sometime since they carried Soy Jerky. i did find them here on Amazon. i tried the Tasty Eats soy jerky first. this is very good (the flavors i've tried). then i order this brand (Spice of Life Meatless Jerky) and Primal Strips. the Primal Strips are prettie good. the texture is a tad oily. now the Spice of Life MJ has a great texture, but the taste is really bitter and strong. my Children love regular Beef Jerky and they really like the Tasty Eats Soy Jerky, but they simply hated this brand. my son even said he almost throw-up. i do not recommend this product. stinks for me, because i ordered a box (24 packs). live and learn, right?
