Watch out for the "new and improved taste" inscription on the package! I really liked Eclipse Spearmint gum, until they came up a couple of months ago with a "new improved taste" which is incredibly bad compared to the "old" one. I returned mine for a full refund. Funny thing is, the barcode on the package remained the same although now the gum tastes like ****, or, to put it mildly, like a completely new product. What were they thinking?!
