I purchased the hazelnut pods and the coffee tastes great, however, some pods open up while brewing allowing grinds to get in your coffee as well as all over your coffee maker. I had to run water through the coffeemaker 2 or 3 times to clean it out. As much as I like the coffee, I won't purchase again as I've never had this issue before with other coffee brands.
