I was suckered into buying these cause it was the only ones i saw in a store one time that said they were San Marzano.  THEY ARENT!  let me repeat THEY ARENT.<br />You have to double check, like i did after using these... cause I have used other San Marzano tomatoes before in the past and they were delicious and sweet and packed with flavor.  These were acidic, bordering on no flavor and even their color was way off compared to the real ones.<br />These said they were grown in Canada... Im sorry but Canada is not Italy, you need to have the ones from the San Marzano region where they are grown and have an official seal from the government of Italy to say they are "True" San Marzano tomatoes.  I went to another store and noticed that Cento have that seal, if you dont believe me, Google it... cause it will show what seals need to be there from the Italian Government.  The Cento brand are quite good the money, i paid $3.50 a can for those compared to the $4.19 for these fake ones.  They are great for sauces or even just put straight on Pizza with a little sea salt.  Save your money and buy another brand, even if its a bit more expensive, its worth the cost to get the real deal.
