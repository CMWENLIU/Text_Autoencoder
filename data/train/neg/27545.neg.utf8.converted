I have ordered 24 pack of red bull on May 6th 2009, and received it today, but was shocked to see that all 24 cans are already being expired on May 1st 2009. I would highly recommend to please check your order before using. I have no idea if I can be able to get my money back. I will try to give DAB a call on Monday and will post back if they admit their mistake or refund my money. (I have to give one star for their prompt delivery)
