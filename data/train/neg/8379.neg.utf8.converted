Not only will my eight cats not go near this stuff, neither will the neighbor's cats or strays in the neighborhood.  It seems they like to lick off the gravy and leave the rest.  The possum finally ate it, but only after hesitation.  I don't know what it is about this product or its dry counterpart, but my cats would rather starve.  Will not be buying either again.
