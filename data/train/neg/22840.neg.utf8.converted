Wow! I bought this recently and I can't believe how much salt is in this vinegar.<br />2 teaspoons contain 1050mgs of sodium ..<br />The plums are picked in brine before vinegar is made.<br /><br />Way to much salt for me.<br /><br />I would like to have seen the ingredient/nutrition label prior to buying.
