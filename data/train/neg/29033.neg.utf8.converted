Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the four cans received were badly dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where undamaged merchandise can be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service.
