At first glance, the Snackalicious Food Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets looks like your average snackable goodie basket, complete with various nuts, cookies, pretzels, cheese, dried sausage and candy.<br /><br />It's upon closer inspection that we realized that many of the items have in fact been repackaged with tacky glossy paper featuring inferior color Xeroxes of the original labels, poorly wrapped around repurposed cartons.<br /><br />In other words, the ill-fitting glossy paper with the obviously reproduced MmmmPop! All Natural White Cheddar Popcorn label is barely concealing a reused box of Nabisco Wheat Thins Stix.  Open that up and you'll find a tiny bag of the promised popcorn.<br /><br />Peel back the paper with the color printer copy of Wege of Hanover Sourdough Hards Pretzels and you'll find an old, taped-up box of Cheez-Its, inside of which is a small package of the pretzels.  And lurking behind the paper packaging of the All Natural Fleur De Sel Caramels from France?  Mmmm--a box of irresistible Crystal Light Energy drink Mix.  Inside that are a handful of the advertised caramels.<br /><br />If all this tacky repurposing was part of some green recycling initiative on the part of Back Mountain, then they should have included a note that explained their company philosophy.  But there's no such note--just the feeling that they simply used other boxes so they'd stand up better in the baskets/look more substantial/disguise the fact that some of the items have been divvied up from cost-saving bulk packaging.<br /><br />The end result is something that looks like it was assembled in your own kitchen rather than something you'd order from a presumed legitimate company with the intention of sending to someone as a respectable gift.
