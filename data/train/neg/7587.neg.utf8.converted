Really excited when it got her today, then I opened it up! All but two were buffalo. One was wild boar and the last one was rotten moldy Elk. Yum. Thank you Amazon for refunding my money at least!! I selected two day shipping, so it got here fast. Please explain how something dehydrated goes putrid in two days? My guess is they didn't even attempt to look at it before throwing it into a box.
