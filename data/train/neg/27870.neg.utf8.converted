I purchased 6 vanilla beans from Halaleveryday. There is nothing plump or fresh about the product that was shipped to me. The beans arrived dry and brittle. There is no way to cut the bean open and scrape the pods out. To add insult to injury, the customer service was rude and smarmy when contacted about a refund. Beware!
