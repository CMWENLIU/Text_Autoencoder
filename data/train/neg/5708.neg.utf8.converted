I have had a venti white chocolate mocha (skim milk, no whipped cream) every morning at Starbucks for the last six years. After I bought a espresso machine, three weeks ago, I thought about making my own white chocolate mocha at home; so I decided to buy this product.<br />This morning I read the instructions on the bottle and put two table-spoons of that chocolate in my cup of coffee... Then, three, four and, finally, some sugar to add some flavor. I put over 250 calories in my coffee for nothing. I never got white chocolate flavor at all.<br />I am, to say the least, disappointed and, definitely, I will never buy (or recommend) this product again.
