Like many of the recent reviewers here, I was also a long-time subscriber of this coconut milk.  I can also confirm that my case originated from Sri Lanka; not Thailand like all the previous orders.  We use coconut milk weekly, so imagine my surprise to find yellow water, instead of creamy, thick, white goodness.<br /><br />Christine at Amazon was able to provide a refund, but was very non-committal about opening a work ticket for the warehouse to investigate this product.  Guess they're not going to insist Roland change suppliers.<br /><br />It was a good thing while it lasted.  Now to try to find an organic alternative... If anybody has found a decent substitute, please share.
