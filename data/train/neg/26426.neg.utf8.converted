From the looks of the package this saffron is exposed to light. The reason some views say that this saffron is weak is because some of the important chemicals involved in the aroma and flavor of saffron break down relatively fast in the presence of light. As such you'll notice high quality brands use opaque packaging, i would avoid this one if you're looking for quality.
