This stuff tastes absolutely horrendous! Calorie free or not, this stuff doesn't taste like ranch to me. It tastes more like chemical with a carbonish aftertaste.  Oh well, at least the balsamic seems to be somewhat ok. I'll find out tomorrow on that one. Otherwise I'd rather take the small calorie hit from using something like Newman's Own sesame ginger or one of the really lite Italians out there. Oh well, live and learn right?
