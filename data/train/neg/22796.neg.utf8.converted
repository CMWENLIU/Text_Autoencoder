I very rarely order k-cups any more because they have gone up in price.  However, I was having company over for the weekend and wanted to impress them with a variety pack of coffee.  So I ordered a package of 35 sampler K-cups.  At least 95 percent of the cups were vanilla flavored.  Vanilla decaf, french vanilla, vanilla supreme.  I don't even like french vanilla coffee.  Very, Very disappointed!!!!!  Were is the variety?  Won't order these again.
