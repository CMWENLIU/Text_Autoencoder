What the flipping hell did they do to my clam chowder??<br /><br />  Normally, I eat healthy foods. We are a mostly-vegetarian household, but once in a while, PMS demands that I have some clam chowder. Snow's Clam Chowder to be exact. It is one of my few comfort foods, and I spiff it up a little so it really is like a good, hearty, restaurant clam chowder. It is delicious and creamy and has clams and makes me happy.<br /><br />  I picked up a can at Market Basket the other day. I noticed that Snow's is now "Snow's by BumbleBee." Ruh-roh, Shaggy.<br /><br />  It smelled wrong when I opened the can. Not bad or spoiled, just not right. The texture was all wrong. The color was different. Since I am apparently a doofus, I made it anyway. This stuff truly sucks. It has NO flavor. It tastes pretty much like lumpy school paste. Only more bland. Not even salty crackers made a bit of difference.<br /><br />  There was no warning on the label. Usually, when a company screws around with a tried-and-true recipe and ruins the product, the add a "NEW! Improved!" warning to the packaging to alert the public of their meddling. They didn't even do that. They just ruined it without any warning, and now my chowder is disgusting.<br /><br />  I've been eating Snow's for forty years, but Look's will be getting my chowder business, now. It may well be a dollar more per can, but that's well worth it since they know enough to leave a good thing alone.
