I did a lot of research on dog food after hearing Eukanuba and other dog food were found top have pentobarbital in them. I loved the ingredients of Blue Buffalo and they seemed to have an amazing reputation. We slowly, over ~ 10 days, weaned our dogs off Eukanuba and onto Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon. Bad things began happening soon after we started. All 3 dogs stopped having solid feces, and someone vomited everyday. We got through the bag and figured that lot, or set of ingredients, didn't agree with their digestive systems so we went over to the Duck. Things got worse.<br /><br />After 2 months of this we changed over to Nutro and they have been great since. I contacted Blue Buffalo to let them know our experiences and they replied with an email pretty much saying "Thanks for being a valuable customer"
