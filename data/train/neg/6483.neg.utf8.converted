Very cute card came with the seeds, but wow there was like only two seeds smeared on the plastic.  I wanted to laugh.  I could just go pick a fig around the corner, so thats what I did.  I think they should err on the generous side next time and make sure the seeds are visable, and at least the amount you purchase.  I will try to plant the two seeds I got, and if they grow will let you all know.  Maybe it was just a fluke, but gosh.
