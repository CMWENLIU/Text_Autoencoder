I wanted this product to be great.  I yearned for this product to be great.  It turned out to be fair.<br /><br />If you use the recommended serving size, you'll find you don't taste is AT ALL.  Nada.  Zip.<br /><br />If you use three times the recommended serving, you'll find it subtly makes your popcorn taste like cheddar, and I do mean subtle.  You'll have to hunt for the flavor.  Don't expect cheesy popcorn because you won't get it with this seasoning.<br /><br />It doesn't cling to the popcorn very well either, which further diminishes the flavor.  You'll need to prep the popcorn by popping in oil or by pouring butter on after you air-pop the popcorn.<br /><br />Oh well.  The search to make air-popped popcorn tasty goes on, because this product ain't it.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is pretty good, but as previously mentioned, I can't taste it unless I use way more than the recommended serving size, which then defeats the low-calorie benefit.  Too bad!
