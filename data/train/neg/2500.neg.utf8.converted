If you are a traditional Yerba mat&eacute; afficionado that uses a bombilla (filtered straw), this stuff is completely undrinkable. The mat&eacute; has been pulverized rather than cut and subsequently blocks the filter and clogs the bombilla. This creates two problems: First, you get precious little tea passing through and secondly, you must spend a good deal of time cleaning the bombilla out before it will be an efficient filter again.<br /><br />Incidentally, unbiased research shows that drinking the loose tea with a bombilla delivers much higher levels of polyphenol antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Lastly, I have been drinking Yerba mat&eacute; for 22 years and there are plenty of other brands that have better flavor.
