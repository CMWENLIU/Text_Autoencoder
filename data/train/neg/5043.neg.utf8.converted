We all were each trying to give away our boxes to the other, because we just didn't like this brand. There was no taker. We had previously purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO615O">La Florentine Torrone, Lemon, Orange, Vanilla, 6.35-Ounce, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> and we loved them (although the lemon was loved the least). I am not sure what it is and possibly it was because the Post Office delayed our box at a very hot location for days (thus I gave this two stars). Yes, they were dried, but they also just didn't have that something the La Florentines did.<br /><br />Also, maybe I had missed it on the product review, but I had thought that these came in just one flavor. They don't. They come in Vanilla, Classic, and Lemon. Hope that helps.
