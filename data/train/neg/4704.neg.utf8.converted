It is a great product for sure!  But this price for a 3 lb. bag is out of the ball park!  I purchased this 3 pound bag yesterday, November 19, 2011 at a local pet food store and paid $14.99 plus sales tax for it.  I can't believe anyone is paying this price for this 3 pound bag of Natures Variety Frozen Raw cat/dog food.  Wow!!!<br /><br />Just go on line to the Nature's Variety Web site and check retail locations to see if there are any retail outlets in your area.  You'll find a much better price.
