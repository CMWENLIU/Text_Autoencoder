Be warned:  the bananas in this variety pack are DISGUSTING!  The apples and pears taste good, like the fresh fruit tastes.  The bananas however are quite nasty and do not taste anything like fresh bananas.  It might be because of the citric acid in them, but it's got a funky smell and a tangy bite to it.  Even the color is off.  I bought this variety pack thinking I was getting a deal this way, but now that I'm throwing away all four jars of the banana it's ended up being quite expensive.  I won't be buying the variety pack again.  I'll buy jars of apple and pear again, but I'll be sticking with fresh bananas from here on.
