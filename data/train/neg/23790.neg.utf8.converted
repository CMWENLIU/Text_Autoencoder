I love all kinds of teas, I drink some every day.  I saw that so many people like this blueberry variety, so I decided to try it.  I am a big believer in the "groupthink" of customer reviews.  And I am rarely disappointed in anything Amazon.  I didn't see that stevia is an ingredient.  Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth.  So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who don't mind stevia.  I'm going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely.
