I gave Grape Big League Chew to my dog.  He couldn't stand it and spit it out and decided his time was better spent licking himself.  He does however love the original BLC flavor and chews it often.  He even has bubble blowing contests with the rest of the neighborhood dogs.  Overall, grape gum is for sissies.<br /><br />The End.
