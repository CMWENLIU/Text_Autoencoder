5/05/2010  Update.  I am sorry but I have to down grade my review yet again.  I found grit in this quinoa for the third time while eating today.  I am shocked, I have never had this happen with quinoa before.  Very unpleasant experience to be chewing and get that awful gritty sensation and sound between your teeth.  It doesn't happen every time so I guess there are clumps of it in areas of the bag of quinoa?  Now I'm stuck with the remainder of this bag plus the three remaining bags I don't know what to do.  It's too bad because the flavor of the quinoa is really good.<br />  *********<br /><br />I am on a gluten free, vegan, nut free diet and Quinoa is a very easy way to get protein so I eat it a lot and can not afford to pay a high price for it so, originally, I was so happy to find it here at a more affordable price than at Meijer.  Quinoa is NOT cheap to buy anywhere that I can find here.  When I bought this the other day I thought that it was a good deal but was disappointed to find that I had over paid.  I will be going to Trader Joe's in future where I have found quinoa that is just as good as Bob's Red Mill and just as well washed but is over one dollar a pound cheaper.  I might try the Eden Organics brand that Amazon carries, it is almost a dollar cheaper per pound, hopefully it won't have grit like Bob's Red Mill.<br /><br /> Bob's Red Mill is really over charging on all their products.  No need to be so greedy Bob's Red Mill.  So many products they sell, like dried chickpeas and chickpea flour, I can get for half the price or less from Patel Brothers Indian Grocers.  Even Meijer has dried chickpeas for less than half the price of Bob's.  I will be canceling my Subscribe and Save on this product.
