These tomatoes sounded great because they have no additives or preservatives. They were delivered very quickly, and are a dull brown color, which I expected because of the lack of sulfites.  Unfortunately, they are extremely bitter, and even though I expected the flavor to improve when I rehydrated them with water, they retained the bitterness. I tried soaking them in olive oil as well, and this also did not do much to improve the flavor.  Amazon advertises these as sun dried but in fact, they are not sun dried and are air dried instead.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the flavor, and I was unable to find out any other information about the company, Sonoma. Therefore, I would not recommend these tomatoes. :(
