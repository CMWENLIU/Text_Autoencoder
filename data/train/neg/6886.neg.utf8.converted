Would be a great price, but these K-cups don't work. If I use them as I normally would, I only get about an ounce of coffee in the cup, and it is mostly grounds. Not wanting to waste my purchase, I now cut open each K-cup and put the coffee into my My K-Cup Reusuable Coffee Filter that goes with my Keurig. The coffee itself is pretty good, but I could have bought a bag of gourmet coffee for a lot less money if I am going to have to use my reusuable filter anyway.
