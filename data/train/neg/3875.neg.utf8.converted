For some reason I love this chalky, vaguely fruity flavored confection. I've been waiting all year for Valentines day so I can go out of control and eat these things for no apparent reason. I purchased six of this exact product in this exact size (7oz) and label: five from one supermarket and one from another. The candy seems stale. The purple ones are rock hard and I'm afrade I'll break a tooth so I throw those away, and the green ones are almost as bad so I've given up on them. That leaves the yellow, pink, orange (usually) and blue ones as safe to eat. These aren't supposed to be hard candy, are they?<br /><br />The Necco web site says these hearts are produced all year for sale during the Valentines holiday period. They are supposed to be soft candy. So it seems that you may get a bag from eleven months ago or a couple weeks ago. Good luck! I think I got the from spring 2011.<br /><br />By the way, I got my 7 oz bags for only a fraction of the coin demanded here, so best to look at the grocery store in the seasonal items area first.<br /><br />Also, I bought a bag of the Brach's Conversation Hearts and did a comparison. The Brach's product seemed fresh with no rock hard hearts, but the flaver is a bit more bland. It's difficult to tell if the different color Brach's hearts are meant to be different flavors. They're more like just fresh sweet chalk.
