These were in my Gold Box and I was tempted to buy based on reviews, but it was unusual that I couldn't read what was in them.  So, I had to go looking for the info and did not like what I found.  I got the following from the Kellogg website and I hope Amazon doesn't mind me posting it for everyone:<br /><br />Sizes<br />5 ct, pouch<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />CHICORY ROOT FIBER, ROLLED OATS, CRISP RICE CEREAL (RICE FLOUR, SUGAR, MALT EXTRACT, SALT, CARAMEL COLOR, MIXED TOCOPHEROLS FOR FRESHNESS), SUGAR, SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE DROPS (SUGAR, CHOCOLATE, COCOA BUTTER, DEXTROSE, MILK FAT, SOY LECITHIN, CONFECTIONER'S GLAZE [SHELLAC, HYDROGENATED COCONUT OIL]), INULIN FROM CHICORY ROOT, VEGETABLE OIL (HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL, COCONUT AND PALM OIL), CANOLA OIL, FRUCTOSE, CONTAINS TWO PERCENT OR LESS OF HONEY, COCOA (PROCESSED WITH ALKALI), GLYCERIN, TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE, WHEY, CHOCOLATE, SALT, GUM ARABIC, BAKING SODA, SOY LECITHIN, SORBITAN MONOSTEARATE, POLYSORBATE 60, VITAMIN E ACETATE, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR, ZINC OXIDE, ALMOND FLOUR, NONFAT DRY MILK, WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, PARTIALLY DEFATTED PEANUT FLOUR, SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE, BHT (FOR FRESHNESS).<br /><br />Allergen Information<br />CONTAINS MILK, SOY, ALMOND, WHEAT, AND PEANUT INGREDIENTS.

These have trans-fat, preservatives, tropical oils, artificial color.  And what about the Country of Origin?  Distributed in USA.......shouldn't they tell us WHERE these are made?  Obviously they're Distributed in USA.  There are healthier alternatives out there and these are by no means inexpensive.
