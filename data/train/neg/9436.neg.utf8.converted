After reading raving reviews ordered this thru subscribe and save, boy, i was wrong! Followed directions very carefully, (basic white mode in bread maker) it didn't rise, came out very hard and dense like a brick and burnt. Didn't care for the taste, smells weird too. Second time used KA mixer, again, followed directions, baked in the oven, (according to directions: bake for 70 minutes, 350F) , bread was already dark in 40 minutes, after 30 more minutes it would be burnt for sure. Didn't rise, again,  like a brick hard and dense.<br />I used the same yeast to make regular French bread just to check if yeast was fresh enough. Wheat flour bread baked beautifully and was very delicious.<br />I just don't understand all the positive reviews out there, nothing is amazing, it's the worst bread mix ever and I can't even return unopened packages :(<br />I want to try other brand bread mixes.
