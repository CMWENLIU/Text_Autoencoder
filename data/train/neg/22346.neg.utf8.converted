While Vitacost is a wonderful company to do business with, this product is not worth your money.  Although the product pictured shows "100% Valencia" on the label, and a lovely speckled peanut butter in the jar, the product has been changed.  It used to be made with 100% Valencia peanuts, with skins left on, but the company now uses Virginia peanuts.  The peanut butter is not nearly as tasty and is now an incredibly thin, oily consistency.  While I will continue to patronize Vitacost, I will no longer be buying Once Again products.
