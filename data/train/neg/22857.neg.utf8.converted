These were the worst food colors that I've ever used, but I blame that on the seller not the manufacturer. Some of the bottles that I receive seem to work fine (by which I mean are the correct color and dissolve/integrate properly). At least half the bottles I got are TERRIBLE for a few reasons: 1) both the fushia and the burgundy are no where near to pink or red! They are a sludgy brown color! Not a nice brown like maybe the bottle was mislabeled, but a disgusting rotten brown color. So for our Easter egg dying, no pink! All but 3 or 4 of the remaining bottles are so dried out or old (or I don't know what the problem is) that they won't even dissolve! I heated the liquid I was trying to color, but that didn't help. I mushed the food coloring gel through a fine sieve, hoping I could break up the chunks and get them to dissolve, but instead this just created lots of tiny little clumps floating around. The couple colors that work properly (yellow, mint green) seem great and the colors are vibrant, but most of the bottles are completely worthless.
