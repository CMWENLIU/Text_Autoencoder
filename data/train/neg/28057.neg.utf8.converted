Unfortunately, I am very disappointed by this product. I sent these to my mother-in-law as a birthday gift, and while she was very happy to receive it, she also politely told me that the chocolate-covered pretzels were not fresh. They had already spoiled, with the chocolate having bloomed (i.e. has that whitish powdery look and is grainy) and the pretzels themselves tasting very stale. To call this box "gourmet" is just an egregious lie - all items are basically purchased in bulk items that you usually get at the candy isle in a cheap drugstore. I am very angry about this! Obviously these boxes have sat for a LONG time and no one cares enough to take a look and see that the chocolate isn't looking fresh. I would not recommend anyone to buy these as a gift or even for themselves.
