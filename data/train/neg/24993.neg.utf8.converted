It's always exciting to find a new gluten-free product to try, but this one tanked. The label had been updated to indicate it was produced in a facility with wheat, versus the dedicated facility label the product indicates on the website. I wasn't too concerned because my daughter eats plenty of foods that are produced in facilities with ingredients she can't have and never has any problems. BIG mistake this time. Within an hour of eating these cookies, she had the telltale migraine and subsequent vomiting that is consistent with when she accidentally ingests gluten. Stay away from these cookies if you are following a strict gluten-free diet.
