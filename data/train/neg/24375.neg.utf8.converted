The other day, my husband and I were having spaghetti for dinner, so I boiled the Shirataki noodles for a few minutes and then tried to eat them.  The taste wasn't bad, then I tried to chew them and the texture was really weird.  I had to chew a lot more than I really wanted to.  I finally gave up and ate my spaghetti sauce with real pasta.
