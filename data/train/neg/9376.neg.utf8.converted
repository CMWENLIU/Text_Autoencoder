While this coffee is an excellent coffee, it is not properly described. It is represented as "all-Arabica" and "light."<br /><br />Trung Nguyen Premium Blend is distinguished by being a blend of three different bean types and a small touch of cocoa, and "spices", as listed on the ingredients. It is Arabica, Robusta and Excelsa, otherwise known as Chari. It is not a light coffee, it is quite strong, like most Vietnamese coffees.<br /><br />This seller does not understand the product or list the proper ingredients, and I suggest that buyers look elsewhere for the proper representatives of the product on the Internet. Trung Nguyen products do have authorized Internet resellers that feature proper descriptions and pricing.<br /><br />It is not acceptable for a seller to misrepresent the major ingredients of a product to the buying public. Particularly on a product that also has non-coffee ingredients. Buyers who may have allergies should be aware of the ingredients.
