I use canned asparagus only for pureeing in soups where the lack of texture doesn't matter. I have used most every brand of canned asparagus and this is the first I've ever bought that was so stringy and woody I had to press the soup though a sieve and thereby waste a good part of it. To add insult to injury I paid a premium for it over the good house brand I usually buy, because it was low sodium.<br /><br />I'll not buy it again, needless to say, and have warned my soup-making daughters about it.<br /><br />I am surprised and disappointed that a reputable company like Green Giant would market a product like this. I hope the negative reviews here will be a wakeup call for them.
