The product that is pictured and described is exactly what I wanted:  milk chocolate/raspberry sticks.  So why did they send me chocolate from the Dark Side?  I could have gotten dark chocolate/raspberry sticks almost anywhere locally; but I wanted milk chocolate, which is why I ordered this product from Penguin through Amazon.
