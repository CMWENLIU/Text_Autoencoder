I was hoping for some bulk inexpensive quality peanuts to make pb. This was not the case. They come in really cheap packaging that was spilled all over the inside of the box. The nuts were stale and rancid tasting. Will not order again. Bright side, amazon was great about refunding me, so no real loss for trying. All my other amazon grocery purchases have been a success!
