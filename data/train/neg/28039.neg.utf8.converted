After drinking a full 16 oz. bottle of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch I would much rather wash down a vitamin C tablet and a few "NoDoze" with some nice cool clear water. The only reason I can think of to buy something like this would be to provide vitamins and energy in a form that was so pleasing it would encourage you to drink it. This product fails on that account. The flavor is not horrible, but is not something I would seek out. I put the recommended two "squeezes" (whatever that is) into a 16 oz bottle of water and started drinking. I kept adding the concentrate a little at a time trying to produce a decent fruit punch taste. Mixed at twice the recommended strength it still tasted weak and vaguely chemical.<br /><br />Again, at twice the proscribed mix, I noticed no "buzz" from the caffeine either. With so many similar products out there, it seems to me that a company wanting to compete in this market would concentrate on flavor, aroma and appearance. It takes no skill to put some chemicals in a liquid and bottle it. Turning that liquid into something people might want to consume is another thing. I think Vitamin Squeeze needs to keep working on it.
