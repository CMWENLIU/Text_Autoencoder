These candies have a good taste and they seem to be made from natural ingredients which is nice but they had a slightly stale texture, sort of chewy.  I bought them for the office and had several people taste them and agree. They are supposed to have a soft middle so maybe the chewiness was by design. Unfortunately you have to buy six bags at a time so you can't find this out without making a bit of a commitment.
