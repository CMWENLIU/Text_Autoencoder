I received a 12 pack of Mrs Fields from Amazon (fulfilled by Lakewood Candies, LLC), slightly open at the front.  Suspicious, I counted the number of cookies and realized that someone had opened up the package and pilfered one along the way...<br /><br />I won't make the mistake of trusting Lakewood Candies again.
