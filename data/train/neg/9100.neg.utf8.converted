I really don't like giving such a poor rating, but I feel people should know about this before wasting their good money as I did.  I had noticed sand being mentioned in a review but thought it was not likely to happen.  But, it did. It may be that swallowing small amounts of sand won't hurt you.  But the grinding noise between my teeth tells me there is wear and tear taking place.  And I'm one that does not want to have extra visits to my dentist.
