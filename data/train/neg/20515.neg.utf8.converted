I bought these based on all the great reviews here. Maybe I just got a bad box, but mine were nothing like those described in all these other reviews! The cranberries were dry and tough. They were encrusted with sugar and sticky. Not very flavorful, and slightly stale tasting.<br /><br />Before trying these I had bought the Oskri brand on a lightning deal, and they were great. Plump and flavorful. But expensive, so I tried these. No comparison at all! I'm going to toss these in the trash and go back to Oskri.
