I bought this coconut extract for my holiday baking got ready to use. VERY disappointing NO coconut flavor at all taste like water Please don't make the mistake of buying this. The list of ingredients is (water organic alcohol organic agave organic coconut milk) as you can see the coconut is the last on the list & I would have expected no water.  This does not deserve one star BAD PRODUCT I hope they will work on the flavor & give a product that taste like coconut
