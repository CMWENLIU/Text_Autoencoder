I saw the tower on line and it looked like a great deal. I have been sending Harry an David gift boxes as Christmas gifts for years and this seemed like a great value just from looks. I had a bad address and consequently had one delivered to my house and discovered that I had sent out three Barbie sized boxes of candy to all of my friends. It is true that the buyer should beware but deception only works once with me and I will never place an order with this company, Broadway Basketeers.
