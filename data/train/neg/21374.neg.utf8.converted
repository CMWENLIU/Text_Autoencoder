This is the hottest enchilada sauce I have ever tasted. Even although the can is marked "Mild" it is approximately one step away from bringing tears to your eyes. We actually had to throw the meal We prepared away because no one could eat it. If the can had been marked "Medium" ( which would still be a strech) or "Hot" We would not have purchased it.
