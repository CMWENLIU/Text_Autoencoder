it's definitely not the worst out there... but's it's FAR from the best, and it should definitely NOT be called "gourmet."<br /><br />byproducts are gross things like skin, hair/fur, bones... it's a cheap filler! NOT good for your cat. in a good canned food there will be NO byproducts or meal.<br /><br />and to those of you saying my cat is ___ and is doing fine, isn't that how it always goes? isn't something fine until there is a problem? also it's like some people can eat junk all their life and not die of a heart attack or get diabetes doesn't mean it's not still junk.
