I love Monster energy drink, but the $47.89 price for a case is not a good deal. It comes to about $2 per can, which is just slightly below what you can buy a single can for at a convenient store. I thought I would find a better deal buying large quantities over the internet, but I guess not.<br /><br />The best deal I have found is 7-11, where a 4-pack can be had for $6. That's only $1.50 per can.
