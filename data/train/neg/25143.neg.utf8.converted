I purchased Roastaroma along with a number of other products, trying to find a substitute for coffee which, along with just about everything else I like, I can no longer consume. Some previous reviews have not been all that accurate, sorry to say. This is actually a tea which tastes nothing, repeat, nothing like coffee. It's more like a cinnamon tea, and a slightly strange tasting cinnamon tea at that. If like me, you are looking for a coffee substitute, I'd recommend Cafix or Caf-Lib. They are the best I've found so far, Cafix being the slightly better of the two. Do they taste like coffee, you ask? Well, they taste like an ok decaf. They work ok for me, because I like to use a liquid non-dairy sugar free creamer such as International Delight.<br /><br />That these other products fall short of real coffee isn't that much of a surprise. Consider how even decaf coffees don't quite taste comparable to the real caffeinated products. If they can't get those to taste closer, then I can understand the challenge in trying to get chicory, dandelions etc to fit the bill.
