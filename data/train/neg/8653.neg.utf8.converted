I bought this elsewhere (locally) because it was on sale, and it was absolutely disgusting. It tastes and smells like vinegar and chemicals, not the creamy cheesy flavor I expect from a queso. I've never met a queso I didn't like until I made the mistake of wasting my money on this garbage. Avoid this product if you don't want to permanently damage your taste buds.
