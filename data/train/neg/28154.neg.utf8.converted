This so-called wasabi is actually yellow, not green.  You don't learn that it's made in China until you buy it and look on the back side of the package.  This awful stuff turns out to be Chinese horseradish.  I can only imagine what they persuaded the horse to add to it, but it was some of the worst-tasting junk I've ever tried.
