I ordered this matcha hoping it would be of the same quality are the $12 matcha I usually purchase from a local Asian market. I was very dissapointed. This is culinary grade matcha. It doesn't dissolve well and the color of the tea is dark, very different from the bright green matcha I am used to. The flavour is somewhat bitter and flat, at least in comparison to any good drinking-grade matcha I've tried. I'm sure this is a fine option if you intend only to cook with it or make sweetened iced tea, but if you intend to consume it as a hot tea, I would advise you to select a different product of better quality.
