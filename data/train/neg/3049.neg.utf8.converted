I ordered based on the reviews and it's taking 2 months to receive.  When I originally placed my order it was showing as available.  However it's been a long wait.  I was looking for Easter candy, might make it to me by Fathers day.  They need to do a better job of fulfilling their orders, I'm going to be so annoyed by the time I receive it that I'm not going to like it no matter what it tastes like.
