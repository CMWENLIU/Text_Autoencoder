I use BioBag dog bags and love them, so I tried the kitchen bags also. The dog bags are sturdy and don't tear at all, but the kitchen bags seem to be made from something else. They don't fit in an average kitchen garbage bin and they also tear extremely easily. If you are using them strictly as compost bags and only putting scraps in them I'm sure they'd do fine, but they shouldn't be used for an average kitchen garbage bag.<br />Also, it only contains 12 bags. Add the price of shipping and this becomes very expensive for a bag only to be used in a compost pile.
