The description of these bars led me to believe they were made of premium chocolate with a Swiss-like texture and flavor. Not so at all. Don't get me wrong; they were not disgusting or gross. They tasted mostly like chocolate. But they in no way tasted premium. The texture was too firm and they didn't melt properly in the mouth. Erythritol is the best sweetener for chocolates in my opinion because it doesn't produce the gastrointestinal distress that most sugar alcohols produce. But it is not as sweet as sugar and any good chocolate recipe should compensate for this by adding sucralose for its synergy.<br /><br />I used to buy the Ross chocolate bars, which are sweetened with maltitol. I couldn't eat but one per day due to the side effects of the sweetener, but sometimes I ventured two because they are smooth, creamy, and sweet, the way great chocolate always is. By comparison, the Chocoperfection bars are like cheap knock-offs. Except that they're not cheap. If they cost a lot less I might buy them again because they do offer something like a chocolate bar taste with no evil side effects. But I won't be buying any more at the current price.
