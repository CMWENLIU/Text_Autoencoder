I just do not understand why Amazon has a continued relationship with company which goes by many other names. It sells very poor products, but they keep appearing on Amazon with their other names. I think a couple names are "The Crab Place" and "The Lobster Store". The picture is exactly the same. I have really appreciated Amazon for monitoring their suppliers, but something is really wrong here.
