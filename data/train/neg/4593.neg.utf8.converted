I used to like Cascadian Farms Organic Purely O'S Cereal because it had no sugar or sweetener and had been buying the cereal for my daughter for 20 months since she was 6 months old. However, the new box I just bought on Feb.13,2010 tasted different,very very sweet! I looked at the ingredients and found that the cereal now has sugar in it. I will not buy this product again. I'm very dissapointed with the new recipe!
