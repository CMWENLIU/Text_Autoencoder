Title says it all.  They reformulated to add artificial sweeteners to their regular hot cocoa.  I didn't notice until I tasted it and thought I accidentally bought the diet stuff.  Nope -- they put splenda and asculfame K (asculfame potassium) into their formula now.  It's really gross -- much too sweet with a terrible aftertaste.
