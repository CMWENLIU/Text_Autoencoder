No wonder they don't include the ingredients in the ad.  MSG has been shown to cause health problems and is entirely unnecessary from a health and taste standpoint.  I never would have bought this product if I had known.  Foolishly I ate some and had heartburn.  I immediately tossed it, feeling really ripped off for my money.  Come now, Amazon -- shouldn't you make it mandatory to include a full rundown on ingredients on products such as this?  Think about it.
