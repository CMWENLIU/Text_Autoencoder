I ordered a bouquet of flowers I saw on the Internet, the name of the item: "Seasonal Color's Bouquet" Pay attention, it says "BOUQUET".  But, when the flowers were received by my daughter, there was no bouquet but a box with a few flowers. I sensed the big disapointment of my daughter who was celebrating her 40th birthday.  I wanted to surprise her and I got her terribly disapointed instead. I was absolutely left down by this terrible company.<br />This company should show the exact way the flowers are presented to whoever is receiving them, otherwise they are terribly misleading people and we all know the name of such action : SCAM.<br />I will never again order anything from this company EVER !<br />Lita Bryant
