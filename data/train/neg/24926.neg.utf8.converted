Box arrived as pictured.  So beautiful!  I was so impressed...until we opened each box.  Not as pictured!  In the ad, the boxes are over flowing with goodies...in reality, the snacks come in a hard plastic bag...not even as big as a single bag of animal crackers.  Even the popcorn boxes that are supposed to be the big treat boxes have a cheap single serving of popcorn in them.  Good thing I bought this on a lightening deal!  If I had paid full price, I would have been very upset!<br /><br />The best thing about this tower is that after the boxes are all empty, little kids can use them for stacking blocks!
