I found this to taste stale and perhaps like drinking liquid cardboard.  I've had the original, unflavored Vita Coco (like it better than original, unflavored O.N.E. and very tolerable for unflavored) and Tangerine Vita Coco (superb!).  This is a HUGE disappointment in comparison.  I used to love the Acai coconut water offered by Hudson Bay, but I can no longer find it.  That was my favorite drink ever!  I'm not sure if it is the pomegranate that makes it taste rather lousy, but I was wholly disappointed.  There is a pleasant fruity aftertaste, but it is ever so slight and nearly undetectable.  I'll pass on another purchase of this again.
