I originally wrote a positive review of this Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn -- until I was awakened in the middle of the night by an extreme attack of heartburn, of the kind I usually experience when I have eaten something that doesn't agree with my cholesterol medication (generic Zocor, or simvastatin).<br /><br />To be sure that this popcorn caused this reaction, I kept my diet the same a second day but refrained from eating any of the Snackwell Popcorn.  Result: NO heartburn -- I slept like a baby.<br /><br />Usually butter is the culprit when my cholesterol pills go to work, but I don't see butter listed in the ingredients on the popcorn package.  Nabisco also claims that this popcorn has NO cholesterol.<br /><br />Well, I don't know what to think, but I would suggest that folks suffering from high cholesterol -- or anyone taking cholesterol medication like simvastatin -- approach this product with extreme caution.  If you experience similar reactions from your cholesterol meds to foods you shouldn't be having, try a single-serving pack of this popcorn before you buy a box and see how you feel.<br /><br />Those who have no problems with cholesterol, however, may like the flavor of this Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, which is tasty, if pricey at around a buck per ounce of popcorn.  I myself threw out the remaining four packs in the six-pack box -- the pain of eating these far outweighed the pleasure.
