I was so excited to find Drake's Yodels for sale on Amazon. I loved them as a child when I lived on the East Coast. I must say I was terribly disappointed. They don't even taste like chocolate and they're very dry. I had to buy two boxes to order them, at a rather inflated price I might add, and both went into the garbage. They're just not good anymore. Perhaps that is because Drake was bought out by Hostess. Or maybe it's just easier to create products chemically rather than use "real" ingredients. Even at that it was less than a week to the expiration date when I received the product in the mail. Another childhood memory shot to pieces.
