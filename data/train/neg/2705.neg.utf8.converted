I guess if you want to keep raking in the money you have to fudge and mislead folk.  That's what SmokeHouse has done by adding 'USA' to their name.  I can say this without fear because the packages I have sitting on the kitchen table in front of me clearly say that this is a "Product of China."<br /><br />You know, the China where they feel free to add melamine to products for human babies (2008), and dogs and cats (2007 and 2010) -- all so that the protein levels register higher than they normally would :(<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Honestly, my little Jack-a-Bee puppy loves their products, but I won't be purchasing the Chicken Chips or Chicken Breast Strips again.  I can't imagine telling my children that the lively little pup they love was made sick (or died!) because of some cheap-*** short-cut.<br /><br />I'd rather pay more money and have it manufactured here in the States.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/dog lover
