While this was once a good tuna at one time, they've gone down hill, recently. I normally eat tuna from the can, with just a squeeze of lemon. I've had three recent cans that not only is in no way solid, but it's a dark color, slimy and off tasting. The only way I can describe it is what cat food must taste like. I have to say, "sorry Charlie", but dolphin would be an improvement over this.
