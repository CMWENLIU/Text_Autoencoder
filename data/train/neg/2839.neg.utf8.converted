These granola bars are the best out there, however, quaker and amazon pulled a fast one on me.  I subscribe and save to these because honestly i eat 12 boxes in about a week and a half.  However, quaker changed the number of bars in a pack from 10 to now only 8!  Same price yet 2 fewer bars per pack. Now with this order I'm basically getting 2 less boxes each time for the same price.  Amazon should have at least warned me that my 10-count 12 pack order was now an 8-count 12 pack order and that i would be paying the same price.<br /><br />I guess its back to buying the variety pack at costco with 60 bars, the downside being the dreadful oatmeal raisin bars I am inevitably forced to eat.  Actually the oatmeal raisin are pretty good, just not at all compared to the chocolate chip peanut butter.
