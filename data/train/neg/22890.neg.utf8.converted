getting stabbed in the stomach probably would have been more pleasant than what happened to me a couple hours after eating a handful of these. like others have mentioned, the horrible side effects that come from eating these are due to a synthetic sugr substitute called "lycasin". they may be tasty but you will be in a world of hurt if you eat any more than a few of these gummi bears. i ate some last night and spent half the night experiencing severe gastrointestinal pain which eventually led to gas, diarrhea, and vomiting. i've seriously never been in more pain in my entire life..and as a result, have had to spend the entire day in bed, still feeling dizzy, with mild stomach pain and unable to keep down anything except water. basically, if you want to induce flu-like effects and spend at least 6 hours in excruciating pain, eat these with reckless abandon.
