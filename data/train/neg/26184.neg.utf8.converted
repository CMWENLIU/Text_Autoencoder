I gave this product poor reviews because they do not allow returns and yet my product arrived damaged. The shipping box itself was in great condition, but the item must have been damaged before shipping.  One corner was badly smashed in. Who did the quality control here?  I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift for the holidays as is.
