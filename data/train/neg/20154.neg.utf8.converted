We discovered banana ketchup on our honeymoon to St. Lucia in 2004. We love it and have been purchasing it for seven years, and never in that time has it contained food coloring or sodium benzoate. However, the four bottles I just received contain both. We are allergic to these items and the ketchup is unconsumable by us. The ingredients were listed as "Product Features-Water, banana pulp,Sugar,Venigar [sic],Tomato paste spices". I am disappointed to have received a product that was other than what was described.
