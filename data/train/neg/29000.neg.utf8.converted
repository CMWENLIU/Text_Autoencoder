I was not happy at all with this. Not only did it take very long to arrive at my doorstep, the canister was already popped on the bottom with jelly beans spilled out in the box. It took many angry emails to find out this product was on backorder, to send a replacement. Since I was already waiting six weeks I chose to take the partial money back they offered. I will never order with them again!
