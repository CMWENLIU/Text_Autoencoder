This is terrible.  I bought this based on the high reviews, but it's just bad.  Way too much soy sauce/salt flavor.  The tofu is mushy and not at all firm.  Also once you get past the salt, the soup doesn't really have a good flavor.  Maybe if you really like red miso, this would be your thing.  But for more of a flavor like you get in sushi restaurant miso soup, I'd recommend  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BIQLL8">Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup (Soybean Paste Soup with Tofu) - 9 Packets (3.15 Oz)</a>.
