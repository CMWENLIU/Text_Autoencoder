I rarely write reviews but wanted to warn others of the affect these lollipops had on me. I've never had any stomach problems and can eat just about anything. However, every time I ate these lollipops, I would get a mild headache and feel nauseous. I really have no idea why but that's exactly what happened. I thought it was a fluke, waited a few days, then tried some more and had the same results. Some reviewers point out the fact that these are made in Mexico and I don't know for sure but wonder if that was part of the problem. Regardless, eat at your own risk.
