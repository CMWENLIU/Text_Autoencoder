Online it says the ingredients are: matcha green tea powder, and sugar.  When I got this in the mail the TRUE ingredients are: green tea, milk, guar gum, nondairy creamer, natural and artificial flavors, salt, and yogurt powder.  Talk about false advertising! Plus the bag it comes in is totally different than the one they show online.  I am a vegan, and I'm highly dissapointed that someone would lie about their product like this.
