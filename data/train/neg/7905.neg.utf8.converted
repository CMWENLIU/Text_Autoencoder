I ordered this tea, along with several other Roland tea in tins.  This was the worst of the lot.  I was expecting something bursting with orangey goodness.  I figured you can get Constant Comment at the store and it's delicious.  This should be even better.<br /><br />It wasn't.  The orange flavor was completely undetectable.  There were a scant few shriveled bits of orange peel, but it wasn't enough to give this tea any discernible orange flavor.  And spices?  Hah!  No spice taste at all.  The tea itself is fine, black tea.  Just not orange spice.
