I love Trader Joe's.  LOVE.IT.  However, a 1.7-oz package of freeze-dried mangoes typically retails for $2.69 in the store.  When I saw the $11.00+ price, I thought it was a multi-package product.  Well, it doesn't appear to be.  BUY THE FREEZE-DRIED MANGOES.  They are unreal, and my absolute favorite of all the TJ freeze-dried fruits.  I could eat it all day long.  Just buy it in the store for under $3.00, not at this price.  Sorry.
