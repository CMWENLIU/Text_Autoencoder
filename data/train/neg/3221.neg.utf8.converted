I'm probably on the 10th bag I've bought right here on amazon...however the reason for the 1 star doesn't reflect the quality of the treats but the pricing. I went to Costco the other day and they were being sold for less than $11. That being said I'll be stocking up from Costco and hope theyll always be sold there.
