I opened one can and could not eat it.<br /><br />Gave a can to a few friends and they said the same thing.<br /><br />I'm giving the rest of the case to the food bank.<br /><br />The food was not spoiled just way away from all the stuffed cabbage rollsI have ever had in the u.s.<br /><br />The product is from Turkey
