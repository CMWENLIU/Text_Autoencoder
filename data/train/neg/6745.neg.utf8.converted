First, I happened to be the customer who told them their declared weight was wrong on this product. It used to be listed (here on Amazon as well as on Pamela's own website) as .7 ounce each. In fact, each packet, a single cookie, is .2 ounce or slightly more, so they still don't have it correct. After lengthy email and phone correspondence they sheepishly admitted the error in weight. You could say this is not worth troubling oneself over, but that's more than three times exaggeration, .7 to .2, so the goal of truth in advertising should have straightened them out. (If you order these cookies and have a postal scale, you can weigh them yourself; you won't find them weighing in at .43 ounce, I'm pretty certain.)<br /><br />Second, before I had finished corresponding with the company, I had ordered this product (100 packets of .7 ounce each). I had tried them in the other package they offer, I believe 7 full ounces (now that I think about that, I wish I had weighed that package's contents). Extreme chocolate really did describe the cookie. BUT, these individual packets contain stale, or at least, very, very dry cookies; nothing at all like I'd tried before.<br /><br />Try them if you want, but be prepared to ask Amazon for credit. I did.
