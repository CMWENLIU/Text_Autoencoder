This cheese is not good.  I do not know how to more clearly state it.  It is a strange brown color and comes in an unnatural square shape.  It seems "manufactured" and tastes like no cheese should taste.  Slicing it thin is no help.  It has a strange butterscotch-y flavor, but is not as sweet and the consistency is just icky.  Bad, bad, bad stuff.  Nearly as bad as Velveeta.  Maybe even worse.
