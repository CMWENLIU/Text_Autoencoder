what an awful farce!!! i have been using this product to make my kids and family food...and there on the second ingredient is yeast extract!!!! all i had to do was google the ingredient to find out that i am giving my family MSG!!! what a terrible company!!! to advertise in the manner that they have and color their image in a different manner than what it is providing the consumers!! to say i'm dissapointed is putting it mildly....buyer beware, this indeed does have MSG!!
