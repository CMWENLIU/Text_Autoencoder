The Good:<br /><br />- low saturated fat (.5g 3% daily)<br />- loads of vitamins and minerals<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Tastes like Pepto Bismol. It has this thick, nasty strawberry taste.<br />- High Sugar content (18 grams per bottle) This surpasses the amount of protein and fiber combined.<br /><br />The bad far outweighs the good. 10 grams of protein is not a lot when I am having to down 18 grams of sugar to get it. If you need lots of sugar, go for it, but I think you are almost better off buying Nesquik, which at least tastes good.
