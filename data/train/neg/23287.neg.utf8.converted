This was the first time ( and the last ) I've ordered Rooibos from this supplier.<br />We drink this tea all the time and I've never had any that tasted like this bag.<br />It has a taste I'd describe as musty, like it had started to mildew' when they fermented it.<br />We tried making tea twice with it and do not consider it drinkable.
