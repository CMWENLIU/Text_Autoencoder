I wasn't crazy about this cereal. I thought it would be a little like grape nuts, but it really was like small pieces of their bread dried up and crumbled (I do like their bread, but not this way). I was sorry that I bought the the six pack. Try to find it from your local grocery store and see if you like it before purchasing so many from here.
