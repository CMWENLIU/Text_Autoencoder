You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals, B vitamins and a lower glycemic index?<br /><br />Well, maybe that's a pile of noise.<br /><br />Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they're doing this time (just like pretty much every other time). Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things (like cyanide) in the bran, which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.<br /><br />On the other hand, I gotta say, it *does* taste good.
