Sorry, I don't trust any food item made in China.  China is a country that has poisoned and killed their own children with purposely tainted food.  My bottle of this product was purchased at Safeway and is stamped "Made in China" so I have discontinued using this brand. I felt lied to as my bottle was not USDA organic but had some obscure international rating. Sorry, I don't trust the Chinese to raise truly organic plants or run a clean, organic processing and packaging operation. Further, the best organic garlic comes from California so why import such an easily obtainable item?<br /><br />Amazon's sales blurb above says this is a USDA organic product -- I assume they are correct. Let's hope so. However, it's the manufacturer who supplies the sales info, not Amazon, so this product might come from China afterall.<br /><br />I want USA organic food that is grown, processed, and packaged under USDA supervision.  You should, too.
