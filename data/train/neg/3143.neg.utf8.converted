I have ordered Taste of the Wild through Amazon before, but this time I received food that was rotten.  My dog loves this brand of food and it has proved to be healthy for her, but even she would lift up her nose when she smelled this food.  It was all I could take without gagging to scoop it out of the bag.  I ended up driving an hour the next day to pick her up some fresh food at a tractor supply store.  I am sure that this was a rare occasion, but beware when buying this food online.
