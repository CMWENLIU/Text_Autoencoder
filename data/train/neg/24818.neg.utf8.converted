I love this cereal so when I saw a big sale on the 4.3oz boxes of it I bought 48 boxes!  Halfway through our first breakfast my wife realized that the little black seed looking things in the cereal were actually little dead bugs!!!  Once she said that I started looking in my bowl and realized it was full of them!  I'm a big fan of the cereal but will NEVER purchase any from Amazon or probably off the internet for that matter.  Grocery store is fine with me!  Buyer beware!
