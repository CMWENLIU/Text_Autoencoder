These were a real disappointment. After trying their Minute Coffee Cake and loving it, I had high expectations. The hamburger buns were tough, and then turned hard as a brick. They were awful, and we ended up throwing them away. A real bummer....a great cheeseburger on a bun is the thing I miss most being a celiac! Do try their Coffee Cake, though. It was fantastic, and you only add water and microwave for a minute! Feels like cheating in the morning, and perfect for those in a rush. Be sure and don't throw the baking container away, as it looks like you can order just the refills without the container for less money.
