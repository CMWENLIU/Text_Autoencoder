I bought this so that it could pick winners in football games like the one did in the world cup (of soccer, name was Paul). I named mine Peter (or Mary, not sure how you know if its a boy or a girl octopus) but no luck, just floated upside down in the aquarium. Perhaps mine was a particularly stupid octopus or it doesn't have an opinion or it's pining for the fiords, but no luck on the sports picks.<br /><br />They really should point out that this is not a sports winner picking sort of octopus but more of a dead decoration sort. I suppose you could take it to a Detroit Red Wings game.
