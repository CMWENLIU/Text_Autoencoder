Sadly - These cookies are not what I remember from living down in Florida. Originally, the cookies were white-coated, whole and zapped your tastebuds which immediately transported one to a mangrove swamp on a sunny day, sipping a lime/planters punch ... What I got was mostly crumbs, brown in colour, slightly stale and one half of the zap-in-the-mouth taste and was immediately transported to Buffalo, NY, for cold chicken wings. We checked all three tins and ended up tossing the lot.<br /><br />I believe that the Byrd group dumps their old/inferior stock in this manner just to gain a buck ... obviously, at our expense ... thusly ... giving us the byrd?<br /><br />I would recommend that Amazon re-evaluate their agreement with this company and take them to the woodshed for a 'chat'. I would further recommend avoiding a depressing/costly chance at happiness/nostalgia.
