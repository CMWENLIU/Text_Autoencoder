I love the flavor of these bars.  So good.  But, they are really hard. They are made with nuts so I suppose I understand why they are hard, but after the first few bars, I found myself skipping these and reaching for other bars that were not as hard as these.  Too bad because I really love the flavor.  This 20 pack will last me a long, long time...
