First let me clear two things:<br />1. I like pure coconut water, and coconut products in general<br />2. This is not about the price<br /><br />This was the worst tasting drink I've had in recent times. It has a very strong artificial coconut flavor which almost makes you gag. If you have had real coconut water, this is nothing like it, but has more of cheap coconut rum flavor. It has an after taste like a dried out coconut that has gone bad. It also has regular sugar as well as a stevia extract which probably makes it overly sweet with a bitter aftertaste. There is nothing right with this drink. Save your money and pick something else.
