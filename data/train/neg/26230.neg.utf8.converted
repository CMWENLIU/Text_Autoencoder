Fry it like bacon for BLTs or breakfast side. Crisp flavor burst with a great aftertaste. I love to cook this at a very low simmer in a covered fry pan for a couple of hours. The texture is very soft, translucent and just melts in your mouth. I'll add it to soups (split Pea, Navy Bean. Very delicious and versatile product. Burgers Smokehouse products are phenomenal! THREE YEARS LATER: OCTOBER 19,2011. Use to love this stuff but after several reorders found the size of the slices, texture no matter how carefully prepared, and in general the product itself not the original I was buying in 2008. The pieces in most or the orders have been too small to fry like a bacon strip. The product turns out tough, sinewy, and rather like something to paste on the bottom of ones shoe rather then put on the breakfast plate. I am a fairly decent cook and knowledgeable and other then boiling the tar out of it, utilizing a pressure cooker, sticking it in a blender, or cremating it and grinding up into ashes you are going to get tough pieces. I don't know what they did to it, perhaps new processing, changed the recipe, new smoke-master, where they are raising or buying the pork cheeks before smoking, shaving the cut on the Jowl, but it is not the same item in size, texture, nor quality I use to so enjoy. The customer service is still wonderful and has credited, sent free packages,and apologized. But now after so many attempts of reordering, retrying, and disappointments I have given up on Burgers Jowl!
