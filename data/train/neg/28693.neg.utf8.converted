This ready to eat meal has a number of drawbacks, One the Sodium Level is 660mgs.<br /><br />The Carbs are 48mgs. I would not call this a healthy snack or meal by any stretch of<br /><br />the imagination. The taste of the salmon mixture is okay, the crackers taste good.<br /><br />The snack mix and the little chocolate bar are the best of the lot here. Would I buy<br /><br />this in a store? No I think not. First it is not really healthy, second it is too<br /><br />expensive for what you get.
