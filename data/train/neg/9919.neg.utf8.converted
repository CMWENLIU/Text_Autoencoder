While Krispy Kreme is a popular Donut franchise,I had never had a donut from there before,didn't know what it tasted like to see what the big deal was. Yep. I must've been the last person on earth that never had the opportunity to eat one. I am from New York (Queens)and there are no Krispy Kreme stores near me. There used to be one in Long island, but I think it is now a Verizon store. I know there is one all the way in Manhattan in Penn Station,on the 2nd level (somewhere near the Amtrak)that everyone finds a real "pain" to find. I never thought it was THAT serious to go all the way there just to get a donut.<br /><br />There are a million Dunkin Donuts around..sometimes 2 in the same zone, but no Krispy Kreme spots other than in the Penn Station. Now I went online to Krispy Kreme com to see if I can order and get it shipped to me only to find out that they don't take donut orders. They wanted to assure the "freshness and guarantee"..bummer! I understood though.<br /><br />I found a few seller's in the search engine selling them that pointed to amazon..YAY! Bought from "Huggy's Heaven". The price was a bit high but I figured they'd be worth it for the seller to go get them, package it up, then ship it. I don't know if the mistake was made by ME in that I purchased them in the summer or if the seller took too long to ship it out, but I was VERY disappointed when it arrived. I was told it was "shipped" by priority mail. Then it said it was to arrive between late August to mid September in the message through amazon (confusing).<br />I was really worried about how fresh this would be when it arrived. I was thinking well maybe the seller is waiting on a "batch" of orders for Krispy Kreme,get them all one shot..then ship.<br /><br />It arrived ironically on the same day it expired (there was a sticker on it that said Sept. 9 2011)<br />It was professionally wrapped in cellophane wrap with bubble wrap and even paper wrap with ice packets that were naturally melted because of the time. The outside of the Krispy Kreme donut box was sticky,slimey,and had melted icing all over it like the whole box was dunked into the icing(just messy!)<br /><br />I opened up the box with sticky hands and tried a donut....STALE!! With Slimey icing all over it. No one wanted to try one with me. My friends asked why I would buy it from a private seller and not the store. They also said that stuff could've been tampered with because of this as well.<br />I ended up throwing the whole thing away. I didn't want to get a huge stomach ache from those slimey,wet,stale donuts. Money down the drain. Lesson Learned.<br />I can't even rate Krispy Kreme in the way I wanted because those donuts I purchased from here does not reflect the actual purchasing from an official store. So unless you're purchasing Twinkies that have a 200 year life span or something simple in the foods dept..I don't recommend buying these kind of donuts if you're picky about freshness.
