I can not wait to try this so called 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  It costs more than other Blue Mountains Coffee - over 50 per pound.  I can find cheaper price by other sellers in Amazon.  I thought it more expensive more tasty...  I am wrong.  The coffee bean is not fresh as what the seller described.  From the paper of the Package , you can tell it has been sit in storage for a while.  .. It is over price and tasted only little better than " regular "  non Blue Mountains coffee.  I purchased it based on the review from other two customers.  They gave it very high review.  Just want to post my opinion - to let other buyer know.  It is not worthy to pay that much money for it.  The true is .. you did paid more than other Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee.. but be careful .. it does not taste better than others.  Very disappointed !!!!  Over priced !!!!!  Don't buy it.
