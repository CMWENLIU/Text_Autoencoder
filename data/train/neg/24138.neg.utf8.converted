This extra virgin olive oil is one of the lowest quality EVOOs I have ever tasted. It is very bitter if you taste it on a stand alone sip from a spoon and compare it with a true pure extra virgin olive oil (which tend to be much more expensive ...you get what you pay for). I have tasted dozens of olive oils from around the world. The reason the price is so low is because the quality is incredibly low.
