I ordered this from Amazon like 6 months ago and I still have 3 packs remaining. I am an Indian and love chicken curry but I'm sorry to say that this prodduct was a complete disappointment. I have had other products from KoI. The paste is not spicy at all- rather bland. It seems to be missing some of the spices needed to make it taste Indian.<br />Not recommended especially if you've had authentic Indian curry in India.
