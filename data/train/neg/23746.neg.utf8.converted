The advertising says tuna in water.  Their web site won't tell you what is in the can!  However if you read the label you see that it is NOT tuna in water, but tuna in water which has been adulterated with genetically modified soy.  This is not good for your health.  It disturbs me when people buy food that they think is healthy but is loaded with genetically modified soy or corn ingredients.  There is no reason to do this!<br /><br />Buy a better brand which is honestly tuna in water only!  Try Natural Sea or Crown Prince brand and see the difference for yourself. There are also other brands that are healthy. You will also find that the tuna is higher quality in those brands - not just watery flakes.
