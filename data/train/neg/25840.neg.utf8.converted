I ordered 2 cases and already received one.  Every can was dented.  I wish I had read the reviews earlier because another customer had the same problem.  AMAZON should discontinue this distributor.  I know from my experience and the earlier feedback about dented cans that my case that is in the mail will be dented also.  Not little dents.  Big dents.
