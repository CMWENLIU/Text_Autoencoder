I first purchased this product because I love the flavored oatmeal that Quaker makes, but found the packets too sweet for my taste and too high of a sugar content for a healthier diet. I was really excited to find the lower sugar instant oatmeal until I noticed that they contain artificial sweeteners to compensate for the reduced sugar. As someone who deliberately avoids "low fat" and "diet" products to keep artificial sweeteners out of my body, it made me mad that they did not make it more clear that this was not a less sweet version of their product, but simply an artificially sweetened one. I just feel that people should be properly warned that the food they are purchasing contains chemical sweeteners, and wanted to let anyone thinking of purchasing this know. If you don't mind artificial sweeteners, then enjoy!
