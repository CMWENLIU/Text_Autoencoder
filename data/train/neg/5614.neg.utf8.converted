This is the  third or forth brand of coconut water in cans that I have tasted .I dont know why coconut water in cans taste weird.<br /><br />The ones in the terapak tastes better and more natural but you can also  tell when the coconut is harvested old or not.The can ones you can not tell if it is because of a certain taste that  I dont normally taste in fresh and younger coconut water and it has an aftertaste.<br /><br />When I was back in Cebu 2011, there is a new trend with the coccnut water , that they harvest, pack on the same day and distribute it to sell in bottle water container within 24 hours and because the water turns rancid if you dont drink it if its not in the refrigerator .But sugar is added since coconut water is bland if the coconut is not very young.Even though they are not direct from the cocnut ,  they were best to none.<br /><br />Anyway ,I dont like coconut water with the aftertaste so even though the can would say all natural and real , its not.<br /><br />I wont be buying this one again.
