I purchased the Torani brand based on my previous experiences with Torani syrups and products but I am not too satisfied with this specific flavor.  Opening up the bottle it definitely smells like what you would get out of a pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc..  The syrup itself is almost like water even when refrigerated and doesn't have a typical syrup consitency.  I tried it both as flavoring to a regular cup of coffee and an espresso drink and was unimpressed.  It definitely had the sweetness that I wanted, but the flavors that I expected weren't there.  I assume maybe buying some pumpkin spice and sprinkling it into the coffee / latte might make it taste better.  I will however try the other brand of syrup that is for sale on Amazon.com and do a taste comparison between the two.  I suggest waiting until another brand comes out with another flavor.  I would even suggest just waiting until Starbucks starts serving up Skinny Pumpkin Spice Lattes.
