Here's a fun science experiment that you can try at home.<br /><br />Pour nearly-boiling water into this filter without coffee (just water) using a filter holder (such as the ones by Cilio or Melitta) and then look at the results in a cup. Notice that:<br /><br />1) The water is slightly brown<br />2) The water smells like the filter - some of the filter's "flavor" has gone into the water that went through it<br /><br />If you brew coffee using this filter you probably won't notice this because the coffee flavor and color is strong enough to overpower these two issues.<br />However, a filter's job is to remove impurities, not add them.
