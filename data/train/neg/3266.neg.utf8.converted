I purchased this product about 4 months ago. The customer service stinks and it's almost impossible to reach a human. My do just fell in the pool and now the collar doesn't work? Thought it was waterproof. I just might contact the BBB on these guys. I hate poor customer service! there is another company called Better LIfe 24/7 and I cannot figure out if they are one and the same?
