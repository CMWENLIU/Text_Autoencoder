Our boxer was on Natural Balance Duck and Potato for years and did very well on it.  After they changed the formula, he experienced horrible vomiting and diarrhea.  He has also had an major increase in skin irritation (ear itching and paw chewing).  The change in the formula was not made apparent by the company for months.  Later they indicated the changed with a small sticker on the bag.  Very disappointed in the company and hoping that no permanent damage has been caused to our pup.
