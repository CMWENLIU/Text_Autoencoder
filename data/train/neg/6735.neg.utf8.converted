I have used these products for several years for my Cairn Terrier. Have always purchased them in health food stores and felt it was a safe product. Never had a problem. However, I recently(June) purchased this item from Amazon and recieved the 6 bags. It took a couple of severe illnesses in my dog for me to connect the mellow mut strips. He initially started vomiting yellow bile and it proceeded to a vomiting/diarrhea progression that lasted for two weeks with much abdominal pain. The first time, I thought he had just injested something outside that had caused inflammation in his abdominal tract. My dog eats an excellent, mostly organic diet...is seven years old and in great health and vitality. After the first bout of this "mystery illness" I didnt give him any treats for a while(because of the dehydrated form) just a very bland diet of rice and chicken/beef working back in to adding veggies etc that would be in his normal diet...he was fine. A few days ago, with the presence of wonderful health in my dog, I opened a bag of the mellow mut strips and gave him one per day for three days. Here we are again, same illness...same symptoms. This time, I made the connection...did some internet research and found numerous pet owners who have experienced the same "toxic" problems with these Dogswell products. I am writing this review to alert other pet owners to a likely contamination problem in these products.
