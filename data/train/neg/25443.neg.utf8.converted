So, what I received were not in fact Salmiak Rocks, but Chocolate Rockies. The incredibly unfortunate thing about this is that these two products look incredibly similar and you cannot tell one from another until you eat them. As such I had already opened everything before I realized the error so I couldn't return them. The chocolate rockies weren't terrible, but they were not NEARLY as good as the salmiak rocks and moreover they weren't what I ordered. When you expect salty black licorice flavor and instead you get "chocolate" (I use the term loosely because the filling was akin to a tootsie roll) wrapped in black licorice, it's rather disappointing.<br /><br />I don't know how you can go about ensuring that you get the right thing here, which is a shame because the price is great and if it was in fact salmiak rocks, those are a delicious soft salty black licorice with a sweet molasses taste to it.<br /><br />If you do order this product, good luck.
