Our original order (placed on amazon.com, from Vitamin Grocer) of two biokleen produce wash bottles came completely wrecked (sad, because it is a really great product) - since there was no protective packaging in the box, both bottles arrived cracked an spilled. My husband received an email at his agency from the staff at our APO post office to pick up the leaking box - the box itself was not damaged, only the contents, since I'm sure they tumbled around quite a bit without anything to protect them (which makes no sense to send bottles containing liquid). Since we have been using our APO, we have spent thousands of dollars and received many many dozen packages with absolutely no problems. After writing initial review, I was contacted by the seller, Vitamin Grocer. Promised if I deleted my review, they would send a replacement for our order (plus additional bottles - I declined the additional bottles, but agreed graciously to the replacements as long as they were better packaged, because what would be the point?), they wrote me back that replacements would be sent ASAP - that contact was originally November 4. I contacted them again around January 4 to follow up, received an email stating it was sent, and I then followed up requesting tracking and they have not responded. I am disappointed and frustrated and feel duped.
