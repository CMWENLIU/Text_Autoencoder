I am following Dr. Simeon HCG protocol and have to exclude all sugar off my ration. I like to take coffee in the morning, but I can't drink it unsweetened, so I've tried Splenda, though I know it is bad for you. IAlso, it changes the coffee taste completely, so I started looking for an alternative sweeteners and found out about Stevia. Very little negative reviews, lots of positive. So, I decided to give it a try. Well, today I've received it. It tastes horrible! Much worse, then Splenda. It has a bitter taste and awful artificial aftertaste. Gr-r-rrr!... I can't imagine, how people use it regularly and find it pleasant!
