I purchased this food because I am trying to feed my cats a near grain free diet and this is one of the few I could find.  That's the good part, well that and this is the only one of the purina fancy feast classics that didn't contain fish either!  Now, the bad part is that my cat would eat this about one can in twenty meaning there is a quality control issue.  After the some research on this matter, I came across the ugly....check out the reviews at consumeraffairs.com (just google consumeraffairs purina -- sorry but amazon site stripped the link when I inserted into the review).  So, be careful as Purina is the major supplier of most pet foods and after reading those HUNDREDS of complaints....they will never again get my business.
