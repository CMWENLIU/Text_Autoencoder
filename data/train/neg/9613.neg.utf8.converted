I loved these as a kid, but this box was old and stale!!! THE WHOLE BOX!!!!<br /><br />Before you buy this item, make sure and check how long it's been in the warehouse.<br /><br />I bought a fresh pack at the store just the other day, the difference was night and day.<br /><br />Call customer service and inquire before purchase.<br /><br />The last thing you want is a great childhood memory ruined because you got old,rock hard crap!!!!
