If u have tried ready-to-eat (any brand) from Indian grocer and u like that sort of thing then go for this else "DON'T".<br /><br />This is same old stuff (I bought it since it has ITC brand name expecting something better/different) and nothing great about it. Personally Ended throwing many of it in trash. (preservatives, no original taste) yucky!<br /><br />Spicy, but strange smell/taste.
