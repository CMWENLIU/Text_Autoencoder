I absolutely love junk red licorice, so I thought that I would try the Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists since they would probably be a much healthier treat.  The initial taste was okay, yet not quite right... they had a kind of weird wheat flavor and heavier texture, which is not the kind of thing you want to taste when you're thinking red licorice.  But it was the after-taste that left me thinking "yuck!"  It was just plain strange, almost minty, but again with a grain flavor.  I could not put my finger on what the flavor was, but then after looking at the ingredients list, it made sense: the number one ingredient is wheat!  Now this is much healthier than regular red vines that consist of mainly corn syrup, but I would not ever eat these!  Now, I should mention that all the rest of my family tried them too, some who love sweets and some that do not, and they all thought they tasted fine.  So I guess if you are looking for something sweet to munch on that is a little bit healthier give them a try, but don't think that they will taste like red vines.
