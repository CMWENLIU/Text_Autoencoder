Wish I read more of the reviews.  The product arrived with then inner package all broken and tea powder everywhere.  What a mess.  Also, when I did get that all cleaned up, the tea tasted stale.  What a waste of money.  Stay away from serendipiTea.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00117GEGU">SerendipiTea Matcha Culinary Grade, Organic Green Tea, 4-Ounce Box</a>
