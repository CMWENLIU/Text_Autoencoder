This is advertised as being a vegan dog treat product, but it is definitely not vegan. Its Amazon title even has the word, "vegan" in it: "KONG Premium Treats Sweet Potato Vegan Treats". I ordered one of these, and gelatin is in the ingredient list. Gelatin is not vegan.<br /><br />The product does not contain any animal "by-products" (rendered meat) and even says so on the package. I think that's what confused the person who labeled it "vegan".<br /><br />Ingredients: Sweet Potatoes, Barley Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Maple Syrup, Vegetable Glycerine, GELATIN [my emphasis], Natural Flavor, Salt, Carrots, Peas, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Natural Smoke Flavor, Mixed Tocopherols, Rosemary.<br /><br />And if I were nitpicking, I'd say the Natural Flavor and Natural Smoke Flavor could also be non-vegan. I can't say for sure.<br /><br />The use of acids in this is also a little weird. I don't usually see three used. And phosphoric acid isn't typically in dog treats, I don't think. It's just odd.<br /><br />I also think it's odd that they used maple syrup, since it tends to cost a lot more than fructose syrup. I guess they suspect people avoid fructose syrup or HFCS. But maple syrup is just another sweetener, probably just as "bad" as HFCS.<br /><br />Other info: "Crude protein: no less than 6.0%. Crude fat: no less than 1.0%. Crude fiber: no more than 4.0%. Moisture: no more than 28.0%."<br /><br />Anyway, just wanted to chime in to mention that it's not vegan like the title says.<br /><br />Hope that helps!
