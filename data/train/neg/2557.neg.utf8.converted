I love thinkThin bars (especially the chunky peanut butter) and buy them all the time at Trader Joe's.  When Amazon had a "Deal of the Day" for them at a discounted price, I immediately ordered two boxes (and signed up for a subscription because their price seemed a little better than Trader Joe's.)  Unfortunately, the two boxes of Thinkthin bars I received were so stale they were inedible - the bar was covered with a white powder and fell apart into dusty crumbs when I broke off a piece to check the inside condition.  Like an idiot, I actually decided to taste the bar just to make sure the appearance was not deceiving - I really do love these bars and my mouth was watering for one!  YUCK - the taste was horrible and I couldn't seem to wash it away!  Amazon doesn't allow food returns, so I've contacted customer service and asked for my money back.  I want a full refund - and I've cancelled my subscription.  So, buyer beware - thinkThin bars are great, but you apparently have to be careful where you buy them.  And sometimes a seemingly great "deal of the day" is not that great.
