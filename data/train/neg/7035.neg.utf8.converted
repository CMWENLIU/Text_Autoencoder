<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDBRI6">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a> I have been using this product for 2 years because I am a diabetic.  I cannot find it where I moved to so I placed an order through Amazon.  Never have I had a problem with anything I ordered through Amazon.  This product arrived in crumbs. I have opened two boxes and both are broken pieces.  The others sound broken when I shake them but I cannot open them because of staleness issue.  I would like to cancel my delivery of every two months because of this.
