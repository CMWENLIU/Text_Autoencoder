If this is supposed to be Indian food, then I don't like Indian cuisine.  The curry vegetable tasted like canned vegetable soup with curry in it.  The spinach and cottage cheese looked so bad that my husband wouldn't even taste it.  It was like baby food spinach with chunks of tofu in it.  I ate it with lots of rice.  I don't even want to open the others.  No thanks to these.
