Since the product was marked down from $215, and it says "an 8 pack", we figured there were more then 8 grabbers in the package.<br /><br />We thought it was an 8 pack with a few grabbers in each package. Wrong! There were only 8 grabbers in the whole box, meaning I just spent $3.75 on each grabber!!!<br /><br />We can get them at the store for $1.75-$2. So basically we were just ripped off.<br /><br />Save your money and buy them in the store.
