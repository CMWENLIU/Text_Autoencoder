I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the "discounts" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.
