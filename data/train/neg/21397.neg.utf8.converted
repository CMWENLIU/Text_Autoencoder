I tried this soup when I was sick. I followed all directions on can, just heat n eat. It tasted and smelled AWFUL! I took one spoonful before having to spit it back out. I even checked the can to make sure it wasn't expired, but it was still good according to the date on the can.<br />I would just make some vegetarian "chicken" noodle soup at home. Cube some tofu, throw in some noodles, onions, nutritional yeast, etc. Much tastier.
