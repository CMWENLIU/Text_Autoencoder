Doesn't taste like olive oil at all.<br />This is one of the tasteless olive oil I have tried.<br />I grew up with olive oil.<br />Most of the exported olive oil from Italy are not what they use to be.<br />They import mix and then export olive oil, and Genco is just that a bottling, caning company.<br />This oil is more likely from Tunisia who has one of the worst oil in the Mediterranean region.<br />Italy as some fine olive oil but this is not it.<br />This doesn't taste like olive oil.<br />About 60% of all olive oil from Italy is not what it is labeled.
