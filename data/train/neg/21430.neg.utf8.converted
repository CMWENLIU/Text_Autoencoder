I was expecting this to be a light flowery/fruity tea and it was not that at all. The camomile flowers have tiny pieces that go through my nice tea infuser and they make a mess of the clean up process with how tiny the pieces are. I also got the cranberry orange and prefer that much more. This just doesn't work for me at all and I love this type of tea just not this blend at all.
