I at first thought I ordered the wrong product, and had to go back and check. This defeats much of the purpose of a K-Cup, having a sealed package with nitrogen gas to keep it fresh until ready to use. When I opened the bag, it was a great smell, as all the aroma escaped into the atmosphere!<br />Know how do you keep the rest fresh? Opening and closing a zip lock isn't going to cut it, as air gets in each time.<br />Also, without the cup, I don't think the coffee gets a chance to 'seep' long enough, as it seems a bit weak for something called Fog Cutter.<br />Think I'll avoid this one in the future.
