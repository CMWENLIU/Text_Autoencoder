We got this syrup to use with coffee as well as to make Italian sodas, with and without the cream. My first use was with coffee;the aftertaste was horrible. The bitter taste flooded your mouth and was not washed away by subsequent sips of coffee;that cup went down the drain! Unfortunately we fared no better with the sodas; the bitter aftertaste was persistent. Needless to say, our subscribe and save shipments on this product have been cancelled.
