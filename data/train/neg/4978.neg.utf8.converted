I love this chocolate and it's not sold in stores.  I purchased 10 boxes and not one was edible.  The chocolate was whitish, dry and crumbling.  The inside filling was dry and crumbling.  If you have ever had spoiled chocolate...this was it.  It was a huge disappointment and waste of $30!!  Beware Yogurette lovers!
