I had read in a health magazine that Fenugreek was a product that could help enlarge the breasts. I didn't even get to a point with prolonged use to dicover if that was true because these pills had such a funny taste to them, and if you don't eat right away or right before you feel very sick, and still, sometimes after eating you'll feel sick. Purhaps it was the size or the dose
