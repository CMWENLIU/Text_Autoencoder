I can't believe you guys jacked up the price and canceled my order on these. "We are sorry, but your order is not available...."<br /><br />Oh, is it not available? Interesting. When I try to buy this for $5 less, it seems that my order is unavailable. BUT!!!! If I pay almost $18 it will be available. YESSSSSS!!!! I love the honesty its so great!!!!<br /><br />You know what, these are cheaper at the grocery store in bulk. I think I will buy them there.
