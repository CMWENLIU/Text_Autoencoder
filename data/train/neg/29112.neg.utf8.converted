I love to use these pretzels to decorate and give to friends and family during the holidays.  I just recently bought 3 CASES (36 boxes) all of which contained at least 50% broken pretzels.  Each bag only had 3-6 whole pretzels in them.  I'm glad that Amazon was able to "working with me" on this dilemma but I am still exremely disappointed with the condition in which these were received.
