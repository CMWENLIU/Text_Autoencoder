Bad side affects!!!<br /><br />It doesn't happen to everyone, but to some people this gum has bad side affects. Don't worry, nothing is permanent, and if you've already consumed it and nothing happened, you're fine. It's just for some people, their body doesn't know how to process it properly, so short side affects are included. I'm not saying Orbit is at fault, because they have other excellent gum, but this did not go so well for me.<br /><br />It contains and ingredient called Aspartame, which is a fake sager. To learn more, go to this website: [...]<br /><br />When I ate it my lips got tingly, and my throat and tongue went numb. I also felt nauseous, had difficulty breathing and got a headache.<br /><br />If you've previously had Mono, or have it now, it can either bring out the Epstein Barr virus,(The virus that causes Mono) or temporarily make it worse.<br /><br />Also, if you have a muscle disease, you can temporarily experience muscle pain.<br /><br />Just remember, check gum boxes for any fake sugars, and remember that this doesn't happen with everyone, it can be rare. And again I'm not blaming Orbit for this problem, as this gum tasted great, my body just didn't agree with it.<br /><br />If you do have the symptoms, gargle and swish with salt water, drink a whole water bottle, and you should be fine within about half and hour.<br /><br />I encourage you all to do research on fake sugar.
