I was so excited to receive my order, considering the rave reviews. And I was so sad to read the labels on my jars -- which stated the ingredients as Concentrated Date Juice, Sugar, Water, Citric Acid." The web photo of the label says only "DATE." Apparently, the maker is sending Amazon a different product to substitute for the "pure natural" all-date one. This substitute is just a syrup. Other reviewers seem to love it, but I wanted pure date molasses. UPDATE: Since the customers who got lucky and got the all-date product loved it, I tried again. Sadly, this time, the "date molasses" didn't even taste like dates; compared to my first order, this batch looked light in color, had a more watered-down consistency, tasted to me like HFCS mixed with honey, and tasted to another person like pancake syrup. I wish the manufacturer would make a pure date molasses. They make a carob molasses, but I'm afraid to try it based on this experience.
