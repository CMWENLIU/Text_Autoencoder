This was the healthiest thing since, well, fruit. One can contains a whopping 33 sugar grams and 35 carbs. While it may be "natural", be careful how much you drink! As far as taste, it was just OK. It tasted like bubbly apple juice, even though it said "black cherry" right on the can the taste was just plain ol' apple juice!
