These Olive Oil Potato Chips with Rosemary were SO GOOD at one time when produced under the name of SOLEA.<br />I bought them frequently, first at Whole Foods then online.  They were large heavy chips that one could easily tell were cooked in Olive Oil<br />with just enough Rosemary on them to give a great distinctive taste. Now they have been RUINED.<br />The chips are smaller, lighter with less Olive Oil and the Rosemary is piled up at the bottom of the bag(instead of on the chips)!<br />Oh, did I mention they are virtually TASTELESS as well?  And I have a box of 12 bags!  UGH!!<br />David<br />Washington, DC
