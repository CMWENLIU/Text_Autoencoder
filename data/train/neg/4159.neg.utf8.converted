I ordered this for a custodian at the high school I teach at, she was still working while on the wait-list for a liver transplant.  It was so cute, and I knew it would really be a pick-me-up for her.  It was supposed to arrive in ten business days, but never came at all, not while she was still working, or even after she got worse and was home bound waiting.  I know this is true, because I didn't know her home address, so I told them to deliver it to the school....so I know it never came.  I have e-mailed the company several times, and they have never replied, although they still spam me with info on new items...as if I would ever order from them again.  Buyer beware - the company I bought mine from was a total rip-off!
