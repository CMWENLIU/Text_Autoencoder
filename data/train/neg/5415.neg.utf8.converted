I bought some of this and tried several packets. I wanted to like it, I really did. But like all of the aspartame-based sweeteners like Equal and Nutra-sweet, stevia is bitter.  Truvia gets 2 stars because it is markedly less bitter than the others but still not sweet like sugar. The rest of the fake sugars get no stars and some are so bad as to owe stars back, like negative stars.<br /><br />I am probably very sensitive to it but so are many others. So if you find artificial sweeteners bitter, then Truvia will be bitter as well. But splitting it with sugar helps somewhat. The only thing that tastes like cane sugar is cane sugar - or beet sugar or whatever but a non-artificial sweetener.
