My wife brought this home from the store the other day and I was amazed at the amount of sugar in them.  Every calorie in this comes from sugar.  While Gerber doesn't add sugar, apples are naturally very sweet, they do sweeten the apples by placing them in a white grape concentrate.  The taste is far too sweet to give to a 10+ month old.
