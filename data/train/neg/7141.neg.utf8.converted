For DECADES I loved Ovaltine! I loved the way the crunchy crystals tasted and felt in my mouth; sometimes I would just eat a dry spoonful of Ovaltine straight from the jar and wash it down with a glug of milk. Good times!<br /><br />This USED to be more nutritional than Nesquik, but not anymore. Now, it's just like Nesquik, only sweeter and with LESS of a chocolate taste. Ovaltine isn't special anymore. If I want a chocolate-like flavoring in my milk now, I just buy whatever's cheaper.<br /><br />Since the flavor, texture, and nutritional value have changed so drastically, why even call it Ovaltine anymore? VERY disappointed.
