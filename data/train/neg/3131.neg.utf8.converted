I grew up eating Starkist tuna.  It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.<br /><br />I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.<br /><br />I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.<br /><br />Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.  It's no longer the tasty tuna of yesteryear.  It is now tuna bits in slimy, tuna-flavored sludge water.
