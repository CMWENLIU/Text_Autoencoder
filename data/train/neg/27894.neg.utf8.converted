I have been trying to find a low fat peanut butter for ages that tastes decent.  I saw Better N Peanut Butter at my local grocery store this morning and decided to try it.  After one taste, it ended up in the trash.  It tastes GROSS and leaves a very unpleasant and lingering after taste in the mouth.  From now on, I am sticking with my extra crunchy Jiff.  I am just glad that I bought some Jiff just in case the Better N Peanut Butter wasn't good.
