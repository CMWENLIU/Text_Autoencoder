The box is 24 pack of tiny boxes. There is 24 little boxes and the little boxes are 24 grams each. The box you get at Walgreen or Walmart is 142 grams and costs a dollar. If you pay $13.33 for this product like we did than the cost of these Boston bake beans is 43grams/dollar. Walgreens is 142g/dollar. So the only reason to spend this much is if you can't get them at a store near you or you really want the mini boxes.<br /><br />P.S. I love the candy, I just don't think it was worth the cost.
