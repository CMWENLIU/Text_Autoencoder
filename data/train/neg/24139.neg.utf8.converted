I ordered this Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil last year and found it to be quite good.  It had a nice "olivey" flavor and I felt safe ordering it again this year.  Unfortunatly this can has none of that "olivey" flavor.  In fact it is flavorless! I am very disappointed and will probably not order it again.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MMO8W2">Genco Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 1 Gallon</a><br /><br />Sincerely;<br />E.
