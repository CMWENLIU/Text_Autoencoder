Buchkwheat Cereal was always my favorite cereal, so when I found this, I had to buy it.  Nothing like the Buckwheat<br />Cereal I missed.  I can't even taste the maple flavor, had to add maple flavoring.  This did not have the lasting glazed crunch I had hoped for either.  If you have not had the original Buckwheat Cereal, this would be ok, but compared to the original thing, it's not it.
