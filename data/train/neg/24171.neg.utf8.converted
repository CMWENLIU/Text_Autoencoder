My husband and I made one of these Canterbury Naturals Chocolate Orange Pound Cakes last weekend..... I say "we" made it w/my tongue in cheek because these are, indeed, very simple and definitely do not require any help.<br /><br />I was glad my husband was there for making the glaze, however, (so I would have a witness and would not get teased later)...... because I was VERY surprised to see the Orange Glaze recipe:<br /><br />1/2 cup orange juice & 1/2 cup GRANULATED sugar - not confectioner's sugar as I have only ever used in glazes before.<br /><br />I've baked a few things in my life that call for glazes and I've never seen granulated sugar called for in a recipe. Not being a baker by trade I thought there must be something I don't know about this simple concoction......so, w/my husband's encouragement I proceeded to go with the box & not my instincts....<br /><br />Incredulous, we decided to do what the directions called for: combine the o.j. & granulated sugar, simmer for 5 min. over med. heat, let cool 5 min. then pour or brush over top of cooled cake....<br /><br />Just as we suspected, the glaze was a disaster and not only tasted odd but looked even worse - the "glaze" never got to a glaze consistency and just soaked into the (already dense) cake and pooled around the bottom in the sheet pan........lol<br /><br />The cake itself, mind you, was delicious, just as the other reviewers have stated (more so before the soaking of the odd "glaze"). I checked and ALL SIX boxes of the mix that we were shipped have the same directions. I feel CERTAIN that this is a typo and that you are supposed to use 1/2 cup of CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR and NOT granulated....<br /><br />Otherwise, we like the cakes and will continue to bake them..... just a heads up for all you other bakers out there that follow the directions and not your instincts......<br /><br />Cheers,<br />JA
