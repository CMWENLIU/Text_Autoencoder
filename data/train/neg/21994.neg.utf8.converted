I love sweetened condensed milk. I use it in my coffee, pour it over fruit (kiwi and tart strawberries turn into something extraordinary with scm over them), and I especially love it on an iced dessert called halo-halo. Move over vanilla ice cream...some scm and shaved ice just takes my breath away.<br /><br />So when I saw this bottle I thought I'd seriously scored big. No more fiddling with messy cans or figuring out longterm storage. However, these thoughts were soon dashed after bringing the product home. The taste was "off" somehow. Best I can describe it was as dusty-tasting and stale. The sell-by date was fine, so maybe I just got a bad batch. However, I haven't purchased another one since and have gone back to my Eagle and Asian brand sweetened condensed milks.
