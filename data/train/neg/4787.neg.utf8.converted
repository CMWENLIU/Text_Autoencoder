Fixed according to directions and served to a panel of 3 people.  0/3 liked it.  I'm a fan of Kraft mac-n-cheese and could eat a pound of steamed broccoli for dinner alone but the powdered broccoli's look, taste and texture were bad.  As a side note, I'm not a fan of Velveeta or processed cheese like the cheese syrup they put on nachos but since I like Kraft man-n-cheese I thought I might like this.  No.
