I was told that Swiss Miss is the only brand of hot chocolate K-Cups out there that does not use artificial sweeteners...NOT TRUE.  Although they DO use sugar, it ALSO has sucralose in it too!!!!  I checked in the grocery store, and even the packets of original Swiss Miss has sucralose!!!  I guess I will have to stick to home made, until I can find something out there that believes in using NATURAL sugar!
