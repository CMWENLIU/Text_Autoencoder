Only if you can stomach a raw smelly fish smell when you open the package and the rubbery noodle texture that doesn't go away with chewing should you order these.  I made the mistake of ordering 10 and threw most away after trying to do something with them twice.  These noodles were like eating rubber bands -- NASTY and look like clear tapeworms.  I tried cutting them, only could stomach them if I cut them in tiny pieces and didn't chew after smothering them in Ragu.  NOT GOOD - I threw that meal out.  I'd steer clear, goes to show if something looks to good to be true - a no calorie no carb noodle  it is too good to be true.... These are also not worth the price.  If you do decide to order the noodle, there are also much less versions than the "Miracle Noodle" on amazon.com.  Order one package for trying - not a lot.
