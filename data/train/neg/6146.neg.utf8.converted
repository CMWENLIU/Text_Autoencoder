Please be aware that these bars have ALFALFA that can cause DNA mutation from a component called L-canavanine( this is an analog of an amino-acid that 'tricks' your body into forming  dis-functional DNA!). When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA has induced Lupus.I am vigilant to to beware these natural companies put questionable ingredients in their products!<br /><br />Alfalfa grass is in the bars and powder of this Amazing Grass product. I did purchase this product and did not realize it contained alfalfa until after I received it. L-canavanine(found in alfalfa seeds and also to a lesser degree in leafs) is a plant insectiside. L-canavanine occurs as a toxic non-protein amino acid in Alfalfa.  The seeds have the highest amount of L-canavanine ; the grass also contains this product. There are other plants that contain L-canavanine but are not common- Alfalfa is the most studied in this area.<br /><br />See the Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL - published in Autommun Rev. 2006 Jul;5(6):429-35. Epub 2005 Dec 29. has found:<br /><br />"One mechanism of its toxicity is its incorporation into proteins, replacing L-arginine and giving rise to functionally aberrant polypeptides. Association of SLE and alfalfa was first reported in a volunteer who developed lupus-like autoimmunity while ingesting alfalfa seed for a hypercholesterolemia study. This was corroborated with studies in monkeys fed with alfalfa sprout that developed SLE. Re-challenge with L-canavanine relapsed the disease. Arginine homologue L-canavanine, present in alfalfa, was suspected as a cause. L-canavanine can be charged by arginyl tRNA synthetase to replace L-arginine during protein synthesis. Aberrant canavanyl proteins have disrupted structure and functions. Induction or exacerbation of SLE by alfalfa tablets reported in a few cases remains controversial. Epidemiological studies on the relationship between alfalfa and SLE are sparse. In mice, NZB/W F1, NZB, and DBA/2 mice fed with L-canavanine show exacerbation/triggering of the SLE, however, BALB/c studies were negative. L-canavanine incorporation may be more efficient in the presence of inflammation or other conditions that can cause arginine deficiency. The L-canavanine induced apoptotic cells can be phagocytosed and a source of autoantigens processed by endosomal proteases. Endogenous canavanyl proteins are ubiquitinated and processed via proteasome. Incorporation of L-canavanine into proteasome or endosome can also cause disruption of antigen processing. Alfalfa/L-canavanine-induced lupus will be an interesting model of autoimmunity induced by the modification of self-proteins at the translational level."<br /><br />Please be careful with this product. There are many other "green foods products" that avoid the use of Alfalfa seeds or grass for this reason.<br /><br />Other research all accessible by public at Pubmed (among many):<br /><br />Prete PE.
