These were a disappointment.  I've had this brand before and they were quite good.  This batch tasted stale, perhaps it had been on the shelf too long.  In addition, almost all of individually wrapped biscotti arrived broken.  It must have had a rough ride.  I won't order these again.  If it wouldn't have been a hassle, I would have sent them back for my money back.
