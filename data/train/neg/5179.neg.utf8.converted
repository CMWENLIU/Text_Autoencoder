I won't be finishing this.  I'm not sure if it's the quality of the tea itself or the quality of the spices added to it.  I tried 4 bags and ended up with a lousy cup of tea with a hint of spice and a bad aftertaste every time.  I was expecting pumpkin pie spice.  Maybe cinnamon?  Nutmeg? A little cloves? Ginger?  I, nor any of the people I shared this with detected any of that, one said it tasted like a rotten pumpkin before even seeing the bag or the box, does that count?  I'm no tea snob, this just absolutely didn't do it for any of us, straight or sweetened.  I figured this was a sure bet, and foolishly ordered this 6 pack.  Don't make that mistake, try one box first!
