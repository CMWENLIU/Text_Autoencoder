If I could give a product minus twelve stars this one would get it.  We bought six boxes of these only to open sealed packets and find the product covered with a hairy white mold.  Of course it was all natural, non-GMO, preservative free, gluten-free mold!<br /><br />There is a very good scientific and rational reason why competent food makers use preservatives, and that is to preserve the food.  Here we see the benefit of an irrational and ignorance based prejudice against the use of preservatives - the woo woo friendly preservative free all natural food goes bad precisely because it has no preservatives.<br /><br />I called the manufacturer and the best they could offer was an apology, which was obviously sincere, and some coupons good for future purchases.  Fat lot of good a handful of coupons will do me when I am never buying these again while shopping online.<br /><br />RUN AWAY!
