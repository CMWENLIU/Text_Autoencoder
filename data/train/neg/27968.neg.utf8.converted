I purchased these candy bars and yes they are great!!!  Just like the ones we had as children!!<br /><br />However, when I purchased them I didn't realize that they were being shipped by Hometown Favorites LLC, the company that carries them, and the cost of shipping almost as much as the cost of the candy bar, $17.93.<br />The charge was placed on my card and I was only aware of it when I got my notice that it had already shipped. I am hoping that if money is a consideration to someone that this will save them from my experience.<br /><br /> Amazon is great and upfront with their shipping costs -- I will not purchase anything from Hometown Favorites LLC again.
