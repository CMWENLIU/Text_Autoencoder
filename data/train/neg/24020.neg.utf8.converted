I love the Dunkin Donuts pumpkin coffee and pumpkin spice latte, so I asked for pumpkin syrup for Christmas and received this as a gift.  I was incredibly excited, until I tasted my coffee.  At first, I thought my milk had gone bad, because the coffee just tasted unpleasant and odd.  I tossed the coffee and poured a new cup, adding milk from a different container, and was met by the same putrid taste.<br /><br />To me, the syrup tastes like rotten squash/pumpkin.  I didn't taste much (or any) spice, though that may have been the overpowering smell of something spoiled.  I tried several proportions of coffee:milk:syrup and could not come up with anything palatable.<br /><br />I strongly suggest you do not purchase this product, unless I got a terrible batch (in which case, Torani needs to tweak their quality control process!).
