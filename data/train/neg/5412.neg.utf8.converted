The pro is that it's marketed as organic. I like that and prefer organic teas. I also saw that it appeared to be a top selling organic oolong item on Amazon, so I was more eager to try it. However, upon receiving it, I realized (through leakage of the tea bags themselves, into the inside and outside of the box) that it appears as mostly a finely milled brown powder with some visible small chopped (?) tea leaves (?). I don't think this is the fault of Amazon (who shipped it very promptly, excellent customer service), but rather just the design of the tea bags. After steeping the tea, it turned a very cloudy color (due to all the finely milled tea particles) which I have never experienced with other oolong teas (I have tried ~5 different brands). I do not want to be drinking such particulate-heavy matter for concern of potential kidney stones! I do not plan to buy this again at all.
