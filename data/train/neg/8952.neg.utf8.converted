It's probably just me... about six months ago, I stopped using no-calorie sweeteners at all, and I've been using mostly honey and agave syrup since then.  Maybe I'm not used to other sweeteners anymore.  My first impression of this was that it had a terrible flavor, and it wasn't very sweet at all.<br /><br />I tried it first in a cup of tea--instead of my usual scant teaspoon of honey, I tried half a packet of Nectresse.  The flavor was bad enough that I dumped the tea.  I waited a day before trying it in some plain yogurt.  I added a little bit to a small amount of yogurt, and again, threw it away after the first taste.<br /><br />Just to compare, I tried a little Splenda in some fresh plain yogurt, and it tasted fine, though just sweet, without the depth of flavor of honey.<br /><br />Looking at other reviews, it seems as though some people love it and some find it unpleasant.  I'd suggest trying a small amount before stocking up on this sweetener.
