After comparing my own sense of what sweeteners taste best with that of others, I have concluded that there must be a genetic explanation for why some brands have an unpleasant aftertaste for certain people while being perfectly flavorless for others. I have a strong aversion to Sweet n Low because of what is for me a most unpleasant aftertaste, but I know that some people enjoy it.  Splenda and Equal have very little aftertaste for me, and blended in with other ingredients, I cannot detect any unpleasant taste from either, although I have friends who cannot stand to use them. Many years ago, I bought liquid Stevia sweetener, but the aftertaste, which to me had an anise flavor, was a turn-off. In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products. If you aren't able to try just a sample of Truvia and therefore are considering spending your hard-earned cash on an entire box, then be aware before you buy that you may have taste buds like mine that can detect bitterness in this product.
