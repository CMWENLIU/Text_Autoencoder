I used to order this over a year ago on a subscribe and save basis, and was quite happy with it.  I just re-ordered it, and opened 3 of 24 cans only to find that it was watery, and smelled off.  I am definitely NOT ordering this again, and was told I could not return it to Amazon as it is a food product.  I had to beg and plead with their customer service to get a refund.  Caveat Emptor!  This is not the same great product it used to be...
