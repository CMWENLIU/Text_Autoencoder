I bought this product from Costco this past weekend. I am a student teacher and I gave a jar to my mentor and kept one for myself. The next day she came to work complaining that it made her sick. I was not sure if it was because it was a new addition to her diet or not so I ate some of mine despite her warning. I became sick in the same way (diarrhea and severe upset stomach) within the hour. I have been eating this product almost every day every since Costco started selling it so I know that this is not normal but it is really scary. I am a vegan so it is not likely that the apple that I had today was the culprit. I would stay away from this product for a good while. I contacted Maranatha as well as Costco, Costco "noted" the problem but took no steps to remove it from the shelf and I am waiting for Maranatha to get back to me. DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!
