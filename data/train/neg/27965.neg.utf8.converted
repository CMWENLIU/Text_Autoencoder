This product tastes okay, but the packaging is ridiculous.  Three hundred 2-cracker cellophane packs were literally thrown into one, big box, with no padding, no partitions, and no expiration dates.  I got these for travel, for lunches to go, and for the convenience of not having remaining crackers go stale.  My family and I can't even enjoy these with spreads or slices of cheese, because all we have are pieces of crackers and crumbs.
