I was disappointed with the Baby Brezza.  It steamed the veggies well but would not spin for blending.  I am returning it with Amazon because if you return it to the company, they charge you $10.  Ridiculous!  Why should I pay for their poor product!?!?  The instructions also note that the blade had two different positions.  When I put in the blade, it seemed like there was only one position available.  I couldn't lower it anymore.  I wouldn't spend money on this product.  Just get a handstick blender for a third of the price.
