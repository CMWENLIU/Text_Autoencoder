One day I bought a can of coconut cream at the supermarket, just to see what it was. One day, I got around to opening the can. It was thick n creamy, very yummy, excellent in my morning cup of cocoa chai, perfect for baked goods when moistness was needed. It went fast. Too fast. Now I can't find it on a store shelf anywhere in my town. Not even sure it was Savoy brand. But I was glad to find it here at Amazon. For $1.62 it's worth it to try and see if it's the same product that I liked so well. But $6.75 for shipping?! Not if I never eat coconut cream again. Even if I had a million dollars, I wouldn't pay $6.75 shipping for a $1.62 item of any sort. It's the principle of the thing.
