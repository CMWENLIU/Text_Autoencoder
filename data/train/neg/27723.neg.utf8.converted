I bought this because I wanted a cheap source of cinnamon.  But it doesn't taste like any cinnamon I've ever tasted (not a good taste either).  So I used one serving of it, and I have a HUGE container left with no use for it!  I tried giving it NO stars, but the review screen forced me to give it one star.
