From Manitoba Harvest: Cross contamination can occur in pesticide free (non organic grown seed) as wind blow or sharing of trucks, equipment or storage bins can occur. For peace of mind buy certified organic as farmers pay attention to detail, don't share equipment or bins, and are monitored strictly so they are paid a higher prices per pound. There's a difference in what kind of fertilizer is used on the land. Our organic seeds come from certified organic land which uses alfalfa as fertilizer, while our pesticide-free seed farmers have the option of using a synthetic topical on the soil, very much the same as liquid plant food you can buy for your house. This synthetic topical is man-made and not organic, which is why our Pesticide-Free product line cannot be certified organic.<br /><br />Also the tubs are gigantic which makes storing a pain. I've gotten a couple of tubs that needed to be cut open because it wasn't perforated and they couldn't be resealed which also was a problem because the product couldn't stay fresh. They need to stick with the resealable bags and jars rather than these tubs. Cheap is not always worth it that's for sure. I'll stick to true organic in bags that take up little space.
