Last time I got a very reasonable assortment of flavors.<br /><br />This time (June 2010) I got three pounds of Wet-Face Watermelon and two pounds of TooBerry Blueberry.<br /><br />Everyones' tastes are different. For me, I am not a fan of Wet-Face Watermelon. And, I kid you not, the TooBerry Blueberry tastes like a wet dog.<br /><br />So I will give away the Watermelon pops at Halloween. The local kids will like them.<br /><br />And the Wet Dog flavored pops go on my desk at work for all those freeloading coworkers who steal my candy! ;)
