I'm adventurous when trying new foods and the fun, graphic tin definitely gave me the extra push to try these organic ginger mints. Well, lets just say they're not going on my 'Most Awesome Foods Ever!' list.<br />I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but figured I'd give these a try anyway. They're not a 'smooth' candy like some mints are (slightly gritty) and have a sharp ginger 'bite' towards the middle-end that lingers for long after its dissolved. They're so potent, I tasted it for a good hour after just one had been finished. I  gave it to family members who don't mind the taste of ginger and they too were disappointed in how they tasted. While I'm not going back to these, the other flavors do interest me.<br />Points though, for the hinged, reusable tin (I'm thinking they'd be great for the LUSH Cosmetics line of soap chunks and solid shampoo slices that are sold by the pound and dissolve in the shower if they're not dried, tinned and moved out of the bathing area. Also great for use when traveling with the soaps/shampoos and cheaper than buying one of their branded tins).<br />Made in Mexico, mine contained about 40, beige-colored mints.
