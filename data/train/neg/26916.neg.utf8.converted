Boy, did this sound like a great product.  We have a problem with roaches in our apartment and we wanted to give this a shot and avoid combat.  Bought a pack and were amazed at how quickly they were filled.  We had no idea we had so many roaches!<br />So after 3 mos or whatever, we were still having roach problems, so we bought more.  We were interested in how many roaches seemed to be HATCHING in the traps.  Gross, right?  We never had so many roaches.<br />So guess what.  We threw the traps away.  And away went the roaches.<br />We've checked everywhere, and they just seem to be gone.<br />The pheromones were ATTRACTING roaches to my apartment.  We had roaches, yes, but not the infestation we ended up with after using these things!  They seriously are a roach magnet, roaches will come from everywhere to get near them, hatch more babies in your home/apartment, and then you'll need to buy more roach magnets!  Amazing.<br />And gross.<br />Just don't do it.  This is a waste of money and will make your house unsafe with roaches, roach poop, you name it.<br />Totally gross.
