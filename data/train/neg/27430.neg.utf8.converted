I'm pregnant and cannot drink alcohol.  I like wine that isn't chilled and if you get this I recommend you chill it fully before trying it.  If not it tastes like watered down, very bland wine.  When chilled, it tastes like grape juice with not enough sugar in it.  I will buy sparkling cider instead for my Xmas party.
