My 6 month old son has allergic colitis with sensitivities to both dairy and soy.  When we gave him Earth's Best Whole Grain Rice Cereal for infants (which does not list any milk or soy ingredients), he had a bad reaction, so I called the company to find out if the tocopherols (vitamin E) in the cereal are soy-based and they said "yes" even though the ingredients on the package say nothing about soy.  We were very disappointed in Earth's Best for failing to protect babies with allergies/sensitivities.  Fortunately our baby is OK now, and we've switched to HappyBellies cereal which is great and clearly labeled as dairy and soy free.
