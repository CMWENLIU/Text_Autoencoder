I decided to give this product a try, thinking that it was an improvement over Kraft's Deluxe product.  It was not.  As other reveiwer said, the only difference is the extra steps, and the package of white powder (seasoning) did nothing to change the outcome.<br /><br />As I began to follow the directions in making this, I was relaxed by the typical technique of cooking the pasta by boiling the water and cooking them for the up to 8 minutes.  The similarity between this package and the regular Deluxe ends after you drain the water and set the pasta aside.  From there, I felt like a fool as I made a roux of the butter, white powder and milk.  I began to wonder why the cheese sauce needed a thickening agent and seasoning, and why it was not already a part of the cheese sauce.<br /><br />In the end, I ended up with something similar to the regular Deluxe dish that was a little less cheesier.  I had to add salt and pepper to it as I imagined Karft using long-term hospital patients used to bland food to perform its taste tests for this product.  The extra ingredients could have easily been combined into the cheese sauce package.  Preparing the regular Deluxe package would have saved time and resulted in a better dish, would have cost less, and would not have had me waste butter and milk.  The package also suggests adding real cheese and popping it into the oven.  Mind you, if you did that, why not make it homemade yourself?
