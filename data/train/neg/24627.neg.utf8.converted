DO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!  I can't believe I was ever stupid enough to pay $30.40 for 3 bags of 16.25 ounce (not 20.5 ounces) Cheetos.  I have been ripped off to the tune of $16.33 plus shipping.  The bag plainly states the cost of each bag should be $4.39!!  I thought it was against the law to sell something for 3 times over the plainly marked price.  My understanding was that I would receive 3 packs per box with 3 boxes to be shipped.  That would have been 9 bags.  With the $5.00 shipping, I paid $11.80 for each bag of Cheetos.  This vendor is patently dishonest and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon ever again.  I received this box while my husband was in the hospital finding out he had cancer.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box yesterday and found I had been royally cheated.  Amazon, you need to ban this vendor forever.
