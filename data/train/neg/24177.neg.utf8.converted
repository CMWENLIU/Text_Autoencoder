I have been buying Starbucks for years, and it was always at least good and usually exellent. The last few orders of French Roast and Sumatra were very disappointing. The quality is definitely lower than it was, and it is MUCH weaker than it was for years. Believe it or not, I just bought a bunch of cans of Melitta  French Roast on sale for 1/3 the price and it was much better. WHAT HAPPENED, STARBUCKS ?
