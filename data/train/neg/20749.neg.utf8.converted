I'm a huge coffee fan, and enjoy prepared, packaged coffee drinks, so believe me, I'm not a snob about that. I eagerly tasted this cappuccino and I wish I had been looking in a mirror when I tasted it, because I'm pretty sure I made a face. There is an adequate coffee flavor, but that tastes bitter and canned, and is tinged with a sort of chemical aftertaste. There is no discernible dairy or chocolate flavor. I gave the can to my teenager to finish. He said it was okay but you know, teenagers eat/drink anything!<br /><br />Recommendation: No, two thumbs down.
