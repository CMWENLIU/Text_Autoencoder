I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.
