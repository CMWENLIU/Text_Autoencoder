After reading other customer reviews about a different label being underneath the Earth's Best label I went to look under my labels. Sure enough there is the same light blue label remains as in the other customer reviews. I am so upset that I don't know what I have been feeding my baby! I thought I was feeding him good formula. If anyone finds out what it actually is I would love to know. Don't order this formula from amazon!
