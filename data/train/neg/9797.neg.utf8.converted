I really like Kitchens of India's curries, I have a sweet tooth and I generally like recipes made with pumpkin so thought this "pudding" would be great.  I wish I could have tried it before buying a six pack.  It does have an appealing taste but it was far too sweet to finish, even though I am used to Indian "sweets."  Like other reviewers, I also found it to have lots of sugar "grit" and an excessive amount of oil that separates when heated.  It was so rich and oily that I didn't even want to finish it.  Each pouch actually has two servings and each serving has 570 calories, over 50% of the daily recommended value of fat and 61g of carbohydrates... in one 1/2 cup serving!  I think I will just stick with Kitchens of India curries and look for dessert elsewhere.
