Over the last year, I have purchased about 6 boxes of these Nature Valley Granola Bars. I've been noticing that there's an unusually high number of nasty, stale, "chewy" bars(10, 2-bar packs in one box) amid the tasty, fresh, crunchy bars. I love NV Crunchy Granola Bars but Eauction's version seems like they are pulling from Nature Valley's "reject" lots. I'll have to go elsewhere for my bars.
