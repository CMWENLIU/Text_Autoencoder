I've purchased this water for a year now for the high alkaline content and for the great taste.  Recently, I've been getting shipments that are NOT the New Zealand spring water but rather distilled water from Walnut Creek, California.  The taste difference IS night and day as a previous reviewer pointed out.  I won't be buying any more Eternal Water on the internet; you must actually see the label to know you're getting what you paid for.
