Bought two cans of this brand to make coconut ice cream and one of my guests took one spoon full when I took the paddle out and had a serious allergic reaction causing her hives and other reactions.<br /><br />Since she had previously eaten a different dish with coconut milk from another company we looked to see the difference.  In this case the can said it was pure, but on the label at another place it stated that it contained ghar gum which is apparently used to thicken it so as to make it look more like coconut cream.  Search for ghar gum on the internet and see the possible complications before eating it.<br /><br />No one else had such a reaction, but not all the ice cream was eaten after seeing her reaction.
