Don't waste your money on any of this crap. If all you need to do is repel common house pets, then just buy a gallon of brown vinegar. Spray the area using full strength vinegar. It works. It's cheap. It will not harm the animal. BTW- I tried Ridder-Critter and the next day there was dog poop on top of the treated area.
