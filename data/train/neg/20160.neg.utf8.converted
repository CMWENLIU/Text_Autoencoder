So I was browsing thru amazon looking for GoGo Squeez appleapple sauce, and the general price was around $24 for a 48 pack, so around 50cents a pack. I saw this one, and assumed it was a 12 pack of 4 (that's how all the other ones are labeled) imagine my surprise when it came, and it was literally 12 packs of applesauce for 18 dollars! That $1.50 a pack, 3x what everyone else was selling it for, and even 1.5x more than whole foods. This is a rip-off. Buy from someone else and save yourself the trouble of returning the item like I am doing now.
