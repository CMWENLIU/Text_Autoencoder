I bought this on a whim at the store, intending to use it in risotto.  I didn't think it smelled very chicken-y so I tasted it.  It tasted nothing like chicken...it tasted like nothing I wanted to eat.  Fortunately I had some "Better Than Bouillon" on hand and used that with water.<br /><br />I checked the Cooks Illustrated review of chicken broths - it was the lowest rated broth of 9 tested.  One of the remarks: "like an entire vegetable drawer gone bad".<br /><br />I would agree with that.  Stay away from this broth.
