I was looking for a good alternative to sugary soft drinks so I tried The Switch. I wanted something carbonated and not plain water. The Switch meets this criteria, but I was hoping it would be better. It is very sweet and every flavor tastes like apple juice. There is not much variation in the flavors. I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K3UN6M">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, 8.4 oz Cans, 24 pk, Variety : Clementine, Blackberry & Apple</a>. I'll try diluting with water to see if it gets better. I would not recommend this or purchase it again.<br /><br />Update 7-11-12<br />I still am not a big fan of The Switch. I ended up giving the rest of the case away. However I have found a new alternative to soda.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P02EX8">TalkingRain Sparkling Essence, 4-Flavor Variety, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 30)</a> has no sugars or artificial sweeteners. It is just sparkling water with fruit essence. I recommend that to anybody wanting a soda alternative.
