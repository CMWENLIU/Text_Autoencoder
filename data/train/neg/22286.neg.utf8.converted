I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.
