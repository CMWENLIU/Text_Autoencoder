Treats smell so good I would like to eat them myself. They are manufactured in China and they look shiny on the outside and I am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this. I have concerns because of China's reputation, plus they eat dogs in China,so how concerned could they be with making a clean expensive dog treat for rich Americans!
