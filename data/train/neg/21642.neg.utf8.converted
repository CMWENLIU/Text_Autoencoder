I accidentally purchased this product, thinking it was the Natural SunButter I usually buy in the store.  I thought the red cap looked different (the Natural has a yellow cap), but couldn't pinpoint what was different.  I quickly realized after reading the ingredients (sugar, mono-diglycerides) and tasting the product (YUCK!) that is was different.  It was harder in texture than the Natural SunButter because the mono-diglycerides prevent separation, and the taste was so bland and fake-tasting compared to the Natural SunButter. Don't get confused.  Buy the Natural SunButter with the yellow cap.  Same company, different (and better) product altogether.
