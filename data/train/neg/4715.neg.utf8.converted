I ordered tulips for my wife because they are her favorite flower.<br /><br />Instead of the 30 Multicolored tulips I ordered she receives a dozen roses. REALLY dont you think if I wanted to order a dozen roses I would have done that.<br /><br />Whats next AMAZON and Pro Flowers?!?!? Maybe you will substitute a flaming bag of dog excrement for my next order.<br /><br />So far today 2 of my three orders from you have been nothing like what I ordered. If I wanted a surprise package or a mystery gift I would have ordered that.<br /><br />I am disgusted with this shopping experience.<br /><br />EPIC FAIL!!!
