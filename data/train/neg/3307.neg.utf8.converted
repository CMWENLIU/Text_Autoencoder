I bought this and a few other Annie Chun products on the recomendation of a Trader Joe's worker.  Annie's signature Soba noodles can be cooked to either an unappealing glue or still hard inside.  The sauce has an unpleasent odor, my fiancee would not even try it.  I went ahead and tried it but couldn't finish it.  I think I'm being generous with 2 Stars, seeing as how my dogs wouldn't eat it either.
