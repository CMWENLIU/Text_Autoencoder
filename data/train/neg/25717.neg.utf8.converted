This product used to be a five-star for me. I was thrilled to find that I could order it through Amazon in quantity, at a great price. This most recent shipment was my third - and I noticed that the can was different. But nothing on the can indicated that the product had changed, so I thought it was only a cosmetic makeover. WRONG.<br /><br />Many people have noted in their reviews that they like this product because it is not as sweet as the other flavored coffees; well, now it is, AND there's less coffee flavor.<br /><br />I looked up the company's website and e-mailed customer support. They confirmed that they have "reformulated" Cafe Francais, and said would take my comments into consideration. I urge everyone who is unhappy with the "reformulation" to go to [...] and ask General Foods to PUT IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS. If enough people complain, they WILL listen!<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'm scouring all my local grocery stores for the "old" cans of coffee...
