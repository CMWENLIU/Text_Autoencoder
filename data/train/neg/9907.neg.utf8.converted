I have read all reviews and found them suspiciously favorable with just a few very real ones!<br /><br />Mighty Leaf has good teas, no doubt.<br />However; not all of their teas are good.  I'll say around half not as good as they claim to be.<br /><br />Too much artificial flavor in Mighty Leaf Green Tea! You can buy Celestial Seasonings Teas three time cheaper with the same result.<br /><br />Wasted money.
