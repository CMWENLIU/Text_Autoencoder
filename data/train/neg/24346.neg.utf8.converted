I ordered a 2 pound bag of CACAO NIBS and what I THOUGHT was a 2 pound bag of CACAO BEANS, but I was not paying attention when I ordered this product.  THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY 2 POUND BAG OF CACAO BEANS, but instead, to my surprise, got two 2-pound bags of CACAO NIBS!!!!  I suppose it's my fault for NOT READING THE CAPTION BELOW THE PIC, but I was in a hurry that day.<br /><br />The nibs are a great product, but I do NOT NEED 4 pounds of it!  I WISH I HAD GOTTEN WHAT WAS BEING ADVERTISED IN THE PICTURE, INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS BEING ADVERTISING VERBALLY.  LOL
