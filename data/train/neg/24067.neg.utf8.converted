I love teavana products, when I ordered this sampler set I was excited. It arrived with NONE of the tea, I contacted customer service, They took their time sending me the teas I had already paid for, and four completely different flavors of teas arrived, the flavors look gross "strawberry lemonade" and other fruity flavors, but NONE of the teas they claim are included are here.This Not what I ordered, customer service leaves something to be desired, in my opinion they should have put a rush order on the teas they forgot to send me. Now I have tea I paid for and don't want. Very disappointed.
