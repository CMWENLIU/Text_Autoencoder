I have heard of Walden Farms products for a while now but hadn't had an opportunity to try anything until recently.  If I had to judge Walden Farms based on this one product, I would have to say they deserve to be closed down...this peanut spread was the weirdest, grossest thing I have ever had the misfortune to attempt to eat!  I'm an adventurous eater and this now tops my list of top five worst things I've ever eaten...the smell is similar to peanut butter, with plastic thrown in.  The texture is a cross between pudding and shaving cream and is slightly rubbery in appearance.  The taste...well, I can't come up with an accurate description of the taste, but I will say there was NO peanut flavor and the after-taste of splenda/sugar substitute is unpleasant and lingers for hours (or until you brush your teeth until your gums hurt).  The rubbery appearance translates into a rubbery texture (and I swear it tasted rubbery too) that melts into bread once you spread it...it soaked into my bread and turned my bread to rubber...no amount of jelly made it work.  I made two sandwiches with it and will not harm the bread with it again!  This product has to be the worst ever made...AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS AND CONSIDER YOURSELF SMARTER THAN ME!!!
