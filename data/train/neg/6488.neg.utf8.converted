Tasted great, but WARNING!!  I managed to eat an entire bag (about 15 pieces) over an hours time....within the next hour I found that I had MAJOR digestive issues...Gas pains, cramps and the need to be close to the rest room. It took about 36 hours before I felt normal...Now the thought of eating a SF Twizzlers or even regular Twizzlers makes me queezy!!!
