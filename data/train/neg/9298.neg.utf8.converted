These k-Caps are garbage. I tried everything to not get them to leak and have had no luck. I tried grinding the coffee less, I tried putting less coffee in the cup. No matter what they still leak. I even took a uses kcup, removed the foil, and put the k-cap on it. Big surprise, it leaked!!<br /><br />The issue is that there is such a large hole in the top. The Keurig brews at a high pressure and water leaks from the top. I have not had water leak from the sides of the cup like other people, just the top. I end up getting clear water in my coffee cup.<br /><br />I am going to try a product that seals the top better.
