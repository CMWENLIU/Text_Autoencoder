I cannot belive this product is still being sold at Amazon, Costco etc.  The FDA has put out numerous warnings about chicken jerky treats from China.  Go to their website to see.  I would not feed this product to any animal. PERIOD.  Yes dogs like them, but is it worth the risk?  There are jerky treats made in the U.S.A. or better yet, you can make them yourself.  Either in the oven or in a dehydrator.  I use the oven method, cut chicken breast into strips, hang from metal scewers and bake at 200 for 4 hours and you have dried chicken jerky.  Easy, less expensive and good for your pet.
