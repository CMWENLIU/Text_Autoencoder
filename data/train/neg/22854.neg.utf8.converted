Some bags contain moldy sausages and they all have a label showing LOT 0273. I still have the bags with moldy sausages in my refrigerator.<br />I opened the bag and feed the treat to my pet without realizing some of the sausage are moldy. Until I take a closer look at it when my pet refused the treat, then I realized the problem. The bags was not opened some time ago and the sausage used in a later day.<br />I called up Amazon and they replaced the shipment with no delay and apologized.<br />I also called up the phone number shown on the plastic bag but have not yet heard from the manufacturer.<br />I believe this is as serious as the pet feed that killed some of the pets last years that was contaminated and manufactured in China.
