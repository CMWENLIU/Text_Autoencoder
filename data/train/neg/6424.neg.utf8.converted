As many of the other reviewers have pointed out the new recipe is terrible! I love chocolate, but have always been picky on what actually deserves to be called chocolate. This new 70% bar should not be considered chocolate and Lindt should be embarrassed for selling it with their name attached. I bought three bars of the original before the stock was replaced with the dreaded new recipe. Too bad chocolate doesn't keep well, I would have bought a box! If you like dark, coco tasting chocolate and are not fond of greasy tasteless bars that call themselves chocolate...don't waste your money on the new recipe. I hope Lindt gets the message and brings back the ORIGINAL recipe!
