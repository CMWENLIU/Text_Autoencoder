I assumed for the price I would get as much mix as I would from carb quik or some of the other low carb baking mixes I have purchased.  What you're actually getting is a whopping 2 cups of mix (notice how they say "2 packs" in the description and then label the amount by weight). The 10 servers is horse manure - they increase the serving count to lower the per serving carbs and mislead as to how much you actually get out of it. I got about 8 medium sized pancakes out of this.<br /><br />It's also a dryer, slightly more bitter mix than either the atkins or carbquik mixes.<br /><br />I haven't been this disappointed in a purchase in quite a long time.
