So disappointed I had expected a better quality/natural product.  Unfortunately there wasn't an ingredients list and I bought with high hopes.<br /><br />Sadly this product is just not good quality.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the jar:<br /><br />Rose petals, sugar, corn syrup, citric acid, color: carmine, artificially flavored, potassium sorbate (to maintain freshness).
