I am a flavored coffee person. When my wife and I go to Dunkin Donuts, she always mocks me for ordering sweet, sugary coffee (I think it's better if I can have a sugar rush and a caffeine rush at the same time!). When I bought my wife a Keurig (probably because I was tired of hearing her shtick every time we went out for coffee), I set out to try the different flavors, to see what sort of deliciousness was awaiting me.<br /><br />We made it through this batch of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033HPPIO">Donut House Collection Coffee, Chocolate Glazed Donut, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, but barely. We came close to throwing out all of our unused K-Cups several times, because the taste of these pods is that bad. It was like drinking a big cup of chemicals. Chemicals that barely tasted like chocolate. Look elsewhere for your flavored K-Cups.
