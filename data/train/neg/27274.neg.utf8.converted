This repellent needs a hard rain to soak into the ground, not just a sprinkler.  The first couple applications I put down just seemed to freak the moles out, causing them to run into the good yard.  i bought two more bags to make a thick barrier between my good yard and the mole infested areas, but now I have fresh new mole trails deep into the good part of the yard.<br /><br />The directions should say to wait until it rains.  I don't think the sprinkler for 20-30 minutes does the job.  I guess I will just have to use grub killer in the spring and hope my grass fills in over winter.<br /><br />F.
