There were just of few grape, blue & green, there were a TON of red, my least favorite.  The packaging is cheesy, the sucker is smaller and several were broken.  I remember Charms being packaged in nice cellophone and the sucker was thicker and larger.  My favorite was grape, although it was sweet, there was a tartness to it.  I'm not sure if my memory enhances what was my favorite candy or this sucker is really is not the same.  Either way, it was disappointing to me!
