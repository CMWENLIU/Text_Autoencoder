I was first disappointed to read the ingredient list and find chemical names that I don't even recognize.  It wasn't horrible, but I'd rather have a more pure product.<br /><br />I popped a handful in my mouth and at first thought the flavor was good, but very quickly came a bitter or stale after-taste.<br /><br />Definitely not something I'd recommend.  We'll be tossing these out for the birds and the squirrels.
