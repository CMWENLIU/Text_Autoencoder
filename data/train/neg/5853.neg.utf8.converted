Mark Twain once said, "The difference between the almost right word & the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."<br /><br />This quote came to mind when I first tasted Newton's Fruit Thins, which are trying to ride the name recognition of Fig Newtons.  Don't be fooled.  The difference between Nabisco's Newton Fruit Thins and the hallowed Fig Newton itself is of lightning bug/ lightning proportions.  The Fig and Honey Newton Fruit Thin is not only thin, but pale by comparison, especially if you like the taste of moist figs such as the old-school Fig Newton provides.  THIS cookie is as dry as an animal cracker, if somewhat sweeter.  It is advertised as containing raisins (which I like) and figs (which I also enjoy), but they amount to mere flecks in the cracker -- too little fruit to impact taste and just enough fruit to get caught between your teeth (they were a bit hard and dry).<br /><br />Nabisco tries mightily, trumpeting the lack of high fructose corn syrup (this product uses old-fashioned sugar instead) and the fact that it provides 8 grams of whole grain per three cookies (for those taking notes, that's 2 g. dietary fiber and 140 calories with 5g of it from fat).  Trumpet away.  When I eat a cookie, I'm being willfully bad; and if I'm being willfully bad, I want to REALLY enjoy the taste of my cookie, calories be damned.  Using that as a barometer, this cookie scores a 2-star rating at best.
