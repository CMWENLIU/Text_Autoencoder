Mauna Loa used to be the only Macadamias I really liked--always nice and light colored, just the right texture and wonderful flavor.<br />NO MORE!  For the past year or so, they have changed markedly.  Now every can or bag full has darker colored, harder textured, less flavorful nuts.  A big disappointment for 2009-10.  What happened??  New management?  Global warming?<br />I'll be happy to change this review whenever Mauna Loa can give me the Macadamias I loved for 30 years!
