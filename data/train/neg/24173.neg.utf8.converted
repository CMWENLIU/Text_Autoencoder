I admit that I didn't read the directions before I needed to use it.  This is not a quick soup to prepare and you do have to add a lot of other ingredients. This also seems to be a soup with black beans in it and not a black bean soup.  I was not happy with it but my expectations were for an easy meal to prepare. My family thought it was tasty but agreed that there were not enough black beans.  Perhaps next time I will replace the beans in the mix with 2 cans of black beans.
