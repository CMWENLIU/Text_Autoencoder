Three people in my household, two of them chocolate junkies, all three of us unimpressed and no one over a period of days wanted more than a couple, and these are tiny cookies. Comments include: "Blah," "bland," "Too much chocolate, not enough peanut butter," "You know I like a good cookie, but I don't want any more of those." My husband who maintains he literally needs sweets every night, and has eaten some pretty dubious desserts out of the belief that if it's sweet then it's better than nothing, has stated he won't eat these. I just put them in a big baggie and told him to take them to work and let his co-workers finish them.<br /><br />I tasted them a couple days ago and felt I needed to try them again a little while before reviewing and there was no real pleasure to it. They were neither revolting nor delicious. I can't call them three stars because that would indicate okay, and since no one in my household wants to eat them and we all spent time trying to pin down why no one likes them, I think three would be too high. Three, to me, would be: "I'm not crazy about these, but I'll eat them, just not gobble them down," but the reaction is more a universal, "I won't eat those." Therefore, I have to call them 2 stars, maybe 2 1/4.
