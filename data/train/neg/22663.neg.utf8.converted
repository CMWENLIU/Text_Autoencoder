I was very disappointed in this.  The noodles had the flavor of cardboard..absolutely no "miso" soup taste at all and I love miso soup.  It did have lots of chunks and good things so it looked appealing but no taste.  I even checked the date for freshness but that was fine.  Unfortunately I don't recommend this one.
