These are great in many ways. They are gluten free, egg free, and refined sugar free. They use sweeteners with a low GI. I usually make my own GF cookies, but we were travelling and wanted some snacks. The cookies are dry, with an effort to be soft and chewy, and lacking in flavor. I'd really expect more from a box of cookies that cost us $5.75 for 12 little cookies. I generally love the Mary's Gone Crackers products (namely their crackers) and think perhaps they should stick to crackers and not venture into cookie land. I did try them with a little Coconut Bliss ice cream and it was a little more tolerable, but still weird in the texture department. For some yummy gf cookies that can easily be made while travelling I'd suggest the vegan chocolate chip cookies from Elana's pantry. My 3-year-old daughter, who hasn't had much experience with cookies, thinks they're quite fine. Really, they're not *bad,* they're just not too exciting.
