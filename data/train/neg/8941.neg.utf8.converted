Great price here on Amazon.  I bought a box of this stuff at Whole Foods and I gotta say this stuff is the hardest form of wheat grass to drink.  Very, very, very gritty.  It does not dissolve well into whatever form of liquid out there.  They suggest you use in a smoothie, . . granted I never have tried that quite yet.  I drink with 8 oz of water and a packet of emergen c lemon lime flavor.  I really hope drinking this is as good for me as I think it is.  When mixed it looks like sewer water, . . .and although I've never drank sewer water, . . .I wouldn't be surprised if this is what it tastes like.  I guess it sure beats having to juice my own.
