I've purchased this water for a year now for the high alkaline content and the great taste.  Recently, I've been getting shipments that are NOT the New Zealand spring water but rather distilled water from Walnut Creek, California.  The taste difference IS night and day.  You can only tell the difference between the original New Zealand Spring water and the distilled water from Walnut Creek by looking at the label.  Therefore, I won't be buying any more Eternal Water on the internet; you must actually see the label to know you're getting what you paid for. This is dishonest on Eternal's part -- I hope they literally clean up their act.
