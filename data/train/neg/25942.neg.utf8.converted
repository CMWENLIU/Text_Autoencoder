I ordered this tuna from Amazon about one year ago for the first time and I fell in love with it!! Sure, it was a considerably more expensive than the average supermarket brand tuna, but oh my god the flavor was unmatched! Unfortunately it seems that things have changed. Beware customers, Amazon is lying to you, this is NOT ITALIAN TUNA ANYMORE. The label clearly says product of Thailand. And yes, you can definitely taste the difference. Sadly this is not the top quality tuna it was before. The olive oil too seems to be watered down a bit. Shame on Amazon for telling lies and shame on the company for taking away what was the best tuna on the market.
