Very disappointed is an understatement. I purchased this as a Christmas gift but under the circumstances doubt it will be given unless I can repackage it more attractively. Imagine the shock when the shipping box was opened to find not the expected gift pack pictured as the product but the individual cups thrown in haphazardly on top of a small cardboard tube containing the print. Only to be superceded by the awe that I was stupid enough to buy this in the first place. I certainly will not be buying from Crazy Cups again.
