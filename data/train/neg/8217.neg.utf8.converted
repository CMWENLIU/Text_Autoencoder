As others have mentioned, the texture of these noodles is something unlike anything I have ever put in my mouth. Also, others have mentioned that the horrifying smell can be washed away but that was not so for me. Once I caught a whiff of these fishy noodles, it was as if it was emblazoned into my olfactory senses. It was as if nothing could erase that odor, and it came back to me as I tried to choke these down, following a variety of recommendations I had seen here. I had ordered a large quantity of these noodles thinking it sounded wonderful and lived to regret it. I felt terrible about throwing the remaining packages out but what was I to do? I felt that if I donated it to a local food bank, there would be many needy people out there scarred by the horrible memory of those noodles. So in the trash they went.
