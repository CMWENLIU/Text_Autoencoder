There was something wrong with the bag I got, the beans were visibly the wrong color for green decaf beans, and when roasted there was a bitter chemical smell and taste that wasn't even like coffee, much less drinkable.  I'll have to throw the whole bag away.  Probably it is just a bad batch or bag?  Food isn't returnable via Amazon, but they did refund me.  I've ordered green beans from Coffee Bean Direct before with no problem (both the regular-process Guatemalan and the CO2-process Columbian were fine), and I assume that the whole crop from Sumatra isn't spoiled, so maybe it was just a sacks worth of bags... ymmv but beware of this...
