Note: Lawry's contains sugar, soy lecithin (an additive), tricalcium phosphate (an additive to prevents caking) and a large amount of sodium. I prefer to purchase a salt seasoning such as Stephanie's Salt Seasonings which is all natural, no fillers, additives, no MSG and is available with a salt substitute. And best all of it has 4 varieties of salt- sea salt, kosher, lite and salt substitute. What else could you ask for?
