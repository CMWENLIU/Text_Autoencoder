These peanuts are OK.  They are obviously far better than most "store-bought" brands (such as Planter's).  However, they are nowhere NEAR as tasty as the peanuts I've ordered from Amazon which are produced by the Peanut Shop of Williamsburg.  Plus, the "blisters" in the Virginia Diner brand seem to be mostly broken in half (i.e., not intact), and they are actually somewhat hard to bite into.  For a few extra dollars, the additional investment in the Willamsburg variety is well worth it.
