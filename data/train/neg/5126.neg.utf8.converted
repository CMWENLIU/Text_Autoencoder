I recieved these as a gift from a friend who knows I love rice and grains. I've been cooking grains 'forever'. I buy 20 lb. bags of Carolina or Riceland rice for less than $00.60 lb. They are better tasting than these 'select rices' and I fill them into my own canisters.At about $4.50 per 2 lb. jar -how good do you expect this to be?  Yes,the jars are cute, but I recycle similar jars from other foods that might otherwise be tossed in the garbage! Save your money, it's not worth it.
