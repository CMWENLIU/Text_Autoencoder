I have tried this flavor every way possible.  Cream, cream w/sugar, black w/sugar, black, small, medium, large, made with the B40 machine at work, made with the B70 machine at my house...  Every way tasted bad.  I like a lot of different flavored coffees and flavored k-cups, I don't know why this tastes so bad.
