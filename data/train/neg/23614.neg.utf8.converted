I'm originally from New Orleans, where just about everyone drinks coffee with chicory, and I've been drinking CDM coffee pretty much all my life.  I like CDM coffee so much that for years I've had it shipped up to New England by the case from various suppliers in Louisiana.  Then I saw this listing on Amazon, and the price looked really great compared to what I've paid in the past.  So I ordered it without paying much attention to the "AD" in the title - which it turns out stands for "Automatic Drip" - which it turns out is vastly different from the "Regular Grind" that I've been drinking for years.<br /><br />This CDM-AD might as well be Maxwell House (no offense intended to the gazillions of people who probably think Maxwell House is good coffee), and it doesn't begin to match the deep, rich taste of the CDM-RG coffee that I'm used to.  I don't know where the CDM-AD went wrong - maybe it's a different type of coffee, maybe it's got a lot less chicory in it, maybe grinding coffee specifically for Mister Coffee somehow makes it taste like warmed up dishwater.  Who knows.  All I do know is that, after making just two pots from a 4-bag shipment, I can't drink another single cup of the stuff.<br /><br />I've got no one but myself to blame for not shipping this pathetic excuse for CDM coffee back to Amazon before the 30-day return period expired, but at least I've cancelled the automatic subscription.  I'll take the remaining 3+ bags to the office, where people mostly don't seem to care what they drink as "coffee" as long as it's got caffeine in it.  And I guess I'll go back to ordering "real" CDM-RG from someplace in Louisiana like before.<br /><br />All in all, this was a huge, HUGE disappointment.
