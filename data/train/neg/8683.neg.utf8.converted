I just received my order of Manhattan Special Sugarfree Espresso Soda from Amazon. I noticed before I opened it that the box felt wet. Upon opening it, there are THREE open/empty bottles inside the package. Not one, not two, but THREE. This was going to be a gift and obviously that idea is completely ruined. Additionally, I am unable to return the item per Amazon's policy. Now the item is not even listed anymore (that's why I'm posting the review to the decaf version of the soda even though I purchased the caffeinated version).<br />Buyer Beware! I will NEVER purchase anything in a bottle from Amazon again!!
