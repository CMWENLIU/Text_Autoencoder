I bought this because the title made me think it might taste a little like a chocolate glazed donut. Not even close! Actually, as a cup of coffee, it's not bad. Not too strong, and not at all acidic. Very smooth, and fairly mild. A pretty darn good cup o' joe. But donut? No. Glazed? No. Chocolate? No. Not. Even. Close. The name does not say "cappuccino", but you might think along those lines if you image a cup of coffee flavored like a chocolate glazed donut. But this blend has no cream, no sugar, no chocolate, no glaze, no donut, and as far I can tell, no flavoring what-so-fricking-ever, except... well... coffee.
