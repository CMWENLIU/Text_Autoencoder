I bought the scoop and bags mostly for the bags being earth friendly.  The bags are too small, sure they fit the scoop, but my cat pees all in one corner so the clump can get huge.  Therefore won't fit in this narrow bag just wide enough for the scoop itself.<br />  The scoop itself is ok, but I still have my old scoop and I prefer it because the litter flows throw my old scoop better than this one.<br />  Bottom line: if you have a cat that makes just small to mediuim sized clumps, then this product might be ok.  I personally find no value in having the bags inside the hande of the scoop.  In fact I think the feel of the scoop is cumbresone.
