I LOVE the product but hate the price! I have been purchasing Bonne Maman Preserves for years from our local grocery store. I was looking to purchase the blueberry in large qty so I figured I might get a better deal online, however sadly disappointed.  Our local store sells one 13oz jar for $3.99.  That is about half the price amazon is selling it for!  I am headed to the store!
