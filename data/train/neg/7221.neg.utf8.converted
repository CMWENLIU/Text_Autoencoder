Clearly this is a subjective matter since I'm in disagreement with previous reviewers.  But while I have at least enjoyed, even loved other coffee varieties in the Tassimo machine, I hated the Gevalia Morning Roast so much I threw the rest away after making several attempts to tolerate it.  It was terribly weak, almost chemical-tasting; it tastes like what comes out of a traditional drip coffee maker if you forget to replace the used grounds with fresh ones.  (For the record, my favorites are the Starbucks House Blend and Colombian; Seattle's Best Henry's Blend is milder, less flavorful than those but still a decent cup of coffee, and cheaper than the Starbucks; Starbucks Verona is too strong for my taste.)
