They were indeed tasty, but I guess I just don't understand the appeal. A small amount of liquid encased in wax. It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason.
