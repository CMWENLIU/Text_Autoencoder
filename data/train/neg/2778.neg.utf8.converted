Yuck! Did not taste like real truffles at all! They were dense, heavy, tasteless pieces of chocolate. My first indication that these were less than edible should have been that the main ingredient in these "truffles" is vegetable oil, not chocolate! If you are looking for good, inexpensive truffles skip these and go get yourself Trader Joe's French Truffles or even Russell Stover. This product is clearly made for the quantity over quality loving crowd.
