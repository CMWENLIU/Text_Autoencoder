This isn't a bash on Nutiva's product specifically but more of a warning to the greater community.  I found out the hard way that all Protein Powders basically contain Aspartame and MSG.  This is because the Aspartate and Glutamate in the products are in free form and are rapidly absorbed by the body.  If you have any allergies or issues with neurotoxins buyer beware.
