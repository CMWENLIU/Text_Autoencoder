Product was advertised as Porcini Powder.  The product that we received was labelled 'Dried Mushroom Powder.' It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly, tasted/smelled like "watered down" porcini, not 100% porcini.  Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again.
