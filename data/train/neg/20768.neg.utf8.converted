Don't waste your money! Did nothing to repell my racoon problem. They continued to tear up my lawn and garden. You can make your own mixture. Go to your local store where everything sells for less than one dollar. Buy red chile powder and some crushed hot red chilies. Mix and sprinkle where you have the problem. Sprinkle some every week at first then you can tapper off. It works 100% The racoons have NOT returned to tear up my yard! There were also some stray cats in the area....not anymore. I live in the hills and occassionally would see coyotes as well. Have not seen coyotes in a while since I have been using the red chile powder mixture. Not certain if that is a coincidence...but I am certain it got rid of the racoon problem.
