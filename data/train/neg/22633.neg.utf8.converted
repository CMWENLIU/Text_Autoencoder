Be careful what supplier you select because returns aren't allowed. I had ordered this chocolate several times via Amazon. From Amazon directly, the G&B bars (made in Canada) arrived promptly. Then in late 2009 my first (and last) order, fulfilled Nutricity, arrived a month after the order had been placed, and then only after an inquiry to the seller. The bars were dry, stale and hard, the color of cocoa powder rather than chocolate bars. Although the bars still had 10 months to go before expiration of the sell-by date on the wrappers, they were a disgrace to the good name of G&B. It may be that they had been stored improperly, or that the single paper wrapper used in the Italian plant (the Canadian maker uses an inner foil wrap) allowed too much air to get to the bars. I ground them for hot chocolate, but they were unsuitable for eating directly and very similar in quality to the bars one sometimes finds at mass-market outlets that resell overstock from other retailers. Two years later I tried again, but had the same experience. The order was fulfilled by a different Amazon supplier, not Amazon itself. Again, the bars were stale and appeared to have been improperly stored (although they did arrive promptly.) In the future I will use a supplier with which Kraft (owner of Cadbury, owner of G&B) seems to have better quality control --- my local grocer.
