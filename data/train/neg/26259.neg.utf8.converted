I mainly purchased this product because of its gluten-free qualities. I'm not an expert on Gnocchi, so I may not be giving it a fair shake. However, the consistency was mushy and a little grainy. I felt as though mashed potatoes would have been a far preferable choice for my dinner's gluten-free side dish.<br /><br />Also, beware that the product ships frozen and was half-thawed by the time it arrived at my house. This may have affected the quality of the final product.
