I've been watching a lot of British TV on Netflix lately.  Show after show mentions Marmite lovingly.  I had to know what all the talk was about.  It's possible that the talk is because the British all joke about how bad it tastes.  They put this stuff on their toast so, I was expecting jelly or "marm"alade.  Hokey smokes some cultural sensibilities are different!  We like you, Britain; glad the Queen has 60 years under her belt and everything.  We're glad Marmite is working out well for you but, Americans apparently left for a reason.
