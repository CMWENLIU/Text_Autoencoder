This good product is sold rancid ,I was asking for a refund,and amazon.com did not answer my email. It Is an outstanding product ,but when I opened the box the smell was strong ,I opened the whole lot, the six boxes ,hopping for have at least one good product.I used this product in the past,buying from  trader joe,or cost plus storesThey  do not have them in stock.The product should smell like fresh bread,light smell,and not rancid .
