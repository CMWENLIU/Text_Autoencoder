I ordered this product, as I had ordered the 3x32oz bags of the same product, which were excellent.  When the item was delivered I was surprised to find it was dyed red.  My first thought was I made a mistake and "oh well, eat up and enjoy", but the mistake wasn't mine.  I have eaten one bag so far, they do not have a great taste and the dye,...... the dye is unbelievable.  It stains metal bowls and Formica counter tops.  I have shelled them with plastic gloves, to have the gloves tear,they stain my hands my mouth.  I tried washing the dye off, to find I stained the sink and bowls and hand and counter.  I probably should have sent the remaining 5 bags back, but did not, thinking maybe in months to come the dye will be less of a problem, just don't know why a wonderful product was dyed.  I have and will order more of the natural 3x32 oz bags, but if a mistake is made again and I get red dyed I will return the order.
