Thank you Gerber, for helping us get our kids off to the right start!  Why should we parents take the time to prepare healthy snacks for our children and teach them to like REAL food, when you have Baby Cheetos in a can for them to enjoy?  One-third of America's children being overweight or obese simply isn't enough -- we need to strive for more.  America's kids need to learn to fill up on empty calories and eat for boredom, not hunger, starting at a year old or younger!  And thank goodness this product "tastes good" -- because that's all that matters, right?
