Dreamfields pasta is indistinguishable from the real thing.  I have made salads for potlucks with it and no one knew any differently.  However, due to the convoluted "digestible carbs" issue I would be extremely loath to recommend this to either low-carb dieters or diabetics, as there's a lot of evidence that it's not truly low-carb.  There are still studies being done on it, so caveat emptor!
