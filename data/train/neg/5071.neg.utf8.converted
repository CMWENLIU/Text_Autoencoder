This product comes up in a search for Keurig K-Cups by calling itself a "Pod". It is not a pod, not a K-cup, and there is nothing in the product description that clearly states what the product really is--a single serve coffee filter bag. I sincerely doubt that the deception is accidental. Bad form, Puck.
