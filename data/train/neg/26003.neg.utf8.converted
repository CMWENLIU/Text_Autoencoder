Honest Foods. Honest my Aunt Tilly. This item retails for $7.99 @ Costco, and you're selling it for $30.00. What are you sending in people to Costco to purchase and then hoard them so you can then bilk the public by $22.00 per selling unit. The public should know how you are ripping them off. This is a complete, and utter disgrace.
