I was about to order Xlear's 5-pound bag of Xylitol when I decided to check out where it comes from.  Like many people, I try hard to avoid any food products or ingredients from China.<br /><br />So I called the vendor of this product (the Vitamin Shoppe).  They said I would have to call the manufacturer to find out and gave me Xlear's phone number (801-224-0937).  That number wasn't too helpful because it didn't allow me to reach a live person, but after pursuing several extensions, I reached a live Xlear customer service rep at (877) 599-5327.  She immediately and firmly said that all Xlear Xylitol comes from China.  She added, "Most of the Xylitol you're going to find WILL be from China."<br /><br />As much as I love Xylitol, I'm determined not to buy any from China.  For the past year, I've been buying one-pound bags of "Emerald Forest" xylitol from my local grocery store.  The bags are marked "Made in the USA / U.S.-Grown Birch Trees."  So the news about Xlear's origins came as a surprise to me.<br /><br />However, the 1-pound local bags of Emerald Forest cost $10 each, so I was searching for a better price.  Guess I'll contact Emerald Forest to determine whether their larger sizes of Xylitol (the ones available on Amazon) are still from the U.S.  I'm willing to pay more to avoid consuming any food or supplements from China.<br /><br />And since erythritol is so similar to xylitol, this leaves me wondering where erythritol comes from....Has anyone checked that out?<br /><br />Decided to finish checking things out before posting this review.....So I just located emeraldforestsugar dot com, got the corporate phone number (866-948-1999) and immediately reached a live person.  She double-checked with a manager, then confirmed that even the largest sizes of Emerald Forest Xylitol sold on Amazon are indeed totally produced in the U.S.A. and that all Xylitol labeled "Emerald Forest" is strictly from U.S.-grown trees.  (And by the way, she mentioned that the mfr sells a 55-pound bag of U.S. xylitol, though I haven't had time to check out the price yet.)  This was all good news to me.<br /><br />While I was at it, I asked whether EF's erythritol is also made in the USA, and she said, "Yes, but we're out of it right now--there's currently a shortage."<br /><br />I also asked about their xylitol gum (since I regularly buy Trident w/xylitol) and was somewhat dismayed to learn that EF's xylitol gum is their only product that does contain some Chinese ingredients.  But in about one month they expect to start producing a gum that is totally from U.S. ingredients.<br /><br />I'm giving this Xlear product only 2 stars because although Xylitol itself has worked great for me, I think the origin of this food product should have been clearly listed!
