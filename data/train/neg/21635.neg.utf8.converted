I'm 54 years old and have never acquired a taste for most vegetables.  Some time ago I started having a "green drink" mixed with 100% fruit juice in the mornings.  It relieved my guilt for not eating vegetables and I had a noticeably higher level of energy.  I used one brand for over a year and wanted to try another brand.  I purchased "Amazing Grass Green Superfood". The taste isn't too bad, but the powder does not mix well with the juice.  When I get down to the bottom of my drink, it's mostly powder and tastes terrible!!<br />No refunds on groceries, so it's been an expensive lesson.
