This product is almost 30% sugar! (18 grams out of 63 grams in the single-serve box) That's a greater sugar content than in ice cream or pecan pie, and much more than in Frosted Mini-Wheats. It's over four teaspoons of sugar. This single small box has 240 calories. Be careful with fat-free or low-fat products---they are often high in sugar and calories.
