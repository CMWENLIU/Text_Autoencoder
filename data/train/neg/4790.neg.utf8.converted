This would have been OK or SO-SO if they had used regular pasta. I'm feel like the other reviewers that the broccoli was more of a dust than chunks. This also needs some meat like tuna or ground turkey. I would encourage shoppers to try the other velveeta skillets because they are really good. However this broccoli one was a total bomb.
