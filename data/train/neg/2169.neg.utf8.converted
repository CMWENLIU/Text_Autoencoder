I was excited to order this product since it is gluten free--however I opened the lid and the seal was broken--as if someone had tried it and returned it!<br />YUCK!<br />I threw it away instantly.<br />What a dissappointment since I had already started to cook.<br />What I learned from this:  always check things as soon as you get them--don't wait--because then you can't return it! ;-(
