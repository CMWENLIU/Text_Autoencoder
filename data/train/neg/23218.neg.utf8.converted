As someone who loves Indian/Bangladeshi food, I have been trying various JYOTI foods, given the good reviews here on amazon.<br /><br />Well, this is the third item I tried and I didn't even finish my serving. I found a rather offputting flavor in the stew/soup. Maybe it's the tamarind. Not sure. (And I say this as someone from the Caribbean who used to eat tamarind sno cones and as of last year had some homemade tamarind honeyed-juice my sister made--she has a tamarind tree. I'm not anti-tamarind.)<br /><br />Whatever it was, this was not like ANY lentils or lentil stew or lentil soup I've had in assorted Indian restaurants in the last 30 years. It tasted overly earthy and odd. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Dunno. But I wish I could be as enthusiastic and give a thumbs up like the others here. I do. But I can't. I really didn't love this.<br /><br />I'm gonna open another can later on and try again. But this has been the one major letdown for me from Jyoti. I almost made this one star, but since I give room to the fact that the problem may lie with a batch or with something askew in the can I opened, I'll leave it at two stars.<br /><br />Now, I'm afraid to try another Jyoti from amazon. I may head to my local Indian supermarket and see if they have the saag and try one can. After this experience, I won't pay for a whole case again. Bummer.
