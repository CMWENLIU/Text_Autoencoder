I bought this thinking it would be easier to have a two-in-one machine to make my baby's food.  The problem is that you can only make about four servings of food at a time.  I'm a working mom, so I need to make two weeks worth of food at a time and freeze it.  That means at least six batches in the Beaba, which would take hours.  In addition, the plastic is pretty thin, so I'm afraid to put the parts in the dishwasher.  This means HAND washing!  Add the descaling requirements, and this thing takes more time to clean than to cook with.<br /><br />The steamer also doesn't have any kind of 'off' signal, so if you have 'mommy brain' and walk away from it while it is steaming, it won't remind you when it is finished so you might come back long after the food has gone cold and then you have to throw it out.  The food processor blade is really inefficient so it takes a long time to get a consistent texture.  If you are processing anything starchy, that means it gets pretty glutinous by the time all the big chunks are out of the batch.<br /><br />For the price, you can get a full size steamer (that chimes when finished), and basic food processor or hand blender that will blend the food faster and more evenly.  And you can use those products for the whole family, not just the limited time the baby needs pureed food.  The Black & Decker steamer is very affordable and doesn't present the water scale problems that this machine has.
