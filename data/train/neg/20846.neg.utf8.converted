Due to the fact you cannot give a 0 star rating I had to give it a 1 star.  While it tastes like chicken, it in no way resembles chicken.  No chunks, basically it looks like they power washed the bones and that's the chicken you get.<br /><br />I've written to hormel about this as well and about to contact the government as "Premium Chunk Breast of Chicken" is NOT AT ALL what this product is.<br /><br />It is a waste of money and time.
