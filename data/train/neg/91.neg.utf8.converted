This is NOT A SUMMER SAMPLER<br /><br />The majority of this Sampler was hot, including: Hot Eggnog, Hot Apple Cider, Hot Gingerbread Coffee, Hot Caramel Apple, and Golden French Toast Coffee<br /><br />Sound like "the Perfect Brewed Over Ice K-Cup" to you?  This was the totality of iced drinks: Vanilla Iced Coffee, Peach Iced Tea, and unsweetened black iced tea.<br /><br />Additionally, there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description.<br /><br />I literally thought they might have mixed my Summer drinks for Holiday drinks, but it was clearly labeled Summer Sampler.<br /><br />Even worse, this item does not generally qualify for a refund.  Beware!
