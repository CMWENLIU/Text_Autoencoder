IN A NUTSHELL: FEW NATURAL FOODS COULD BE WORSE FOR YOU THAN LARD!<br /><br />WHAT IS WORSE?  --- Hydrogenated LARD, which is loaded with TRANS FATTY ACIDS - CHOLESTEROL - SATURATED FAT - AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS - HORMONES ETC. AND that's what this product is.<br /><br />SOME INTERESTING STUFF: WHERE IS THE LARD ON THEIR WEBSITE?<br /><br />Dial, the soap people, own Armour, and Armour makes this Hydrogenated, "All Natural" Lard. However, though Armour owns up to making many less than healthy edibles, on their website, there is NO mention of Lard as one of their many products.<br /><br />If you have to use Lard, this is a long established brand that resturants use, and though "hydrogenated", this is a good product as hydrogenated Lard goes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I wince when I leave a resturant, and while walking through their parking lot find myself staring at huge tubs of empty lard containers lying around the dumpsters. Funny, but I'd swear they weren't there before I ate.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is not just lard, but Hydrogenated Lard, which should be stricken from the human diet if at all possible. If that is not possible, Armour has been a reliable brand that has been making lard forever, though they don't want to admit it apparently [WONDER WHY?].<br /><br />It does, however, make me wonder what is in Dial soap?!<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]
