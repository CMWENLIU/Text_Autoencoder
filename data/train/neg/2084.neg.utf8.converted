The plant in the picture looks so much greener and healthier than what I received in the mail today.  The pot is a very inexpensive 'growers' pot, and does not add at all to the over-all look and appeal of this half-dead plant.  My plant contains two braided brown trunks with no foliage, and three yellowish stalks with yellowed leafs.  The 'braid' is held together at the top with a green bread twist-tie.  Over all, I wish I had spent a little more money and ordered a better plant from a different supplier, and I should have made sure the pot was nice enough to keep the plant in for some time while adding to the decor of my home.  With the ill-health of this plant, I am afraid to upgrade the planter/pot as I might further stress this suffering little thing.  Maybe this one should have been called the "waste of money tree'.  If you really want one of these, look elsewhere - this one is just not worth it.
