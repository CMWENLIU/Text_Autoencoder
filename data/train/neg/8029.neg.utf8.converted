Its the day before Easter.  My Dad has Celiac sprue disease..NO GLUTEN.  Imagine my shock when after I had ordered these to MAKE HIS pies....I see wheat listed.  Can you imagine if I Didn't double check the ingredients and just went ahead?  He would have been SO sick....and it would have been my fault.<br /><br />PULL THIS FROM GLUTEN FREE PRODUCTS!<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION...I MAKE MY OWN WHEAT LADEN GRAHAM CRACKER CRUSTS....not happy...not happy at all.
