The seller states in the product description that the quantity of Kefir grains will be enough to make one cup of milk. The amount I received was just over a teaspoon and the seller's directions which came with it said to put it in a quarter of a cup of milk. The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been "babying" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else. That being said, I have been able to make Kefir--albeit in doll portions---and the flavor is good.
