I do think this product is crazy overpriced for what it is and how much flavor you get. However, I was thirsty after Pilates and went to the Starbucks next to the studio and they had this, so, liking blackberries and having tasted the Pear Hint (which has a complex and interestingly subtle flavor), I got it.<br /><br />Not interesting. Not complex. Very much like you just added water to a glass in which you'd had some berry juice. But the flavor itself, while clearly a berry flavor, is not rereshing or interesting. It fell flat for me.<br /><br />I did like the idea that Hint gave me to make my own fruit essence water. A simple idea, but other than a squeeze of lime or lemon or other citrus at home, it had never occurred to me to just add a couple drops of fruit concentrate to my filtered water at home and chill.<br /><br />I'll do that now. I think it's crazy to pay a premium price for barely flavored water (unless you're away from home and dying of thirst and looking for something that's not sugary like juice or boring like plain water).<br /><br />Nice enough, but really, nothing special. Though I love their bottle /label designs. They do catch the eye and feel "clean".
