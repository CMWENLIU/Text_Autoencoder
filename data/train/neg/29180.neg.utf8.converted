while waiting for my order to arrive (now foods - better stevia) i picked up a box of "stevia in the raw" from my local supermarket, and boy what a mistake that was! it is without a doubt one the most disgusting sweeteners i have ever tasted and these people claim that it has no after taste...i got one word in response to that, LIARS!<br />avoid it at any price!!!
