The first wine gums I had ever tried were Gustaf's that I ordered here from Amazon. At first I thought they were a little hard, but I really started to like that about them. They last longer for one thing. Anyway, I decided I loved them and came to order more. I happened to notice that Maynard's had a much better rating, considering they cost quite a bit more and I thought I'd try them. Big mistake. For more than $30 with shipping I received three small bags of soft, sort of stretchable gummies that don't compare in any way to Gustaf's, (which came in three huge bags). Both companies make a grape-ish flavor that is pretty disgusting, but I could at least eat the Gustaf version. The Maynard's grape flavor tasted like poison. I would never order these again, but I'm going to order the Maynard's right about now.
