I love salmon. I love canned tuna. I love Chicken of the Sea tuna, in particular. I should love this, right? Wrong.<br /><br />Based on all these reviews, I really thought this might be something special. Well, it's not. The salmon is bland, barely pink and just not tasty. It's also shredded and packed in water, which makes is mushy. The salmon packet contains skin, plus contains small bone/cartilage fragments & pieces.<br /><br />This item might be suitable if you are camping or stranded on a desert island. But for me, I'd rather go hungry. And based on another recent review, there is a dog who won't eat it either. I certainly don't recommend for a household with children given bone & cartilage in the package!<br /><br />One star for contents. An additional star for convenience.
