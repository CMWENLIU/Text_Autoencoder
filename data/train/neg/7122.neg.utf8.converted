What a disappointment it was to try the new Nestletized "Malt Classic Ovaltine." Gone are the granules - instead, it's now a fine powder. The taste has changed too. It's not really awful - still drinkable, but it's definitely not in the same league as the original that I grew up on. In my estimation, they ruined an excellent product and disappointed a loyal customer base.
