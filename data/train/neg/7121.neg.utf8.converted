Ovaltine has updated their packaging and changed their formula.  The new formula is very similar to Nesquik.  It no longer dissolves in the milk and stays dissolved, but settles on the bottom of the glass.  This was the main reason I bought Ovaltine over Nesquik; it dissolved and stayed dissolved. The new formula is a real disappointment.
