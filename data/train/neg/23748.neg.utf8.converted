My German Shepherd dog (who DOESN'T wolf treats) ended up choking on a busy bone and lacerating her throat with a subsequent infection. A vet bill of over $400 dollars for a fun healthy dog treat. NOT WORTH IT. I contacted Purina to make sure no other dogs have to go through what we did, and I'm still waiting for the "sample collection package" to arrive for the other bone that was in the bag which I've saved along with the packaging. Don't buy it. I've also read of several cases of bloat caused by this dangerous treat.
