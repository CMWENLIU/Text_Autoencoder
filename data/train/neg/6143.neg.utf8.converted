I wanted to try this product, especially since the advertising said it was gluten free. Upon tracking down the manufacturers site and looking at the nutritional information for multiple products, I see that they are made with WHEATGRASS and BARLEY. I am sure they are a great product for those who do not have gluten issues! But I for one am glad i did some research before buying...
