I really wanted to like this product.  Even after all of my friends told me I didn't need a separate appliance to make babyfood (just use your food processor!), I went ahead and bought it.  I had read the reviews and I knew that it wouldn't cook a lot at a time, so I wasn't expecting to make mass quantities of babyfood, just to make it easier to give my daughter whatever veggies we might be eating that night.  Well I'm pretty dissapointed -- almost everything I've tried in isn't as cooked as it needs to be.  I find the machine to puree the food when it's half raw, resulting in a lumpy mess.  I've tried mixing the food with breastmilk and pureeing it further, and then it just tastes like raws veggies pureed with breast milk.  Gross.  I have also tried cooking the food for longer than the recommended times, but I guess the steam isn't strong enough, because it's never cooked enough.  I've tried sweet potatoes, green beans and carrots, all with disastrous results.  Lesson learned - next time I'm just going to cook the food in the oven or in a steamer and then throw it in the food processor.
