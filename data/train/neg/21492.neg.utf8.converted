I read the reviews and ordered five of these.  I had just moved the contents of a storage unit--furniture but very few clothes--into my home and started seeing the moths appear daily.  I did the research and determined that these were closet moths and not pantry moths (the culprit had been a wool rug that was in the storage unit).  I had the five traps overnighted for an extra $17.  I followed the directions and put them out.  Two days later the traps were as pristine as the day they arrived--not a moth anywhere inside.  Instead they were still fluttering through the air and lighting on the ceilings and walls.  I called an exterminator.  He came out and placed a couple of Russell XLURE - R.T.U. traps in the kitchen and den.  The first day there were five captured in one and three in the other.  As of today, they have been in place for 13 days and and there are at least 15 moths captured in each.  The Safer traps are still hanging and are still as clean as the day I put them up.  Either I got a faulty batch of Safer traps or the product is a ripoff.
