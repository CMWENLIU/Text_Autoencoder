Normally, I have no qualms about ordering from AMAZON ... but, not this time.  I specifically wanted Fancy Feast with the Liver flavored food; because, I'm unable to find it in my area. I also had ordered the brown box of food, which again, was the type that I am unable to buy in my area.  Instead, they sent me what they wanted me to have - WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! What they sent, I could have easily bought at Sam's for a much cheaper price and more cans in the box; i.e., 36 cans for $16.00 ... but, I wanted to try these new flavors for my 3 wonderful children who love their Fancy Feast ... I'll keep what I have but will NOT consider ordering cat food again from AMAZON ...
