I bought a whole case of coconut milks so that I could refrigerate it and then scoop out the cream and whip it so it would be like a vegan whipped cream. Well, when I scooped this one out, and tried to whip it I was extremely disappointed! It turned into a liquid and wouldn't whip up at all! And not only that, but there is no "USDA organic" label on the cans. It says "natural" but I'm really not convinced. I think that label most of the time is a gimmick anyway. I think I'm going to just get mine at Whole Foods next time. I know that kind was truly organic and it whipped.
