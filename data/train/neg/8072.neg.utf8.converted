TOTALLY NOT FOR ME. AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED SINCE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALL NATURAL. NOT NATURAL ENOUGH I GUESS FOR ME. IT IRRITATED THE SKIN AROUND MY EYES, EVEN WITH THE SMALLEST AMOUNT I WAS USING. PLUS I BROKE OUT IN LITTLE BUMPS AROUND MY EYES.ONCE I STOPPED USING IT, THE BUMPS DISAPPEARED. THANK GOODNESS. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THAT WAS A WASTE OF $$ FOR ME.
