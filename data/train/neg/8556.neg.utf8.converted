Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system, and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods. Normally I drink cold-brewed Toddy coffee, and even though I'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee, I can drink that with just dairy, no sugar. I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee--and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee. It was so bitter I almost couldn't drink it. It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt. And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time.<br /><br />The problem was, I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process (the Toddy's cold-brew method does result in a less bitter, less acidic, less caffeinated coffee than normal) or the coffee brand. So, I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods (2 to a pack, very inexpensive) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy. It tasted slightly weak, oddly; however, it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee. If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees, which I don't, I think you'll enjoy it. But if you have acid stomach problems or just don't like bitter coffee, I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo.
