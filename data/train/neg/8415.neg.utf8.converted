I tried this extract in several types of baked goods and was dissapointed every time. There seemed to be no flavor at all! I eventually used 4 tsp in a sugar cookie recipe and STILL could not discern any flavor hazelnut or otherwise! I tried it in a simple sugar and milk glaze thinking perhaps cooking had influenced the flavor. There was only the slightest vaguely bitter taste to the glaze. There was no flavor, pleasant or otherwise in anything I tried this product in.
