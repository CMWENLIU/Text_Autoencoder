I purchased this tea from Swanson vitamins along with another brand.. "Traditional Medicinals".<br /><br />I tried TM first.  I never add sugar, honey etc. in my teas i drink it according to my husband "John Wayne style"<br /><br /> The tea tasted ok. I didn't have to add an additional tea bag to taste the flavor.. it also smelled really good.<br /><br />Then i tried Yogi... there was absolutely no taste and I didn't smell the flavor like i did with TM.<br /><br />I added 2 tea bags in about 6 ounces of water and still nothing. It was just like drinking plain hot water with a brown tint.<br /><br />Now as far as what health benefits i have experienced from drinking either brand.. I think it's too early for me to tell.
