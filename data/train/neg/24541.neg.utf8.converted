I hate to go against the voting trend here but I have to be honest ~ I just don't like this product.<br /><br />I hate the dominating soapy aftertaste.  It is strong and unpleasant and stays with me for hours.<br /><br />Also, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4D5GC">Let's Do Organic Shredded, Unsweetened Coconut, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> as stated is very finely shredded ~ much too fine for my taste.  It makes for an extremely dry coconut.  Some may like that quality but I don't and I took to moistening it with coconut water or coconut milk.<br /><br />I purchased the pack of 12 from Amazon because it was such a value compared to buying it from the local health food store.  That's a lot of coconut not to like.  I ended up donating the rest of my case to a local food bank so at least it would not be wasted.
