first and foremost people i wanna let you know i tried all kinds of energy drinks Hardcore drinks like VPX Redline, pitbull,venom, amp, Red bull,etc..<br /><br />never had no problems at all with any of the above. But please bare with me what i am about too say. When i took Monster after consuming it on a more consistent basis my body would overreact i would get leg cramps, headaches, nausea, i have a hard time walking, i feel weird. its like you got leg cramps and your walking this stuff really messed me up. and its only MONSTER BRAND NOT OTHERS<br /><br />I HAVE COMPLAINT AND SOMEHOW THEY TRY TO SAY THEY AIN'T ''LIABLE'' WHEN MONSTER IS WHAT CAUSES THIS. i am guessing they put a little bit of too much of something other drinks don't put. YOU BEEN WARNED!!<br /><br />PENDING LAWSUIT
