Curiousity got the better of me at my local Wegman's so I bought a bottle.  I wanted to see if the beverage justified its mixed but also strongly negative reviews.  Well, I didn't die drinking it, but it didn't taste great either.  And for marketing purposes, as others point out, looking at black water just doesn't sit well with my mind and I couldn't get past it.<br /><br />It left me a slightly bitter aftertaste, and all in all, while I wouldn't say it's the most vile thing I've drank by any means, I would never buy another, and certainly at the prices they're asking.
