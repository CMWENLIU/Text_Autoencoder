I ordered this item which came in a flat rate USPS box.  I got an Identical box from another vendor.  My purchase from Online Candy Store was $29 with $35 shipping.  The identical flat rate box from another vendor was $9.80 shipping.  There is something seriously wrong with this kind of service.  NOT WORTH THE PRICE, DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM THIS SITE. If I had not given this as a gift, I would have returned it.
