I really like this product, however in doing the math, i can't figure out how this is a savings, in fact it's a rip off on this site! I can go to my local target (which i have been doing), and buy this exact product (32oz) for $5.99 a can, on here it's roughly $10.00 a can.................Again, where is the savings and why is so expensive on amazon?????
