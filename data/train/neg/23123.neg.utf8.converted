I bought a case of these to make some desserts.  I had no idea I would get so many in each 7 oz. package, or that they would be so big, or that they would be so crunchy.  Taste is fine.  Just know that if you're making a dessert and you expect the ladyfingers to suck up the sauce or sherry or liqueur, buy more sauce/sherry/liqueur than you planned!
