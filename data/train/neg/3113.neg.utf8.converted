It's fantastic that this gum contains Xylitol... but on the flip side, it contains Aspartame!!!! There's really no point in chewing a gum that's laced with a harmful chemical, just because it has a healthy component too! There are many brands of gum that contain only Xylitol without any other harmful ingredients. This gum is just an advertising gimmick to grab a market share of those folks who are health conscious, and may not realize how harmful Aspartame is. If you're purchasing this product in order to contribute to your overall health... then skip it! Aspartame is a powerful neurotoxin that everyone should avoid like the plague!!!
