I love loose leaf tea - the large leaves brew slowly, giving flavor but not bitterness. It has a subtle quality about it that sets is apart from the grounds found in tea bags. This tea does not have that quality. Rather than whole leaves, the tea is ground-up bits like in English breakfast tea. Even after brewing the leaves are tiny chunks. Rather than a long, slow brew, I found that this tea takes on a bitter edge after as little as two and a half minutes. I usually brew tea bags longer! If you keep the brewing short and use a lot of leaf to compensate it can be drinkable, but why bother when you can do better with a bag? I won't be buying this again.
