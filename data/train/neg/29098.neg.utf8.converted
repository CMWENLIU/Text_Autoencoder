I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was "yuck" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything.
