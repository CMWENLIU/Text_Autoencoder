Can't say it feels good to write this.<br /><br />We first ordered this product about 2 months ago and the first box of 20 bones lasted us that long because it was very densely packed rawhide. Each bone lasted approximately 2-2.5 hours of constant chewing. Needless to say we liked the product and reordered it. Unfortunately the the new box is completely different from the first!<br /><br />First of all, the bones in the second batch have a pinkish/brownish hue to them as if they're coated with something for flavor. Instead of a densely wrapped single layer of rawhide, the second batch has ball-shaped pieces of rawhide wrapped by a single layer of rawhide (imagine peas in a pea pod). The bones are very light in comparison to the previous batch and my dog literally goes through them in 15 minutes!! He threw up the "ball" parts one night and his stool became much softer since we gave him the new bones.<br /><br />I'm going to try and return the new box to Amazon and reorder to see if maybe there was a mixup. I'll update my review accordingly.<br /><br />--------<br />April 2011 update:<br />Well, Amazon was great and I was more than impressed with the service... they instantly shipped me a new box! The box we received had the same types of bones as we received in the second shipment which we weren't happy with. So unfortunately we'll have to find a different source for rawhide bones. By the way, since dogs are sensitive to changes in their diet, I decided to experiment and let our dog have these new bones and see if he'll get used to them with time. Several weeks have gone by and he still has softer stool when we give him the bones, he also has diarrhea because of them once in a while. When we don't give him the bones his stool is a better color and is nice and firm. Sorry, didn't mean to get too graphic, just trying to give as many details as I can.
