I love crunchy cheese goodies. I thought these White Cheddar Just the Cheese snacks would be a nice little treat but when I tried them, I thought I had bitten into a salt lick. I have never eaten cheese that was even half as salty as these little bits. They were toasty and crunchy but the salt overwhelms everything. I won't be reordering.
