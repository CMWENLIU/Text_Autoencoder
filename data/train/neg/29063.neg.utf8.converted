I bought these for the cake pops that I was making. I tried them on both chocolate coating and on candy coating. These just don't work very well period. I thought the ink was just dried up, but they write just fine on my hand and on paper. They only seem to work if you're using them at an angle almost parallel to whatever you're writing on (but that defeats the point of the fine tip!)...and even then, they barely show up at all. I'm going to try the Americolor pens...everyone seems to like those. Trust me, save your money and don't buy these!
