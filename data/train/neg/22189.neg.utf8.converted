If this were just a good tasting, better for you than the sugar and caffeine bombs little drink, it would be great.  The problem with it is the mystical IQ enhancing promise.  Basically, you drink it, it tastes good, it's crisp and not too sweet, but you don't suddenly get smarter or feel the need to do calculus for giggles.  It's a nice drink trapped in herbal hype, and hence a hyped price.  Fail.
