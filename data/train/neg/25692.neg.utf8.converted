I tried this in water, and it took a lot more than I expected to be able to get a strong taste. I am accustomed to Crystal Light and was a little surprised that this MIO took so many drops to get the strong taste I wanted. But the more I put in, the sweeter the water became; it seemed to get sweeter a lot faster than the mango taste amplified. I just couldn't drink it.<br /><br />Next I thought maybe it would brighten up my Diet Sprite; well it did make it pretty! But the MIO seemed to fight with the sweetener in the Diet Sprite in a way that created a funky chemical off-tasting residue in my mouth. So dumped that.<br /><br />One last attempt to redeem the MIO: iced tea! How can you mess that up? Easily! Add some MIO! The tea went from delicious, to tasting like someone had dropped perfume into it. I can't even begin to describe what happened when my tea and the MIO mixed; every sip not only smelled like my bath lotion, but it also faintly tasted like maybe the lotion had been dumped into my tea. Just an unpleasant, shudder-giving experience. Dumped that glass.<br /><br />No matter what I mixed the MIO into, it also left a slimy feeling in my mouth, kind of like snails had been living in there awhile.<br />Not a purchase or even a recommendation for me.
