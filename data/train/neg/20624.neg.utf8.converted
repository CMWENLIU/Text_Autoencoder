fail! had to stop eating them part way through the bowl. It has a funky taste probably due to the brown rice. After about 30 seconds in the milk they develop a very spongy texture not unlike eating wet packing peanuts.<br /><br />Before tossing the rest of the box I am going to see how they work in Rice Krispie treats.
