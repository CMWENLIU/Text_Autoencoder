I like special K cereal. I like the bars, too. But this flavor of their cereal is just gross. The flakes are alright on their own, but the pieces of chocolate are totally unedible. They are big waxy chunks, and you can barely taste any chocolate flavor in them. I don't know what they are made out of, but it's not real chocolate. They get stuck to your teeth and you just have a mouth full of brown waxy bits by the time you're done with a bowl of this cereal. I'm a huge cereal fan, and an even BIGGER chocolate fan, and you couldn't pay me to eat another bowl of this crap!
