This product is horrible. I tried it and tried it and tried it again. It just tastes so awful I couldn't stand it.. I tried everything too. Adding things like salt, sugar, skippy, chocolate syrup, and caramel syrup to it. And even ALL of those put together could not drown out the terrible chemical taste of this garbage. Yuck! Please don't waste your money like I did. I barely ever write reviews for products, but for this I MUST. People NEED to be warned of this inhumane, dispicable food. Please just stay away for the good of mankind!
