If you like Licorice, DON'T buy these.  If the manufacturer had spent another nickle on licorice extract this candy might be palatable.  The consistency is fine, like a soft gummy bear.  The flavor is severely lacking.  What flavor there is is almost acrid.  The manufacturer also missed the mark on the nutritional information.  Each package is 7 oz.  The per serving information is listed for a 42 gram serving with no indication as to how many pieces that is.  There is also caution about eating too much will cause you lower tract distress, but again, there is no indication as to how much is too much.  Since there were both positive and negative reviews I thought I'd take a chance.  I did and I lost.  Be forewarned and don't make the same mistake I did.
