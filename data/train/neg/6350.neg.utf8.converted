Ordered this product as a supplement to my concession operation.  On receipt, I put it on some popcorn I'd made for friends as a test run.  Of the six people who tried it (myself included), four thought the popcorn tasted oily and that it actually detracted from the taste of the popcorn.  The topping was put on in incremental amounts.  Of the six testers, no one thought it made the popcorn better.  Four thought it negatively affected the popcorn and the other two were neutral.  I will most likely not be purchasing this product in the future.
