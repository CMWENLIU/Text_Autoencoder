These matzo crackers were in poor shape when they arrived.  The dark chocolate had a white covering which generally means it got too hot or too cold.  I did try one of the crackers- stale, stale, stale.<br /><br />So, now I have three boxes (minus one cracker) of inedible crackers sitting on my counter because I can't bring myself to throw away $17.77 worth of my wasted money.<br /><br />They are not returnable per the website; I was going to try to return them but no luck.<br /><br />As for this review, it did get one star because the system won't take the message without at least one star.
