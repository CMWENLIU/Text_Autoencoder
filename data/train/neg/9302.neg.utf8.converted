A great idea but what a dripping, splashing mess! It's like the reusable Keurig filter and doesn't produce a steady stream into the cup. I had better luck with a square of heavy duty foil. Oh well, doesn't seem worth the effort of returning (30,000 probably thought the same thing) the two I bought so some one is getting a drippy stocking stuffer and I added 3 useless things to my kitchenware drawer.
