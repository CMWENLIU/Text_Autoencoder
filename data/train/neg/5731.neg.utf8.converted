The defective packages have holes or ripped areas in the bottom. This let air in and caused entire contents to solidify. Some of these opened packages had been re-sealed with scotch tape. The outer carton was in good shape, so the defects must have been at the source, rather than at Amazon. I will not permit any of the Cracker Jacks in the carton to be consumed because of the risk of contamination.<br /><br />Also, it appears Frito Lay, the people who produce Cracker Jacks, is using Amazon as a place to dump the products. The expiration date on the packages was November of 2008. Looks to me like Amazon got dumped on and I was left holding the bag.<br /><br />Cracker Jacks is apparently not a returnable item.
