Well, back to Mama noodles we go...<br /><br />I had high hopes when my friend I was visiting in Portland was using these for a quick long-day-at-work meal-between-meals. THEN I read the label.<br /><br />Hydrolyzed soy protein.<br /><br />Not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick-reached 10g a day "healthy moderation" level, but hydrolyzed soy (hydrolyzed "vegetable protein" almost always being soy, too) is full of MSG. It's not alone-- autolyzed yeast, corn-sourced maltodextrin (which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore), the list goes on, but in short they are all MSG... only unlike Europe, America does not require that special "enhancer" code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy (thanks, Monsanto).<br /><br />So that said, I did taste a bit of it, trusting his comment of no MSG (it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them)... and as I am sensitized to the weird not-salt flavor of it, I stopped and asked politely to see the package. Sure enough, glaring at me is MSG... For taste, I'd give it 3 stars overall--the MSG taste isn't super-strong, but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless, so I couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />For ethics, it's a miserly negative 10 stars...
