I have been a Necco wafer lover for most of my life-and still am-even at the age of 65!<br />But, I WILL NOT EAT THIS DISGUSTING STUFF!<br />They have ruined Necco wafers-I can't even tell what the flavors are! I quit buying them and will continue to do so until they bring back the right ones-the GOOD ones.
