I like the glass. It definitely is the glass for drinking Tequila. they truly let  the aromas and flavors of fine tequilas be discovered by the drinker.  The problem is that they are so very fragile.  I broke one while gently drying it. The stem separated cleanly from the rest of the glass. I broke another,  again while drying this time I was lucky that I didn't cut my hand with the broken glass. For the price I'm not sure if thy are worth all the trouble.
