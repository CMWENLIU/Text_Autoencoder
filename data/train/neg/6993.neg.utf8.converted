The description uses the word bulk, so I didn't even think about the 16 oz. size description. Do not be deceived into thinking you are getting a large quantity. This is the same size bag you can buy at your local drug store for $2-$3 less than you would pay here. Very disappointed at how they mis-portray this as being "bulk", this is just your everyday average bag of Tootsie Rolls.
