As my baby approaches the stage at which we can introduce solids to her diet, I started doing my research on organic, prepared baby foods.  I was all set to make Earth's Best my brand of choice, since we already use some of their other products (e.g., baby wipes).  But that was until I discovered that the covers of their glass jars contain bisphenol-A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor that can cause negative health effects, especially in vulnerable infants and young children.  Apparently, Earth's Best claims that its jarred baby food has been independently-tested, and found to have undetectable levels of BPA.  However, I'm still skeptical.  In a "perfect lab" setting with a pristine jar of baby food, the BPA may not have had the opportunity to leach from the cover into the baby food.  But in the real world, by the time that jar of baby food reaches the average consumer, it has been turned upside-down and shaken up in the process of packing, shipping, unpacking, shelving, etc.  Plus, many parents warm up their baby food in the jars; and I've heard that heating can increase/speed-up the BPA leaching process.  SCARY STUFF!!  I don't see why Earth's Best doesn't just play it safe and line their baby food jar covers with a resin that doesn't contain BPA.  It's honestly not that hard to do ... Just ask Eden Organics!  The linings of many of their canned vegetables are BPA-free.  Sure, it might increase the cost of the baby food by a bit, but I'm sure I speak for many parents when I say that I'd be willing to pay a little extra just for the peace of mind of knowing that there are no harmful chemicals in my baby's food.  After all, we're willing to spend a bit more for organic baby food to begin with.<br /><br />Earth's Best also makes baby food in BPA-free pouches.  But, to be honest, the company's refusal to acknowledge and correct the problem of BPA in its jar covers has left me with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended).  So I may just take my "baby-food-business" elsewhere.
