I was excited to have gum that didn't have artificial sweeteners that I bought two boxes of glee gum in peppermint and triple berry.  When it arrived, I tore open the box, and popped in 2 pieces.  Then the disappointment began only a few minutes later as the flavor quickly dissipated.  I took out a couple more pieces and then the flavor returned... only to be disappointed later when it went away. Your money is better spent sucking on lollipops or eating (what I have found) the only gum that doesn't have artificial sweeteners, dentine gum, cinnamon.. this is never-ending disappointment.. or never-ending calories as you try to keep up with the flavor.
