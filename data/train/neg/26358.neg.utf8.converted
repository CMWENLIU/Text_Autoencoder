I bought some fresh dried apricots from the farmers market, and thought these might be on par. Sadly they are not. They're kinda dry and don't have the same rich flavor as California apricots. Anyways it is summer again and I can eat fresh apricots again. Unfortunately, I have 3 bags left that I'm gonna have to force myself to eat.
