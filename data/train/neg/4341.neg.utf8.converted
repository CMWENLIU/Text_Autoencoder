I bought these on the strength of the reviews.  Inside the thin wrapper the texture was mushy, and I didn't like the taste at all.  It tastes mostly of beef heart, smoke and spices.  I found them inedible.  I had several of my friends try them since I didn't want to waste them if someone else could eat them.  The first two friends did not like them, but the third did, so they found a home.  The free sample of barbeque beef jerky was delicious, and I am going to order some of that.<br /><br />Addendum: Not long after I wrote the above review, I recieved a telephone call from the company.  He said that they stand behind all of their products, and even though I could not return the item since I had given them away, he would send me a replacement of any other jerky.  He sent me the barbeque jerky which I had sampled before. with two additional free samples of other flavors, which were also quite good.  I have never dealt with such a wonderful concern for their customers as I experienced with this company.  I think you can't go wrong buying from them.  He said if anyone doesnt like what they get, they will replace it.
