I thought I had found a perfect Christmas gift for an out of town sister who is allergic to chocolate.  I ordered and shipped a gift basket called "Something Sweet & Savory."  It contained no chocolate.  I was on vacation when the basket arrived and did not hear that my sister received a gift basket containing primarily chocolate until I returned home January 1. I contacted Wine.com immediately.  They replied that she should return the basket and they would ship another one.  My sister had tossed the packing box by that time and had no way to return the basket.  I again contacted Wine.com and they gave the same reply.  "Return the basket first."  She cannot use the contents or return the basket.  Stalemate.  Wine.com offered NO OTHER REMEDY.  And -- to add insult to injury -- my sister never did receive a package of Harry & David chocolate covered nuts.  I will never order from this retailer again.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DKA7HM">Wine.com Something Sweet & Savory Gift Basket</a>
