If you do a search for "arsenic baby formula" you will see the results of a study that showed that this formula contains high levels of arsenic.  Read the study, make your own decisions.  The study isn't talking about organic baby formula in general, it is specifically this brand, this formula.<br /><br />When I told my pediatrician we were giving our daughter organic formula, she made sure we were not using this brand.  Unfortunately, we bought this before reading the study.  We won't be using this formula.  Instead, we're going with Vermont Organics.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />A recent article in Consumer Reports shows that Baby's Only has made an effort to remove arsenic in their formula.  Look for a use-by date of January 2014 (Dairy with DHA & ARA), July 2015 (Dairy), or later.  In these newer formulas, arsenic is undetectable.<br /><br />I'm leaving it at 1 star because I have 3 cans of this that I can't return and that I'll never use.  I won't be buying the new formula because my daughter is already enjoying Vermont Organics and there's no point switching, so I don't know if the new stuff is any good.
