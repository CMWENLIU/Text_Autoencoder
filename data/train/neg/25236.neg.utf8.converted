I received my vanilla beans today. In anticipation of receiving my beans I got all my ice cream making equipment together and ready to go. Unfortunately what I received was extra crispy, dried out vanilla beans. The aroma is still there but they aren't fresh at all. The literally look and feel like someone deep fried them. I was wondering how these people could sell $6.00 vanilla beans, but I guess your better off paying the $15.00 for 2 beans at the store.
