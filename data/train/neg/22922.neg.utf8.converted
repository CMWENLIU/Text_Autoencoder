But this was honestly the worst frozen pizza I have ever had, let alone the worst expensive 'premium' frozen pizza. Both Home Run Inn and Vito & Nicks frozen pizzas honestly make this taste like Playdough, which the crust was actually pretty close to in terms of taste.<br /><br />The cheese was nice and stringy but completely devoid of taste, just a stringy blob covering the top of the pizza. The sauce was average at BEST. The crust had the weirdest, most lifeless consistency of any pizza I have ever eaten and could barely be classified as a crust.<br /><br />I can hardly EVER be bothered to write reviews (this was my first online review in probably 5 years) but it was so bad I feel like I had to warn others - STAY AWAY, DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR MONEY OR WASTE PRECIOUS CALORIES EATING THIS TRASH!
