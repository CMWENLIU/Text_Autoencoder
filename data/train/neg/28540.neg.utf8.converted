My son is 7mo and has has 4 teeth already.<br /><br />I thought these would help with teething but when I gave them to him, he put it in his mouth, bit off a huge chunk and then proceeded to gag on the huge chunk (it doesn't melt as fast as needed I guess).  I had to reach into his mouth and grab it.<br /><br />These aren't biscuits--they're more like airy wafers that take almost zero effort to break apart.<br /><br />Although it won't crumble into smaller pieces that your child could choke on, you still have to be worried about the possibility of having your child bite off a mouthfull size and then have it get stuck.
