I posted a pic at the top of this page... the actual bar looks NOTHING like the picture on the box.  It's a bizarre nub of a bar - I actually LAUGHED when I shook it out of the package, it was so ridiculously small.  As for the taste... it's chocolatey, not totally unpleasant...but DRY...like the Sahara desert dry...like there's not enough milk in the world to wash it down dry...like I'd tell you how dry it is but my mouth is too gummy and I may be trying to swallow it until 2099 so I can't talk.  If you have allergies and can't have gluten (like me) you'd be better off eating a piece of chalk and a spoonful of cocoa than this.  Skip it.
