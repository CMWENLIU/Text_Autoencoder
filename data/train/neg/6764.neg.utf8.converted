My order arrived promptly but unfortunately NECCO decided to change the recipe of a long time favorite and their new "original" wafer is not at all like the true "original".  The true original had great flavor and color, the new original is tasteless and faded pastel colors.  Necco should re-label their new recipe product to avoid confusion.
