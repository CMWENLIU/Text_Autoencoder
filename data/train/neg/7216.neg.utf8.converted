I paid an outrageous price ($1.49) for this product at a pet store.  It is made far too rigidly to work on the smallest size cans.  Once it is on the can, it is impossible for me to remove.  I enlisted my husband's help and even he has trouble getting it off.  I was given a FREE can cover at another pet store.  It is a softer plastic and works much better.  If you use the smallest size cans, forget about this one!
