I want to return my recent purchase of Olivado Avocado oil. The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them. "Natural Zing you ripped me off". I am out $15.  and am very upset.<br />Sincerely,
