Product claims and what I think of them:<br /># Attracts and traps flies - NOPE. After several days, only two little bitty flies are trapped, not the ones that we're trying to catch and that still buzz about happily (until I hit them with the fly swatter).<br /># Roll contains patent-pending three dimensional patterns and colors that are highly attractive to flies - WHICH FLIES? Maybe the Tennessee flies are too smart to be lured onto the trap paper?<br /># Easy-to-release paper - TRUE.<br /># Glue does not stick to fingers when touched - NOT TRUE. It does stick.<br /><br />Just go with the old-fashioned thingamajigs you hang from the ceiling. Though not a pretty sight, they're much cheaper and actually work.
