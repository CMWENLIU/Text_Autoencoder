We received the cat food in the original packaging - there was no protective wrap.  There is a lot of 'powdered' cat food in the bag - crushed nuggets due to, I believe, handling either at the warehouse or, most likely, by the shipper.  Until they improve their packaging I do not recommend that you purchase this product on-line.
