I love to eat Campbell's Chunky Soup. I ordered this pack of 12 cans on a whim one day. I signed up to get these every 6 months for the reduced price.<br /><br />I should have been more careful and read the details. These cans of soup are a lot smaller than I am used to seeing in the store. Camp bell's Chunky soup is usually in cans that are larger than an ordinary soup. These cans however are the typical size of a can of soup.<br /><br />On top of the size of the can, I realized that I can get regular size of Campbell's Chunky Soup for cheaper than these cans if I find them on sale.<br /><br />I highly recommend passing on this purchase and spending your money somewhere else.<br /><br />What did I learn with this purchase? ALWAYS read reviews before buying anything on Amazon :)
