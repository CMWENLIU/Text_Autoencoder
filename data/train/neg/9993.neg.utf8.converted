The first thing I noticed after opening the sealed bag was a godawful smell. It really slaps you in the face.  The taste, well, it's not as bad as the smell, things things are edible, but I can't really say I would enjoy eating them.  The good news is that after eating about a few of them, it totally killed my appetite.
