Because the point of using honey for me is to avoid the fast changes in blood glucose levels that come with refined/processed sugars -- this "not-all-honey" honey product does not work.  If you go to the company's website, it clearly says that this is only 60% honey -- the rest is maltodextrin, a fructose usually derived from wheat.  That's like paying for steak that is 40% breadcrumbs.<br /><br />Yes, you are getting pure honey in this -- but you're also getting filler.  Honey does not need a preservative or flavor enhancer, and it certainly doesn't need added fructose.  If it is impossible to make a powdered or granulated product from honey, companies should just say so, and not market something as honey when it's really just 3/5 honey.  A company that starts out its relationship to me by trying to deceive me, is off my list -- no matter what else they make.
