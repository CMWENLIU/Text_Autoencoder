I had to throw the whole case out.<br /><br />I'm not unusually sensitive, but they are so high in hydrolyzed vegetable protein (the ingredient-list euphemism for MSG) that even a small amount used as seasoning was enough to set off a major 24-hour case of "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome." Not worth the risk.
