Don't like it, but then look at the cost.  Mine wasn't even white.  It is blue and I put it in a large bag of dog food.  There are markings ever so slight for 1/2 cup and 1 cup which are not of much use - use a measuring cup instead.<br /><br />It's my fault,  I  should have shopped more carefully to find what I needed, which was a small 1 cup scoop that I could use instead of one of my nice kitchen ones.  It's flimsy and has rough edges.
