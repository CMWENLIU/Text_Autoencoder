I have been drinking Gevalia Swiss Hazelnut for Tassimo for YEARS (at least 5) and have been on a subscription plan for delivery.  Just opened one of the newly packaged products.  Not only has the packaging changed, the product has changed immensely!  It used to be a flavored coffee, pretty much unsweetened, but now it is LOADED with a sugar substitute and tastes positively disgusting. I'm sensitive to sugar substitutes, so a little WARNING about these changes would have been GREATLY appreciated.  I now have several packages of this coffee that will end up in the garbage.  It's been so sad to see the decline of number of products available for Tassimo, but now to see what little they have left starting to change for the worse - I guess it's time to switch to Keurig (as much as I really don't want to).  I have cancelled all further subscriptions for this product.
