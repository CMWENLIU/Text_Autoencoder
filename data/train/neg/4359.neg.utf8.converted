A friend of mine was sweet enough to buy these for me when she discovered them in a tiny market, and I'm still very grateful to her for being willing to buy them (expensive pasta!) without knowing if they were any good or not.<br /><br />Even my favourite spaghetti sauce could not hide the pasty, wet-dog odour this pasta gives off -- and the "flavour"? Forget it. Directions followed to a T, but this stuff just isn't worth it. No one at the table liked this stuff. Another disappointing gluten free pasta; don't waste your money.
