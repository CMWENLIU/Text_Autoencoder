I am SO NOT happy about purchsing this item. It is NOT as described. What the description says is "Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Dill, Mint, Parsley & Thyme," what I got was Genovese Basil, Thyme, Mint, Lemon Basil, Oregano, Dill, Global Basil. I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware.
