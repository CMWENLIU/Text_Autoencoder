I was surprised to find this in the grocery store.  I was unimpressed when I read the ingredients and looked at the price, $4.79.  None of the ingredients were organic like Pamela's Chocolate Cake.  So why charge this extremely high price if you're using junky, cheap ingredients??  A regular Betty Crocker cake mix is $1.90....what justifies this exorbitant price for a refined SUGAR filled GF version?<br /><br />PAMELA'S Ingredients: Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar, Brown Rice Flour, Organic Cocoa Powder (Processed With Alkali), White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Chicory Root, Sweet Rice Flour, Grainless and Aluminum Free Baking Powder, Sea Salt, Natural Flavor (Contains Corn Derivative), Xanthan Gum.<br /><br />On Amazon I can order the 6 pack of Pamela's for $4.48 per mix.  EACH Pamela mix is 21oz.<br />Betty Crocker is only 15 oz!!<br /><br />BEST BET -- buy Pamela's GF cake mix and get healthier ingredients plus more cake for your dollar!<br />Pamela's Chocolate Cake Mix still reigns supreme.  I've been eating GF for over 15 yrs now.
