The name Rainbow popcorn inplies that the popped corn will be mult-colored. It pops white and in small "tight" kernels.  It "chews" and tastes a little OLD! I also ordered "baby white" at the same time--I found it unsatisfactory too.  It pops small (as expected from name?) and is heavy.  I won't order from this company again.
