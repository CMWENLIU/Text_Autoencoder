I ordered these products through prime, and they appeared to be packaged properly.<br /><br />Every single bag was damaged in the manufacturing process, and I was unable to use any of the products. It appears the products were not checked before sending, and there was a slit down the side of every single bag.  All 4 boxes appeared to come from the same production batch.  To top it off I cannot return the products.  So now I am out $19 dollars, and I cannot use BioBag's compost bin which I also bought.  Can't say everyone will get the same bags, but buyer beware.<br /><br />I have pictures, but I cannot upload them in this review.
