This sauce kind of has a weird unappetizing smell. It smelled bad while it was cooking.  I was able to eat the chicken I made only by masking the taste of the sauce with a lot of basmati rice.  Maybe the smell is just something I don't like, but I would not buy this product again.  The texture of the sauce was fine however.
