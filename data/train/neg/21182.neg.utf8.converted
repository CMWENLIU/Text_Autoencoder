these are simply the worst stuffed grape leaves i have ever eaten. i cannot believe all the good reviews, which, regretably, influenced our decision to buy. we threw the first can out, it was so bad, then tried another a few weeks later, hoping there was just a bad can in the case. no such luck.  i would even say, this is one of the worst things i have ever eaten! these are a major rip-off.
