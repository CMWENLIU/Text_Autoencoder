I tried these noodles after the numerous recommendations made by the website HungryGirl, but I must say that these noodles are the MOST disgusting thing I have ever eaten.  If you want to get these noodles, I highly suggest you get one pack to try before stocking up (as I did), because you will most likely be left with packs of noodles you won't want to eat.  These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench.  Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them.  You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites.  The nutritionals are great, but they are so not worth any calories you save...they taste horrible and you'd wish you'd eaten nothing than waste 40 calories on these noodles!
