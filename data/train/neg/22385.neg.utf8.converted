I've always loved Barney Butter in a jar so was keen to try the convenient packets. Unfortunately they've not been a good buy. The product separates, and no matter how long I knead I can't get it to blend. When I tear open the packet I get a brief drizzly of very oily almond butter then there's a big lump left over that's near impossible to dislodge without cutting open the packet with scissors! Not even close to the consistency of the jar. Really disappointing.
