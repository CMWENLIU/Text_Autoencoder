I received only a sliver of kefir grains -- my grains did not look anything like the grains in the photograph. I understand that, if you work with them over time they expand. I have worked with them twice -- the first time I followed instructions & made successive batches over a 4-day period. The second time I allowed 18 hours. The kefir grains have expanded, but not enough to make a good, thick batch of kefir....and the kefir tastes bitter. It is supposed to taste sour.
