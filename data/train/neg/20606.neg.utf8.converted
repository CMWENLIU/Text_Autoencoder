Gave my entire family a terrible odorous condition, if u know what I mean. Usually I buy my quinoa from the bulk bins at Whole Foods and have no problem. I made this quinoa twice, to accompany two different dishes and the result was the same. We all left our perfume where ever we went, for a day after we consumed the quinoa.
