I bought this scent because I heard that green tea and cucumber helps with odor.<br />When I tried this deodorant, I was smelling something fishy.<br />The scent is overpowering and when it wears of, it smells so terrible.<br />Didn't help with keeping sweat at bay either.<br />So sweat+odor=very embarrassing moments in public and by myself!<br />Threw this deodorant away and will never try Dove again.<br />Also, they test on animals, how terrible!!!
