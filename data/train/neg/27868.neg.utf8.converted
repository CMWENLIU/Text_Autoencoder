Was excited that I could get the chocolate taste without all the sugar! It arrived, I made a cup and was disappointed with the STRONG artificial sweetener "aftertaste". I immediately began searching the label to find out what had been used to make it so "sweet". I found nothing about a sweetner on the individual packages but aha! on the side of the box I found the culprit: sucralose. I'll have to keep searching because I won't be buying this product again.
