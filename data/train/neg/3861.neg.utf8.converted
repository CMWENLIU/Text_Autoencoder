since no one else that reviewed this mentioned it, and since i bought it based on the high reviews, i thought i'd fill you in if you're buying this to sweeten tea, as i did. DON'T DO IT!!! It's TERRIBLE for sweetening tea, and you'll end up using half the bag to sweeten one glass!!  Can't comment on how it works otherwise. Wish I could return it!!!
