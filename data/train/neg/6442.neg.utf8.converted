Here's the email I wrote to the Lindt company after my first taste of the "new" version:<br /><br />Hello,<br />I have loved your 70% Excellence bar since I first discovered it 3 years ago. The slight tang of fruity notes was very unique and simply delightful. Also - knowing that only the highest quality chocolate is made with enough cocoa butter to preclude the need for soy lecithin, I was impressed that your 70% Excellence bar was soy-free. Like many other Americans, I typically avoid soy for health reasons.<br /><br />However, your new version of the 70% Excellence bar is entirely a disappointment. Its bland flavor is not disagreeable but it certainly lacks the character of your previous recipe. And I see that the quality of ingredients has also been sacrificed - the 70% bar now contains soy lecithin. This chocolate no longer stands out from any other chocolate available on store shelves.<br /><br />I will now be buying my chocolate from a different company. But if at some future time you decide to resume your previous version of the 70% Excellence bar, I will be pleased to buy from Lindt again.
