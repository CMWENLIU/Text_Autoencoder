I have 6 cats.The one cat is very picky and it took me many tries to find a flavor she would eat.This is the kind she would eat.However,the last 2 cases,she will not eat.I have opened cans from each case, only to find she turns away from it! I went to the local grocery store and bought 2 cans to see if there is any difference.The ones from the grocery store have a better color and is not all watery.She ate both cans I opened.I don't know what is wrong with the last 2 cases I ordered from Amazon but I am cancelling any future orders.I think it is rancid.I tried to get one of the other cats to eat some and they too,would not touch it!I am not going to take a chance and get them sick! No more FANCY FEAST FLAKED FISH AND SHRIMP from Amazon.I am terribly disappointed that they would send me this rancid cat food.
