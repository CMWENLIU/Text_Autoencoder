I also had ordered these bars and had my ordered cancelled. They had the money pending out of my bank account, and had sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then, a couple days later,  they decided they had listed the wrong price so they cancelled their orders. They should not have sent out an e-mail stating they were backordering when that was a lie (they obviously have no problem today having it in stock). I will not order from this company again...
