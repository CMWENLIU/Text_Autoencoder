I usually buy my Charms lollipops at BJ's, but they only sell the assorted box.  That is why I was willing to pay more for this product. When I received the package the box looked old.  Like it had been setting around a warehouse for some time.  I decided to try one and regretted it. The lollipops are way past their "freshness" date.  They are nasty.  Don't waste your money purchasing from this seller.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I spent my money.  I requested a refund.  I think I'll stick to buying them at BJ's where the lollipops look and taste fresh.
