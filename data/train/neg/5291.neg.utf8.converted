I have to agree with everyone else. I once accidentally purchased the DaVinci Gourmet brand caramel and I remarked to my husband that it tasted like pancake syrup to me. When I bought this though, I was thrilled to be saving money. Imagine my disappointment then when I tried it the very first time. I believe this is the same syrup as the caramel, but with a different label slapped onto the bottle. No, really I do. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the two.<br /><br />Well whatever it is, it is NOT hazelnut.<br /><br />I would recommend the DaVinci Gourmet brand of sugar free Hazelnut OR hazelnut flavored Splenda packets instead. Amazon sells both DaVinci and Splenda, but neither have super saver shipping at the time of this writing. You have to balance for yourself whether or not the extra money is worth it to you.
