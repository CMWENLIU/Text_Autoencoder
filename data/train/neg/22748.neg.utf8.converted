I tried this tea out of curiosity yesterday... normally, I love Tazo teas.  But this one... ugh.  I couldn't drink more than a few sips before I felt the need to pour it out.  The scent of it alone reminded me of a funeral home.  It tastes and smells exactly like orange-scented wood polish.  Awful.
