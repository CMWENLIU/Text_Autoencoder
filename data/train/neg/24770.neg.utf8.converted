Update:<br /><br />I deleted my old review, because it caused confusion and did not relate directly to this specific product. However, I will stand by my decision to discontinue my family's use of any product from The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Earth's Best products fall under this company).<br /><br />If you read my old review, I apologize for not specifying that this specific product does not have BPA in the packaging. I did not mean to cause confusion.<br /><br />I also failed to specify my exact problems with this specific product:<br /><br />It made my daughter gassy<br />She normally spit up at least 1/4 of her bottle (she rarely spits up since we switched to Nature's One Baby's Only Organic Soy Formula)<br />I don't care for a couple of the ingredients:  Life's DHA (uses Martek's Hexane method) and corn syrup<br /><br />***Just so you are aware (I was not), the Obama administration banned the use of DHA and ARA in certified organic baby formula and cereal back in 2010.
