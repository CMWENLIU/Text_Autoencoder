I used to buy Caffe Verona for my regular coffeepot and decided to try this for my Tassimo when it came out.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  When I would drink from the coffeepot, it was sooooo good.  It didn't seem to have the same flavor from the t-discs.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Maybe it is the strength of the t-disc?  I prefer it kind of strong.
