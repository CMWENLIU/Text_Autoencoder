I purchased four cases of these particular sardines because I am a believer in healthy eating and was attracted to the omega-3 factor and the olive oil. Reading the nutrition facts,however, I was upset to learn that these sardines have 29% saturated fat and 23% cholesterol. Can I swap them for other sardines, at my expense. I was advised that the Brunswick sardines in spring water, with no salt added, are the prefered kind. I, again, accept the responsibility and will pay for additional cost. Would appreciate your guidance. Thank you, S. Norman Reich
