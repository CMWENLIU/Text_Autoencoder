The television commercials for Pepperidge Farm's MILANO MELTS cookies really worked -- I couldn't wait to buy a bag!  I'm a big fan of the original Milano cookies -- the cookies themselves are light, crispy, and perfectly paired with rich dark chocolate.  So what could go wrong with Milano cookies filled with dark, sumptuous chocolate creme?<br /><br />Well, MILANO MELTS are disappointing.  First, the cookie itself:  It's sort of a "double-thick" Milano cookie, which means it lacks the lightness and the delicate crispness of the original Milanos.  It's very hard around the edges, and the texture seems dense and unappetizing.  Then, there's the "dark chocolate creme":  It just lacks the flavor of the chocolate on the original Milanos.  Additionally, there's nowhere as much creme as you see in the TV commercials (or pictured on the package).  The creme is mostly located in one half of the cookie -- I took my first bite and wondered, "where is the creme?"  All I saw was a thin line of chocolate, which was tasteless buried inside that thick cookie.  There was more creme on the other side of the cookie, but it was nothing like what I was expecting.<br /><br />These are simply not as good as the original Milano cookies (which are wonderful).  This is an interesting-sounding idea that just didn't pan out.  Stick to the original Milanos -- they will not disappoint.
