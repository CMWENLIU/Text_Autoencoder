I have been buying and using Hershey unsweetened powdered cocoa for over 30 years now.  It was pretty good stuff for the price, and always reliable.  Alas, imagine my dismay to bite into a chocolaty-looking brownie made with the same recipe I've used for years, and taste -- blah.  Blah?  From a BROWNIE?  Gasp!  What was this?  No rich, dark, pungent, distinctly chocolate flavor?  Brown, yes.  Chocolate, barely.  If you'd put a blindfold on me, I'd have been hard put to figure out what I was eating.<br /><br />You know the difference between REAL chocolate and those cheap, waxy brown little fake foil-wrapped abominations you can buy at the discount store to placate the neighborhood trolls every October?  Well, that's the difference between good old reliable Hershey cocoa of yore, and the stuff they're trying to pass off as cocoa now.<br /><br />I was aware that Hershey had removed cocoa butter and other quality ingredients from all their ready-to-eat chocolate products a couple of years ago and replaced them with vegetable shortenings, soy, emulsifiers, and God-knows-what-else.  But I naively thought Hershey cocoa powder had escaped a similar flavor hijacking, chemically-enhanced adulteration.  I was so, so wrong.  The ingredient list says, "COCOA."  Trust me, this is NOT the same cocoa it used to be.  And it's so, so wrong what Hershey has done to it.<br /><br />It's sad when an American tradition falls to the greed of a big corporation cutting corners.
