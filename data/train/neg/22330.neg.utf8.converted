Cats are carnivores, so their diet should be based on products that are primarily meat based. While the first ingredient is chicken, this is inclusive of water pre-processing. That means the true first ingredient is corn gluten. There are cheaper, meat based dry foods on the market. Please do your research and do your cat a favor by feeding them their natural diet.
