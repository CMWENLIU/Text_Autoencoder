One word: Boo.  I wish I had read these reviews before I spent my money on this garbage.  The Campbell's Healthy Choice clam chowder is a total waste of cans.  One has to do way too to make up for all of the things removed to make it "healthy".  Don't spend your money.  Either go for the regular Campbell's or Progresso.
