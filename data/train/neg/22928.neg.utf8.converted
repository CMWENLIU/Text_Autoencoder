The label on the packaging says "8 fruitastic flavors" but there aren't any fruit flavors here. The initial (very) subtle flavor of the colored shell is gone after just a few bites, and then all that's left is the generic "gum" flavor.<br /><br />Every piece literally just tastes like confectioners sugar. No flavor variation at all. If you want fruity, check out a different brand.
