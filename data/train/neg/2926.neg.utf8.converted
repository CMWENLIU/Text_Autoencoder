This product was so misrepresented that I no longer use Amazon as my first choice when I'm looking for a product.  I ended up spending my gift certificate and was totally ripped off for 3 packs of nuts that I can purchase in a store for $5.  Don't be fooled by this product no matter how they try to dress it up.
