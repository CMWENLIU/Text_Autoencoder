I tried this for the first time because my favorite sesame oil (Kadoya) wasn't available.  I figured all Japanese sesame oils are more or less the same. I was dead wrong.<br /><br />What a disappointment!  This oil is either watered-down or not processed properly.  I will never order it again, unless there is a world wide shortage of sesame oil.<br /><br />Stick with Kadoya 56 oz if you can get it. It is rich in flavor and the real thing.
