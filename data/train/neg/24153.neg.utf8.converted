I have been a very very loyal Senseo drinker since my first machine over 7 years ago.  I purchased the new Supreme model in Oct '11 when my old one was wearing out and then Consumer Reports rated the new model the top one for pod machines.  I would have purchased it from Amazon but the Senseo website was selling them for half price!  Too good to be true it turned out....as they stopped selling the machine several months later and on April 1st the pods were no longer available in retail stores.  So I kept purchasing pods thru Amazon.  Until May....when I saw that they no longer in stock.  And no longer in stock anywhere online....including the Senseo Store on their own website.  Well I just called Senseo today, June 7th, 2012, to complain and they said they they "should" have coffee pods back in stock mid-June.....and they said Amazon "should" have pods the 1st week of July.  That wasn't good enough for me.  They sell (and then stop selling) a coffee maker and then claim they cannot supply the coffee pods due to operations problems and changes with their manufacturing.  I love my Senseo brewer a lot but it is too much of a struggle to get the pods....or wait for them....and I am not convinced that this won't be the case again the future.  So the people at Senseo (Sara Lee, Inc actually) helped me make a decision.....that I will be disposing of my 8 month old Senseo brewer next week when my current pod supply runs out and I will be replacing it with a new K-Cup machine.
