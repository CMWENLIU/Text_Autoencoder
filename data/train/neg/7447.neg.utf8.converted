Okay, background first, 45 year old white guy that drinks too much Coca-Cola and wants to cut back. I like tejava (a lot). I drink green and black teas, etc. So I am not a new-be to tea. So I bought this tea, the Anteadote Organic White Tea thinking it would be a convenient alternative to reaching in the fridge and grabbing a Coke. Man! Was I wrong. This stiff taste nasty! I mean, nasty with a capital "N". It's so nasty that I am not sure what to do with the remaining 14.5 bottles! That's correct, 14.5 bottles.... I could not even finish the only bottle I tried! Ugh! So, if someone writes and says "I love the taste of this tea and that other reviewer is smoking crack".... well... I hope you think twice. Fair warning has been served.
