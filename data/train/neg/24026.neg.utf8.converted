I purchased the caraway seeds after looking at a Dr. Oz show on healthy alternatives to prescription medications.  Caraway seeds may be the newest thing per Dr. Oz, but I tried a teaspoon of them and they tasted so bad I was unable to eat them.  Maybe I misunderstood the directions, but acid reflux is much better than the caraway seeds.
