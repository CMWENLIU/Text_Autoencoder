Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like. Counted on all the positive reviews, but we all have different palates, don't we? I prefer Senseo's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite. Just opened my first of six bags, so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my "bargain" purchase of a brew that is weak and one-dimensional. I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy. Just can't throw it all out!
