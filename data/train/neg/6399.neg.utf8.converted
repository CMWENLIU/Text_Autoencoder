I wish Rihanna would get her face off this product.  It tastes nasty.  I bought a couple dozen since I love Vita Coco's products. However, this flavor is just the worst. They tried, and the taste has a hint of guava.  But it doesn't work in this package.  I have tried giving them away and nobody wants them - I still haven't seen anyone who likes the taste.
