I am very unhappy and saddened to report that I will not be dealing with this bread company again and neither Amazon unless there is no alternatives. I bought a case and stored them in my kitchen which is cool. The bread was fine however within 1 week I opened a second loaf and noticed mold inside one of the loaves. I then checked the rest and also saw mold on every one . I checked the instructions again, the storing option was that it could be placed on your counter top , I contacted Amazon who referred me to the seller by e mail, I had a reply to say the bread should have been frozen immediately, this IS TOTALLY UNTRUE and not stated on the labels. Anyway I then filed an A-Z claim to wait over another week for Amazon to send me this short curt mail saying it was not covered under A-Z , I was shocked as they knew why I was claiming this item and now to say not covered is very poor service indeed.  I contacted Customer Service and instead of empathizing with me Paula in customer service started to tell me about expiry dates and her mother works in a bakery ! I don't need to hear that as I know all about GF bread and have been buying it for years. I could not even get to speak to a Manager after requests to do so and then was insulted with a $30 promotional voucher which I declined. I spent thousands with Amazon year after year and to be treated this was is very sad , what happened to your legendary service. I also notice that Amazon send me an e mail saying sorry they cant help and thanks for your business , truly amazing they just don't value their best customers<br /><br />Bottom line don't deal with this bread company as they don't live up to their promises and try to shirk their responsibility as the label is misleading and false
