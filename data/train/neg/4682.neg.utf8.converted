When my husband brought in the delivered package with popcorn kernels stuck to the tape of the folded box and the sound of popcorn rolling around in the box... He knew what his Christmas surprise was immediately... a Popcorn Popper. The bag the popcorn came in was not sealed properly on top and 2 inches of the bag was open leaving the popcorn stale and spilling all over.
