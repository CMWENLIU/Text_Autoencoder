We've gotten other flavors of Spry gum from natural food stores and liked them.  So, I was excited to see fruit flavor available.  However, I was very disappointed when we received it and it was artificially flavored.  Not a big deal to most people, but it is to us.  The only reason I ordered it was because I thought it was all natural. My kids did try it before we realized it, and they liked the flavor, but I ended up throwing most of it away.  If I want artificially flavored gum, I can get that anywhere.  I don't need to order it. So, if your buying this just for the no sugar aspect this might be okay, but if you want "all natural" look for something else.
