two issues cause me to give the product one star.<br />-packaging: 5 pounds of the product came wrapped, but not sealed, in plastic inside a cardboard box.  as i pulled out the plastic, the bites fell everywhere.<br />-taste and consistency:  while the smell is normal/good, the product doesn't taste like black licorice, leaves an unpleasant aftertaste, and has the consistency of rubber.<br />i bought this product as a gift, and was totally embarassed and disappointed in its quality.
