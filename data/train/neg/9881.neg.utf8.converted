I used to buy all the earths best products for my kids. My 18 month old loved the Elmo pasta and sauce that comes in a can. However after purchasing a case of the Elmo pasta and sauce I opened the can and found bugs! There were tiny bugs that looked like baby roaches!!! I continued to open all the cans in the case to find they all contained 2-4 bugs per can!!! I called the company and was offered coupons as a compensation. She assured me that this was an isolated Incident. I told The company to keep their coupons because I will never be purchasing their products again! Makes me wonder what their plant looks like. I am throughly disgusted that I have been feeding my 6 month old the jars of baby food. Just wanted to make others aware......
