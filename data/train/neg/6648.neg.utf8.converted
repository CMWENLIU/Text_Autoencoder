I love this oil, good flavor, love that it's organic, BUT the pour spout makes such a mess on the top of the tin that you have to wipe up & waste (1/2 teaspoon with every single pour) and sometimes even runs down the side of the tin that I won't be buying it again unless the tin is designed better.  I've tried pouring fast, slow, etc. and it just doesn't pour well at all.
