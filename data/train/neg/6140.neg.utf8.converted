I have been taking this product for two months now but for some reason,the last 2 weeks, itchy skin rashes have manifested in some parts of my body. I stopped taking green superfood for a week and my skin rashes have diminished.<br />I resumed taking the product again but skin rashes came back again. Definitely, the cause of my skin disease is this<br />product. For other people, this product may have worked but not for me.<br /><br />My friend has recommended new probiotic supplement. He said, the supplement is very potent, everytime you take one capsule, it is equivalent to 24 servings of average yogurt. If anyone is curious, you can search  Regenesis Probiotic supplement on Amazon and check out for yourself..
