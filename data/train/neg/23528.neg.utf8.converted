I have to agree with another reviewer on here, I buy this EXACT same product at Sam's Club for $9.99. These people are ripping you off. As he said, if you buy these often you could easily buy a Sam's Club membership for the extra cost these people charge. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for your rawhides.
