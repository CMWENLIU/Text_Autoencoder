I loved the Blueberry Pomegranate flavor enough to be getting regular deliveries.  But this month  Blackberry Pomegranate shows up without any notice to me.  I do not care for this flavor as much as the Blueberry combination and am most annoyed that no one gave me any advance notice that my regular order was being changed.  Amazon, this is a glitch you need to fix!!  The seller should advise the buyer that they are no longer getting the product they wanted!<br />As for the merits of the drink:  it is okay but too strong on the Blackberry side.  Unless you really like the taste of blackberry that much you probably won't love this one.  I've cancelled this subscription!
