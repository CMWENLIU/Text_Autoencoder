Seriously?? By whose standards??<br /><br />Since when are wheat starch, glycerin, cellulose, potato starch, bacon flavor (?what does this mean?) healthy?<br /><br />I bought this thinking it would last a few hours or days but my dog just gobbled it up in minutes.<br /><br />I love the nylabone chew products but I don't recommend these unless you have very large dogs that can eat them as treats.
