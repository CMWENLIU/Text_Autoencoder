This product has changed its safflower source.  I called the company today after receiving my order - which label did not match that on the company website within the past week.  They say that now the website is correct. It has only has 2g of polyunsaturated fats which is well below the 7-11g per serving that Dr Oz recommends for aid in reducing belly fat.  It is a great oil if you want it for cooking.  I am canceling my auto ship.
