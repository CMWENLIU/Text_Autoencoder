This crap is made by a lazy company that leaves the dirt and sand in there and calls it minerals. If you like adding sand to your salt before sprinkling it on your favorite foods, this is the salt for you! If you like a salt that is loaded with minerals and flavor without the grit, get Spice labs Himalayan salt. That's what I did and I will never again spend my money on this gritty crap that they could have filtered but that would take too long and cost too much?<br /><br />Yet another company out of Utah that cuts corners and compromises our health...the other company is concentrace mineral drops ... that product was endorsed by a scientist who now removed his endorsement after seeing the filthy conditions that company now uses! Something wrong with Utah?!
