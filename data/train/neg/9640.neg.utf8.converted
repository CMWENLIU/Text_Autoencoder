I bought two of these directly from AeroGardens.  One with the salad greens and one with the tomatoes.  I've had them for 32 days now, and the greens are about 2" tall and the tomatoes show one tomato plant that is no more than 1/4" high.  I called to do an RMA.  I have hydronic (infloor) heating, set at 64 degrees, which is very uniform and should not have caused my AeroGrows to fail.  I checked the pH and TDS and found that they are way out of whack from what they should be for acceptable levels.  I will be building my own hydroponic systems for far less money after this experiment.  I am glad I got these on the trial basis which allows you to return them if not satisfied.  These may work well in a warmer environment but in the long run, they will not outperform other systems that you can build cheaper and bigger.  To the company's credit, they are paying for the return shipping so I am only out the initial shipping (about $30).
