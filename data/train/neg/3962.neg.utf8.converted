I bought this spray because it doesn't contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager.  I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas.  My husband chose to use nothing.  I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites.  In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies.  This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.<br /><br />While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless.  In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
