The product itself deserves 5 stars as all 3 of my cats go crazy and sometimes even fight for it. However, Cat-Man-Doo or "Bonito Flakes" as the Japanese call them are used in actual cooking and if you look it up under this name on Amazon, there are sellers who are selling it for a fraction of the price listed here. You can also find this at your local Korean/Japanese grocer in big bags that last months.
