Our cats have been eating Natural Balance for a long time. They like it and it's endorsed by our vet. I started buying it at Amazon recently to save a few cents a can and to have it delivered to my house since the cases of this can get heavy. I buy 6 cases at a time. In both orders I've made,I've had to throw away two or three cans because they are so badly damaged that I believe the seal is broken, so I'm not sure if I'm actually saving any money. In the last shipment, one of my cases was 1 can short and also had a damaged can or two in it so I only got about 21 instead of 24. The first time I ordered, I thought this was a fluke but it happened on this last order also, so shipping damaged goods is just part of their process.
