This isn't the worst quality food you could feed, but it isn't a high quality product, either.  Yet the price is comparable to premium quality holistic foods-- probably a marketing decision related to Rachel Ray's starpower?  I purchased this during an emergency- an ice storm had begun and I was out of dog food, so I grabbed a small bag at a convenient store on the way home from work.  My dogs ate it willingly, although they didn't love it.<br /><br />Nutrish foods (both the chicken and beef options) have lots of indigestible corn, artificial dyes, and gluten.  Corn seems to pass through most dogs nearly undigested, leading to large stools and wasted money.  Gluten was the ingredient implicated in the tainted pet food scandals over the last couple of years-- it just isn't a wholesome ingredient, and it's one I tend to avoid. The good things I can say about this food are that it doesn't use yucky slaughterhouse "by-products", and that it includes great vegetable ingredients.  Overall, there are worse options on the grocery store shelves, but this is an overpriced, less-than-great food choice for your best pal.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Ingredients list, so you can make up your own mind:<br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brewers Rice, Corn Meal, Soybean Meal, Animal Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Corn Gluten Meal, Brown Rice, Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Natural Flavor, Dicalcium Phosphate, Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Dehydrated Alfalfa, Dried Peas, Dried Tomatoes, Dried Carrots, Potassium Chloride, Choline Chloride, Olive Oil, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Ferrous Sulfate, Iron Oxide, Dried Parsley, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Mixed Tocopherols,plus the expected vitamins.<br />``````````````````<br /><br />Here are a couple of alternatives you might want to check out:<br />Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs., Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs., Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YWMYE">Blue Buffalo Lamb & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs.</a>.
