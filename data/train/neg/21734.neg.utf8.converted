These Colombian coffee beans used to be a good everyday/nothing fancy coffee.  I've bought them 2 times in the last 6 months (& many times in the past years); they are not as good as they used to be.  They claim the beans are the same even though the packaging changed but I don't believe it.  The beans are now more bitter & have less flavor.  I also found more quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.  My most recent bag had 9.<br /><br />I've stopped buying this coffee.  Having a good cup of coffee in the morning is one of life's little pleasures for me & so it's worth paying more for good coffee.  So far, I've bought these 3 coffees from Amazon & they are excellent:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z8VES">Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Pouch</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041QIIYY">Weaver's Coffee and Tea, French Roast Organic Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>
