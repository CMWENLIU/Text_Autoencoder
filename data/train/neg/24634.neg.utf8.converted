I purchased this product supplied by As-Seen-on-TV.ws in December 09. When I tried the product for the first time, it never worked! I contacted the seller As-Seen-on-TV.ws and told them that the product was defective. I was told, they would ship a newer revised unit, once they became available. However, when this one came, it was still the old style, I had the same experience as with the first one - it did not work! After contacting the company again, I was asked to return both units at my expense and they would send the newer style that was now available.<br />Now, I have been told that they will not send another product since shipping to Canada would be to costly, but instead refund my original purchase price without compensating my expense of returning two defective products. So how do I rate this products? I can't, it never worked to begin with. How do I rate the Seller? You draw your own conclusion.
