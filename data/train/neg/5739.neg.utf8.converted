If it sounds too good to be true, it's too good to be true.  Thought I was making a good investment in purchasing this item.  Turns out it is useless.  The filter prevents the coffee maker from completely sealing once it is placed in Senseo coffee maker, so once you clamp down lid and press botton to make coffee it leaks hot water all over the place, making a big mess.  Also, the rich foamy coffee you get with Senseo pods is nowhere to be seen.  I used Starbucks. It did not foam up and it was weak, weak,weak.  The podfilter was fully loaded with coffee. Even on the 1 cup setting the coffee was weak.  FOLKS YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  IT'S NO WONDER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND KEEP BUYING THE SENSEO PODS IF YOU WANT A GREAT CUP OF COFFEE AND FORGET ABOUT BEING A CHEAPSKATE.  I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON THE HARD WAY.I'M OUT 30 BUCKS AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.  IF THERE WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF RATING AVAILABLE, THIS ITEM WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IT.
