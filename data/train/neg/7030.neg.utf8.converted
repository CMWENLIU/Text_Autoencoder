Wow, I'm a HUGE fan of Nutiva. I buy their Hemp Seeds (best non-animal protein there is).<br /><br />I was excited to get this as I use coconut oil in cooking, coconut milk for protein & fruit shakes and everyone here is a big macaroon fan.<br /><br />This showed up as a solid mass. I couldn't even push a butter knife into it. I could only scrape some off the top, to taste it. So I did what I was told in the directions: "Place jar in hot tap water for 5-10 minutes & thoroughly stir."<br /><br />30 MINUTES LATER there was little liquid sitting on one side. That's 30 minutes with boiling tap water running into a small bowl where the Coconut Manna was immersed.<br /><br />I'm not sure what use we'll find for this, but I don't see the sense of liquefying it every time I want to spread a little on toast.<br /><br />MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. There's no way a company could have tested this and not experienced what we did.
