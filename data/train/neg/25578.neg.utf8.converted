I tried.. I really tried... I honestly tried...but I couldn't eat these things.  I will stick to the kind i purchase locally int he grocery store as they are crisp (really crisp) and not bad on taste with 19% fiber.<br />Even though these Scandinavian brand was recommended by Dr. Os and lots of others I just can't handle them. Tsate is not good in my opinion, texture is horrible, and Sahara Desert sand would be more moist.  I bought a large quantity of these things so regret doing that.  I though thet would be like my regular Crispbread.  I might be good for others but not for me.
