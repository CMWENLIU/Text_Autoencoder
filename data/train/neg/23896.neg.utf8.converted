It was my favorite tea until the damned peppermint was added. Now it's a completely different tea! This new tea is not satisfying at all unless of course you want to feel like you're brushing your teeth instead of drinking tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings really shouldn't claim this to be the same tea because it really isn't. That's too bad considering it got the company started and all. I just wish there was a way to get the tea without the peppermint but it'll probably never happen.
