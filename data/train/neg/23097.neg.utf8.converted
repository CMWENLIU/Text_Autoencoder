1) This product is not at all decaffeinated. The "99.7% caffeine free" on the label refers to the percentage of stuff in the container that is not caffeine, rather than a portion of caffeine that has been removed from the cocoa. It is no more meaningful than it would be to write "100% nightshade free" on the container. See the comment thread under Matt's review for more information. 2-star penalty for misleading advertising.<br /><br />2) This cocoa tastes no better than cheaper brands I've tried, and it is more expensive other brands that taste better. 3 stars for taste.<br /><br />3) The fat-free aspect is not very significant, at least not to me. Cocoa powder is roughly 20% fat, but you only need a small amount of cocoa powder to make hot chocolate.<br /><br />4) The metal containers, while nice looking, do not function well. It is difficult to open them without spilling some cocoa.
