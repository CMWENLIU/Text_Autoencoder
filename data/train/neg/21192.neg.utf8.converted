A 6 lb bag the my vet insists on is $22 plus $8 shipping=$30!  Granted he had a urinary tract infection but there must be more reasonable alternatives.<br /><br />So it will cost me 5 bucks a pound for this stuff.  I can't afford it. Plus there is nothing that I hate more than overcharging on shipping to make it look cheaper. I can't find it any cheaper on Google.<br /><br />Does anybody know of an alternative?
