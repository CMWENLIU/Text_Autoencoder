I based my purchase on the package picture. Boy was I disappointed! The product is very strong and induced instant heartburn. There were also many broken pieces in the box that I opened. I am going to ask for a refund even though the product is non returnable.<br /><br />These may be right for you if you like powerfully strong mints.
