Has a nice mellower taste than store bought heat-processed table salt.<br /><br />No Iodine, so I supplement with 4 drops of good tasting Liquid Dulse <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014HV48">Bernard Jensen Products - Liquid Dulse, 4 oz liquid</a> (also Very good to FILL thyroid with GOOD iodine!- Keeps from taking in any Radioactive iodine from Japan reactor spill!- Radioactive iodine does Permanent damage to thyroid, and can't be reversed! Radioactivity is sure to work into our food supply...!)<br /><br />Per my dentist (for everyone)- I started gargling with 1/4tsp salt in 8oz of water after brushing.<br />It is VERY unnerving to see the undissolved black/brown specs floating around!<br /><br />The other unprocessed sea salt brands come from "Less" pristine waters, but I'll give them a try next time.
