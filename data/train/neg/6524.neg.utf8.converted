I recently gave up drinking soda and have been searching for a calorie-free alternative.  I'm a big fan of Tea2Go, but like most sweet-tasting mixes it has Splenda in it.  So even though I've replaced my Diet Pepsi addiction with watered down tea, I still feel a little guilty about it.<br /><br />So when EBOOST came along I thought it was a perfect opportunity to inject some vitamins into my diet.  And, let me tell you, EBOOST sure did.  I just didn't expect it to blast those vitamins through my tongue and out the back of my skull.<br /><br />You see, the folks who produce EBOOST believe that more is better.  And therefore, something that's good for you in large quantities is even better.  And while we're at it, why not just multiply the good stuff by a THOUSAND, because hey, how can it hurt, right?<br /><br />I take a daily multivitamin already and even the efficacy of a multivitamin is questioned by the FDA.  The reason being that different minerals are absorbed by the body differently, and often require fat in your diet (usually at the time of consumption) to be absorbed along with the vitamin. In other words, just sucking down a vitamin with water isn't going to do you much good.  And, in case it's not clear that this review is going down the toilet, dumping thousands of milligrams of certain vitamins into your system is going to pass right through you.<br /><br />Don't tell EBOOST that.  EBOOST has 1,000 mg of Vitamin C, which is 1,667% the daily recommended value.  Let me repeat: one thousand six hundred and sixty seven percent of the daily recommended value.  And here I thought I was okay drinking a glass of orange juice in the morning! I drank a full eight ounces of water with EBOOST and I'm surprised my head hasn't exploded already.<br /><br />In fact, the only vitamin that EBOOST doesn't include insanely high amounts of is potassium at just 14% of the daily recommended value, because that would reduce the efficacy of the 2,500 mcg of Vitamin B12.  Do you know how much of the recommended B12 daily value that is?  41,667%.  I read the label twice: FORTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT of the daily recommended value.<br /><br />A quick search of several health sites explains how ridiculous this amount is. "Vitamin B12 supplements do not appear to improve energy or athletic performance, except in people with a vitamin B12 deficiency."<br /><br />Please folks - if you want to take care of these fragile bodies of ours, drink plenty of water, eat healthy, and exercise. There is no magic formula that will make you healthier except a healthy lifestyle.  There are plenty of other ways to get your vitamins, but EBOOST isn't it.<br /><br />Also, it tastes like metal shavings off a dirty muffler mixed in with an orange rind. But I have only myself to blame -- EBOOST fizzes when you pour it into water.  That's Nature's way of telling you not to drink it.
