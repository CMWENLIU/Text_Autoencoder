My case of Wolf chili arrived yesterday. Lets start with that. HEY AMAZON, whoever works in your shipping department should be fired. This case of chili was in a box about 8 inches larger than the case itself, no problem there. But only 1 piece of brown packing paper was used, and it was placed on top of the chili. There was no packing around the sides of the case, so this chili was sliding around in this box and tearing the box up. A few of the cans were dented, but no problem there. I worked in shipping and receiving before, and if anything was packed in this manner, it would be totally unacceptable. I am surprised UPS even accepted the package the way the case was sliding around in the box. Ok, enough of that. On to the chili itself.<br /><br />I bought this because I had read so many reviews about how Wolf chili is supposed to be the best. Well, I gotta say that it doesnt even come close to the best. First of all, open the can and pour it into the pot. Thats right, pour. The consistency of this chili is almost like soup. Any other can of chili you would either have to shake vigorously out of the can or spoon it out, but this stuff just pours out. And I think there was beef in it, but it must have been ground up so small that it was hardly noticable, again, adding to that watery consistency.<br /><br />As for the taste, well, it aint bad, but again, nowhere near the best. But the consistency of the chili and the taste combined? Makes you wonder how anyone can rave about this stuff. 4/10 at best, and thats being kind.<br /><br />If you want the best, I would go with Stagg. Many different flavors and a much higher quality, and better consistency.
