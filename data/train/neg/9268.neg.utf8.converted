Every can you receive will be dented significantly. It is obvious that these were set aside by the vendor as unsellable to the normal markets and grocery stores, and Amazon must have gotten them at a huge discount. They then turn around and sell them on their website. The fact is that damaged cans are supposed to be disposed of or donated to a food bank or shelter. You do NOT sell them. Don't make the mistake I made.
