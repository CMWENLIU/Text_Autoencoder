I usually drink the Mothers Milk tea but thought I would give the Yogi tea a try.  It did nothing for my supply and it tastes horrible.  I got through 2 boxes and couldn't finish the last four.  I have a strong stomach and can usually tolerate anything.  The Mothers Milk tea at least makes a difference in my supply.
