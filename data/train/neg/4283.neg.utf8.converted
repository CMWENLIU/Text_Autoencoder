I tried this coffee because of the price being less than most k-cups here on Amazon.  It's very strong coffee using the largest setting on our B-60 (I think it's 9.25 oz.).  Taste is not full-bodied but rather ashy tasting and flat; it smells and tastes like cigarettes and coffee.<br />Also, I have to hold the machine closed while it's brewing.  The strange non-k-cup pod will not allow the machine to close properly.  The pods need to be stored in a ziploc or other airtight container.  I'd have appreciated knowing they were not standard k-cups in advance.<br />I won't re-order despite the savings.
