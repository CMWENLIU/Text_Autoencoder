These berries are just gross. When I opened the bag, the odor turned me off immediately. Also, they aren't just dry, but rather like small stones. They made me think of the stuff you put in the bottom of fish tanks. Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.<br /><br />Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.<br /><br />I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.<br /><br />If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell. Gross.
