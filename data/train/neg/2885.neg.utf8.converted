If you have any sense at all, you'll pass on this. Look at the box, 3 for 99 cents, and there's 24 in the box. 24 divided by 3 equals 8, and they want 13 for it and more for shipping and handling.<br /><br />Don't get it? It's worth $8.00 and you're gonna pay about $18.00 for it after shipping if you get it here. Just go to your local gas station and grab the display, it'll be a lot cheaper and you won't have to wait for it to arrive.
