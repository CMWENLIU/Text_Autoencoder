The coffee is decent, when the inner lining stays in place.  I'd guess 12 out 17 k-cups we brewed were filled with coffee grounds.  The last I just put in the garbage without brewing it. The first cup brewed was ok, or at least I don't remember any grounds in it. Then a couple cups I would notice little brown pieces floating.  Other times, I would find the bottom of my cup was the entire k-cup of grounds.<br /><br />The K-cups are lined with a tea bag-ish filter, which seems to be loosely pressed or glued between the foil lid and the plastic  cup.  I don't know if it's the pressure of the water spraying it off, or a bad seal, or what...<br /><br />I've never had this problem with other brands, and I am hesitant to purchase another Van Houtte brand k-cup again.  Hopefully this was a one time thing, but it costs too much money to hope it doesn't happen again.
