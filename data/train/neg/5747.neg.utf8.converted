First of all, two bags were opened and the chicory was spilled everywhere.<br /><br />Second, I don't know why it says "Ground Coffee" on the label.  It's 100% chicory.  Yes I know that is identified but it should not even have the word coffee on the label.  I made one pot and threw all six bags away.
