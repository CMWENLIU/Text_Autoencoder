18 cartons at 8.25 ounces per carton = 148.25 oz.<br />148.25 oz. = 1.16 gallons<br /><br />$20.00 / 1.16 gallons = $17.23 / gallon. For SOY MILK.<br /><br />If you really want your kids to drink soy milk, go to your local grocery store, get a half gallon of Silk for $3.00, then buy them a Thermos to fill up every day for their lunch.<br /><br />I love Vanilla Soy Milk, I really do. I'm willing to pay a small premium over regular milk for the lack of cholesterol, etc. without the nastiness that is skim milk. But the existence of this product for this price is almost an insult to our intelligence.<br /><br />Unless you're independently wealthy, that is. Then buy away.
