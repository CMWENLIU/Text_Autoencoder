It was very disappointing to read the ingredients and find that this cheese contains CORN FLOUR, which is a filler. Even grated cheese in supermarkets like Kraft label clearly "No Fillers". So does the Safeway brand. The thought of an Italian cheese having corn flour in it as a filler is repugnant to me, and is a rip off. Grated cheese should be 100% grated cheese. The label says that the corn flour is used to prevent caking. This is not true. Cellulose is used as an anti caking ingredient. Corn flour is a filler. This cheese tasted like saw dust to me and Amazon's excellent customer service gave me a full credit because I was so disappoined. Don't be fooled by the Italian name. Kraft grated cheese is 100% cheese and in a pinch is just fine and obviously sold in any supermarket.
