I got the baby brezza about 6 months ago, when it was time to start introducing solids to my baby boy. Back then all the reviews were 5 star, so I was super excited to get this item and thought it was worth the higher price. Well, it's not. The main reason why I got this item was so that I could make vegetable and meat purees in one steamer/blender. In the product review it stated that the machine can be used for meat and fish. It can't. In the operating manual it says that you can only used ground meat, which I didn't like. I thought that maybe I can cook the meat separately and then put it in the brezza to blend with the veggies. Well, it couldn't do it either. It couldn't handle blending even very soft turkey breast and would quit after several seconds. Having to stand there and hold the button down was also very annoying. I was extremely disappointed with the brezza and wanted to return it, but the seller I got it from wouldn't accept returns once you open the box. Anyway, now I use the brezza only to steam the vegetables. I cook the meats separately and then finish it all in a blender. After 6 months it can't blend even soft vegetables, by the way. So basically I paid a $100 for a vegetable steamer, which you can do in a simple pot.
