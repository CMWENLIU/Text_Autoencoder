If you are a health nut and really don't eat actual cookies, then I guess this would be a treat for you.  And God bless you that you maintain such a wholesome diet.  If you eat cookies, candy and other kinds of junk and are looking for a way to cut down on those things; keep on looking.  This is not chewy or soft and the taste is awful.  Even the few bits of dark chocolate cannot redeem this thing.  Nope, I will not substitute with these ever again.
