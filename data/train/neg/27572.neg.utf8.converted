I bought these "treats" expecting my pup to enjoy an all-natural snack. She did enjoy eating them, but I, alas, was "treated" to an deluge of foulness. Knowing that switching foods can cause an upset stomach, I only gave my hearty, healthy, and athletic canine 1-2 "nibbles" a day.<br /><br />Though I was satisfied with the product's "100% chicken" composition, I was proportionally disappointed by my dog's irregular "nibble-stools" and never-before-seen bathroom accidents inside the house. One such occurrence even took place in my pup's crate, the one place in this world that is sacred for my dog.<br /><br />Thinking,"ah, it must be something else," I performed a series of logical experiments to determine the gastrointestinal culprit; holding all other variables constant over the course of a week or so, I concluded that the treats, though unarguably delicious and well-packaged, had caused my dog's present condition.<br /><br />Wanting to be rid of the canine Metamucil, I passed the treats off to a friend, who later found that her dog had come down with similar issues- noisy stomach, uneasiness, and diarrhea. I quote: "it sounded like he had a pack of wild monkeys in his stomach!" Hyperbole aside, I'm sure that these treats are great for some, many, or perhaps even most dogs. But I would also warn those with pups of particular countenances that "Chicken Nibbles" may, in fact, leave your dog empty rather than full.
