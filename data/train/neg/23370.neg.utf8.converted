this item killed my  mothers cat ( she used the cat drops) this stuff is poison! So not use! Don't believe me? Ask ANY VET! she spend over a thousand dollars trying to save her cat after using this garbage. The vet stated this stuff should be illegal and its poison, they get people in all the time with bad reactions to whatever is in this stuff. Don't risk your pets life just to save some money.
