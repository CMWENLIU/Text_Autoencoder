I took a chance after reading very mixed reviews, and I do not even want to give one star.  My package arrived on time, and was very nicely put together, however the contents were very disappointing.  I expected the 35 K-Cups that I paid for, and only received 21; 15 tea, 4 decaf coffees, and one regular coffee.  Do NOT order from this company, believe the reviews and spend your money elsewhere.
