We purchased the item from Costco and have enjoyed the snack without reading about its origin [individual bars have a lot of attractive information but does not have country of origin].  To replenish our supply I decided to order it from Amazon and for the first time [after reading the reviews] became aware that the food product was made in China. What guarantee is there that the product is GMO free? Are random samples of the food item tested for GMO presence? Is the product manufactured in a facility that does not process non-vegan items?  Who has tested food products from China for presence of heavy metals and other contaminants and is there a continuous testing? The claim is that the product is "all natural" but who has verified that components used are grown on land that is not contaminated with chemicals and heavy metals.  The product is very tasty and we have not suffered from food poisoning but now that I am aware of the country of origin I have grave doubts about the integrity of the product for long term use [bioaccumulation of contaminants and cumulative effects over time] and will look for similar snacks that are made locally [Made in USA]. I have no confidence in food products from China based on available evidence of widespread pollution and contaminated pet food ingredients and baby food.
