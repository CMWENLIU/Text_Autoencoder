I purchased this as a way to save money and make juice at home while buying gift cards to save up and get the Breville Juice Fountain Elite.  I thought perhaps I could slice up and blend fresh fruits and vegetables with a little water added, and strain the pulp out through this rather expensive bag (a paint straining bag would have done the same thing, been much cheaper, and wouldn't have cost anything to ship down at my local Home Depot or Lowes...).  When squeezed, the juice yield is quite low.  I was disappointed in this new thing I decided to try, but it is not the fault of the seller.  The seller provided a fast and smooth transaction, and it was advertised as a "Nut Milk" bag, so maybe the pulp of fruits and vegetables were too much for it to handle.
