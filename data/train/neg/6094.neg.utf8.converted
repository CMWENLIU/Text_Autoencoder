I received my sunflower kernels and started munching a bag of them.  I noticed a slightly "off" taste, so I checked the expiration date, and they had expired almost two months before I ordered them.  Many products are good long past their expiration date and I would not request a refund on food simply because it was expired, but this product did not taste fresh.  I reported the problem to Amazon and they immediately refunded my money.  While the product was not satisfactory, Amazon's service is, as always, first-rate!
