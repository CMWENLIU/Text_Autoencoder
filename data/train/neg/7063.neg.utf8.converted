I found the beans to be of poor quality.  They were packaged in a plastic zipper-sealed bag, not vacuum sealed as I would have expected.  The pods were completely dried out, stiff and flat, not oily and supple as one expects of gourmet quality beans; I was afraid the beans would snap if bent.  There was no oily residue common in good quality vanilla beans.  Getting the caviar out of the pod is going to be tricky in this condition.  The color on the pods is less consistent than I would prefer.  The fragrance, while markedly vanilla, was diluted, likely due to the pods' overly dry condition.  I would suggest that the poor condition of the beans is likely due to the method they were packaged.  Vacuum sealing the beans would have protected them from drying out much better than a plastic bag with a simple zipper seal, which is far from air tight.  The beans are more of extract quality than of gourmet quality.  I am completely unimpressed.
