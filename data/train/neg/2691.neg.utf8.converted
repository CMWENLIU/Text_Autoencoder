Well, it WAS a great product.<br />Campbell's has changed this product and, if you order this, you will receive 12 "NOW EVEN BETTER!" version cans, which have DIFFERENT ingredients and taste DIFFERENT. Why change a product that was getting great reviews and selling well?<br /><br />Maybe to save money? Either way, don't buy this because Amazon will ship you the "NEW" version, which doesn't taste anything like the version we liked before Novemeber / December 2011. Unfortunately, these are also disappearing off grocery shelves, being replaced by the "NOW EVEN BETTER!" labaled cans.<br /><br />Also, Amazon will not let you return these, by default. I'm in the process of requesting an exception, since they sent soemthing other than what is listed, here.<br /><br />__ Don't buy this. Amazon will ship you something different and have been doing so since Novemeber / December 2011 when Campbell's changed the recipe. It isn't better.
