not only is this product from China, but the cans were so badly dented, I could not tell if they are punctured.  The damage did not occur during shipping.  The case inside the shipping box was attempted to be taped up but it was in pieces.  Since I will not feed anything to my dogs from China, I requested a refund.  If I knew that this was a Product of China, I would not have purchased.
