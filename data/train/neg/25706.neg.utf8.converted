The Orville Redenbacher's gourmet popping corn has a great fresh flavor however we find that in our air popper, approximately 20% of the kernels do not get popped.  We have a standard air popper (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a>) and other brands of popping corn have a much higher pop yield.  My wife greatly prefers the fresh flavor of the Orville Redenbacher to store-brand popping corn (stale taste) but she is not happy with the large quantity of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />We are going to try some other brands to see if we can find something as tasty as the Orville Redenbacher  but with a higher yield in our air popper.
