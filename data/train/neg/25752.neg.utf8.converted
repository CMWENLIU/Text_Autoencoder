Perhaps some consider dipping packed rice stick treats in emulsified rawhide enough to label them as "rawhide", but certainly I do not.  I like to give a rawhide stick to my Boston terrier most mornings while I'm getting ready to leave for work so she doesn't get anxious, but she bites these sticks in half immediately and they're gone within seconds!  In my mind, rawhide chews are meant to be gnawed on for at least 10 mins.<br /><br />They also gave her some stomach upset and diarrhea, which no other rawhide product ever has.  The "made in China" label should have made me suspicious immediately.  I'm tossing what's left of the bag and never buying these again.  My hope in leaving this review is that no one else will be fooled by the "rawhide" label.
