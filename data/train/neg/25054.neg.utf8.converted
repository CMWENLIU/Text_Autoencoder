This "lemonade" is worse than the champagne drink called a French 75 I had at Pat O's in the French Quarter that tasted like meat marinade and although I had spent 7 bucks, I poured it out. It tastes worse than that Icee I drank in grade school that unbeknownst to me had a cockroach in the bottom of it. The experience was worse than the time when I was a kid and my dad went to the store to go get apple cider, but he was drunk so he accidentally got apple cider vinegar and I took a big swig and threw up.<br /><br />I don't know if its the stevia sweetener, which I had never had before, or they got a terrible batch of lemons, or what the problem might have been, but this is by far the worst bottled "refreshment" that I have ever had. Never again.
