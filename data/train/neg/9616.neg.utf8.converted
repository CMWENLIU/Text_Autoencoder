I bought this unit on special from Amazon. I have followed the instructions to the letter and after 7 weeks, the only thing that can be harvested is the chives. Dill is doing ok, but looks nothing like the pictures. Basils, mint, parsley and thyme have barely past the sprouting point. I will try one more kit and if this doesn't work it is going in the next yard sale.
