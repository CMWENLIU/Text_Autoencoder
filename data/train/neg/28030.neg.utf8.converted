My dog, a 3-year-old chocolate lab with no history of allergies, had a severe allergic reaction to Sojos and required weeks of treatment to recover from it.  I took my dog to two different vets, both of whom said the change in his food was almost certainly the cause of the illness.  When I took a closer look at the remaining Sojos food I found that it contained bits of wood, twine and bulap sack material.  When I changed my dog back to his old food, the allergy went away.  Sojos refused to admit that their food was the cause of my dog's illness, and refused to refund even the money I had paid them for the food, let alone reimburse me for over the over $700 I spent for veterinary care.  Don't risk your dog's health with Sojos.  If you want to make home-cooked food, ask your vet for a recipe.
