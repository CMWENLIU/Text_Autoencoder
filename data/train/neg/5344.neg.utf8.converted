The Art of Appreciation Grand Edition was a FLOP!  I sent it to my brother for Christmas.  He told me it looked wonderful but there was VERY little there to eat! His wife ate the ONE cookie, they each got ONE truffle.  It was all pretty package and no goodies.  I feel so badly I am going to send them a restraurant gift card!
