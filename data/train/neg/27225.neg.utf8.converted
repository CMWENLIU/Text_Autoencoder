This item has old outdated packaging indicating the product has been around a long time - the Nutrition Facts box on the package doesn't even include a line for Trans Fats but the list of ingredients indicates that the product contains a significant amount of extremely unhealthy trans fats. This stuff should't have been sold. Amazon has dropped the ball here - buyer beware.
