The order arrived in a timely fashion & was well packed including an ice pack to keep the bars from melting.However, I ordred "Chocalate Delight" but received "Cinnamon Bun" instead. Upon reading the ingrediant list my mom discovered that the bars contain hydrogenated palm oil, a transfat. After a call to Russel Stover Candies, whence the bars were shipped we discovered we would have to do a return/exchange through Amazon. Well the bars are tastey & the whole return process seemed too convoluted to deal with so we'll keep them or maybe hand them out on Halloween to bad children.
