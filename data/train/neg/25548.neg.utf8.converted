I review beverages for a living, and wanted an alternative to caffine, decided to go this route, being a huge fan of teas, especially brown rice Japanese teas, this provides no mental clarity, no alert aid, nothing.  I was able to drink a cup with husband before a long treck with the dogs, and I wanted to take a nap....what a waste of 20 bucks, the advertisement is misleading and I truly believe it is cheap green tea in a simple green bag with a label you can have made at any printer to say organic coca....Amazon will be hearing from me after I contacted the seller and they said that it was opened so no return....how else are we going to know if a product is worthless...9.00 for the product and 9.00 for shipping for an ounce of green tea, what a joke...
