Are you familiar with the chemical smell that emanates from the tip of a Sharpie? That's what your water will smell like when you put this in it. No matter how much of this concoction I mixed into my water, it failed to taste like sweet tea. It did have a tea-like taste but I'd put it somewhere between Snapple peach and raspberry teas. If you're a fan of sweet tea just go buy some from the store or make your own; stay far, far away from this stuff.
