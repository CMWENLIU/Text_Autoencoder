This product has more, but not twice as much in the container, however you must use twice as much as other brands of sodium free baking powder when you bake with this brand.  This makes it cost twice as much to use. I would not have bought it if I had known that I had to use twice as much of the product. This product should have stated the fact that recipes needed twice as much of this product as you do other Sodium Free Baking Powder. I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN<br /><br />Amazon Verified Review
