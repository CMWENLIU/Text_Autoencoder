Whats wrong with you amazon? I ordered Comvita honey  asn B002FBD3J2 on Jan 18 and you sent me a bottle from a kiwi kosher parve I never heard of. So i ordered this one as the pic is at least the same bottle I got earlier last  year. Guess what I got today? Same "kiwi" honey with a different label!!! This time it was labelled umf instead of bioactive and a white cap compared to the black one I got from last time! Everything else is the same on the label! How could one legit company use two  mehotds for mesuring its activiy??? Also, there is no expiration date on the bottle!!! WTF???
