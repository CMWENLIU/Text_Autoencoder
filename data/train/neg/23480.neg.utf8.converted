...and I'm not talking about fresh coconut water. Even canned coconut water from Costo is far better.<br />I really don't understand the 5-star reviews. I wonder if these people know what a coconut tastes like.<br />An earlier review mentioned the after-taste. It is closest to stale processed white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />Seriously, if you weren't told that this was coconut water, you'd never guess. It's that bad.<br /><br />If you're near a Costco, go get the canned Foco coconut juice. (12x17.6 oz cans for under ten bucks). At least that one has a semblance of coconut in it. (and is cheaper by the ounce. 160 calories for the 0.52 Liter can - which is not too bad for an 80% juice but it does have added sugar and water)<br /><br />I was going to give it a 2nd star for the low calorie count (so one could add fake sugar to make it sweet), but after looking at the nutritional facts, I don't know what the calorie count really is.... Why? Nutritional facts state 5 calories per serving. No mention of the number of servings in the container. Serving size is 22g, but package weighs 275 g. So that is 12.5 servings (not 25 servings as advertised). So is this 5 calories per ounce of mixed drink or 22g of powder.<br /><br />Bottom line, skip it. Hopefully the pineapple flavored one that should arrive over the next few days will mask the cheese aftertaste.<br /><br />UPDATE: The pineapple flavor does mask the cheesy aftertaste. I'm going to have to mix the original and the pineapple as there's no way I'm going to be able to drink the original one alone...
