I cannot speak for the alcohol versions, but this wine (in contrast to other alcohol-removed products) is very watery. I was unable to detect anything.  I am glad I had obtained this as a gift. It is not something which I would have been proud of purchasing for myself. And I really would not have wanted to serve it to others.
