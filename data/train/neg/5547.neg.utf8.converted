We don't like these at all.  I think the mix has too much baking powder or something, as the pancakes have an odd chemical taste.  If you make a small dice out of a fresh apple, cook it in butter with sugar and cinnamon and fold into the mix before cooking it covers the chemical taste, but who wants to do that with a mix?
