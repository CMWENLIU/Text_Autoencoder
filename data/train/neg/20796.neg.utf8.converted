Granted that the item description doesn't say how many cans were in this order, but the item dimension on the product description was supposed to be 12x9x4 and weighed 6 lbs, shipping weight is 11.4 lbs.  I received one 13.2 oz can that didn't even come close to the dimensions on the product description.  The item I received was 4" high with a diameter of 3" and had shipping weight of 2 lbs on the shipping label.  The shipping box (note: the shipping box not the item) was 10x7x3.5, not even close to the item dimension.  If you own a dog and feed the dog canned food, you would know that one can of wet food is not $24.98.
