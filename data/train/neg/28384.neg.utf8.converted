I love this coffee, but it is now only sold in single servings. I called Nescafe, and they refuse to sell the hazelnut in a canister any longer. This product is over priced at 8.00 dollars more or less, when you consider that there are only 20 servings in the box. I have loved this coffee for 20 years, so the product gets five stars, but the packing gets a zero.
