I love these beans and was excited to find a good price on Amazon. However, when they arrived 9 of the 12 cans were severely dented. The exterior of the package looked fine, but the contents were unusable.<br /><br />Denting can open small holes in a can, so eating food from a dented can is not a good idea.
