With the consistency of Alka-Seltzer and that artificial sugar flavor in the back of your throat, this `Pink Lemonade' variation of the `eboost' product is really no better than what I experienced with the Acai Pomegranate flavor.  On top of that, there really is no boost to be had here (I'm still waiting to experience what others claim to experience).  It feels chalky going down and at times even makes my mouth pucker.  I think I preferred the `barely there' Pomegranate flavor to this one, actually.  I'm all for `all natural', but not if it tastes like this.  I'm sorry eboost, but I'm still not sold on your product.
