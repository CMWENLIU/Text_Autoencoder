I'm sorry I just can't eat this.  It is too thick and chewy and slimy to eat.  I have tried, several times, several different ways. I wanted to like it. It isn't something I will buy again.  I do, however, like the angel hair pasta.  Is is much thinner and is easier to chew and good in soups and oriental dishes.
