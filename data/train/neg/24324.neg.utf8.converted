For all those time you think "this is too good to be true" doesn't it always just so happen to be "too good to be true."  When I searched the "net" for Golden Harvest this is what I got.  The description read exactly like Golden Harvest but when the actual product got to me, it was not Golden Harvest and all the ingredients in Golden Harvest wasn't there.  In all actuallaity, all I got was 8 pounds of couscous and rice. I could have done that myself!
