I have made one cup of coffee and the coffee is disgusting, tastes like cheap instant coffee and after a two second stream of black the rest of the cup brewed out water. I think the 15% restocking fee listed on the invoice is outrageous; this is less than quality coffee you have sent me and it is not my fault it is undrinkable. This is also the census of my entire office and all we drink is K-Cup style coffee here.
