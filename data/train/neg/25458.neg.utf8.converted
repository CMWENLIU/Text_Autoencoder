Our pug (different dog than the one in the other review) has been having trouble gagging and vomiting after having these chews, and so I tried soaking one overnight to see if it got soft after ingestion, and it wasn't soft after 12 hours. Which might explain why our small dog has been having so much trouble. No more of these chews in our house.
