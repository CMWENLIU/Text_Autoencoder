My wife has been on a GF diet for a few years now, and recently our son was diagnosed as well. She found and ordered this product to try out and we all loved the taste right away. I was a little dismayed at the price per bag, but I soon found out that pretty much all GF specialty foods were on the pricey side and I needed to get used to it, especially b/c she had to order most of it online (add S&H).<br /><br />But then they opened up a Trader Joe's right down the street from us this past year and we discovered a near-identical cereal product for half the price!!! Same flavor, same ingredients, same GF assurance...but only $2.99 a bag.<br /><br />They even started carrying this product in our local Kroger grocery stores recently, but it's still $6.99 per bag!!! So no S&H, but you're still paying crazy $$$ for cereal.<br /><br />No contest for us...TJ all the way.
