Bobo's are avabilable at my local organic market and I love them.  For a few cents cheaper, and free shipping, I ordered them from Amazon.  Alas, the produce that arrived had passed it Best By date by two months!  What a disappointment.  I guess I'm better off paying full price for a fresh product.  And naturally food items are non-returnable, even when they are listed as "new" but arrive "old"!!!
