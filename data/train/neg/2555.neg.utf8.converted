I recently received an order of what is purported to be "Finest Grade White Tea, Organic Peony" barcode 8  05715  11629  5.<br /><br />While not an "expert on tea" I lived in East Asia for 10 years and have had considerable experience with Chinese and Japanese teas.<br /><br />Neither the dry nor brewed product have the scent or appearance of true white tea, nor does the tea, when brewed, taste like white tea.<br /><br />The appearance, scent and flavor are more indicative of a reasonably good Chinese "Hong Cha."  Had I bought "Hong Cha" I would be satisfied with it, but white tea sells at a considerably higher price than Hong Cha.  I tried a variety of quantities, temperatures and brewing times.  None resulted in satisfaction.<br /><br />I do not know whether the containers were mis-labled or filled incorrectly, but I am not happy at having bought even a good "hong cha" at the price of "Organic Peony."<br /><br />It has been impossible to contact the Boston Tea Company.  I would not only not recommend this product, I would recommend against buying anything from this company.
