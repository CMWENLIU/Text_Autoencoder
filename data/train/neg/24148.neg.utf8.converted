Water tastes dry to no mineral content. The "energy" was completely unnoticeable. This was just expensive reverse osmosis water.<br /><br />Voss/Peligrino/et al. actually have unique flavors, but this was just expensive because a new age guy says he infused it with his energy. Wish I had known before I bought it. I thought it would be an Italian mineral water based on the name.
