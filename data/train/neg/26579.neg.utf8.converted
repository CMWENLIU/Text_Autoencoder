I bought this formula for my daughter. She has never been picky, and has been on Enfamil formula since she was 6 months old. I tried this toddler formula because she was having some gas pain issues. I made her a bottle and she took one sip and spit it out on the floor. I thought that maybe I had made it wrong so I made another bottle, and she took a sip and threw up. I then tried a sip myself to see what the problem was, and I gagged and had to spit it in the sink. This stuff is so bitter and gross. I can not believe that a company like Enfamil would make such a horrible product. I am really upset I spent the extra money on this stuff and should have stuck to her regular formula. Do not buy this until you try it with your baby first!
