The ideas here are nothing that has not been written before. People who buy these have a closet full of other "pie in the sky" books, videos, and so forth with nothing in their bank account. They sell on their web site for $79.95, but if you look long enough at garage sales, thrift stores, and flea markets for well under $5.00. I bought my copy at a thrift store for $2.00: why? Because after someone got suckered in and listened to it they felt like a fool and anonymously gave it away. Burn your money (you will be further ahead if you burn it instead, because at least you wouldn't have wasted any time listening to it) and pay for it at any price and then come and tell me how well you did and how rich you got any time you care. Right a review on it if you think it's worth anything. So far I haven't seen any stories in the media about anyone super succeeding after buying to these. Where are the good old days when they used to sell fountain of youth water and snake oil?
