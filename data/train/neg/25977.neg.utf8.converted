Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all.
