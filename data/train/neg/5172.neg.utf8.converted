I got the product yesterday.  The bag looked like it was opened and glued back together.  I was very hesitant to open it but my dog is running out of food...  It is just insane to believe that the original EVO packaging is so bad.  It wasn't air-sealed and the top fold looks messy.  Again, it looks like some one roll it and glue it together. (like how we would seal it at home!!)  This is the first time I got such a bad quality dog food product.  VERY disappointed.  And I do demand an explanation if the seller cares about their business!!  I will not recommend this to anyone.
