I give this product two stars because there are no artificial ingredients and it is 75% organic. That is all it has going for it.<br />I'm trying to go "all natural" and "organic" with all my purchases. I saw this for about $5 for the five pack and since the price was comparable to the Velveeta version (which is far from "all natural") I bought it.<br />Stirring the cheese sauce into the leftover water from cooking the macaroni took a few minutes. I did not time it, but it was more than two minutes. My son would not eat it. I made myself a package. It tastes kind of like macaroni with Cheetos powder on it (although I think Cheetos powder would taste better). I wound up melting a piece of organic American Cheese on it and stirring that in to make it palatable.<br />I think I'm going to try to figure out how to microwave a small amount of regular macaroni then melt cheese on it in the microwave to make my own macaroni and cheese.<br />This product was a big fail in my household.<br />This is the first Annie's product that I have tried that I did not like. Before trying this stuff, I was 100% satisfied with Annie's products.
