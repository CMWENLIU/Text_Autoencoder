There has been a continuing problem with this item, Illy box and cans are marked with code "ICS", [S is for "Scurro" Dark Roast].  Box and cans should be marked "ICN" [N for "Normale" Medium Roast].  I've received three different shipments with this problem, each time prompting an Amazon return, a removal of the item from the website until corrected, and then reorder once the correction has been supposedly made [item is again available on Amazon].  If you like the Medium Roast as much as I do, Dark Roast just won't do... CHECK YOUR ILLY BOX AND CANS CAREFULLY [cans stamped up near the opening], YOU MAY NOT KNOW YOU'RE GETTING THE WRONG ITEM!!
