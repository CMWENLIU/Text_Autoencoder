I knew I was in trouble with this coffee as soon as I opened the bag - beans were medium brown and dry, not that dark, lustrous finish I was looking for.  I have tried several coffees from Amazon searching for a less expensive and more politically correct alternative to Starbuck's French Roast - Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster, Rocamojo French Roast, Java Trading Co. Seattle Dark Roast.  The Lavazza was by far the worst of these coffees - weak and tasteless.  Rocamojo French Roast came the closest, but not quite there.  Fogbuster wasn't too bad. Java Trading was in last place until I tried the Lavazza. Should have known better than to buy a grocery store-type bean.  Lesson learned...not too expensive a lesson since it was on promotion.
