These are delicious and i don't buy healthy foods so i don't care about the candy bar comparison. I bought the chocolate ones and always want to eat two. but as other reviewers have stated, they are ridiculously messy. crumbs every where. you have to look in the mirror when your done eating to make sure you don't have chocolate on your face. you must also wash your hands. this is not a granola bar for on-the-go, which is why i buy granola bars in the first place. i have never eaten a granola bar sitting down at a table with a plate and napkin. they are yummy but i think i'd rather have a chewy bar.
