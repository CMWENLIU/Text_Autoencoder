I didn't know what to expect when I received this from the Vine Program.  Having dealt with nausea due to chemo I was hoping it would help with it.  It might would help, but I couldn't get past the taste.....it was very spicy in that it burned my throat.  I used the whole packet in a large mug of hot water.....I may have mixed it too strong or it may be supposed to taste rather spicy.  I'm not familiar with ginger so I really don't know.  I just didn't care for the taste of this product, but I would like to try other of their herbal teas.
