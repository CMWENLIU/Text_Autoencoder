I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats.
