I have to give this product one star is that it should have a warning on its package. The tea contains raspberry leaves, which is considered by some not recommended for first trimesters. Here's my story: After stopping drinking tea for pregnancy, I was looking for a caffeine free tea. When I shopped for maternity pants, I saw this in Motherhood. I bought one and tried it that night. I liked it immediately and drank four glasses of two tea bags. That night, I was shocked to see my weight dropped 3 lbs. I didn't know why and continued drinking this tea until I was out of it in two weeks. I started looking for this tea online and came across a website, where a lady said her doctor didn't recommend it for first trimesters because it could cause contraction. Another website said that the raspberry leaves were considered cause contractions and could cause miscarriage among first trimesters. I then found this tea on Amazon and ordered it, deciding to stop drinking it until I entered 2nd trimester. Unfortunately, at my u/s I was the fetus stopped growing at 3 weeks ago. I looked through the journal, it was the week that I started drinking this tea.  The tea tastes light and refreshing, but it should have printed a warning on its package.
