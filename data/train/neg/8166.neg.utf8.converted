I though I would be good. I am French and le Rougie is not the best but a quality brand. I wanted to test it before my Christmas party. A good thing I did, the box we received was tasteless. I prefer duck foie gras to goose because duck has a stronger taste compared to goose wich is more subtile so I was so disappointed. In the end I ordered a whole duck fois gras made in USA.
