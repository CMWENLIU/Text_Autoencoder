This coffee is ground too coarsely to make decent espresso in either of my two Capresso machines.  I filled the portafilter to the top and tamped as hard as I could, but when I brew the water runs through the filter way too fast.  I get about 3 oz. of coffee in 10 seconds instead the ideal 1 oz. in 25 seconds.  This results in strong coffee instead of actual espresso.  I've tried to make this as regular coffee in a french press as well, but the 70% robusto bean in the blend makes for a pretty bland cup of coffee.
