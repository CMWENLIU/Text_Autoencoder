I have bought vanilla beans for several years for making homemade ice cream.  I always buy from Amazon because the supermarket vanilla beans are usually old and expensive.  I just received my order of these and was very disappointed.  The beans were stiff, not pliable as a good vanilla bean should be.  They did not have an oily feel to them, which is another sign of quality and freshness.  Also, there were less of the seeds that you get from the inside of the bean, which is where most of the flavor comes from, compared to previous purchases I have made. Finally, they did not have a very strong vanilla aroma - no where near as strong as other vanilla beans that I have bought in the past.<br /><br />I just used beans from the last order I bought (well over a year ago) along with these vanilla beans that I just ordered.  The old ones were MUCH better in quality than these new ones despite being quite a bit older.  I always vacuum seal the beans after I use them to help keep their freshness, but the other vanilla beans are still well over a year older than these new ones and were far better in quality.
