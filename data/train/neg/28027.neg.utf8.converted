When will the price of energy drinks stop being so high?  It's ridiculous..and I wish the "phase" would be over so these were actually priced at what they are worth.  I'd have just bought just one to try it if I could but I don't see these around here.  Not a good taste...some-what citrusy but sour and hard to choke down.  I've had many sugar-free energy drinks that actually taste GOOD.  Tiny cans, not much in them but carbonation and some added vitamins..not even that much caffeine.  I tried drinking two at a time..no effect.  I won't be purchasing again.
