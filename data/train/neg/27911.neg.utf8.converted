I LOVE cacao nibs and I so much wanted to love these, as they are a small organic company from Ecuador. I bought these, Navitas and a generic brand, from Peru at my local food store to compare. Compared to the other 2 these were of terrible quality, both in appearance and taste. They look washed out, and don't have the fresh, sort of oily look that the other raw organic cacao nibs I bought had and are much smaller pieces. They are about half the six of others on average and the bag included much of what I would call cacao nib powder. Their taste is less pungent and their texture a bit dry, less cool and crispy than others. The biggest problem with them is that the bag is FULL of shells, which are not chewable, and must be picked out. You cannot eat them in crunchy delicious handfuls at your desk.... or even pour them into a recipe. Actually, you have to meticulously inspect each small group of them for shells, which are hard to tell from these super small nibs. Anyway, for the best quality I would go with Navitas or another brand that you can see in person before you buy. From my experience if they look good they are good! I hope this helps.
