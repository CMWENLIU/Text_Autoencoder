I did not like this coffee.  I was excited to try it given all the great reviews.  However, it was either too weak or too strong and strange tasting.  I made two cups of coffee and had to put more than 3 tsps of grounds in to make it not weak.  However, when I did this the coffee had a strange taste.  I would not recommend this coffee.
