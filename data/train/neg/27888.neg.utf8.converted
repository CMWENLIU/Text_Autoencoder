The sampler pack included with my Keurig included Green Mountain dark magic extra bold which was the best coffee in the pack. I bought Timothy's thinking it might be a cheaper equivalent. Have to say I've been disappointed. I'm struggling to get through one box and if I could return the other half of the two-pack I would. Newman's Own is better but I'll have to save my pennies for Green Mountain.
