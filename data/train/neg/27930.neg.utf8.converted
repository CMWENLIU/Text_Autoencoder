My roommate purchased this for our household. First batch we made was sour. I thought it was a fluke since it had gotten such good reviews. I made a few more batches but all the coffee brewed from this brand was really sour - to a point that it was undrinkable. Maybe we were unfortunate to get an unfresh bag. It's was a waste of 2lbs of coffee beans.
