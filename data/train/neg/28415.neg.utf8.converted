This is an awful product. It leaves sand in your food and bottom of cooking pans after boiling something. Why there are so many 'excellent' reviews leaves me wondering...Who's really behind these reviews? Granted it may be "Natural & Organic" but so is dirt. I do not think there are THAT many folks who love to eat grit!
