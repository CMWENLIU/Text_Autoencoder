Firstly, I've used this product with both my younger sons and have never had any problems with it.  We started it on the advice of our pediatrician to use as a supplement because he suspected my son had acid reflux and it worked as a charm!<br /><br />Secondly, I find that the smaller containers are better since you are meant to finish it within I think a week after opening, which means that you are better off with the smaller container, depending on how much your child eats obviously, but even price-wise it's smarter.<br /><br />Thirdly, and I know this may not apply to everyone, but it is Kosher and DAIRY FREE (Parve), which is VERY VERY VERY hard to find in formula, which pretty much makes this an only choice for many special need kids, or even many who aren't special needs but need formula that isn't dairy.<br /><br />And finally, I am surprized that [...] prices are actually higher than all the local groceries, [...], etc.  I hope they bring their prices down so that all of us can happily buy it from them in the future.
