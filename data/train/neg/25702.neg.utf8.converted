Dear Consumers,<br />If you purchase thise product, you are paying about 50 cents more than stores. No one is selling this particular can of tuna in the market for more than 2 dollars a can (which is what this comes out to) and you can get it most places for less than $1.50 a can. Even with the "so-called discount" you are getting ripped off like you can't believe. Wait until they get a better provider to give us a REAL discount.<br />Thanks
