This is the second, and last, time I will buy coffee from amazon.com.  The first time, I received a bag of coffee that had been out of date for months.  This time, it's still stale, but without a use-by date on the bag.  So much for trying to save some money and time.  I'll go back to making the trek to Whole Foods.
