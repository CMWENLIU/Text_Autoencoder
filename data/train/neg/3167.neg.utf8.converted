BRM 'gluten free' items still contain some sort of gluten cross contamination.  We started SCD/GAPS to deal with lingering health problems caused by eating a regular GF diet for our Celiacs.  I bought 2 different brands of almond flour, one made specifically for and by SCD and BRM.  We used up the other brand and started using the BRM and guess what?  ALL symptoms of Celiac started coming back!!  Doing an Internet search I did find out that many Celiac's not only react badly to BRM almond flour, but to many other of BRM GF items too.  Before SCD, we had stopped using any BRM GF baking products because we always got 'gluten sick ' from them.  We will NEVER use another  GF flour from BRM again because their food safety is just not strict enough.  I did get a prompt refund from BRM for the $125 I spent on the 25lb box of almond flour though.
