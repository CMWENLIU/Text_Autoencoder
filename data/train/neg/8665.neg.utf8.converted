I love mincemeat.  My grandmother made mincemeat.  I make it now myself.  This is not mincemeat.  This is disgusting.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients in Crosse & Blackwell's "mincement," in order of volume, according to the label:  apples, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, raisins, water, vinegar, corn starch, and then trace elements of orange peel, salt, spices, caramel color, orange juice, and preservatives.  (As an aside, what on earth is the purpose of that orange juice, which exists in less quantity than the caramel color. )<br /><br />In other words, this concoction is apples, drenched in high-fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup, with a few raisins.  Lord knows what the "spices" were, because they could scarcely be distinguished under the sickly aftertaste of corn syrup.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients from a recipe for real mincemeat, again in order of volume:  apples, raisins, beef (for those who like it), sultanas, currents, sour cherries, citrons, sugar, strawberry preserves, apricot preserves, orange peel, lemon peel, spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, allspice), salt.  This mixture is marinated in liquor - rum, brandy, sherry, apple jack, or whatever additional or alternative liquor you may enjoy.  Our family's recipe calls for these things; other people use different fruits, most omit the meat, some use juice and vinegar instead of liquor.  But the result, in any case, is rich, spicy, complex and delicious.<br /><br />Or, if you prefer, you may have Crosse & Blackwell's canned apples with high-fructose corn syrup.
