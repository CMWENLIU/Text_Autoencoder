This is the second brand of canned or bottled truffles. Firstly, what type of gadget gets this can to open? I had to use an old fashioned beer can opener which left me with the problem of fishing out the little truffles through a jagged opening. When I finally succeeded, chopped the truffles, and put my nose close to them, there was hardly any aroma. After adding them to the risotto I was making, there still was not much truffle perfume. This is a better quality truffle than the previous brand I'd bought. You actually could get that almost garlic like undertone to the truffle.<br />I've pretty much decided that for a home cook, truffle infused oil of good quality is the way to go. You don't get the full spectrum of the truffle aroma, but what's there is quite intense.
