I soak black beans overnight and use a pressure cooker to cook them. I've had very poor results with this brand time after time. Some beans are overcooked and mushy while others are undercooked and crunchy. I've tried different soaking times and different cooking techniques with the pressure cooker and always end up with beans that aren't evenly cooked. I've had other brands cook up just fine, so the only thing I can think is that the issue is with this particular brand.
