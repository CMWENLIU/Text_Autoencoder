This product, while possibly satisfactory for some, was not as represented.  I had searched for 100% Dutch process cocoa, and that was what I thought I was gettuing.  Wrong!  This  product is a blend of natural and Dutch process cocoas.  The description is misleading.  I have written a letter to Customer Service about this, but my hopes for a good result are not high.  Apparently because this a food item, even though none of the cans was opened, it is not a returnable item.  I'm not a happy camper!
