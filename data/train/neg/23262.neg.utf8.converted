[...]<br /><br />In this study, we have compared the glucose response over 3 h after ingestion of a 50-g CHO portion of the Dreamfields product with the same dry weight CHO of a traditional commercially available pasta. A crossover design was used. Two groups of five subjects each, i.e., 10 subjects total without known diabetes, were recruited for the study. They were not aware of which pasta product was being served. Regarding taste as well as mouth feel, our results confirmed the Dreamfields company claim. All subjects agreed that they could not detect a difference between the Dreamfields product and the traditional pasta. Both were considered to be highly acceptable. When the first five subjects were studied using the same cooking method for both products, the Dreamfields pasta did not result in a smaller glucose rise. To our surprise the mean postmeal glucose curves were essentially identical. Therefore, we studied five different subjects. The result was the same; that is, the curves were essentially identical (Fig. 1). In 10 people without diabetes, the Dreamfields pasta product we purchased did not result in an improved glucose excursion when compared with a commercially available traditional pasta product as would have been expected based upon the company's claim. Because we did not test several different batches of Dreamfields pasta or other commercially available pasta products for comparison, it is possible that different results would be obtained in other studies.
