First thing I must say is the cutover service is great. Lillianna and Nancy are very nice (the fact that I know there names is redic). However, as much as I wanted this product to work! After my 2nd machine and my 3rd bowl I'm giving up. Nancy asked for another shot (this is not the first time she's asked) but this time I declined. I wanted to give them a shot I really did but there have been way to many errors, so I thought you all should know. I am a big review person so I had to put this out there.<br /><br />We bought our machine directly from their site. First machine out of the box tiny plastic piece on bowl lid BROKEN. Get a new bowl. Finally get to use the machine, water leaks EVERYWHERE and after steaming no blending happening. A new machine arrived. 1st use - steam but no blend again, but no water yay lol. I gave it another shot, worked good. Yesterday, couldn't get my blade off and drive shaft was stuck. Now, at this point i have 3 bowls sitting around - but I was just TIRED of this machine.<br /><br />READ THIS PART @ LEAST:<br />This machine has a great concept, steam and blend all in one without going back to hit another button - perfect, I thought, until I got the manual. There is actually only about 5 foods that you can actually do this with!!! (i wish i would have known this) All the others have water issues. So for instance, I think it was apples, they have too much water after steaming so you have to go and strain the water before blending...so whats the point? Along with this when you blend manually you have to stand there and hold the button in! I've decided I'm not that lazy and I can go back and hit a steam button - but I am a multitasked so standing over the machine to hold the button in, well, sucks!<br /><br />Taking it apart and getting the blade out is rather difficult (and as u can see from above sometimes the darn thing doesn't even come out). My mind always slipped and i wanted to get my food out of the bowl - but to take the blade out it needs to be attached to the base, so I would have to put it back on and get the blade out.<br /><br />Also, difficult to put the bowl back on the base @ times. The gaskets have to be lined up or there is no luck.<br /><br /> I am using filtered water and I am still getting mineral deposits in the water tank after first use, hmmm?<br /><br />Overall, too many flaws, too many manufacturing errors, time to buy a beaba. Sorry Breeza, I wanted to love you.
