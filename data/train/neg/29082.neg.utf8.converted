The product itself is awesome. I had been eating a can everyday, Sun-Fri for over three years (a case has 24, so 4week x 6days).<br /><br />I started the subscription to Amazon Jan of 2011 in order to save money. The price had always been 24.50, except July 12, 2011 where it was only 23.15.<br /><br />In May 2012 I went on Amazon to see when my next shipment was scheduled to ship. At that time it was still 24.50. Less than 7 days later I went on Amazon to get an early shipment and to my shock the price had almost doubled!!!<br /><br />I can understand the price going up a couple cents, even a couple dollars - but going up 15.28 overnight, for a 24.50 item, is insane!<br /><br />Needless to say, I haven't ordered any since!
