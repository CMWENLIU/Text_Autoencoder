I am a health food nut. I discovered dried mangos in my local nature/organic food store. They were bulk quantity by the scoop around 9-10/lb. I LOVED THEM so much and soo much healthier as a substitute for a sweet snack, that I wanted to find a better price. After reading reviews about this brand I went to Costco and bought the 30 ounce bag... HERE ARE MY THOUGHT<br /><br />IT CANNOT EVEN COMPARE TO THE NATURAL literally RAW pieces of dried Mango in the organic store WITH NO ADDITIVES!!!! We are talking about DRY pieces of real fruit<br /><br />This AS I SUSPECTED (but nevertheless bought the bag) IS MORE LIKE CANDY!!!!<br />Ingredients list: Dry Mango, SUGAR, Sulfur Dioxide (for preservative)<br /><br />The pieces of mango are COATED with something like powdery SUGAR!!! It is very sweet. 31g of Sugar per serving of ~42g. ALSO the inside part is sort of still juicy EXACTLY LIKE A CANDY. And dont get me even started on the Sulfur Dioxide. I bought grapes that said: "Treated with SO2 PLEASE RINSE THOROUGHLY!!"<br /><br />SO HOW DO I RINSE THIS MANGO!!!<br /><br />SUMMARY: If you want candy-like stuff, buy it. GREAT PRICE. If you want REAL RAW amazing dry mango with no sugar and no chemicals go to a organic health store. My store recently had a sale I got 3 pounds at 7$, which is just as low as the costco one. I will finish this bag that I bought from Philippines and never buy it again.<br /><br />P.s. My first amazon review JUST because I knew that I will be tricked into getting this candy but went ahead anyway to prove my initial worries.
