i got so excited that when i found "pemmican" on amazon that i just bought it and didnt read.  yes it my fault that i didnt fully read the ingredients.. but when you advertise something as pemmican, shouldnt it contain dried meat and rendered fat?  this has no meat, no fat, and is not even gluten free.  what a disappointment.
