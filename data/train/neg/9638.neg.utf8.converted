This could have been so cool! What an awsome idea! I loved it at first and it worked great, at least for the herbs. The problem is that after just three crops, the pump gave out. But what can you expect when the pump is essentially the same size as an oversized postage stamp? Total rip-off...(and btw,I DID thoroughly clean it and get the stray roots out of the filter so don't blame the failure on lack of maintenance)<br /><br />If you're interested in a small hydroponic garden for the kitchen, I would suggest searching around for some quality units.<br /><br />-johnvisnaskas@yahoo.com
