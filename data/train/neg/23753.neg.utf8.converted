I'm new to gluten free baking, but I really liked this brand, and thought it was a good choice rather than having to buy 4 different kinds of flour for one recipe. Boy was I wrong! I made a batch of pumpkin cookies with this. The consistancy was fine, but the taste was FOUL! Someone else called the taste toxic, and I think that sums it up well. I even tried to make another batch of different cookies to make sure it wasn't something else that was wrong. More horrible cookies...more wasted ingredients. Do not buy this for baking, you'll only end up wasting your time and money.
