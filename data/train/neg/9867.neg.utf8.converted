I had read reviews for this before and somehow missed the fact that it had sucralose in it. Ugh. I made it and it smells great, tastes great, and all things considered it probably is very good if you can tolerate sucralose, but unfortunately I can't, even if it's the last ingredient listed (which it is on this). Why they added it is beyond me, but I'd wish they'd make a version without it.
