Bought this gum as an impulse buy, not knowing anything about the bad reviews here, and was hit by the same awful aftertaste problem!  I searched the internet on my own for "trident citrus blackberry aftertaste" and ended up here at Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, the aftertaste didn't taste like tomato to me; it tasted more like... something disgusting that I'm too polite to mention here.  I'll give you "2" guesses, if you catch my drift.  I'm not exaggerating.
