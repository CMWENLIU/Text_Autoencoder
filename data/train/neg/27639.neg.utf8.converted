Well, these capsules are sold by Top Line and just fulfilled by Amazon.  Top Line, shame on you... You are reselling a product way above its MSRP.  Capitalism in action.  The only authorized place to buy these capsules is directly from Nespresso.  I wonder if the capsules are out of date???<br /><br />Now, the coffee is 5 stars.  This price... Incredible.
