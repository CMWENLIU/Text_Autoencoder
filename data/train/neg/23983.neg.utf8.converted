Yes, that is correct. I buy many things on amazon, and 99 percent of the time it is good. I checked the code on bottom of the can and it was made in 2000. As I writing this it is 04/08/2011. Olive oil does not get better with age in a tin can. I went on the zoe website to see how to read the code on the bottom of the can. On the zoe website click on blog at the top right hand side. It had on my cans the l= lot number, 00= year olive oil was made. I called Amazon right away to report this to them, and explained where I found this information. They agreed with me and issued me a complete refund. I don't blame Amazon for these old olive oil cans, but I do blame Zoe (New York City based Company). They supply Amazon, nationwide and slipped some old stock through thinking no one would notice. Guess what I'm from New York City , I know how these guys operate. Zoe may be good Olive oil , but check the codes often. You can find the code information on any Company website.
