This is something I purchase regularly and thought I might want to buy on Amazon in bulk. It's a good product, but if this is really only one pack of two one-serving cups of rice, the price is three times what every supermarket I've been to charges for it. Seriously, this is available everywhere. What is the deal with the price???
