I like rich, bold coffee.  I have been buying coffee through Amazon, the Keurig site, Costco, and even in a grocery store when I run low.  I am searching for the best cup for my taste.  Neumann's own is the best so far.  This sampler was appealing as a way to try many bold K cups without commiting to much to one brand.  What I failed to do was recognize the price which was almost $1 per k cup (twice as much as other purchases) and realize the sample pack would include decaf (which I did not want).  Next time I will not let my impulse cost me.
