I'm a big fan of oatmeal; Quaker oatmeal, in fact. I like most of their stuff, and have never had any bad experiences with any of it.<br /><br />When I saw the Oatmeal to Go bars, I thought that they looked like a quick, easy, and healthy snack.....which they may be, if you can get past the horrible taste and texture. I've since been trying to give these things away to my co-workers, but everyone takes one bite, and then gies me a funny look and then a "no thanks".
