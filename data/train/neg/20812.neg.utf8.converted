This has an artificial-sweetener aftertaste.  It also seems to have an alcohol-like flavor, as if I am adding an alcohol based axtract instead of something made with water.  I have yet to try my strawberry and orange of the same brand, but the chocolate is definitely not worth trying to save money by purchasing this brand (go for sweetleaf, it doesn't taste like a 'diet' sweetener).
