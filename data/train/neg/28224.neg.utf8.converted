This decaf green, like every other brand I've tried so far, is not green in color and is missing that light, fresh, "green" flavor of a good caffeinated Japanese-style tea.  I'd say it is actually a bit smoky, sort of like a Chinese-style green tea, which is not what I'm looking for.  I like smoky green teas, like Hojicha, but I don't like that flavor in plain green tea.  I've drunk green tea my whole life and tried many kinds from restaurants, groceries and Asian markets, and this one just doesn't do it for me.  It was surprising given the glowing reviews at Amazon that influenced my decision to buy it.  So far Stash's decaf has been the best, but I'll keep searching for better.
