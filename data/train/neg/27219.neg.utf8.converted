When I ordered I knew they were mini pouches, but expected something more than what I got for twelve dollars.  If you were going to compare it to regular halloween candy bags, this would be on the small side.  I wouldn't expect to pay more than four dollars for something this small.  The kids will eat the pop rocks and love them, but the price was way too high.
