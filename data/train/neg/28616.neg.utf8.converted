I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small "made in Thailand" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)
