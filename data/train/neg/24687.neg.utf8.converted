I have been buying a different brand of this treat for my dog and she just loves them and they are a much better treat than just a plain biscuit. I purchased 4 containers, 2 chicken and 2 duck with yams. No more than 2 days later they were moldy. When I contacted the company explained they knew it was a problem and have changed the ingredients to prevent the mold as it could cause upset stomachs in dogs consuming them. When I asked them to replace what they knew was a dangerous product, I was told to take it up with the seller. Not very friendly as they are responsible for the "known" problem treats.I did contact the seller to explain they had a potential problem and the were more than nice and sent me 4 new jars.....hopefully the good kind. ;-)
