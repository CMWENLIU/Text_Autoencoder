I purchased these candy bars to give as little gifts to thank people who took a Salvation Army Angel card at our annual "Spirit of Christmas" concert. When I was putting decorations on the bars, I noticed the bars had expired. I am assuming the company sent them at the end of the month of expiration so they were "legal"...but, by the time, I gave them to people on the 11th of the following month, they were expired. It could have caused the orchestra a lot of grief. I will not do business with them again.
