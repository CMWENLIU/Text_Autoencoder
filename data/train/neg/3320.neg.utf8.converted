I love illy coffee. I think it is among the finest in the world. I even enjoy illy iced coffee in the can--but not this version. It tasted like bland epresso mixed with nonsparkling seltzer. Only 50 calories but I wIsh they added more calories if it meant this would be tastier. Not sweet at all. Sorry illy. It is a miss.
