These are made in China (do not buy ANY pet food from China).  Dogswell has been using propylene glycol to soften their treats (what are they thinkng?).  Do not purchase or support this company in any way until they clean up their act.  And for whatever reason Amazon doesn't allow returns of this item, so I had to toss mine out.  Bad business all around on this one.
