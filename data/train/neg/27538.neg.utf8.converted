This truffle puree product really lacked the strong truffle flavor i was expecting.  I did not understand why, when they are sold in packs of three (25g x 3), the recipe attached, although i did not use, asked for 200g of truffle puree.  (That would mean 8 tubes of puree).  I would stick with whole truffles in it's juices over the truffle puree.
