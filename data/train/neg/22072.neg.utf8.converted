I had high hopes for this only to be VERY let down. I've had the Lavazza "Super Crema" (blue bag) and it was pretty good. This "Crema e Aroma" is some of the worst espresso beans I've tasted. The cream is decent but the flavor is thin and sour. I've tried different grinds, water temps, tamps, etc... nothing helps. I have been making espresso at home for 10 years using high-end consumer equipment so I know how to make good espresso... these beans are very lightly roasted, versus most beans I've used, and very dry out of the bag. Maybe the trip from Italy kills the beans? Either way, if you like good espresso... better than Starbucks quality, stay away from Lavazza Crema e Aroma.
