The best part about this product is that it is made from American-grown fruit...other than this, it is disappointing.  First, the containers aren't exactly as pictured (no round screw-on cap, just a carton), which was only important to my son.  Secondly, the containers are very small (only 4 inches tall), so the entire pack hardly seems worth the cost.  As for the taste, the nuggets are very sweet, and I was sick of them before the container was empty.  Finally, if you're trying to avoid corn syrup, don't buy this product, as it contains corn syrup (and extra sugar).  Overall, I was disappointed by this odd product by a quality company.  We're switching back to Cliff Kid fruit twists.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />While the front of the cartons state "Made from American Grown Fruits" the bottom of the carton reads "Made responsibly in CHINA"!!  Seriously?  They grow the fruit in the US, ship it to China for processing, and ship it back to the US to be sold to consumers?<br /><br />Shame on Florida's Natural for their deceitful advertising.  In my opinion, people concerned about buying products made/grown in the USA do NOT want these products processed in China.  Way to support the American economy, Florida's Natural.
