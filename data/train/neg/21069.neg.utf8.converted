I purchased 3 boxes based on the 5-star reviews and am very disappointed in the quality. I have a Hamilton Beach pod coffee maker for work and when brewed the coffee looks like weak tea. I have to pour the coffee back in the coffee pot and brew again just to have a mediocre cup of coffee. Very disappointed in this brand and will not buy again.
