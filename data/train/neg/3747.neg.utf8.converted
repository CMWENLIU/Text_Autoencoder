Overall, I cannot recommend this machine.<br /><br />The machine made excellent espresso for the first few weeks we had it.  Once it was broken in, the espresso was average, and the crema was more of a large-bubbled foam.  The grinder is able to create a fine grind, but unfortunately the machine can't pass any water through it, so you have to use a mid-level fine grind.  The machine is able to adjust the amount of water used per shot, but anything more than the smallest available setting creates, well, coffee.  Not even an Americano, just coffee.<br /><br />After three months the grinder broke.  When I opened up the machine's door a broken part flew out.  Amazon sent me a new one.  One month in on the new one, the brewgroup jammed.  I thought it was broken, but after four days, the machine was able to pry itself loose.  Ground coffee was all over the brewgroup, as if it had exploded.  We'll see how it works out.<br /><br />A bright spot--Amazon was astoundingly helpful and gracious.  They replaced the first one, postage payed, express delivery, with no questions at all.  They offered to refund the original purchase price on the second one, until it broke loose and started working again.  I cannot complement them highly enough!
