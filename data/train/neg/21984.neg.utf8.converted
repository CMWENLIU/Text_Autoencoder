I really wanted to like this product.  The taste and quality of the properly sealed items are outstanding.  However, 2 of the bars in my box were moldy, within sealed packaging.  White mold visibly present upon opening the packaging.  I contacted the Tanka company and never received a response.  They claim 100% satisfaction in their product yet don't seem to respond to complaints.  I am less than satified with my money being wasted and no response from the company.
