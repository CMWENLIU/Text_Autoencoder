The initial putrid scent is much abated by rinsing the noodles before use.  However, that is not the cause of this low rating.  The noodles are a nice attempt to bring low or no calorie foods into a restricted calorie or restricted carb diet.  The taste is quite plain and it takes to a sauce well.  However, within a few bites, I had to throw them all away, as I felt like I was eating rubber and it became increasingly thusly disgusting in texture.  I don't mean a good rubbery texture like chewing gum, I mean like something you wouldn't want to ingest or even chew on. I am a fan of many popular diet foods and don't like to waste food, but I couldn't swallow this and ended up wasting it, dumping into the trash.
