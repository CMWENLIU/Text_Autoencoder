Hey, I'm just a middle aged guy who by disciplining his food intake and hitting the treadmill every day is trying not to become a big fat bloated parody of himself and maybe live a little longer too.<br /><br />I drink a lot of nutritional "shake" canned beverages.  I want to stay slim, but sometimes I need to eat fast.  I thought I'd compare the nutritional content of my canned shake of choice with the nutrition that this shake provides to athletes.<br /><br />My shake of choice lists 23 items in the nutritional table at the bottom.  This product lists 15 items.  In cases where both nutrients appeared in the table, my shake had more of those nutrients than this one, with the exception of Vitamin C, where they both had 100 percent.<br /><br />My shake has 10 grams of protein, and this shake has 20 grams.  Score one for Gatorade!  Both shakes have about the same amount of potassium.  My shake has 23 grams of carbs including 5 grams of fiber.  The Gatorade shake has 56 grams of carbs.<br /><br />So, I must conclude that athletes need way more sugar than I do, and way less vitamins.  Oh yeah, both cans contain exactly the same amount of product.<br /><br />Finally, there's something creepy to me about marketing a "shake" in a dark green can.  Ever had any kind of "shake" that was dark green?  Remember all those algae shakes you had when you were a kid?  Well, neither do I.
