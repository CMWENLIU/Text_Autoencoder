I purchase a lot of goods from Amazon, including bulk groceries. The corn is a fine product, but the cans are another story. Out of 2 cases, I was only able to save 7 cans. The rest were horribly dented or caved in and went in the trash, as no one else wanted them. I do not eat food from dented cans due to the failure of lining or seal. Yes, a couple cans dented at the seal actually leaked, meaning bacteria could also get in. Unfortunately, the cans were packaged in this unacceptable condition from the factory. Shame on Libby's for poor quality control. I will no longer buy canned goods online.
