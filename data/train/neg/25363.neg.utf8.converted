I purchased 2 of these to kill off some white fly I have on 3 hibiscus trees that are now inside my house for the winter.  Four weeks have gone by and no progress.  I even added one more to each pot than what was suggested on the product directions.  There's still plenty of white flies - and I'm extremely disappointed.  Would not recommend.
