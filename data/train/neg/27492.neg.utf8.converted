I was hoping for a nice creamy cappuccino for the evenings or during the day where a strong brew wasn't needed.  Well, *some* coffee flavor would have been good.  This tastes like coffeemate plus sugar plus old coffee grounds.  Its flat, sweet, thin, and ends with something of a slightly bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of aspartame...  with nothing in between.  There's not even a filter inside the k-cup...  just mostly cheap creamer...
