I'm a big fan of Larabars in general and have been eating them for years. I've liked almost every flavor, though of course some are bigger hits with me than others. I really like the cherry pie, not so much the pecan pie or cashew cookie. Honestly the blueberry muffin is the first one I've tried where it was so gross I couldn't even finish it! It doesn't taste like blueberry at all, just kind of like weirdly sour and mushy cashews. Maybe I got a bad bar, but I will never try this flavor again unless someone could assure me they normally taste better. It was really so bad I couldn't even choke it down.
