After reading so many good reviews, I felt compelled to buy this product. And man, it was horrible. First of all, they should really display prominently that this is not tea. It's some kind of tea flavored beverage.<br />I took a look at the used k-cup and it was completely empty. I would have expected some tea grounds left in there if it was real tea.<br />Also, it left a bad taste of artificial sweetener left in my mouth. Why couldn't they use real sugar? Or couldn't they mention that on the label also? Actually, it would have been better to not put in any sweetener and let the consumer add it themselves.<br />Upon further review of the ingredients, I also see partially hydrogenated oil. Yeeech...<br />Anyway, I must be in the minority on this one, but just so people know. I'd suggest you try it at a friend's place first before drop $12-18 on a box of fake tea.<br />I've had good results with some of the real tea that they sell in k-cups but this one was a dud.<br />By the way, I have a nearly new box of Cafe Escapes Chai Latte if anyone is interested in buying it at a discount!!  ;-)
