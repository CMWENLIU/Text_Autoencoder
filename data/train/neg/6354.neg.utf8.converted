I found this tea very bland when brewed normally (1 tsp per 8oz boiling water for 5 mins). When I tried adding more tea, the flavor was distinctly "barn-like". Sort of like moldy hay. I am very disappointed in this tea overall and will not order it again.<br /><br />It is a shame because the price was nice! But you get what you pay for I suppose, and I will stick to ordering higher-quality teas from other vendors.
