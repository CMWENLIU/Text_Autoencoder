I was in whole foods in Seattle Washington and saw this gumbo for sale. Being a Louisiana native, I know what good Gumbo tastes like. I am no fool, I knew if I purchased Gumbo in a jar it would not be nearly as good as homemade Gumbo. I was utterly shocked at how bad it actually was. It had such an overbearing taste (I think it was bay leaves or Okra) that it ruined the entire gumbo. I fed this to 2 others in my household and they had the same thoughts. I never waste food, and I even tried to reheat it and eat it the next day....it promptly went in the trash. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it was so bad that I had to look it up online and see if others had the same experience!
