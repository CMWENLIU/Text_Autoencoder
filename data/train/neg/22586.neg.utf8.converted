The picture is very deceptive - you only get 1 container of coffee and I had assumed it was 2. Yes, I should have checked more closely, but I assumed that for the price I was paying I would get 2 containers of coffee. Grocery stores charge at most $5 for one of these, so don't waste your money buying this product.
