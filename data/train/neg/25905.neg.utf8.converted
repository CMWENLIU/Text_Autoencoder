While this product works with many others I know, it doesn't work for me at all. The only reason I cite that stands out for me is I eat healthy, I maintain an active lifestyle and I get enough of rest, so in the mid afternoon when I have the 5 Hour energy drink, I still feel sleepy and I can sleep through it without feeling energetic (I work out in the morning). I'd love to hear comments from others who do have a healthy, active (vagan) lifestyle and still find this energy drink valuable.
