I've ordered Greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them. I sent the first one back and won't see my money for 4-6 weeks. Guess I have to do the same yet again. Spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they aren't going to expire before you can use them. I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.
