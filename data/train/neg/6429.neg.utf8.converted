I've read all the reviews of this product and I feel I must add my name to the chorus of negative reviews on the new recipe.  I can't express how disappointed I was with the new recipe.  I started eating dark chocolate about 12 years ago.  I started with sharffen berger which is quite good chocolate.  I tried various brands.  I wanted the healthy dark but wasn't interested in eating 85% because I wanted to balance flavor with health.  That is where the old recipe of this 70% bar was perfect at.  It tasted better than the Sharffen berger to me and every other bar I had tried.  Now they take this wonderful bar and ruin it for poorly thought out reasons.  I still had a bar of the old when the new came out and I did a blind taste test in my family of four.  All thought the old was better than the new.  So Lindt's marketing machine is doing itself a great disservice by continuing to perpetuate the lie that most people actually like the new recipe.  Note that in my grocery store I can still find the 1.2 oz bars as of August 2011 that are labeled Intense dark.  These bars are still made in france and have no soy products in them (although they say it may contain "traces" of soy beans but all chocolate products say that due to the factory environment in which they are made).<br /><br />For me at least money is no object for this purchase and I'm not rich.  Just trying to prioritize good food over other things in my life.  I would gladly pay the higher price if the exchange rate was the issue or if the ingredients were the issue.  The bottom line is the new recipe is horrible.  Don't purchase if you like chocolate.  If you like wax just buy a candle and eat that.
