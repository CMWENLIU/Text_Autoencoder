I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much, that fast, would be laughed out of business. This is is shameful. Get these prices in line, Amazon (or, if Worthington's responsible, get them to get their prices in line or drop the product).<br /><br />As far as the product? It was dropping in quality, anyway. It had gotten much slimier and, simultaneously, a strong grainy taste started overpowering the rest of the flavors (sort of like skunky beer).
