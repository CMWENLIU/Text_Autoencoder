Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.
