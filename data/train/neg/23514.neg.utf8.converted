I bought this tea and was very much looking forward to it. I love the flavor of "normal" Chai tea, and was expecting this to be similar.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />First off, the good. It was delivered in a timely manner. Great service. It was packaged much better than I thought. From the picture you expect to get brown paper bag full of leaves. What is actually received is a food grade, thick plastic-lined paper bag. The bag also has a zip-lock like sealer. Very nice.<br /><br />I didn't open the shipping box for a day or so and didn't notice any aroma. Once the outer box was opened it hit me like a mac truck. This tea is VERY fragrant!<br /><br />Now, alas, for the bad. As other reviewers noted, this blend leans heavily on the cinnamon. In fact, I would say that it doesn't lean toward cinnamon, it buries all other flavors under a wave of cinnamon. I've just brewed and drank my first (and probably last) cup of this tea. It hurts my throat, the spice is so heavy. I tried diluting it with both milk and water, but the pain persists.<br /><br />I failed to note any Chai seasoning in the cup I drank. I do not plan on reordering this product.<br /><br />In closing, if you are considering purchasing this tea, be aware that you will be drinking liquid red-hots. If that's your thing, more power to you.
