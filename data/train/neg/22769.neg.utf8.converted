Has anyone else noticed?  This mix is NOW being shipped without any alfalfa, and with only 8% radish---thus mostly devoid of its zesty components.  Doing so borders on inadvertent fraudulence, methinks.  Oh well, I betcha these four mixed pounds of mostly clover will mostly sit high up in the cupboard, degerminizing, becoming my lifetime supply of Bland Blend Sprouts, then passed on to my young'uns to enjoy in their tasteless years. Or next spring perhaps I'll sow a radish-speckled new lawn.
