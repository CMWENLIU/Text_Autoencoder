Sounded fantastic...and would have been great stocking stuffers for a family who enjoys nori snacks. However, the box arrived already open...hard trip, I suppose! But I was still hopeful! then I opened 3 different individual packages and they were a slimy mess- snack escaping it's once sealed tray in each one. Ok, I like nori...but I don't feel good about eating something that has little in the way of package integrity! (one out of 3 layers intact!)<br />Wish I could have said good things about this snack. Maybe yours will be in better shape!<br /><br />gave it another try! and very yummy- wonderful in soup and on popcorn. Great for pregnant or nursing moms (high in vit A) I'd recommend it now, hope the shipping technique stays good!-We are all hooked!
