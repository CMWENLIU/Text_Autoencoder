Chilean seabass (actually called Patagonian toothfish) is being fished to extinction.  These fish take decades to reach maturity and live as long as 80 years, but they are being caught faster than they can reproduce.<br /><br />Try black sea bass, striped bass or rockfish instead.<br /><br />References:<br /><br />http://www.net.org/marine/csb/<br /><br />http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=6
