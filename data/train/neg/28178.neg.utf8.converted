In the larger world, my favorite mint tea is Bigelow's Plantation Mint. Unfortunately, that's not available in the Keurig world. In trying to replicate Plantation Mint, I bought four sample packs of mint options directly from Keurig for testing. Gloria Jean's version is the best of the mints by far.<br /><br />My problem with Timothy's? It has a strong twang up front and a noticeable unpleasant chemical aftertaste that tastes a bit like chewing a mint leaf whole. Even when cut with a LOT of water as iced tea is, it still has a too-sharp quality. I hesitate to add this lest I make myself sound crazy, but it also feels like it's forming a film on my tongue and throat as I swallow. I've tried about a dozen Keurig flavors as iced tea and none of the others make this "film." So try it if you must, but take it from someone who's actually compared... there are better options for mint tea in the Keurig world.<br /><br />To make iced tea easily in a Keurig, you need a very strong glass that won't break when taken from boiling to freezing. (Crate & Barrel's excellent Large Working Glass is the strongest I've found that still looks good.) In a 21-ounce glass, put your sweetener in -- 1.75 teaspoons of Splenda for me, 1.25 t for my husband -- then brew a MEDIUM cup of tea. Add ice to almost fill the glass. The ice will melt easily and will end up to be 1/4 of the total volume. Stir and drink. The quality of your ice matters since the melted part will become at least half the drink.<br /><br />If you'd like to try a flavored iced tea other than mint, my very favorite is GJ's Passion Fruit. It's out of stock, so I can't link to it. Until it's available here, try the close second-place tea: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHDH9Q">Gloria Jean's Coffees, Tea K-Cup, Mango-Flavored Black Tea for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>.
