What am I gonna do with four pounds (less a half dozen scoops) of this stuff? I was hoping to find a decent French Roast that I could get at a reasonable price, and take advantage of the free Amazon Prime shipping. But who is Jeremiah, and what exactly was he picking?<br /><br />THIS WAS NOT THE SOLUTION!<br /><br />The beans in this coffee are visibly inconsistent in their roast. Some beans appear almost raw, some are dark like good French Roast should be, and most are mildly brown like a Columbian. The beans also are small in comparison to all other coffees that I've tried, although I don't know what that signifies; the appearance is like beans that never fully matured.<br /><br />I've avoided Starbucks coffee - although its generally very good, they kind of burn the beans, plus its way overpriced to get the brand name.<br /><br />The best alternative I've found, and the one I'm going back to, is the Barista Brava French Roast found online at the Sam's Club site. The beans are dark, plump, and consistent in quality, with a flavor at least as good as Starbucks. It might be a little more expensive than Jeremiah's Pick once you throw in the shipping, but at least its palatable.
