I bought this coffee with high hopes as an alternative to the Senseo pods that are getting harder to find. We have two small Hamilton Beach coffee brewers that use Senseo pods, and we always enjoyed the coffee they produce. I was actually anticipating that these Baronet pods, from the reviews, might even be too strong ... but that was not the case. I don't know if the issue is that the Hamilton Beach brewers don't heat the water enough ... or the pods are just terrible ... but the cup they produced looked more like tea than coffee. We tried wetting the pods first, and I even put another pod in my cup to "brew" like a tea bag, but nothing worked. Weak, weak coffee. Maybe they work better with a genuine Senseo brewer ... but if you have the Hamilton Beach model ... steer clear of these! I wish I could return them but cannot.
