These multigrain crackers are absolutely wonderful. I gave only one star, because of your (Amazons) price....it is twice more expensive than at Sam's Club ($7). So why are we going to buy these from this source. Amazon, I am a huge fan, and regular shopper, but this really disappoints me. I will be checking your prices more closely.
