I have a package of Knorr "Sides Plus" Cheddar rice with broccoli and Carrots here with me.<br /><br />I'm looking at it in disbelief because I'm just not sure Knorr sold me what the package said I was buying.<br /><br />If there is any hint of cheddar cheese in it, I must be missing it.  Moreover, the rice isn't even cheddar-colored (supposedly from he cheddar cheese - I know the rice doesn't come in that color naturally).  At most I would call it a rice, broccoli and carrot medley, but that's about it.  I know some older grandmas might like it, but kids and anyone hoping for a cheddar cheese taste (let alone sauce - this doesn't have a hint of there being a sauce) is going to be disappointed.  It does taste ... healthy.  It just isn't what I was looking for.<br /><br />The sad thing is that the package states "Rice and pasta blend in a cheddar cheese sauce with Br and car..."  This is so far from the fact that I am going to have to believe Knorr either has very poor quality control, or is not truthful about just what they are selling and packaging.
