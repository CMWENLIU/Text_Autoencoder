I use Enfamil <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKWMJI">Enfamil Premium Infant Formula Refill Box, For Babies 0-12 Months, 35-Ounce</a>, very stable. but when I switch to Enfamil gentlease <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VKYGOM">Enfamil Gentlease Infant Formula for Fussiness and Gas, Refill Box, For Babies 0-12 Months, 33.2-Ounce</a>, I see a bitter taste like medicine. Why? Should I keep my child drink?
