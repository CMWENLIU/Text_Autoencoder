This jerky sounded pretty promising.<br /><br />It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals.<br /><br />When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor.  It was too sweet, and not spicy enough.  Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics<br /><br />-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky<br /><br />-Texture was good, but not great<br /><br />-Good price<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not very spicy<br /><br />-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.<br /><br />-Beef cuts a little too fatty.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky.
