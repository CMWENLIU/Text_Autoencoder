Need I say more.  The only problem with them is stopping.  You too?<br /><br />They were my morning treat in the service.  A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee.  25-cents BTW<br /><br />FIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE!!!!<br />Added 3/12: Well, I just got another deal.  Seems affordable with deals and anything but when not featured.  The above indicates a lifelong relationship.  I should know the taste.  This case of cookies is different and not a good different.  Even the texture is off.<br /><br />The expiration date appears to be 14May12.  Still in spec but close and if poorly stored you get rancid.  The price was almost $2/box cheaper and close to grocery store prices.  I have figured out why it went from $50+ to 30's.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT I WENT TO AMAZON RETURNS AND THIS ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE.  AMAZON ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME ON RETURNS.  DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  These went from a lovely treat to a reward for my dog.
