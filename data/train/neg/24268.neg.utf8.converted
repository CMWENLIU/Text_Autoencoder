I was so disappointed when this arrived that I didn't end up giving it as a Christmas gift because I was too embarrassed. I ordered the product on the 12th of Dec and didn't receive it until the 22nd, after the expected arrival time. I paid 18.99 plus shipping for a small plastic container with 9 pieces of basically the same thing, only different colors. There was not one sweet from the picture in this "assortment". My boyfriend (from India) was also extremely disappointed in the product. Next time we will just take the time to make these sweets ourselves.
