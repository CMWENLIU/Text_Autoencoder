I like full-flavored teas, because I add milk and sugar, so I appreciated the strength of this tea's flavor. However, the flavor had an odd note that I had never before encountered in a tea. I can only describe it as "fishy". I made several cups, at different strengths, but I could not finish any of them and I eventually discarded the box.
