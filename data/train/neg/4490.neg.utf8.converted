When I purchased these treats in our local health food store previously, they were soft and chewy and perfect for me to squish my dog's morning and evening pill into. The ones I bought from Amazon are dry and crumbly and don't work at all for giving pills. I bought all flavors, and all seem to be the same. So now I have bags and bags of treats that are no good at all for the purpose I intended. My dog still eats them, but certainly NOT with as much gusto as the ones I bought locally.
