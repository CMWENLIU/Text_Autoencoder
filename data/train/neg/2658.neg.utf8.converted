This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats. I supplement their diets with wet food and thought I'd make the change to a organic brand.<br /><br />First of all, this stuff turned my stomach upon opening it. It smells disgusting, like something died in the can. The consistency was gross too. This stuff was sloppy and fibrous. It looked like spoiled tuna salad and smelt even worse. I thought it had possibly gone bad but the date on the can indicates that it's still quite good and nowhere near the expiration date.<br /><br />I really shouldn't have given this to my cat but I gave him a portion of it (not the whole can) to see how he took to it. He actually did eat it very happily, gluttonously in fact... But he was ill after and the remnants of this come up all over the kitchen floor. That's the first time I've ever had this happen when sampling a new food.<br /><br />I think I'm going to stick to my usual brand. This stuff was not worth it! I am very disappointed and quite disgusted.
