Even though this product says BPA FREE right on the front, they are not in fact BPA free.  In very small print on the back, it says "Lid not included".  I'm sorry, the lid is part of the can.  To say these are BPA free is false advertising and completely disingenuous.  If you follow BPA testing at all, even small trace amounts are harmful.  Will not recommend this product and hope others see this review if you're concerned about contaminates in your food.
