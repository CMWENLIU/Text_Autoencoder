Once upon a time this was available in local grocery stores, but no longer. So I bought a dozen at a time from eurofoodmart and ate them sparingly. When I tried to re-order in December 2009, I discovered that overnight, greed struck and  eurofoodmart bumped up the holiday price by 50%. Not only that, they now offer only the 4 oz package, not the standard 6 oz with the larger wedges. So much of the time you will need to use two wedges to do what one did before.<br /><br />There are better places to get this cheese than eurofoodmart, and fairer internet merchants to do business with. Pass up these price gougers and keep looking.  Support the good people, not the others.<br />----------------<br /><br />Now it's November, 2010, and there seems to be deception with this product. Amazon is selling the 4 oz cheese wedges, but the supplier gave them a graphic of the 6 oz.
