Da Vinci Sugar Free Syrups with Splenda. There are over 30 different flavors. Trust me when I say that only a handful of all those flavors available is worth the price. English Toffee, French Vanilla are winners. I am sure there are a couple more but I am not going to spend good money on other flavors that are not even worth .50 cents. B-52 is one! How did it come to me? I do not recall ordering that particular flavor and they probably send it by mistake (we'll see when I ask for my money back. Over [$...] each cost!). Hard to describe the taste but enough said that when I added some to an otherwise superior cop of coffee this crap made me pour it all-minus that first sip-down the drain.  B-52? What's that, an airplane? Because it sure does not taste normal to me! The aftertaste is enough to make you want to demand your money back! Yes, there are many but only the very few are worth the price.
