I have been buying from Amazon for about a year and for the most part I have been very pleased with their prices and service. I have, however, learned that it is a good practice to check prices before having the luxury of having items sent to my door at no cost. For the most part Amazon's prices are in line and are competitive, but sometimes they run too far into left field and run head first into the wall. It is worth $10.00 to me to make a trip to Costco to buy a bucket of jelly beans. I bought this exact product today for $15.89 at Costco.  JohnD
