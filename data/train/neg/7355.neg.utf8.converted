Well I just heated up my first bowl of Oatfit and was ready for some warm good oatmeal on a cold morning. Unfortunately I had to spit it out after the second bite. It is extra mushy and it leaves an awful after taste. Very artificial and almost bitter. For an extra 60 calories I rather stick with their other lines.
