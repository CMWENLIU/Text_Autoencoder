Down to my last can of this 5.5 oz Hill's Science Diet Kitten Culinary Creations Roasted Chicken in Gravy Canned Cat Food, when this order finally got here today.<br /><br />Problem:<br />the ad fails to mention any size of the cat food cans.<br /> but the picture shows a 5.5oz can.<br /><br />So, I ordered it based on the picture: which is CLEARLY 5.5 oz cans.<br />What I got is 2 cases of 24 2.9oz cans,<br />this is not what I ordered.<br />and now, I need the cat food! I have hungry cats here!<br /><br />I ordered it online since it's not available locally.<br /><br />I am NOT happy!<br />I can't return it for refund, it would take way too long.<br /><br />what do you suggest?
