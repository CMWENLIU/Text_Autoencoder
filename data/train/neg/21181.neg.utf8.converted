I've been eating stuffed grape leaves for decades and these are far and away the worst ones I've ever had. They ARE edible, yes. But they're so incredibly salty that I'm eating them at about 1/10 of the pace that I normally would (especially considering how many cans I now have). Bottom line: spend a little more money and get something better.<br /><br />P.S.: Another reviewer remarked on how some of the cans were dented in transit. That was the case for me too.
