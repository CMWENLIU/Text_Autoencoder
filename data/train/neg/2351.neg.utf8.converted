I was looking forward to trying this beverage mix. I mixed it as directed with 250ml (8 oz) of hot water. It dissolved quickly.  And just FYI, the color of the drink was darker than that pictured on the box. It was a murky brown color. As far as flavor goes, the ginger was just too strong and nasty. I didn't like it at all.
