I bought these drops in the store and they are excellent. My mistake was ordering more through Amaxon.com. I ordered through Amazon because the price was so much lower than the store. The first order arrived totally melted, pure liquid. When I called to complain, they promised to notify the warehouse that they must be shipped in a cold pack and sent out a replacement. Obviously the warehouse didn't get the message or just didn't care, because the replacement arrived melted also. After being promised that the third time would be different, they sent a second replacement...but NO, this was also melted. After this I insisted on a refund, which I promptly received. Would love to hear from anyone else who ordered if they are still shipping unrefrigerated. I would start ordering through Amazon again if they fixed this problem.
