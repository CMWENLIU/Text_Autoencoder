Buckwheat with milk is my favorite meal start from early childhood. I born in Ukraine and Buckwheat is very different over there - it's pretty brown seeds. Not light green like this one. Even without roasting it was delicious tasty and smells so fine. But, because I am now too far from the Ukraine and Russian stores too expensive for me I guess I have to add anything else to my Buckwheat kasha in order to have some taste in this meal...<br />By the way, any Buckwheat can become mushy if you don't know few simple secrets. I would love to share: First - water should always cover the seeds 2 fingers above (horizontal position =)<br />Second: add little of salt to Buckwheat in the water and bring the water to a boil FAST, then<br />reduce the heat to minimum and allow to simmer for not a few minutes but until ALL water will<br />be inside of the seeds.<br />If you put too little of water - you will eat dry, raw and possibly burned kasha.<br />If you put too much of water - you will eat wet and mushy kasha.<br />And , if you cook in the BOILED water you will get all combinations above.<br />Good luck and enjoy. It is food from the Heaven.<br />Victoria
