I've been happy enough with the quality and price of Eight O-Clock coffee that I signed up for Amazon's Subscribe & Save program.  Two different times now, Amazon has raised the price of the shipments by 33% and didn't notify me.  I feel that a subscription program should notify consumers when prices go up significantly.  I'm canceling, even though I like the coffee and the convenience.  I was agitated at Amazon the first time this happened, but gave Amazon another chance.  They let me down again.  Bad practice, Amazon.
