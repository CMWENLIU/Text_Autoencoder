I ordered this for my son for his school meal. First off, the nutrition information is really impressive compared to traditional Mac 'n cheese so for a family trying to eat healthy, I did not have a problem eating this. But it does not taste like Mac 'n Cheese at all but rather Macaroni in a vegetable/butternut squash sauce with cheese. As long as you are aware of this then you will be fine. The flavor, for me, was good but texture was mushy for a frozen entree.Add this to the hefty price tag and I would rather cook my own vegetable casserole and choose a different pasta for it i.e. whole wheat Penne or Rigatoni.All in all, disappointing for us.
