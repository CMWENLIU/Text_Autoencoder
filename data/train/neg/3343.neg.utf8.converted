l have been using ordering Lavazza Italian Coffee, Qualita Oro - bean, 8.8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)through amazon since June 2007. Its a great bean but you need to have the coffee is vacuum sealed, this ensures the taste is fresh. 4 out of 5 shipments the bags have pin holes allowing air to spoil the beans. l will not be buying from this vendor again.
