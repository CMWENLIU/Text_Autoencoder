You can buy passion fruit concentrate at mexican stores, it is called MARACUJA. It is in Portuguese, in a yellow plastic bottle. It only costs $3.00.  I forgot the name of the brand, but just write it down in a piece of paper and take it to the store and a clerk can help you out. don't waste your money with this.
