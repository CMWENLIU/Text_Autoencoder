Of my two cats, just one will "eat" TOTW canned food and even she only goes for it once or twice per month. I notice, like others, that she's into the gravy more than the meat so I'll probably stop buying it. The dry food is so damn good, it's a shame TOTW can't bring that same excellence to canned food.<br /><br />I give two stars because atleast the one cat doesn't back away from it. She takes a couple slurps and then leaves. Fair enough for a 2 star rating IMO.
