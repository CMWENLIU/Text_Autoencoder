The product was shipped in a plastic bag placed into an express mail envelop. As the envelops are designed for documents packing a bag of nuts results in the envelop being stuffed. There is no protection for the nuts so as the envelop is thrown around in transit and as other packages are thrown on top of the envelop the nuts are crushed resulting in well over 50% of the pecan halves arriving as pecan pieces. Also the bag is loaded with pecan dust from all the breakage in transit. I do not understand why this shipper would ship what is sold as a premium product in packaging that results in delivery of an inferior product. I purchased and paid for Fancy Mammoth Pecan Halves not pecan pieces.
