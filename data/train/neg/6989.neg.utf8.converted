Not sure WHY on earth this company sells this product with Continuous shock. This is VERY DANGEROUS for smaller animals and children, even up to the size of Golden Retrievers. Read other reviews to see the animals this had killed!<br />Do NOT buy a fence unit unless it is a pulsating shock. There is NO reason for this. It costs very little to make this pulsating and is much better and safer.
