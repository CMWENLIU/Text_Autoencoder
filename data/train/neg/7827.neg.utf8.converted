There's always some debate about whether wheat grass juice/powder is safe for gluten-sensitive people. It's presumed that since the grain is gone, then the protein that causes a reaction for many people is also gone; wheat grass is supposed to be just the stalk.  Not so with this product. I am normally a big fan of Navitas stuff but this one disappointed me. It's somehow contaminated with gluten b/c I took some and instantly got my typical reaction to gluten. So if anyone gluten-sensitive is considering trying a wheat grass powder, definitely avoid this one.
