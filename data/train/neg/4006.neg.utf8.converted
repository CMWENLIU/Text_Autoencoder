We're Polar Tuna fans, but were curious to try this one because of the great reviews. It may simply be personal preference, but we were disappointed with the flavor of Wild Planet. We did a blindfold test of this brand plus two others, and this came in last. We'll stay with Polar Tuna, which is scrumptious!
