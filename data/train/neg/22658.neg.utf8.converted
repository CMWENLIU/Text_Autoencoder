I've been a "connoisseur" of dark-chocolate-dipped apricots for years and this is the first time I've ordered them from Amazon.<br /><br />This brand, Old Naples, was a real disappointment.<br /><br />The apricots have an artificial flavor, a strong aftertaste, and a stale, jelly-like texture.  It was not at all the melt-in-your mouth, sticky-sweetness that I have experienced from other brands.<br /><br />The chocolate layer is thin but more importantly, it's cheap chocolate. It's a waxy, flavorless, too-sweet chocolate that barely even looks like dark rather than milk chocolate.<br /><br />On the positive side, each one was individually sealed in cellophane so they weren't as messy as I expected, and the simple gold box was attractive.<br /><br />I would not order these again.
