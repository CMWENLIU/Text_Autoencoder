The PICTURE for this item, (and even the wording below it), proudly proclaim, (in BIG letters), 'BLUE CRAB BAY CO., CHESAPEAKE CRAB CAKE MIX, 2--OUNCE PACKAGE, (PACK OF 6).  Well, they did get the last part right: it IS a six pack, and each pack DOES have 2 ounces.  And there IS actually some crabmeat listed in the ingredients: the second ingredient is "crabmeat", (presumably dehydrated), and down the ingredient list, is listed "crab-roe".  All well and good -- but I CAN'T TASTE IT!  (IS the crab hiding??????)  The ONLY ingredient I taste in this product is: S A L T.<br /><br />'Salt' is the SIXTH ingredient!  But also listed is something called "spices"....which can be anything, because it is not specified they are NATURAL spices, just "spices"...which can be chemical reprodutions of natural spices and/or newly-created chemical spices.  Who knows?  Not me, that's for sure.<br /><br />I should have known better....<br /><br />Each 2-ounce serving of this product comes in three separate containers.  The first is the outer, cardboard container -- which contains the other two, clear-plastic-wrap containers.  One of these holds a small amount of freeze-dried vegetables.  The other, (MUCH larger), holds the other ingredients.  HEY -- I NOTICE NOW THAT THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ON THE PACKET ARE N O T THE SAME AS LISTED ON AMAZON, NOR DOES THE PACKAGE LOOK THE SAME!  The item NAME IS the same same, however....and I HAVE been informed by a notation, when I first came to this product, that I HAD ordered it before.  But MY package has "Shore Seasonings" in BIG leetters on it, and a COLOURED BACKGROUND MAP!  Same company?  Maybe they changed hands between the time I ordered and the time the product arrived?  At any rate, the package I have contains NO crabmeat, dehydrated or otherwise.  What it DOES contain is this: Seasoned Cracker Crumbs, (bleached WHEAT flour, salt, paprika, cayenne, celery, mustards, herbs and "spices", (presumably all in the larger inner packet), and air-dried vegetables, (red bell peppers, tomatoes, leeks -- all presumably in the smaller inner plastic packet.)  THERE IS EVEN A RECIPE ON THE BACK, TO MAKE CHESAPEAKE CRAB CAKES, WHICH STATES THAT TO MAKE THEM, Y O U MUST SUPPLY THE CRABMEAT!  But Amazon says I bought this product.  Which product?????<br /><br />Well, I've opened one package....don't think I can return the others.  If Blue Crab Bay Company has been taken over by "Shore Seasonings", this should have been noted on the item's page, and the ingredients changed.  I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THT FROM IT -- AND IT ALONE -- I COULD MAKE CRABCAKES.  BUT THERE IS NO CRABMEAT IN IT!  Only mainly wheat -- and SALT!!!!  Having no crabmeat in the house, I tried to use this mixture with the tunafish I DO have on hand.  Tuna in water.  With no salt.  The mixture was still unbelievably salty.<br /><br />Something is incredibly "fishy" here.  And I don't like it!  I doubt whether I will buy this product again -- as long as it has SO much salt.  And I am SERIOUSLY thinking, (right now, at least), in investing some money in...........SALT MINES!  (Which, if conditions there are as bad as they used to be, is somewhere where I'd like to send executives from..........  Oh, forget that.  All I want is an apology and my money back, from Amazon and from the Blue Crab Bay Company / Shore Seasonings!
