My wife bought this because she likes drinking Hemp Milk, but this purchase was bad.  I'm not sure if this is an isolated incident or not, but this experience was not good.  First, when the box arrived, at least one of the containers was broken as there was milk all throughout the box.  We did not report it to Amazon thinking it's just one and we could live with it.  But after a week or so, my wife noticed that at least a couple of the containers were bad already.  The expiration date on the containers say April 2012, but when she opened them to drink them, they were bad.  No where does it say to refrigerate before opening and even when we could find these in the stores, they were not always refrigerated.  We're not sure if we're going to order these again and I'd hope this is an isolated incident.
