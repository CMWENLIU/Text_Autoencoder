For one thing, these aren't the eyeball candy I was looking for my Halloween dinner to put on my cupcake, the eyeballs are only on the wrapper, not on the candy itself.<br />Secondly, these candy taste old and yucky, the filling is very dry and stick to my teeth like crazy, I thought I'll just have to eat them since I can't use them for my cupcake decoration, but they're no good at all.<br />I could have returned it, but it doesn't even worse the trouble, so I just throw them all out in my garbage can!
