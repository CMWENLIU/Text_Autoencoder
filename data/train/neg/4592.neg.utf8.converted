I *loved* that Cascadian Farms used to sell an organic version of that perfect baby finger food - Cheerios. We bought it often, but were surprised and saddened to see the latest version sneaks in added sugar. Even my 2-year-old saw the change; after eating a few he looked and me and said, "they are sweet!" Of course, he's still a fan, but I will not be buying these again unless CF reverts to the old (perfect!) formula.
