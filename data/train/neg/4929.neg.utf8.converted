I am no stranger to Pacific Foods or soup products in general.  I eat a lot of this manufacturer's items and I consume many varieties of soup.  Of late, Pacific Foods has been producing many new flavors of soups that lack attention to taste and consumer friendly packaging.  This rosemary potato chowder is one of these newer soups and it was a big disappointment for me.<br /><br />My dislike of this soup began with the packaging.  It is one of those fold and tear type of cartons where you pop the sides up and take a knife or pair of scissors and cut off the top to remove the contents.  These cartons are not consumer friendly.  It is difficult to remove the product without some of the contents spilling as you tear off the top.  Pacific has soup containers which come with a capped spout.  The capped spout on other containers allows the consumer to pour what they need and refrigerate the rest.  Alas, with this container, you need to pour all of the contents and put what you don't need into a tupperware dish -- thus creating more dirtied dishes in your life.<br /><br />The second disappointment was the appearance upon pouring.  I definitely eat food first with my eyes.  When I poured the soup into a bowl, there were giant curds intermingled with oily broth, carrots and celery.  This soup is made with milk so I am guessing that was what caused the curds.  I had to use a whisk to break them up.  After heating the soup, the base was still very oily.  See a photo of the soup in the product image gallery.<br /><br />The third disappointment was the taste and texture of the soup.  The soup is oily, filmy and I don't think it is thick enough to be called a chowder.  The manufacturer was very light on the use of rosemary.  I wouldn't call this a rosemary potato chowder.  I would call this flavored liquid with some finely diced potatoes and a dash of rosemary.<br /><br />The fourth disappointment was the nutritional profile.  This container has 2 one cup servings.  Each one cup serving has 230 calories, 8 grams of fat, 25% of your daily saturated fat (5 grams) and 30% of your daily sodium.  See a shot of the nutritional profile in the product image gallery.<br /><br />If you have the time, I would make your own potato soup.  Imagine Soup carries a large line of soup bases, including a potato flavor.  If you add potatoes, onion, carrots and some spices, you will have a soup that is much more texturally appealing, flavorful and nutritional (that soup base has 110 calories per cup).<br /><br />This product is vegetarian.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.
