This is the first time I can ever remember such a difference in a beveridge's taste from one can to the next of the exact same product.  My first couple of cans were very appealing, with just a subtle hint of flavor mixed in with the sparkling water.  Then out of the same case, I suddenly find a can of Talking Rain with an intensely awful taste, as if some absent-minded employee had left the flavor spigot on too long resulting in a very nasty, strong taste that was far removed from the delicately flavored water I had first sampled.  Doesn't this company have testers to assure uniform quality throughout?  Apparently not, which is very sad.
