If you see Vernors Ginger Ale in the store at it's usual price, ie. > $3.00 snap it up as it is much better than Canada Dry or comparably priced Ginger Ale/Beer. I don't understand the point of vendors selling a product here and then charging between 50%-125% of the product price in delivery costs. Who is ever going to purchase anything with S/H fees that high?<br /><br />I have recently become a fan of good Ginger Ale/Beer and would love to find a consistent reliable source for Vernors(for every day drinking) to some of the really good brands; Cock N Bull, Reeds, or the last brand I tried, which I believe was named Santa Cruz,for when you want something really good.<br /><br />I have tried making it at home and it works well aside from the thus far insoluble issue of fermentation after 5-7 days (even refrigerated). If you can find this with free shipping, fill your storeroom, but aside from that, I don't know. The few brands Amazon carries with free shipping, I have issues with. Fever Tree; not great and 7 oz.bottles; Hansen's; too much vanilla taste, really overpowering. If you truly like ginger in different incarnations, the Ginger People make an excellent 5 oz. bottle of ginger juice; a drop of which will invigorate mass produced ginger ale. Their shipping is also outrageous but here is a tip with which I reluctantly part. Vitacost.com carries it by the case 12 bottles @ $4/btl. and has very cheap S/H-free over $75 and they have a broad line of nutritional supplements that you can easily add to cart to get total above $75 and get free shipping.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a quality ginger ale/beer distributor that offers free shipping, I'd love to know. In the meantime, even Canada Dry has responded and is now actually putting ginger in their ginger ale. I couldn't believe that it was all artificially flavored until about 9 months ago.
