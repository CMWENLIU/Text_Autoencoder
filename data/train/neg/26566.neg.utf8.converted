I purchased two cases of Libby Pumpkin.  Very late arrival, rude email, and when received half the cans were dented and had to be used immedialtely. What I could not use because of dents were donated. I fault myself for not seaching farther.  The price with shippig was outrageous, but I needed it soon (my error once again).  I will not use them again.  100 percent guarantee, good luck!  I honestly did not contact them after the goods were finally here. Nothing happend before my inquiries...don't expect further help.
