When I ordered the Theater-Size Jujubes I made especially sure that the Jujubes were the 6.5 oz Theater-Size boxes (double-checked description etc. in the vendor's ad).  When I received the Jujubes they were 1.5 oz boxes instead if the 6.5 oz.  So I paid the same price for the 1.5 oz boxes as I would have paid for the 6.5 oz sized boxes.  The product was totally misrepresented by the vendor.  I would not have ordered this product had I known the "real" quantity size.<br /><br />I decided not to return the candy because it was just too much trouble to do so.  The main thing I wanted to do is let you know how the vendor misrepresented their product.<br /><br />I have ordered so much from Amazon and this is the very first time anything like this has ever happened and I was really disappointed.
