They have CHICKEN printed BOLDLY on the label..open the bag and overwhelming stench of fish is the first thing you smell.  My dog ate one and vomited.  They also state proudly that they are an AMERICAN OWNED company, but their product is made in China.  If you care about your dog don't buy this or any other Canyon Creek Product.
