I'm a sucker for limited edition cereals and was happy to buy this.  And then got a bigger surprise when I opened the package, got hit by the odor, and tasted the stuff.  And then I had to Google and see I wasn't alone.  Some website said it best when they said: "it was Yabba-Dabba-Eww! I could taste the caramel apple, but only for a brief moment in between a weird unrecognizable initial flavor and an unpleasant aftertaste."
