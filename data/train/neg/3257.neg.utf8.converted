I was excited to find this at my local pet store for my cat who has allergies.  Her allergies would cause her to scratch at her head and ears until she had sores that would become infected.  I suspect she may be allergic to certain grains; she is definitely allergic to chicken.  Her allergy symptoms cleared up on this food, but it gave her such loose stools that won't even use her litter box anymore.  (She goes in our bathtub).<br /><br />I'm looking into other alternatives online.  I don't think cats need, or particularly tolerate, all of the fiber that comes from the oatmeal, vegetables, and fruits in this formula.  It sounds nice to us, but it's just not what cats have evolved to eat.
