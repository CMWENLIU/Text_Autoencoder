I purchased this and really enjoyed the first box.  However, a few weeks later when I went to cook another box there were bugs, like flour bugs, in the pasta and I had to throw it all away.  The box states 100% money back guarantee, however the Hodgson Mill did not send me my money back they sent me coupons for their products; products I am not sure I want to buy in advance of using them.  If you purchase more than what you can eat on the day it arrives I would advise storing it in more than just the box it comes in.
