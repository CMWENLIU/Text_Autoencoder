I agree with one of the previous reviewers. The fruitcake looks good and seems to be mostly fruit and very little "cake", but all those preservatives!!! Besides the long list of preservatives, there really isn't any flavor to the cake itself. All one tastes are the fruits. The price I paid for this little tiny square of it was outrageous! Do yourselves a favor and get the fruitcake from the Assumption Abbey Monks. The cake has a delicious flavor having been soaked in liquer and it doesn't skimp on the fruits either!
