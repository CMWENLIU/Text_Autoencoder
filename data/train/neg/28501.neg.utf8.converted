My wife and I bought this when Davidson's standard bulk rooibos was unavailable for some weeks.  We have had vanilla rooibos from other sources (Celestial Seasonings has a wonderful one), but all were bagged, and we prefer to use our infuser.<br /><br />Boy, this was a bad surprise!  Davidson's does not say there is any vanilla in the tea, just "natural flavors".  Unfortunately, those chosen "natural flavors" seem to range from anise to cardamom to caramel, but there really is no vestige of vanilla to be found.  Frankly, the taste is so unlike anything we would have wanted with our rooibos that we are going to give it to a family member with instructions to throw it away if she doesn't like it.<br /><br />We enjoy Davidson's red rooibos and green rooibos, their Silver Needles white tea, and their Spring bulk teas.  This one, however, is a perfect waste.<br /><br />Stay away from this!<br /><br />NOTE:  I gave it "2 stars" because the product is packaged very well and the rooibos quality appears to be as good as their normal unflavored rooibos.
