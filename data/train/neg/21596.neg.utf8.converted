I admit to being a bit spoiled as to coffee.  I normally get fresh, locally-roasted coffee from an independent coffee shop in my town.  The Pear's is "OK," but you can tell the instant you open the bag that it will be a disappointment.  Grounds are light in color, dry in appearance.  The aroma and taste are not rich and satisfying.  To its credit, it does not have an acidic "bite."  But it also does not have the earthy fullness that I've come to enjoy in my coffee.  The good on-sale price roped me in, but I will not be a repeat customer for this brand.
