I've been making jam for years using low-sugar Sure-Jell (you can get away with using even less sugar than listed on the package if you're generous with the lemon juice).  My jam always comes out beautifully.  Unfortunately, I ran out of Sure-Jell tonight, and used a packet of Pomona's Universal Pectin that was sitting in my cupboard instead.  BIG mistake.  The jam jelled, all right, but the final consistency was pasty and the brightness of the fruit flavors was totally clouded.  I got pretty much the same results as if I'd thickened my fruit with corn starch.  Ick!  Next time I'll stick with Sure-Jell.
