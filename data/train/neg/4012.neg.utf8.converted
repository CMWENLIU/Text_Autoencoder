I chose a cherry flavor to test, because I like cherry tasting candy and beverages. I came home from work today tired, thirsty and ready for a break. I was happy to find The switch had arrived, and it was already nice and cold since it is a really cold day.<br /><br />I sat down with my laptop and my switch ready to take a break. I took a nice long drink and found that this tasted nothing like black cherry to me. I reminds me more of Robitussin cough medicine. Another flavor might be more tasty, but I won't be purchasing this product for myself. I will stick to the much for refreshing and flavorful IZZE beverage.
