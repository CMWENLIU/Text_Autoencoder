Totally disappointed in buying this product from Amazon. It was OLD, STALE and completely TASTELESS.  It turned out it was a few days from it's expiration date. Please note my complaint has nothing to do with Folger's Hazelnut Decaf coffee, which I drink regularly: what I find disappointing is that Amazon would dare to sell a product in such deplorable condition. Even my tiny local grocery store would have removed it from their shelves months ago... if they carried it.<br /><br />From this experience I've decided to stick to buying only books from Amazon.
