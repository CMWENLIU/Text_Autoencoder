I was so excited to try a cheese-less mac and "chreeze." I'm vegan and like just about every kind of food you can think of, but this stuff was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. It didn't taste like cheese all. I added extra rice milk and earth balance to no avail. I took a bite and had to spit it out....and for someone who drinks green drinks and all sorts of concoctions on a daily basis, that says a lot. Steer clear of their mac and chreese and try their gravy instead (it's really good)!
