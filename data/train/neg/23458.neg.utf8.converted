This was not a good purchase for me. I'm a coffee fanatic and was hopeful of a great coffee experience. Over half the bag went into the trash. I NEED GOOD coffee, especially my first cup of the day. If I don't have that good coffee experience, I trash the offending beans and move on until the beans I find give me what I'm looking for. I found no aroma or flavor with the coffee brewed from these beans. I went back to my regular provider for my beans. (they don't carry Kona which is why I was intrigued to try this offering) I've had 100% Kona many years ago and LOVED it, so it's not that I'm unfamiliar as to what I should be tasting. It's just that this brand did NOT "knock my socks off" and I was hopeful that it would.<br /><br />UPDATE: After my review, the President of Hawaii Coffee Roasters contacted me and offered a refund or a new bag. I left the choice up to him. I received a new bag and have to say that I had the 5-star experience that I had hoped for. I ended up having received a "bad bag" the first time around. While it is not my favorite varietal, it certainly gave me the coffee experience I was looking for with great richness, smoothness and flavor. I also give 5-stars to Hawaii Coffee Roasters and its' President for OUTSTANDING service.
