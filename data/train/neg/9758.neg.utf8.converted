As simple as that: nutritional information is NOT accurate !!!<br />Iron content in purple bag is only 2%, NOT 45% as stated on the pouch itself !!!!!!!!!!!<br />Light green pouch "Rutabagas", contains Iron: 4%, NOT 120% stated on the package itself !!!!!!!<br />We have fed 2 packs daily: 1 light green "rutabagas" and 1 purple one - "pumpkins" to our girl since she was 3.5 month old.<br /><br />What a disappointment !!! This company should be held accountable for causing anemic, malnutritioned infants.<br />Wow, I can hardly keep my emotions !!!<br />FDA control anyone ...
