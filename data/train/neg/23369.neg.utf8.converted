Seriously .. I don't know what others are getting but the "juice" in the bottle I received has the appearance of diarrhea .. not the smell, fortunately, but certainly the look.  I'm not exaggerating .. we're talking a dense brown color here.  It's not out of date, either.  In fact, the expiration/sell-by date is 27 June 2013 so this stuff should be fine.  There's absolutely no way I'm drinking something that looks like what this stuff looks like.  It's no wonder that the bottle is completely enclosed in plastic wrap .. if people could see the color of this stuff, there's no way they'd buy it.  Also, if your Pomegranate juice includes Acai Berry, that's something you might want to include somewhere, anywhere, in the product description when people are buying it online.  In fact .. here's a list of the ingredients:  Proprietary Pomegranate Extract Blend (Punicalagin, Ellagic Acid, Polyphenol), Resveratrol Extract, Omega 3, 6, & 9, Reconstituted Pomegranate Juice, Acai Juice (from Acai pulp & Acai powder) Pear Juice (from concentrate), Apple Juice (from concentrate), Vegetable and Fruit Juice (FOR COLOR!!!!), and Natural flavor.  Wow .. I think I'm going back to Brownwood Acres Pomegranate Juice .. the ingredient list on that is pretty simple .. 100% pomegranate juice concentrate.  And the kicker .. it's actually a wonderful looking red!
