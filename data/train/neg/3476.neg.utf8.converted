This is made in Thailand and does not taste the same. The old made in Japan drinks are totally superior in taste, after taste, aroma. Didn't listen to the other reviewer about the formula change with the made in Thailand drinks and ordered 2 cases but didn't want to go through the trouble of returning. If you had tasted the old drink, you will greatly be disappointed. If you have not had Ito En before, you may still find this drink good. Sorry, not for me.<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted "watered down", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly.
