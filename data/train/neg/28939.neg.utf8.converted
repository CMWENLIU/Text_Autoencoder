On a recommendation from a book, I purchased 3 bottles of the Frontier Coconut Flavor, and it's horrible!  There is NO scent or flavor, except for chemical.  The coconut seems to be completely missing.  AND there are no returns so I have 3 bottles of stinky oil stuff.  Save your money and purchase a different item.
