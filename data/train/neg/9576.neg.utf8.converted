I got this when it was on sale in the gold box. I like cooking with a lot of oil, so i thought I would try this coconut oil out. It seems to be a good brand, but I have learned that cooking with coconut oil is not for me. I can not appreciate the coconut flavor in my whole meal. I like drinking coconut water and eating coconut ice cream, but i think I will stick with olive oil for my cooking. I just use this oil for my skin after sunburns or if i want to wrestle with my wife.
