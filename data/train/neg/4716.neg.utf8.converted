The truth is real, this thing is freaking scorching man.  And I eat hot pepper basically everyday.  I only ate half of 1 and it kicked my butt.  And still is hours later lol.  It arrived in 5 days, not bad.  But, the reason I'm giving it 2 stars, not because it's not hot (It's waaaaaay hotter than a habanero, the hottest I've ever tried up until this bad boy) but it's because I didn't get 15 peppers.  I only received 12.  And I know it's only 3, but when you advertise an amount, that amount needs to be that amount.
