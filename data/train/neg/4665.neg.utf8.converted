I love the Vita Coco coconut water. Have been ordering it for a while now (atleast 3 - 12 packs a month).<br />Just received this shipment with a very sour taste. Poured it out into a glass and it looked brown, frothy .... basically disgusting.<br />What happened Vita Coco? Slacking on the quality control?<br />5 starts for the product. 1 star for this batch.
