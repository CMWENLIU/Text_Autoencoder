I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. After a few months, I've harvested about 5 ripe chili pepper, the halapeno hasn't done anything, and I'm about to run out of nutrient. I pulled some of the early sprouts, put them in a pot on my lanai, and they are doing far better than the plants in the 150 dollar machine. Point being, some miraclegrow, a few bucks, sunny spot on the lanai, or just a trip to the grocery store. Waste of money. Update, ran out of nutrients, so am using Fox Farms Grow Big, I now have some chilis showing up in the Aerogarden, the outdoor plant is now 24" tall, has well over 30 peppers on it, the Aerocrap has one semi-mature pepper and is 7" tall, do the math, not worth it, and made in china, insult to injury.<br /><br />Aloha
