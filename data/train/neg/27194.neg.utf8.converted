Some one highly rated this chocolate candy that it was made only once a year by a high end France store.<br />I thought this Chocmod Truffettes be more or less like the Canada made Ferrero, before the purchase.<br />Big disappointment! It's not even close. It has no taste, no flavor, just plain nothing .....<br />other than a 85% saturated fat swirling in your mouth. I wish to get my $30 plus, back.<br />Save your hard earned dollar, you deserve something better, much better.
