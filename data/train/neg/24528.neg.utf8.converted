The smell of Carob overwhelms everything else and makes up half of the flavor. I was hoping this was an organic version of "Pero" (an German instant coffee substitute made from Barley, Malted Barley, Chicory, and Rye). No such luck. The Carob destroys what could have been a good product. YUCK! FYI, the ingredients are Organic Carob, organic barley, organic chicory, organic ramon nuts, natural coffee flavor. Notice how chicory (a nice substitute all by itself) is almost last. This does not taste anything close to coffee-like to me. :(
