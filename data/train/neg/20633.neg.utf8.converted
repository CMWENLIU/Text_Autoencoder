I have been using Better than Milk for years, but I thought I would try this product.  It doesn't dissolve well, it's the consistency of liquid pudding if you use the manufacturer's proportions, and it doesn't taste good; overall I'd rate it poorly.  It might do OK in cooking.  About the only thing it has going for it is that, unlike Better than Milk, it is pure soy with nothing else added.
