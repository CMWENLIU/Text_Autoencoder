This is Kraft equivalent to the Ford "Edsel"! Whoever was involved in the decision to market this stuff, did nothing to preserve their job security. If I wanted to go through all the bother of making a white sauce, I'd be making my mac & cheese entirely from scratch. Total waste of time and extra money, with no benefit to taste. The end product was very bland with an unappealing texture. We didn't really like it at all. They use a thicker type of macaroni and even after cooking a few additional minutes it was still kind of tough and gummy. I'll stick with the Kraft Deluxe... taste better... easier to prepare... and cheaper.
