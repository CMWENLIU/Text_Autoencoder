As with most Saeco products the life expectancy is less than 2 years, and then the price to fix the broken pump or the leaky insides cost more than the machine itself. I have been through 2 in less than two years and the warranty requires you to pay for the shipping (heavy machine) and they won't guarantee that they will fix it, and then you have to pay to have it sent back. I regret ever looking at the machine - next time a Breville - my daughter has had hers for 5 years with no issues, ever.
