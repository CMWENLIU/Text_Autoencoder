I ordered this stuff after reading all the reviews. I was planning on using it for some desserts I was making to cater a wedding...it arrived and the boxes were old and puffed and the sprinkles inside were white with age. It wasn't the packaging, it looked like they'd been shipped out that way. Nothing like the picture on the front. In fact they didn't even look like they had EVER looked like the picture on the front. Beside the white crappy look of them they were short and fat, not the elegant chocolate sprinkles I wanted. They didn't even taste good. I had a few king arthur sprinkles that I made stretch for my event and from now on will only be ordering them from now on.
