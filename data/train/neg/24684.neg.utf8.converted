My dogs love these treats but with the Made in China label, I don't buy them anymore.  The AVMA and FDA has issued warnings related to chicken jerky treats made in China and my wonderful vet made me aware of this.  I'm very unhappy about this as my dogs really do love them.  But I love my dogs enough that I won't purchase these or other Made in China treats.  And let me tell you - that's a challenge.<br />Let me note that I did a search on Amazon for "Dog treats made in USA" and this product came up.  If it doesn't actually say in the description that product is "Made in the USA", it's not.
