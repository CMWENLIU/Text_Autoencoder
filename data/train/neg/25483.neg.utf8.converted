I haven't tried the product yet, but regardless of that experience, I think it's pure BS that when I checked the date code, I found out that the product I was shipped was half-way through it's shelf life!  Give me a break!  So in my view, I paid full price but received half the value expected, since I had intended this for my earthquake food supply.  Not a huge deal, since I'll use it, but I had intended to keep it for 12 months before use.  I suspect that the expiration date is just a suggestion, and that the product will last much longer, but why not ship products that are fresh to begin with?
