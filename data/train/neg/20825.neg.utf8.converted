Buyer Beware: I ordered this product 4-11-08 (rcvd it promptly) and the expiration date is 7-7-08. I'm a single gal - so that means I'd have to chow down 2 of these packages each month just to consume them before they expire.<br /><br />For the health concious - these are fruit juice sweetened which means no white sugar is added! They are 60 calories per cookie with 13g of carbs, 1g Fiber, 8g sugar, and 1g of protein.<br /><br />I had to leave a rating of only 2 because of the taste - just "ok" for me. They have a very heavy flavour almost a slight fermented after taste to them. If you're a die hard fig lover, these might be for you but I personally prefer the whole wheat version by Nabisco
