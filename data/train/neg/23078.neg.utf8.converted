If the government says you can lie, then it's okay to lie? California almonds are not raw except for a few loopholes, so why is this company saying these are raw when they're not? Because the USDA says they can!<br />Trader Joe's uses the same "legal lie" about their almonds and almond butters but that doesn't make it right.<br />Artisana, the manufacturer says the process of making the butter only reaches 115 degrees but they leave out the part about the almonds are already partially cooked.<br />You can buy truly raw almond butter from unpasteurized organic almonds but this isn't it. "California almonds" is the giveaway.<br />Google unpasteurized raw almond butter if you want the real thing.
