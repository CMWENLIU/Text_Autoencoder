Here's my experience... We have an 80# Golden Retriever who gets overly excited when we have guests.  This doesn't exactly fit the "stress" problem that the product is designed for but we thought it might help calm him down a bit particularly when we have guests that aren't dog people and don't care for his enthusiasm. The dosage calls for 1-6 ml depending on weight with the max dose of 6ml for anything over 40#.  The first time we tried it we gave 5ml and saw no results.  Last night we tried again with 7ml (slightly over recommended dose).  Again there was no visible calming.  This morning the dog went with me for our usual jog and then back at the house he had some kind of seizure or tremors that lasted about 5 minutes with shaking and very limited, wobbly control of his back legs.  By late morning he was his usual self.<br /><br />So, admittedly we did not use exactly for the intended purpose and did slightly over-dose him although according to directions he could have had another dose after 6 hours and we only gave one.  I don't really know that the episode was caused by the product but we've never seen the problem before so it's very suspicious.  That's our experience... draw your own conclusions.
