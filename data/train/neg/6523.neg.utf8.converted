I agree with the other reviewers, Necco has totally ruined a childhood favorite.  Squirrel Nut Zippers are now no more than run-of-the-mill caramels.  Also the 240 count are sticking to the wax paper.  I wasn't going to mention that since I need the fiber but I thought you might want to know. BRING BACK THE NUTS.
