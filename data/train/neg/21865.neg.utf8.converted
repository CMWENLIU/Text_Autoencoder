I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any "I am sorry for your inconvenience" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked.<br />The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware.
