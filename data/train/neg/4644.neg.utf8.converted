That tastes much better and more filling, and I think they're healthier.  I have been buying these Oats N' Dark Chocolate for a while until I saw a big package of these granola thins at Costco... it was interesting at first, but I realize it tastes more like milk chocolate than dark. Plus, pay attention to the interesting comparison to the Snickers Fun Size by another commenter.
