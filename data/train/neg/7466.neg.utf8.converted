I understand that many of our daily products are now made in China.<br />And I am not saying that all products made in China are bad.<br />I own many products around the house that are made in China.<br />But food is something I refuse to buy that are made in China.<br />In the product description, it does not specify that it's made in China.<br />On the box I received indicates that it's<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************<br />MANUFACTURED BY Guangzhou Yongwant Foods Co., Ltd<br />IMPORTED BY Liberty Richter Bloomfield, NJ 07003<br />*******************************************************************************************<br /><br />I thought I would share with others who feels the same before wasting your money.<br />My purchase 1 box (6 packs) went straight to the trash.
