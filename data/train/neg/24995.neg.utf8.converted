Lots of negatives about these cookies, even though they look great and have some great potential.<br /><br />First thoughts: Price high, small package, and cookies look dry and are somewhat small in size.<br /><br />Taste: Bars have a dry mouthfeel, too fluffy and dried out versus moist and chewy. Very weird unpleasant, overpowering, nutty-flowery taste. Perhaps from the amaranth, quinoa, and/or old coconut oil? Could use some cinnamon or something to enhance the baked oatmeal flavor.<br /><br />Only compliments--uses natural ingredients, contains a lot of raisins, which are nice. I like how they use palm sugar and tapioca syrup for natural, more low-glycemic alternative sugar-sweeteners.<br /><br />Overall these are not worth getting again, unless the other cookies (Ginger, Choc Chip...) are an improvement. Similar concept to Enjoy Life gluten-free cookies, but Enjoy Life's so far taste better.
