Really disappointed in the change.  Not at all what I was expecting.  Wish I hadn't bought a case.  It's a soup, not a thick and creamy chowder.  I won't buy again.  Tastes fine for a liquidy soup..has about 25% the potatoes that it used to...sadly, not a chowder and I used canned milk to try to thickening it up.  The store brand (generic) is better.
