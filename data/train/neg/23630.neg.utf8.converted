I have always loved, and bought Maille mustards. However, I recently bought two jars of Dijon Originale, and Dijon Old Style on two different occasions within the last six months. Both were made in Canada.  The Dijon Originale jar was not closed properly, and the Old Style was liquified when I opened the jar.  I has to throw the Old Style out.  Be aware.
