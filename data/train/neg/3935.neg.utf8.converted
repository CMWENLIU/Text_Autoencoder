I bought this hoping to make a Root Ber my grandkids would enjoy helping make and drink. We followed the included directions carefully. The resultant root beer was drinkable, but tasted like wintergreen, very strongly. I thought it was OK, but the grandkids wouldn't touch it after one taste. Decent wintergreen soda, but not muck like root beer, although the stuff smells great.
