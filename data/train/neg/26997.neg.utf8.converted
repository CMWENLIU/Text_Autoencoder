They look pretty but neither I nor my husband could eat more than half a cracker. Terrible GF after-taste. I put them out for the squirrels and they wouldn't touch them either!(it's January in Mich.) Over the holidays I found Glutino crackers and also tossed out the Blue Diamond in the cupboard (the squirrels DID at least eat those). My favorite for spread and cheeses is the Glutino Cheese which has just hint of cheese flavor.
