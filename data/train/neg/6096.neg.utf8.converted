I was excited that I found this gummy candy was available on Amazon, I had a bag from Trader Joes and it was sooo good.  Unfortunately, when the Amazon order came in the gummy bears were all hard, dry and crusty.  Very dissappointed in Amazon....  There is no food return so I hope get some type of compensation....!
