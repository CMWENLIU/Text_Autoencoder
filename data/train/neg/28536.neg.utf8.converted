Foolish me, I ordered these for my husband who is on some newfangled diet, so I wasn't as careful as I usually am, and I love Eden products, and I thought these would be fine, but they have shoyu in them which means soy and wheat and wheat means gluten, so we can't eat them.  I am sure they must be delicious if you can eat soy and gluten!
