i was expecting the lollipops to be as represented in the picture - cute packaging and quantity of 2.  instead i got a single broken lollipop in a plastic bag.  this was meant to be a gift for someone - albeit a gag gift - so now i will try to look for something similar from another vendor.  i would return this item for a refund, but to do so would be more expensive (& more of a hassle) than this is worth.
