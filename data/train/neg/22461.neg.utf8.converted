October 8, 2010. The Blue Buffalo Company of Wilton, Connecticut has announced a dog food recall of certain batches of some of its popular products due to potentially toxic levels of vitamin D.<br /><br />My dog got extremely sick, and was very upset to hear of this.  Only thing that changed with his diet/life was blue buffalo.  I literally almost lost my dog last week and had to have in surgery because his gallbladder was about to explode.  He quit eating completely, was throwing up, diarrhea, and took him to the vet to realize his liver was swollen and gallbladder had to come out.  It's sad to think you pay good money for dog food and you still could be feeding him poison.  I don't know how I will every trust dog food products anymore.  Please make sure there is no recalls on food you are feeding your dog.
