I was expecting a much different flavor from Dr. McDougalls Pad Thai. What I tasted was definitely not the flavor I wanted. There was not enough peanut flavor and not enough spice. I threw half of the noodles away. I will not recommend this to anyone. I would give this a 0 star review if it existed.
