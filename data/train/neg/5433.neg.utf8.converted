The product is YUMMY! and tasted even better since I got them from my local CVS store during Christmas time for $10 - so glad I bought more than one!  It seems to be strictly a seasonally stocked item, so normally I wouldn't mind paying a little more to be able to buy and enjoy them year round but a near 300% mark up...that's too big a bite even from a half pound reese's cup!
