Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.<br /><br />Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.<br /><br />I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way,<br />Fran B.
