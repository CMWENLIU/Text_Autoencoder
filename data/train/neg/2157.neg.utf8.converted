Ordered the item on the 7th.. wasnt shipped until the 14th!! WAY BEHIND THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE! They did not offer any compensation for my inconvenience. When asked if they would express ship the item, they responded "since we use proirity mail there is no guarenteed arrival date". RIDICULOUS. I got this item FINALLY on Friday Oct. 17th (10 days after it was ordered... 5 days after the promised time frame) Product is just so-so. It only comes in a silver packaging, with a home-made looking logo on the bag. No Nutritional info, no ingredients. The communication was also very poor. took 2 emails befoe i got a response.
