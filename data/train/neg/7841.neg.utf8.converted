I did not see a shipping cost for this time item until e-mail order confirmation was sent and noticed the shipping cost was as much as the product!  So much for a good deal...  Since it was within time specified by Amazon to cancel, I attempted to cancel; but it was processed anyway.  Not happy about this but will search for shipping cost before placing another order!  Buyer beware!
