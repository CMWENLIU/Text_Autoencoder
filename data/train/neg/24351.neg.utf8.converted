This Oskri Coconut and Dark Chocolate bar is far too sweet. The dark chocolate is more like milk chocolate, and the coconut is so sweet that it overpowers any chocolate taste and leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste. The same thing happens if I eat a Mounds bar, so I can only conclude that if you like Mounds, you will like this Oskri bar. I am not a fan of either!
