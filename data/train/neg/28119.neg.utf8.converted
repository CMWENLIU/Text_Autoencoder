I was told by my doctor to go off of milk for awhile, so I started looking around for some food products that didn't have any milk in them.  I happened to find this brand on Amazon.com, but you could only buy a case of 12 and I didn't want to get that many in case I didn't like it.  I actually happened to find it at the store so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />As I was making it, I thought it smelled quite good and I was anxious to taste it.  Well, I'm here to tell you, smells are deceiving.  I don't know how anybody thinks this actually tastes good.  It tastes just like metal and has a gritty texture like saw dust.  I have to laugh at the side panel because it says that Chreese sounds like "trees" and that no trees were chopped down to make the box.  I'm pretty sure I know what they used the trees for.<br /><br />I paid over $3 for the box--it's pretty expensive.  I didn't want to throw the rest of it away if I didn't have to so I dumped it back into the strainer and washed off all the Chreese.  The noodles taste fine, but the Chreese needs a complete makeover.
