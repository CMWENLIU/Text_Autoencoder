I read a really bad review of this but I'm trying all the GoPicnic meals so I tried it anyway.  There were more bad items than good in this, unfortunately.  The salmon was like a weird tasting, overly-fishy, lumpy soup. Gross! (And I love salmon in many shapes and forms!) I couldn't finish it and gave the majority to my dog.  Since that's the main value of the meal (protein) I found this GoPicnic meal to be of no value to me!  Anyway..The crackers were excellent (same ones as in a few other meals), the edamame was okay but bland (google the dangers of eating soybean for women...made me wary of eating this) and the dry fruit mix was rancid!  I double-checked the expiration date to make sure I didn't get a bad lot but it doesn't expire for several months.  I'm writing Amazon for a refund after my review.  It's too bad...I enjoyed the majority of the meals.
