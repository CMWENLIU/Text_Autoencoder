This is unlike any dry milk I've ever used.  It's a super fine texture, so that when I add it to something it turns into glue.  I have always used dry milk in my coffee; unlike half and half it doesn't go bad, and unlike instant creamer it's not artificial.  But this stuff is terrible.  I wish it wasn't so expensive or I'd just toss the bag.
