If you are watching what you eat and don't want to eat trans fats, then you should avoid this product or any other product that has partially hydrogenated oils in them. It's pretty fricking brilliant that the FDA allows a product to be labelled with 0 trans fat per serving when its actually about a half gram per serving. If the FDA really cared about this they would demand that labelling shows EXACTLY what is in the product. If you drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day with this stuff in it, you are getting a nice big dose of trans fat and doing yourself harm. This is not a liver friendly food. Eat liver friendly and you will live a long life. Your liver is the filter for the body. Just like a pool filter, once it gets clogged, it doesn't work good. Fortunately, the liver is one organ that can repair itself if you let it. Remember, eat liver friendly foods.
