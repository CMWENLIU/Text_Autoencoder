Read the fine print.  Looks like its coming from your local farm, "cage free" organic, but the back states in very fine print - "Made in China".  What's wrong with that you might ask? Well you read the reports about chicken jerk breast and dogs dropping dead from it, specifically from treats made in china.  Never again.
