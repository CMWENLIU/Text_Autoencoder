I was so excited to start making baby food...I diced my sweet potatoes into little bitty cubes, set up the Brezza, and everything appeared to be going fine...until I realized the blades weren't actually moving!  It steamed perfectly, but when it came time to blend, the Brezza made lots of noise but the blades didn't do anything!  So I had to whip out my old (non-BPA free!) food processor to finish making baby's food.  I was pretty annoyed...  Apparently I have a defective model; I have since contacted Brezza customer service, and I'm expecting a replacement unit shortly.  They also notified me that this unit is an older model, and they have since made improvements, so the replacement will be the newest model.  I'll update my review when I receive the new Brezza.
