These packages contain less than the ones I have bought at CostCo for several years and cost more, by the time you figure S/H.  Our store no longer carries them so I was happy to find them on Amazon.  The order arrived and I was shocked to find notice on the outside cartons that they are NOT a product of USA.  True, that info is in tiny font at the bottom of the printing on back of the packages but I had never noticed. I will not be buying these again and will read labels much more carefully in the future.
