Product of China.  Unhappy that the other reviewers did not mention this as it is clearly labeled on the back of the individual packs and the cardboard box that the packs are sealed in.  If "Product of China" was included in the item description or shown in the picture of the item, I would not have purchased.  I can't comment on taste since item went into a basket instead of my mouth.  But to try to be fair,  the labeling is all in English and states  "produced on HACCP certified site" and "best before date 03.15.2013."  Unable to return this item per "returns are easy."
