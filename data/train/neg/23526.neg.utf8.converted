Maybe there's no sugar, but that does that make it pure?  I just opened a can of this stuff.  I noticed a strange taste.  It tasted sort of the way tires smell.<br />After a 2 spoonfuls I decided something was definitely not good.  I checked the can, and SURPRISE!  it is made in China. After the Chinese pet food additive scandal that caused the death of so many pets in the US, and of babies in China, I won't eat food that I know is produced there.  Is there a reason to trust their food controls? And who knows what caused the acrid taste in this product.
