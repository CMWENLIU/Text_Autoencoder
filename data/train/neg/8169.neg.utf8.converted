I wanted to like these crackers, given the awesome nutritional profile and ingredients.  I would say two and a half stars, and it's because the idea is great but the execution is not so good.  I'm just unhappy that I'm stuck with five more bags of these things.<br /><br />There are two primary weaknesses:<br /><br />1) Lack of flavor.  I think I need to try the other cracker flavors, because these are just whole flaxseeds with some Bragg Liquid Aminos (soy sauce, basically) and lemon juice, and the flavor is just not enough for me.<br /><br />2) Awful chewing experience.  When you eat one of these, the flaxseeds stick. Everywhere. Between your teeth. On the roof of your mouth. Lodged around your jaw.  Really, it takes a long time to feel like you don't have flax embedded everywhere in your mouth.  Not a very social snack, for this reason.<br /><br />I hope they keep working on this, as the idea is good.
