I usually don't write reviews b'cos my feelings, whether good or bad, have never been strong enough to  write a review. until now that is. this must be the worst cereal ever made. they look like cheerios but taste nothing like cheerios. I added liberal doses of honey to try and get through one bowl and couldn't. The cereal also has a funky smell (kind of like wet cardboard). amazon does not accept returns on this item so beware about buying pack of 6. I am sticking with chex (gluten-free) for now.
