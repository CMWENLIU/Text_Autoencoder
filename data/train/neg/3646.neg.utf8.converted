I grew up in SE Alaska back in the 70's when the transportation infrastructure was not as good as it is today.  Sometimes, things like fresh meats, fruits, vegetables, and dairy were a bit expensive back then.  While fried Spam was not a staple back then for us, it was definitely a regular on the menu.<br /><br />Now in my mid 30s, I work a lot of late nights and was looking for something quick and easy to eat, yet actually has protein and is filling.  Walking down the grocery aisle, it jumped out at me, viola, Spam.<br /><br />While it no longer sports its key that you used to tear away that thin strip of metal, it was just as I remembered.  However, I no longer had the metabolism of a child.  I am already festively plump, so I figured I better lay off the blue Spam.<br /><br />So I decided to give the Turkey Spam a try.  At about half the calories and much less fat, how could I go wrong.<br /><br />What separates Spam from the cheap Wal-Mart knock off for me is that Spam has a nice firm texture which other imitation brands do not seem to have.  While I would give the taste of the Turkey Spam 4 stars, the texture was terrible.  The texture was soft and mushy, much like the imitation Spam products.  Personally, it reminded me of eating a can of cat food.  After eating a few slices, I could not bring myself to finish the can.  I did not try frying it.  Perhaps some further cooking would firm it up a bit.<br /><br />If you are a Spam addict and figure you need to shave some calories out of your diet, it is definitely worth a try.  The taste was not bad at all.  However, if the texture of your mystery meat products is important to you, I'd probably stick to Spam blue.
