I've been using Avoderm formula for awhile now.  I just recently purchased a bag locally of this particular product (note the new packaging).  Had I not been stressing the importance of ingredients to a friend of mine, I wouldn't have noticed the following on the label:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Whole Corn, Corn Gluten Meal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Ground Whole Brown Rice, Oatmeal<br /><br />These are the first six items that make up this cat food.  Not chicken, but chicken meal (ground up meat, organs and bone)...followed by two corn products.  This is terrible and I am already returning the food I have purchased.  Avoderm, you should be ashamed of yourself for this unconscionable change in your, heretofore, excellent formula.
