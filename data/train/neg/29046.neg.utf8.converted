Ok, for starters I have personally spoken to the guy that owns this company and had asked him about some nutrition information about his product. Needless to say I was treated like a 2nd class citizen and was told not to call him and bother him any more! WHAT?!?!?!?! I did further research and many of the ingredients in this product are NO BETTER than a FRAPACHINO from STARBUCKS! I train for fitness/figure competitions and can tell you first had this product is full of crap ingredients. Save your money and the deciet and go to Starbucks, at least you know what you are getting there and WITH A SMILE! :-)
