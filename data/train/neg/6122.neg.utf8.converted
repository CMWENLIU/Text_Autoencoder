We have a 9 week old kitten that we recently adopted from the local pound and she's been eating the pellets, which we think is causing her to have diarrhea.  We just discovered that she's been pooing under the coach as well.  Maybe Feline Pine is good for certain cats, but not this one.  Also doesn't seem to absorb the smell very well.<br /><br />.....<br /><br />UPDATE:  It turns out our kitten had coccidia, which was causing her diarrhea.  Perhaps she was eating the pellets because of condition - I'm not sure.  We stopped using the product in any case.
