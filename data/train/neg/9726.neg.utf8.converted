I am not a finicky eater, and I love most soups. This stuff is terrible. Very thin consistancy, very few potatoes, an occasional bit of celery, ALOT of clam grit. I don't mind an occasional CRUNCH with my clam chowder, but with EVERY bit of clam? The taste is so bland (well of course - low sodium) I am giving the remaining cans to our local food bank. I am not even going to waste my time trying to "doctor it up." Weird that I feel guilty about donating food, but there it is.
