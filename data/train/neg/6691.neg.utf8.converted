I felt like the information about this product was a little misleading, once it arrived.  Maybe it ships as 5 pounds, but it's just over a pound of product in actuality.  I'm glad it shipped free, because the individual pieces were marked "3/99cents....which makes the $9.49 price slightly MORE than retail.<br /><br />Then when I tried one, it was crunchy, which tells me this is not fresh product.  Still edible?  Absolutely.  Still the Laffy Taffy banana flavor I like?  Absolutely, but I won't be buying this again.  I live in Alaska, and I can buy over-priced candy right here at home.
