I drink chai in all of its forms, from the Masala to the Oregonian to the Starbuckian.  The Indian recipes have always been my favorite, and as I ran out of the Masala Chai my daughter brought me back from India I began looking for a rich replacement.  In the end I came to these Amazon reviews and offerings, and ultimately ordered the Wagh Bakri bags.<br /><br />Their chai is, in my opinion, mediocre at best.  Heavily colored, with strong black tea but less of the spice recipe that makes chai a delicious adventure.  It is certainly not "India's Best Tea", and I won't be ordering this item again.
