I ordered this chocolate because my highly allergic child cannot eat milk products. When the description indicated the chocolate is lactose free and "Vegan" (which usually means no animal products - including dairy) I was thrilled. Like another customer, I was sorely disappointed. Unfortuately I did not read the fine print on the wrapper until after my daughter had eaten some and had severe gastro problems afterwards. Amazon please fix the misleading description.
