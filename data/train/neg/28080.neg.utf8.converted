We breed and raise cats who are typically not picky eaters. We purchased a case each of the large cans of Venison, Beef and Duck. The cats wont eat any of the three varieties. The food is very solid with a paste consistency. It also smells unpleasant. It is an expensive product with supposedly higher/better nutritional value. But, if the cats wont eat it, it has no value at all. When I called to talk with the manufacturer, they said they'd let some one know my complaint. Since they didn't take my name or contact info, I doubt they'll do anything. If you are wanting to try this food, go to the pet store and buy one can to try it out. Dont get stuck with 3 cases as we did.
