I like kimchee and I enjoy cooking, so this looked like an interesting experiment. Well, now I know.<br /><br />My first suspicion came when I saw that this slim package, just a few tablespoons, alleged to season five pounds (over 2 kg) of cabbage. I like big flavors, so I figured I'd just use more. Then, the first step in preparation wilts the cabbage by soaking it for a few hours in salt water - a process that left a strong salty flavor that won't rinse off. It took some effort to get the lumps out of the mix, when I added the water it calls for, and finally figured the small ones remaining would dissolve on their own. The final product is what counts, though - I just didn't like it. It doesn't have the tang I want, it does have a sweetness I don't look for in kimchee, the spicy flavor doesn't come across as fresh, and I just don't care for the taste.<br /><br />So, I'll try another kimchee mix if I find one. I won't try this again. I hate wasting food, but I'm not sure I'll be able to finish this batch. I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
