I was counting on a big bag of salted macadamias, shame on me for not doing more research. These nuts taste great, but had I known they weren't salted, I wouldn't have made this purchase. I won't say it was a deceptive description, but if you are looking for Mauna Loa style dry roasted salted nuts, do not order this product. The product page does not indicate they are unsalted.
