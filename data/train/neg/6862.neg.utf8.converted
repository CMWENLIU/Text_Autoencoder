It's back at Costco!  For those of you who were so disappointed when Costco discontinued this cornbread, which is the very best, weep no more.  I visited my local Western PA Costco yesterday and lot and behold, there it was.  For what I paid to get it through Amazon's vendor, I could have bought at least two in the store.
