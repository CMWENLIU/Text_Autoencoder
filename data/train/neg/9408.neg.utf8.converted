I am puzzled by the rave reviews - I was not especially impressed.  Maybe I had a bad batch.  But I have had PHENOMENAL Maple Syrup that tasted literally like butter - homemade on the farm in upper State New York.  Admittedly nothing else compares but this stuff was pretty tasteless - Spring Tree is at least one star better.  I would not order again -<br /><br />BTW - I don't think syrup s/b left in these plastic containers - I suggest moving them to glass asap.  I notice my other one picked up the taste of the plastic (I gave the Brown Family away so I did not have it that long).
