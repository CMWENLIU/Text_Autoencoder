Ever since finding pandan flavored ice cream at a Thai fusion cafe across from my university, I've been obsessed with trying to find pandan to make my own. I took a chance with this product and bought 6 bottles, mainly because it was so cheap. I hugely regret it. The product lists sorbitol as its primary ingredient and I would suspect that green food coloring comes in second. The flavor itself is weak and artificial and does not at all resemble the magical, toasty, vanilla-y flavor that I so desperately crave. If you're looking for even a halfway decent pandan extract, avoid this at all costs!
