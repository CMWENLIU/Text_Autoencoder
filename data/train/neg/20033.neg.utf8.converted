I've been buying KAL stevia for awhile now with good results but now I decided to go cheap and buy 1 lb of this stuff thinking it would be pretty much the same. Nope... It's way weaker than KAL and takes 3-4x as much so even though I saved 50 percent I'll be wasting more money using more of the product. Oh well. I'll use it up and buy KAL again.
