I was really hopeful when I ordered these Fruit Slices.  It had been a long time since I had eaten any Fruit Slices, and was hoping to spark a delicious memory from my childhoood!  BUT, I was so disappointed when I ate my first slice - yes, I ate the entire piece, HOPING that the flavor would get better, but alas, the flavor did not improve.  The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit.  I took one bite tastes of the other flavors, and couldn't tell much difference in any of the flavors, other than a bitter, sour fruit taste.  So - save your money, and look for a different brand of fruit slices to buy!
