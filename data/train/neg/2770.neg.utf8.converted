The tarrazu coffee is my favorite but I normally buy from world market. This Tarrazu from coffee bean direct doesn't have a good flavor or smell. I also have to use twice as much to even come close to the boldness I like from the world market coffee. I bought 5 lbs and will probably throw it away, it is not worth it.
