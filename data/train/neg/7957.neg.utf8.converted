I bought these and the unsalted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.<br /><br />If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg ([...]), which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.<br /><br />If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back.<br /><br />It's been a while since I wrote this review and today, 4/9/2011 someone commented about my original review and the higher cost of the Williamsburg Brand peanuts. Of course, generally speaking, unfortunate as it may be, we often must pay more for healthier foods. Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to update my review. If there's a Costco near you, there's a Kirkland Brand salted peanut that they sell, in a rather large can. The peanuts are pure and unadulterated and only roasted in peanut oil; no unhealthy cottonseed oil like the Planter's. And, they are, I'm confident either less expensive or most certainly much more cost competitive than the Williamsburg brand to which I alluded in my earlier review. So, in this particular case, provided one has access to a Costco, one need not pay more for a healthier peanut.
