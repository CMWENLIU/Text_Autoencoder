I tried this bread mix for the first time a couple days ago, and followed the directions, faithfully. I did not use a bread machine, but otherwise, followed the optional directions to make it by hand. It turned out to be an extremely heavy brick, uncooked in the middle.  Tried to eat it anyways, but it was so damp and uncooked, had to give up.  Horrible!
