I agree with Lynnette Layton,  I find this to be totally tasteless.<br />I feel I'm just pouring on yellow water to my food. I also bought the cruet and mixing bottle for ten dollars, and one packet of this in the cruet bottle makes so little, I  needed half of it for one ear of corn on the cob.  No wonder they only sell it in mass quantities.<br />I feel I 've lost $27.  I find the sprinkle bottle to be better.
