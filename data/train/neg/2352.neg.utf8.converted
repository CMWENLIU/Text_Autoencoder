I was really looking forward to trying this, but it tasted like a bunch of raw ginger put through a juicer & heated up (and I followed the preparation instructions). I coudn't taste any lemon at all. I do use ginger from time to time, so I am not anti-ginger, but this tasted terrible & upset my stomach.<br /><br />If you decide to try this, I hope you REALLY like ginger.
