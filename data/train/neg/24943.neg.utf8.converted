After searching reviews on amazon, I chose to order this brand due to name recongnition and high reviews on this particular brand, La Tienda. The picture shows 3 cans of La Tienda, but what you get is another brand entirely: some brand called SPP, different tin, different label, different brand. Not affiliated whatsoever with La Tienda. Futhermore, the picture clearly shows a variety pack- one can of HOT one can of SWEET and one can of BITTERSWEET. I got three cans of HOT.<br /><br />Since the packaging is entirely in spanish, I cannot discern if this is a reputable brand or producer, nor can I know if this brand is a cheap substitute for the brand I thought I was getting. Since I am not an expert on Spanish Smoked Paprika, I decided to just go with a seemingly well known brand and not take a chance on a brand I never heard of. For all I know this could be a store brand or generic and not produced to the standards of the brand he is advertising.<br /><br />Seller needs to take down the picture and relist with what you are actually getting. If you are brand conscious, go elsewhwere. The brand I received, "SPP" is not being sold by any one on amazon, and I can't actually find ANY information about this brand at all.
