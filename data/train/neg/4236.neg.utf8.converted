It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap.
