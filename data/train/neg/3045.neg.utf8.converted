With all the rave reviews, I was really excited about these gummy bears.  The flavor is good, but the texture is what really turns me on to gummy candy.  Unfortunately these were too chewy for me and they didn't go over well with my friends either.  I guess it's all about personal preference.  I'll look elsewhere for my candy.
