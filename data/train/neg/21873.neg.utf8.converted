I had high hopes for this, but sadly the bag this tea came in was torn completely opened and the tea inside was spoiled and stale.  I know what stale matcha tastes like, and this product tastes like it has been sitting exposed to air for months. Not only is the tea undrinkable due to the spoiled taste, but it loses its health benefits after being exposed to air. I'm very sad about this, because I have liked other products from this company in the past.<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER. If this company wants to make good, they should refund or replace for anyone who has received a defective product.
