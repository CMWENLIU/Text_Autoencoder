I can't figure out what these things are!  They have the texture of a cracker, but have a sweetness on the outside like a cookie.  They kinda have these chunks of stuff in them - fig I guess - but they're not sweet, really, not do they add much flavor.  They're really crumbly and thin and look like they need to be dipped in something or covered in something - but they're not.  They're like a bland cracker-cookie thing and I just don't get it.<br />-<br />Sorry, I'm not a fan of these things.  These are like crackers with a sweetness on the outer part with chewy bits of whatever distributed throughout.  The bits of fig stuck to my teeth really badly - which was bizarre.  The cookie themselves have a very crumbly texture and break up in your mouth into nothingness.  No real strong flavor here and hardly sweet at all.  The term "fruit" is used loosely here, as the "fruit" is just these tiny bits throughout each cracker-cookie that you can barely taste anyway.  PASS.<br />***<br />Update:  I'm giving these 1 star.  Been eating them for a week now and they're just terrible.  I keep trying them, hoping they'll grow on me, but the weird texture and stuff sticking to my teeth have made me grown to hate them.  These are garbage.<br />***
