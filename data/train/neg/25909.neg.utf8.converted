I honestly don't get the popularity of this item. It is nothing more than B complex in liquid form. I guess it's something to take if you don't carry around a small bottle of B vitamins. Maybe I drink too much coffee and that is why I can't appreciate the energy effects of a B complex, I think taurine and guarana are much better energy sources. Whether you prefer B vits, caffeine, taurine or guarana, below are products that will give you what this product gives you(or more) at a much more reasonable price.<br /><br />B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020HQAU">B-100 Complex 100 caps</a><br />Super Stress B Complex 100 Caps<br /><br />Liquid B supplements:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NOUDE">Nature's Bounty B-Complex Sublingual Liquid 2 fl oz (59 ml)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00125W1AO">World Organic - Liquid B Complex, 16 fl oz liquid</a><br /><br />Caffeine, Taurine & Guarana:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTM0WK">Red Bull Energy Drink, Sugarfree, 8.4 Ounce Can (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O4YC">Diet Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DNBYXK">Monster Lo-carb Energy 16-Ounce., 27.5 LBS Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQSQ68">NOW Foods Taurine Pure Powder, 8-Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000703AU0">Super Guarana 1200mg - 90 tabs,(Good N' Natural)</a><br /><br />Personally, I  think it's silly to cough up two dollars for one shot of this when you can have the same level of energy, through the same vitamins at a much cheaper price.
