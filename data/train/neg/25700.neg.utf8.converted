I agree with the other reviews--great product.<br /><br />BUT, when the product is packaged in a box so useless, i wont ever buy again.  The parchment is supposed to be ripped along the side of the box.  You know: where other boxes have a jagged edge?  This has NOTHING.  Seriously, they expect you to rip the parchment along the bare edge of the flimsy cardboard box holding it.  It never works...i've had friends and family take shots at it.  So far NO ONE has been able to get a straight tear...<br /><br />So if you get this, be sure to have scissors nearby!  :(
