Hi,<br /><br />I have tried both the armonioso and the arabica capsules. The price is better than original nespresso's and they are "greener" but that is the end of the story for me since:<br /><br />1. Taste is for me only at minimum quality and therefore not comparable with the original nespresso capsules that I have tasted. Taste is of course different from person to person.<br /><br />2. I have a Citiz and when I put a capsule in the machine I have to press down the handle with a force that to me seems too much in relation to what is good for the machine. If you take one of these capsules appart you will see that just beneath the visible outer filter is a HARD plastic element, whereas the original nespresso capsules are only made of soft material. I guess this is why you have to press down the handle very hard. As you might have noticed the machine pops rectangular holes in the the capsule. I am affraid I will bend or break some plastic part in the machine.<br /><br />3. When the machine starts to "shoot" water through the capsule it hesitates for a second or two and then it says pop. During this second or two no coffee comes out, only water. After the pop coffee comes out instead. At the same time the flow of the coffee is VERY RANDOM, which means that every cup will be different from the other. There is even less coffee coming out of the machine because of the hesitation and the random flow, compared to an original nespresso capsule.<br /><br />In conclusion; with less coffee per capsule, random taste, and a questionable use of force to put the handle down, the lower price makes these cheaper capsules no longer attractive to me. One star is given for the green concept, but there is a limit of how much you want to sacrifice to go green. It should be noted, that all this could of course be because of my Citiz and how it is constructed compared to other Nespresso machine models.
