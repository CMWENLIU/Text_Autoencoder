I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there, and love eating the powder raw. But Nutiva's product does not taste good at all, compared to the other products it tastes like dirt, and its not milled to a fine powder, its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything. The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands. If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest or Ruth's Hemp Protein. I eat hemp religiously so trust me, take my advice and avoid this one. Bottoms Up! Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there, and easy to digest.
