This product says "Jolly Rancher FRUIT CHEWS".......I received the HARD CANDY. I called the Customer Service as soon as I received the wrong thing and asked for her to send me the CORRECT type of candy. She said they didn't have anything but HARD CANDY.....SOOOOOO It's definitely false advertisement because it CLEARLY states "FRUIT CHEWS" when you are ordering. I was buying this for my mom for Christmas because it's her favorite candy and I couldn't find them in any store and apparently I can't even trust to buy them on the internet anymore either. SO RIDICULOUS!!!! Needless to say, mom didn't get her candy for Christmas~ I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE TO BUY THIS PROIDUCT if you're wanting fruit chews.....because you won't get it.
