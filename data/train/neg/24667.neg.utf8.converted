I ended up throwing it all way -- all 25 lbs of my order after I used a few pounds of it to make my grandmother's recipe for posole. It just wasn't TRUE posole. Although it resembled the creamy white kernels in appearance (except the kernels were a bit rounded and too fat at the germ), the taste was completely wrong.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't posole and I couldn't eat it. I believe this corn is used for Ecuadorean food -- definitely not Mexican -- and certainly not posole. What a disappointment that this company (who does have lovely offerings on their web site) is passing this product off, perhaps unintentionally, as something it certainly isn't. Yeah, I should have tried to return it, but I was so disgusted. It took me a while to get my perspective back -- I mean, it was only corn... I'm better now...  :]
