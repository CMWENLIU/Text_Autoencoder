I bought this food because it seemed like an excellent choice of food for my cats. I gradually switched from Eukanuba to Innova Evo about three months ago because I wanted to provide better nutrition for my cats. Three of the cats adjusted well to the new food, but the fourth cat, Gutterball, started developing what seemed like ulcers or sores on her chin and on the top of her head. I immediately took her to the vet, and she was diagnosed with Acne caused by an allergic reaction to the new food. After a course of antibiotics, some acne medication,and switching their food back to Eukanuba, Gutterball is back to normal again. I still think that Innova Evo is a great cat food choice, but beware that some cats might get a bad reaction to it.
