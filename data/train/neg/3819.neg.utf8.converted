these are not waterproof or durable. the boots get holes in them and the velcro strap comes apart. this is an overpriced cheap product. I bought these for a lot less and wanted to buy more because they do not last. When I saw the price for these I thought maybe it was a different product than the ones I had, but it is the same thing. They might last a month if you don't use them every day. I used mine to walk my dog in the snow and at least one got holes and fell apart within a couple of weeks.
