I loved these since they are so convenient.  I hate powder formula since I always have problems with clumps and they are messy.  It was so nice to just open one of these rather having to mix and shake and get powder all over the place.  And they carry so well....alas, due to the BPA chemical leaching issue, I switched to powder again.  I hope they switch to BPA free containers.
