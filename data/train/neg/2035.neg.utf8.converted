I can't say the coffee tastes BAD as far as coffees go, plain coffees. But I ordered Irish Creme flavor, and Irish Creme it Ain't. Not at ALL. You really have to search for even a hint of ANY flavoring, and even then you catch maybe a hint of creamy something, and an even tinier suggestion of rum or something. But no Irish Creme. Not at all.<br />Very disappointing since it's nearly impossible to find Irish Creme in any local stores, and that is why I resorted to ordering it from here and from what seemed to be a respectable brand in the first place. Only I didn't find it here either as it turns out. Blah.<br />I guess the search goes on. Only now I have to figure out what to do with the other three bags...
