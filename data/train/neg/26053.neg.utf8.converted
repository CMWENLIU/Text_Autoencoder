I agree with the two most recent reviews...I have been ordering this product through subscribe and save for about a year now and have gone through several cases of delicious creamy coconut milk. In May Amazon had a discount on this product so I ordered two cases, and so far the first few cans we have opened have been very disappointing. I too noticed a difference upon shaking the can, it was very liquidy and not at all how it used to feel. Upon opening it, there was no cream, it was very runny and looked oily. I didn't notice a bad taste with it, but it is nothing like the product I was used to. Tonight I used it to make coconut milk ice cream, and it was very gritty, not creamy, and never even froze in the ice cream maker like it used to (it was very runny upon scooping it out). I am very disappointed in the change in this product and will be looking for a new brand.
