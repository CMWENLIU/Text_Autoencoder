I recieved these as a brithday gift.  I was really excited because I love chocolate covered coffee beans, and I received 6 bags.  After eating a few, though, I'm disappointed.  The chocolate is good but it's a moot point if the beans are too hard.  They don't have a good coffee flavor, because you can't chew them up.  And your mouth and teeth are left with little bean shards to finish.
