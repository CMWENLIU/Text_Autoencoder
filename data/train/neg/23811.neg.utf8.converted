Flowering tea is a nice gift idea, so I bought five of these based on the ratings here. Big mistake. What you get is a cheaply made, garish box that is stuffed with a lot of cardboard shred. This all comes packed inside an outer cardboard box. Somewhere in the middle of all this cheesy packaging is a Dollar Store quality glass teapot and a small box of flowering tea. I am embarassed to give this as a gift. I took the tea out of the box and put it in a small gift bag. I will recycle as much of the pile of packaging junk as possible. A complete waste of money and even though it is mostly packaging, Amazon calls it "grocery" and I cannot return it. Please don't waste your money on this one.
