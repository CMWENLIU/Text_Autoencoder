The switch to organic is a good step, but Rice Dream rice milk is chalky and too sugary - 23 grams of carbohydrates per serving!  That's close to the sugars in a soda.  A person could get a sugar high or go into sugar shock (if diabetic) with this level of sugar.  I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.  You can even mix the two and even add some rice milk, but rice milk alone is too high in sugars.
