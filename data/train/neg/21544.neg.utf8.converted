I love the speed and agility, as it were, of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto brewer. I accept the limitations as a trade-off for convenience. I do not like this flavor.<br /><br />Not every product can be translated into a single-cup device. In this case, the process for making the drink is the same for the other two-capsule drinks (cappuccino, latte machiatto and others). However, the goal here is to create a kind of frothy hot chocolate. It does that as it should. The problem is the taste.<br /><br />A good hot chocolate earns its designation by using good chocolate and good milk. This provided neither. It tastes artificial on every level.<br /><br />At least the coffee products they offer use real coffee. Those resemble more of a better version of a gas station cappuccino. The Chococino resembles hot chocolate made from Count Chocula cereal.<br /><br />--Brockeim
