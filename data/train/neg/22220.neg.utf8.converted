I expected 96 k-cups of donut house coffee and got 4 boxes of 24 count flavored coffees. Seller needs to be more specific on what buyer is getting. Sent it back and got an e-mail confirmation that I will get a refund in about 10 business days. Can't understand why refunds take so long after they receive the item back.
