I'm so glad I read the label before drinking this! I did taste it though, it's HORRIBLE and spit it in the sink, the aftertaste is hard to get rid of even if you don't swallow it. This can has a whopping 66 grams of sugar which would have put me in a sugar coma for a day, hardly something that would give anyone long term energy just a big fat sugar crash. It doesn't even taste good, so why would anyone put this crap in their body? It has lots of caffeine and 260 empty calories per can. There are supposedly two servings per can so if you down this whole can know that you double all the amounts on the label. There is no good reason to consume this stuff.
