I found the granola itself to be very delicious and it is exactly what I wanted. the chocolate element makes it just indulgent enough so I'll be motivated to eat breakfast and not skip it. Considering I ordered this "bulk" item, I thought the expiration date would be like 2010 or 2011. However, it expires in September! It gives me like two or three months to finish the boxes. I thought that was kind of ridiculous.
