I bought these mints some time ago, and while the "mint" itself has no real anise flavour (they are quite bland actually), I really bought them for the tin, which is beautiful. If you want actual absinthe flavoured mints, these will disappoint, but if you are like me and wanted the lovely tin for later use, then it's worth the purchase price.
