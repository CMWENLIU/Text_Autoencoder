If there is no wholesome food available, this could do.  However, this is high in salt, low in fiber, high in carbohydrates (tastes like sweet candy), and uses highly processed ground turkey.  Even gourmet pet food offers real chunks of meat.  This is supposed to be for advanced babies, but it's mushy with bits of ground turkey and corn kernel peels.  It would be good to see more WHOLE bits of food, less salt, less sweetness, more fiber, and cuts of real meat (not highly processed ground mystery turkey) with more meat.  It is healthier for me to use frozen vegetables with meat than this Sprout concoction.  They get two stars for trying to be organic.
