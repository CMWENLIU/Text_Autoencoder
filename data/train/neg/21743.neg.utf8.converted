There's something funny going on when your main soup ingredient is listed almost dead last on the list, right before caramel color. Three lumps of textured vegetable protein, no bigger than a fly... they're saying this is turtle? Are they using the water from a snapper's territory to make the broth? Looks like the supply of turtle meat has dried up.<br /><br />This soup is for all intents and purposes vegetarian, but with almost no protein. It's still somewhat tasty but without meat you're just having a bowl of gravy for lunch.
