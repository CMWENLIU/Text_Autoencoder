I'm a little disappointed in this gum. The pieces (indivudal "chiclets" in a blister pack)  are tiny (expect to pop at least 2) and the flavour blows out pretty quickly. I have been chewing Trident "mini sticks" for some time. They too use Xylitol as the sweetener but retain their consistency and flavour for much longer than Xlichew.<br /><br />Even the initial flavour of Xylichew is pretty weak compared to Trident.<br /><br />I likely won't be buying Xylichew again.
