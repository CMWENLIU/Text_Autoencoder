If you like Chai, don't waste your money on this.  I love Tazo, Oregon, & Pacific Chai, but this is watery and just plain nasty.  My nephew's a Chai addict, and he dumped his down the sink -- you know it's bad when a 17 year old won't drink it.  When made in an 8oz cup, it's basically colored water -- a little better if you only run 6oz of water through your machine.  I won't be buying this again.
