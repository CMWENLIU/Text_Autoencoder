The worst raspberry salad dressing available. The flavors (olive oil?) are fighting each other. It smells atrocious... like someone's dirty feet after pouring vinegar on them. And the odor lingers in the air, driving you to distraction.<br /><br />It will certainly make you wash your dishes quickly. There are amazing Raspberry salsad dressing put there. This isn't one. Disgusting
