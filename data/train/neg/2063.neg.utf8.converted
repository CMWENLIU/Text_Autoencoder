I ordered these seeds hoping to save money by buying in bulk. I  ordered seeds with other companies and had no problems. Then, I ordered these seeds.<br /><br />The seeds in the bag look like they are 2-3 years old. Right away I noticed the grass was really MOLDY.<br /><br />The grass grows very SLOWLY and is very THIN.<br /><br />The grass never really produces enough for a satisfying amount of wheatgrass juice.<br /><br />I contacted the company hoping I could exchange the seeds for a different batch of seeds. The company never responded.<br /><br />I will avoid doing business with this company. Bad service and even worse product. These worst wheatgrass seeds I have ever bought.
