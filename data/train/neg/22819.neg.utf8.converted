Who would pay these prices,  this stufff is fantastic, but I want any of you who have a Publix near by to go there for it......  I just purchased,  they come packaged 2-  5oz servings for 3.50......  I just spent ten bucks on 30oz,  and this site is trying to sell me 25oz for 35.00????  What a rip off.  That said this stuff is fantastic and addicitve.....  well behaved princes and princesses will even eat it.  Flaky, not dry.... just yummy.
