Day One: Treats devoured with alacrity by our two, treat-loving, non-finicky felines.<br />Day Two: Seemed to enjoy pretty well.<br />Day Three: Enjoyment/interest/speed of devouring definitely on the wane.<br />Day Four: Even though hungry, some treats left uneaten.<br />Day Five: One or two treats reluctantly gnawed; the rest totally ignored.<br />Day Six: After not even a week's trial, the jury is in: GUILTY of being the worst treats ever.<br /><br />I'm going to have to sneak these not-cheap nuggets into the cats' occasional offerings of "kitty crack" (aka Fancy Feast) if they're going to get eaten. Two paws (and their humans' thumbs) most definitely DOWN.
