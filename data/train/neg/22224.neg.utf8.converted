The dog food:  Great stuff.  Both my dogs go crazy when I give it to them.  It gets high marks from dog food reviewers on the net, too.  One thing -- know that it comes from Thailand.  I'm very careful about dog food and treats because more and more seem to be coming from China.  My final rule is -- would I eat something from that country myself?  I would/do eat from Thailand, so in this case it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />This particular supplier:  Please, please, PLEASE be careful when you purchase.  They show a full sized can but IT IS NOT!  These are very, very small 2.8 cans.
