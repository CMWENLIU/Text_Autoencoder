Yeah, it's a a cheap wire basket made in China.  It's job isn't glamorous, and it didn't cost much.<br /><br />But I expected a cheap wire basket...not a cheap, rusted wire basket.<br /><br />The rust doesn't cover the entire thing...just parts of the legs.  I have a $300 Nespresso machine that looks pretty good on my desk...Don't want a rusted wire basket sitting next to it.  I'm going to just throw this thing out and get a pencil holder or something to keep my pods in.
