My rating does not reflect this product at all.  I give the product a "10".  They are delicious and addicting.  :)  I give the product a low rating due to the seller's price for the product.  I hope people are not actually paying this price.  You can find this same brand in a 32 oz (2-lb) bag at most Costco's for $9.55.  If your Costco does not carry them or your store does not carry them, you can politely ask and your store will likely start.  I was appalled to see this seller has these for such a high price.  I love this product and Amazon, but I will make of note of the seller and never purchase from them.<br /><br />After further review I see Brookside is actually selling this product on Amazon for more than stores charge for the very same product.  I expect more out of a company then to try to swindle their consumers with excessive prices.  I understand the whole concept of saving by buying in bulk, but 100% markup to the direct public seems extreme.
