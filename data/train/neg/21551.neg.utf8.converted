My husband has one of the Hamilton Beach One Cup Coffee makers that uses Senseo pods.  So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.
