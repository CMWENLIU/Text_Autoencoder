I must say the whipped peanut butter bars are amazing and only 100 calories but the Protein Fit Peanut Butter bars that I used to love are not very good at all anymore. They are not horrible but they are nothing like they were. They just don't taste as peanut buttery anymore; more cardboardish than they used to. They are also much smaller. I am operating under the assumption that there used to be a lot more calories in that thing than 140 because it's much worse and smaller now for the same amount of calories. This is very disappointing because that bar used to be my favorite. I was so excited when it came back that I ordered 8 boxes. Disappointment!!
