This stuff is absolutely horrible tasting, and not just one batch from one seller.  Over the past 14 months, I have had Gevalia's 12-oz. "Morning Roast" for Tassimo several times, and purchased it from Wal-Mart, the local grocery, Kohl's and even once through Tassimo Direct.  Not only was it metallic-tasting weak coffee every single time, but about 30% of the T-discs end up clogging about halfway through the brew cycle, and when they finally let loose, almost all of the grounds come squirting out into my coffee cup, ruining it anyway.  This is not a brewer problem (have cleaned and de-scaled both of my brewers), nor a water problem, as I use bottled water for coffee.  The worst part is that when you try to get any satisfaction from Tassimo, or even try to report that there's a problem with these particular discs, their idiot customer service people just want to refer you to the espresso disc recall!  I will not buy any more Gevalia branded coffee.
