I bought this food due to the high quality food content, but the pellets were so hard my 16 year old cat would not touch them.  I gave the food to a friend with younger cats, thinking strong teeth would be better suited to this item--but they had no interest in the food either.  They actually removed it from the bowl and ate only their regular food, which was mixed in to make the transfer to a new food easier. I finally ended up putting it outside for the neighborhood feral cat.  He ate it.  But then, I suspect he is starving.  (I live in a very rural area where no shelters exist or I would make an effort to help him; as it is, I just feed him.) Maybe another of the Blue Buffalo products would work, but I opted for Purina One Beyond for my cat which is available at my local stores, costs considerably less, also contains nutritious food and was an instant hit here with my old kitty.  My cat does have a sensitive stomach, and the Purina caused no stomach distress.  I cannot attest to the Blue Buffalo on that count as she would not eat it at all.
