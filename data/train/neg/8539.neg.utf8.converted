I ordered three solid chocolate bunnies for Easter for my wife and kids. They arrived today; all three are broken, one is broken in more than one place. Each bunny was wrapped in clear foil and loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. They were then placed in a cardboard box where there was enough room for them to float around freely. Apparently they did. Broken chocolate bunnies. After paying $60 I would expect they would spend 50 cents to add enough bubble wrap and/or cardboard protection so that UPS couldn't (easily) break the bunnies. Guess not. Crap. Now I don't have anything special for Easter and I'm out $60. Do not buy from this vendor; it's at best a crap shoot.
