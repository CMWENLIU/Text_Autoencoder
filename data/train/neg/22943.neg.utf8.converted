I saw the commercials and though that this would be something great to try, something to add flavor to water and sugar free. I should have realized that sugar free means artificial sweeteners. Going off of the ads, I added some MIO to a glass of water. Of course I could barely taste anything so I added more. I couldn't tell that it was sweet tea. All I could taste was those nasty artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />I tried different amounts and numerous glassed of water thinking that it might be that I put too much or too little in the water. None of it helped. It was so bad that my stomach was rolling after attempting a couple glasses. Now, a different flavor might be more for me. But after this experience, I think I'm just going to not ever think about buying any more.<br /><br />I'm sure if you like Crystal Light and other diet drinks you will enjoy this. Personally, I think the headaches I get from horrible artificial sweeteners is a good sign to stay away from MIO. I'm glad that I got this for free from the Vine Program or I would have been upset to have wasted my money.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.
