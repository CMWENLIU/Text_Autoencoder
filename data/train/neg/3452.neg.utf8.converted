i bought 80 bucks worth of this because of the other reviews of this product. my cat won't eat it. period. so just like in people, taste is subjective. buy a small amount and try it out first. hopefully your cat will love it. i'm sure it is a good product quality-wise, which is why i didn't rate it lower.
