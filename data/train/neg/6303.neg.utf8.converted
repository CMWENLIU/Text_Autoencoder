I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the "brand". "Late July" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.<br /><br />Vanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.<br /><br />Dark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The "dark" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Never again.
