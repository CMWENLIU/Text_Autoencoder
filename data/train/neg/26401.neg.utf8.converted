For the price, this is a nice little gift. Nothing special and of mediocre quality at most.  The glass was coming out of mine when I received it but it wasn't broken.  And don't confuse the photo and the description of a "box full of chocolates" with what is actually in the box.  The chocolates are in two small packets that will easily fit in the palm of your hand. The box is mostly filled with straw but you can't tell that from the photo. It's appropriate that the chocolates are in individual packets but I did expect there to be a bit more of them.  The product description should include a better description of that but I expect most folks aren't buying this for the chocolate anyway. I haven't tried them since I'm giving this as a gift at an office Christmas party. I's sure someone will like this very much.
