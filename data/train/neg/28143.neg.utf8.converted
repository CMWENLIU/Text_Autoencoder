I'm a chai (tea) lover. With the 2 very positive reviews, I thought I'd found a reasonable replacement for my very wonderful but expensive Rooibos chai teabags with Davidsons version. But the cinnamon is so overpowering in this, I can't even taste the tea (or the other spices, if there are any). Too bad. Back to the search....
