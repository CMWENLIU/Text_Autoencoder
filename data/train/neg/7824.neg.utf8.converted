I ordered these pretzels for a party that I was going to have. When I opened the box, to my dismay, about one third of the pretzels were broken to the point of being large crumbs. I didn't have time to send them back before my party, so I picked out what I could that was presentable. We have since gone to Costco to restock. Not only were the pretzels whole, the price was half. Sounds like a much better deal to me.....
