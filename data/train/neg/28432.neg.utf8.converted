This product was recommended.  I usually make my own almond butter in a food processor with quality almonds.  That is not always convenient.  Barney's product was on another website with fibre products I purchase.  It was very hard to determine what the ingredients were - reading the label when there is sugar I want to know the source... I got curious - no ingredient list means MORE research because they are hiding something.  This has other ingredients, palm oil it appears and cane sugar... That's probably why it tastes good.  Advice:  Read the labels if you want to know what you are putting into your body.
