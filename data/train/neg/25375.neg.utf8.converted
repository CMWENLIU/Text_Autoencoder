Some time in the last year or so, General Mills changed this from being an oat cereal to being a corn cereal.  The oat cereal was GREAT, like chocolate cheerios with marshmallows, but the corn version is less chocolatey tasting and has a completely different texture.  It really is much worse.  Also it has gone from 50% RDA of folic acid to 25%, and 1 g of fat to 1.5 g.<br /><br />I wish I had known that before I bought 6 boxes.  Fortunately I still had one of the old boxes (it takes me forever to get to the recycling place!) so I could prove to myself that I wasn't crazy.
