I would normally give anyone (the seller in this case, not the maker) the benefit of the doubt on products, but these were awful!  They had to have been several years old at least!  The caramels were hard as a rock and inedible.  Unfortunately, I had already given a bag (they came pre-bagged) as a gift before I tried them.  I immediately called and apologized to the recipient after tasting.  The remaining four bags I unwrapped and fed to the wildlife.  They didn't even melt out in the rain if that gives you any idea how stale they were.  I definitely will NEVER buy from this dealer again.  They had to know how old they were before mailing.  And these candies were a favorite before this purchase. (Goetze Caramel Creams - 1 lb. divided into 5 bags)  I had to select a "star" for the rating since there isn't a catagory for being disatisfied.
