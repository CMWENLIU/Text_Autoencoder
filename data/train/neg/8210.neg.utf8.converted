These are totally disgusting!  This is the second time I have tried them because I really wanted to like them.  I have read so many good reviews and Hungry Girl strongly recommends them.  I am not a picky eater at all, but I just cannot swallow these.  The fishy smell does go away, but the texture makes them inedible.  YUCK.  I have tried both the angel hair and the fettucine.  I was laughing so hard when I read the reviewers remark about her husband spitting them out like on the movie BIG.  I spit them out too.  LOL
