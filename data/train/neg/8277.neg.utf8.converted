If you really love the grassy, slightly bitter flavor of green tea, then you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for a tea that makes it easy and more enjoyable to get the health benefits of green tea but with a yummy blueberry flavor, this is not for you. The blueberry flavor is extremely subtle and easily overpowered by green tea flavor. The berry aroma is potent upon first opening the bag, but the flavor just doesn't deliver. I'm really disappointed.
