As others have pointed out, this tastes of BURNT bananas. Those who don't think so must have LOTS of dead taste buds or have a funky-taste fetish (it takes all-kinds to make a world).<br /><br />The bottom of the bars coloring looks suspiciously over-cooked, as well.<br /><br />Many people have come to the same conclusions on Amazon and other sites regarding the flavor of these things.<br /><br />I know, I know. Taste is subjective. As someone who enjoys bananas AND chocolate, this bars are an ultra-bummer.<br /><br />...tastes like they've burned the bananas and up-chucked in the chocolate. :-L
