After reading all the great reviews and being a waffle lover I had a friend get me a can.  He carried it half way around the world for me.  Followed the directions to a Tee, used my George Foreman waffle grill and it made beautiful golden waffles.  Take away the butter, maple syrup and blue berries and it taste like nothing, cardboard must taste better.  Made my first and last batch, even the cheap mix is better than this, yuck!  Don't waste your money on this tasteless product!  Can I give a half star, or no star???
