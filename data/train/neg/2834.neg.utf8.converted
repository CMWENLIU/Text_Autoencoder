Granted, my expectations from Proflower weren't exactly high. I wasn't expecting the flower to look like the picture. But was it that much to ask for some stargazer and iris buds that are alive?<br /><br />What my mother received from her so-called "Spectacular" was a bunch of disgusting slimy brown rotten buds. Proflower must not care about what they send out because I am 100% sure this did not happen through the shipping process. Based on tracking records, the flowers were sent out wednesday night from a location roughly 150 miles away. And it was received around thursday noon. During that time, the local temperature was constantly below 80 degrees. There's absolutely no quality control when it comes to Proflower.<br /><br />Well, lesson learned. Steer away from Proflower no matter how tempting their prices may be.
