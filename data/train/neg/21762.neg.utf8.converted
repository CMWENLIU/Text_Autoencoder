I ordered the Pee Post with limited expectations, and was still disappointed.  My dog has not even sniffed the post, much less peed on it even with great encouragement. My comment is that since the area around the Pee Post is now green since he won't pee in the area of the post, maybe the product could be used for the opposite as advertised?
