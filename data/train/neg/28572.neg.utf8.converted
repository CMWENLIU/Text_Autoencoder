Really it's just sweet. Add too little and there's no flavor at all, add more and it gets way too sweet, it's like adding pure sugar with a very mild coffee flavor and no detectable white chocolate flavor. It's not horrible, just not very good either.<br /><br />The Ghirardelli double-chocolate flavor is better (if you like chocolate of course), but even that is nothing special, they really seem to just be cashing in on the good reputation of other Ghirardelli products with these - honestly any brand, even the "Great Value" Wal-Mart store brand is just about as good and at a much lower price.
