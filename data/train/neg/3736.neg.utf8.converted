I LOVE AMAZON. I LOVE MILK DUDS. That said, this third-party seller is in Arizona and they did not properly pack the candy for their extreme hot weather. The Duds arrived completely melted in a solid mass at the end of each of the product boxes. The BLOB of Duds in each box were so badly melted that they adhered to the cardboard inside the boxes. The end that could be seen showed that the solid blob of Duds had turned white from melting. I called the seller and they actually recommended NOT buying their Duds until DECEMBER when it cools down in Arizona. WHY THE HECK DON'T THEY JUST PACKAGE THEM AS PERISHABLES SO THEY'LL ARRIVE UNMELTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!?! I receive perishables from sellers across the country without problems all the time. I've never seen anything like this - it's really UNBELIEVABLE! They also want the product back before issuing a refund. So, they're sending a prepaid RMA to me. They could've saved themselves the return shipping AND a customer if they'd just correctly packaged the product in the first place!!! Obviously, I do NOT recommend buying from this third-party seller (even in December!). Clearly, they do not even approach Amazon's high shipping standards and customer service.
