I just purchased a bag of this Vitality Chicken Breast dog jerky product from a large national retailer today (I liked the natural, wholesome ingredients), and was VERY concerned and upset when I read that is is made in China. Given the many unecessary and unethical pet deaths that occured fairly recently due to melamine and other toxic ingredients in Chinese made pet products, my concern is quite legitimate and justifiable. You just don't know if you can trust any pet products from China anymore. And here I thought that I finally found a good, heatlhy, wholesome pet treat for my dog. I had to throw out the bag. Bummer.
