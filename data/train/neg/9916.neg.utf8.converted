I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened.  I wanted some with just a little sweetness but not as sweet as what is normally on the market.  However - I don't like to say anything bad about anything but these absolutely taste like cardboard - there is absolutely NO taste ( you would never guess you were eating bananas if you were blindfolded) and the texture is like cardboard also.  I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN.  Sorry... wish I could say something positive about these but I can't in all honestly.
