Ok you might not get cavities but you'll definitely get some cancer causing chemicals in your body by sucking on the titanium dioxide, red 40, yellow and blue chemicals they colored it with. How hard is it to make a healthy product with all natural ingredients. Not that hard... just color the candies with natural dyes. Would never buy a product that claims it's healthy or "natural" and then adds unhealthy ingredients in with the ONE healthy one. I would just get XyliChew or Spry gum instead. There's just xylitol and 2 other natural ingredients in those and is waaay healthier for your teeth AND body than this stuff. Or if you want some really good organic lollipops with no chemicals in them get Yummy Earth hard candies or lollipops on here.<br /><br />(ADDED DEC 2011) They finally added a natural version of these same Xylitol lollipopos since I posted this... get them here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V019RY">SimplyXylitol All Natural Assorted Fruit Lollipops in a 1 lb. bag</a>
