I had previously bought the Lomo Iberico which was approximately $80.<br /><br />I bought this one because it was a lot cheaper, and Campofrio is a known brand in Spain.<br /><br />I was disappointed because it was very hard which made it difficult to cut. Also, the lomo had a deep fold across the length of it (a small fold is normal), which coupled with the hard texture made it difficult to serve to guests (even the fat around the edges was hard).<br /><br />The flavor was good, but it was not excellent.<br /><br />Next time, I will buy the Iberico again. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's smoother, has better flavor, and a lot easier to cut and prepare for serving guests.
