This coffee tastes like a good cup of gas station or fast food coffee (i.e., objectively average, at best).  It is not very flavorful, particularly compared to other k-cup brands on the market.  But, this coffee is also 30-50% less expensive per cup.<br /><br />It's also worth noting (as other reviewers have) that these need to be kept in an air-tight container because they are not individually sealed; the bottoms of each cup are semipermeable filters--not air tight plastic like other k-kups.  This is inconvenient if you prefer to keep your k-cups in a k-cup tower next to the machine.
