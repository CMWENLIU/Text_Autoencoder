This review refers to Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water;No Salt(pack of 12)<br /><br />I had previously bought the Crown Prince canned salmon(also no salt added) and was very happy with it. Everything about it was good. Smelled good, looked good and tasted good. So I decided to give the Tuna a try as well. The tuna was exactly the opposite. Smelled awful, looked horrible(very dark and chunky), and wasn't good tasting at all. It wasn't that it smelled or tasted rotten or anything, just not like good quality Albacore tuna should.<br /><br />We are always on the look out for a good deal on low or no-salt items. They always run so high in the store, even for a tiny can of low-sodium tuna, you pay twice as much as one that is full of salt. These large cans came to a really good deal, and as I see from the other reviews, they enjoyed these. Maybe we got a bad batch or something, but after trying out 2 cans we know we won't buy this - or eat this - anymore.<br /><br />My husband is the one who really likes tuna. I could take or leave it(usually leaving it). He usually went through 2 cans a week of the regular tuna we bought at the store, but, even he was disappointed by this stuff.<br /><br />So I'm not recommending this not so "princely" tuna;if there is one batch of poor quality packed, there is probably others. It's too much money to throw away by taking another chance. For right now, I'll stick with the 2 cans of Star-Kist or Chicken of the Sea we buy each week at the market.<br /><br />Thanks.....Laurie
