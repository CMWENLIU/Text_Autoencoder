The packaging looks very nice, but the quality of the food is quite poor.<br /><br />The cheese is not real Brie/Camembert as the nice round box suggests, its fake "Camembert-flavored" processed cheese.<br /><br />The knife broke when I tried to cut plastic which protects the sausage.<br /><br />The mustard tastes awful, the crackers are "cardboard"-flavored.<br /><br />But I like the cutting board.
