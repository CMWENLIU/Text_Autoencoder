The taste and aftertaste of sucralose is artificial and unpleasant.<br /><br />Xylitol can have a bit of an aftertaste sometimes but it generally tastes more like real sugar and has less of an aftertaste. It also helps to combat tooth bacteria. Erythritol is nice for some uses because it's basically non-caloric. I've tried all the sugar replacements, and I prefer xylitol for most things (baking especially), and erythritol for other things (chocolate, lemonade, et cetera).<br /><br />The best news is there is no debate about toxicity when it comes to xylitol and erythritol, unlike Stevia extracts, aspartame, saccharine, and sucralose. Everyone agrees that these sugar alcohols are non-toxic (except don't feed dogs xylitol because they can't metabolize it correctly).<br /><br />I see no reason to pay so much for sucralose, which is several hundred times "sweeter" than sugar so should not be so expensive. Maltodextrin, the bulking agent, isn't expensive to produce either.
