Del Monte appears to be so ashamed of where pup-peroni products are made that they no longer include that information on the package or on their web site.  When a corporation is too embarrassed to disclose such information, there is usually a very good reason for them to be ashamed.<br /><br />My dogs liked these products, but I have since switched to only giving them products made in the USA and food/treats which do not include meat by-products.  I don't always trust USA manufacturers, but they do have fewer quality control problems than some foreign countries I could name.
