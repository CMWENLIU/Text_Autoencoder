I bought these soups not realizing the following--the soup cup is two servings---that means that this is 340 calories and a whopping 660 mg of sodium.  I guess you could eat half the container, but what do you do with the rest?  Despite this (hey, I bought it...), I made the soup and was unimpressed.  It tasted salty and stale.  I have had other dehydrated soup cups (great for traveling) and this is by far one of the worst ones that I have had.  Too many calories, too salty and too complicated to make (you just don't pour in boiling water and wait a couple of minutes).  I find that the Nile Spice soups are better and certainly less fattening.<br /><br />I am a bit surprised that Dr. McDougall would create a product like this.  I thought it would be more healthful!
