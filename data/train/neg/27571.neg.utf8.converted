I have had the nacho chili, and they were great.  This was really terrible. Grandkids wouldn't eat them, the smell grossed them out.<br /><br />Smelled sort of musty and stale or something.  Just a foul smell upon opening the bags...I guess a Poor combination of herbs with the lemon.<br /><br />They became expensive dog treats.
