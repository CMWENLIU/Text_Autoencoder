I thought I'd give Twinings Chinese Oolong Tea a try based on other reviewers feedback here on Amazon.  I did not enjoy the flavor of this tea and maybe it's due to my like of simple/common oolong teas versus the fancy-grades which seem too complex for me.  The description on the box labels it as a "sweet and delicate tea with reddish colour"... but personally, I have to disagree with that description.  It was more of a perfumed sweetness with a hint of bitter aftertaste, not delicate at all.  Everyone has different tastes and most likely I'm the odd one in the bunch.  I prefer a loose-leaf oolong tea and still trying to find my favorite.  For oolong in a tea bag, my current choices are Bigelow Chinese Oolong and Foojoy Wuyi Oolong Tea.
