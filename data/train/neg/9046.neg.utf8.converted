I have been buying this product for well over two years and had been delighted by it!  Gluten-free mixes for the most part are horrible and this used to be exceptional not only in taste but in texture.<br /><br />To my great surprise and disappointment the ingredients have been reformulated. I recently reordered two cases of this mix; same packaging, etc. so no reason to suspect anything had changed.<br /><br />Well, as I was baking yesterday I noticed the "new" mix was a different color, in comparison to the "old" mix (I still had 3 older bags) and consistency when stirring was like mixing chalk powder in water.<br /><br />As the muffins were baking, the "old" batch mix was baking beautifully (nice golden brown) but in comparison the "new" batch mix did not appear to be baking (still pale white coloring after 20 minutes in the oven).<br /><br />So here's the scoop, the bag is now 13.5 ounces versus what was 16 ounces. There was no disclosure on the bag stating this major change.  In addition, many of the key taste ingredients have been eliminated such as vanilla bean powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The base ingredient was brown rice flour but is now whole grain brown rice flour (pale bland flour).  Now I know why the "new" product is bland! The taste is now gritty and in essence unpalatable.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have one unopened case but will not be able to return it; Amazon does not allow food product returns. I believe the manufacturer should have disclosed all of these changes clearly on the packaging thus allowing consumers (like me) the option of purchasing or not.  If I had known the mix was reformulated I never would have reordered. Base cost per bag including tax is $4.84.  But keep in mind that your cost is slightly higher because you must add oil, sugar and any other ingredient i.e. blueberries, nuts, etc. to make the "finished" product.<br /><br />My recommendation, do not buy this reformulated product.
