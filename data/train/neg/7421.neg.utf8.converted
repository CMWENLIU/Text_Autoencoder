Seattle's Best has obviously been taken over by idiots. That's the only explanation for this new change in product look and taste. Are they trying to market coffee to grade school children? The new product presentation in bright colored, ugly bags with huge numbers on them is so unsophisticated and juvenile that it boggles the mind as to how this piece of rubbish got rubber-stamped by any executive who loves coffee. Coffee drinkers don't appreciate this kind of flashy, cheap looking product packaging and still they've tried to keep their original customers by stamping a tiny little reminder of "Like Henry's Blend" on the bag. Well that just rubs salt into the wound because the taste also seems to have been tampered with. I predict that this will go the same way as the Tropicana OJ fiasco and that they'll lose sales to the point that they'll be forced to bring back their far more sophisticated packaging and blends. Luckily, I have plenty of local roasters selling coffee that I can turn to and not feel ashamed for buying such a pathetic looking product. Henry's Blend, in the traditional red bag was a sophisticated, gourmet coffee and that sadly no longer exists.
