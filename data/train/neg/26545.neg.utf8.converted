Equal and NutraSweet were the exact same product, with the same exact ingredient, made by the exact same company.  Consumer Reports blew that cover a few years ago.  The funny thing was that you could find both on grocery store shelves right next to each other, see the same company name on both boxes, read the same ingredient, same amount per packet, same amount of packets per box, yet they charged double the money for Equal than they did for NutraSweet, and even Consumer Reports never got an answer from the company as to WHY that was.<br /><br />Since then, the company that produces Aspartame is no longer "Searle" (then headed by CEO Donald Rumsfeld!) but instead Monsanto, the same company that produced the toxic "agent orange" for Vietnam!<br /><br />If you are looking for a substitute natural sweetener, because you are a diabetic, then STEVIA should be something to look into.  Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a "sweetener" it has to be labeled a "nutritional suppliment" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />Please don't take my word for anything I have just said above, please do the research yourself so you KNOW it is all the truth.
