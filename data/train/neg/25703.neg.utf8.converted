The Andes mints themselves were quite tasty, as Andes mints always are. Five stars for the taste, definitely.<br /><br />That being said, these were shipped with NO protection against the heat, at ALL. If a seller doesn't warn that hey, a product might melt in transit, I typically assume that they're doing something to PREVENT that from happening. These, however, were merely tossed in the box with my other items, and arrived half-melted -- they all oozed into the cracks and crevices of their wrappers, making them both difficult and messy to unwrap. I'd be even MORE annoyed if I'd planned to use them for anything other than personal consumption, as they're in no condition to be handed out for any reason.<br /><br />In summary -- 5 stars for the Andes mints themselves, zero stars for the thought put into the item description (no warm weather warning)/shipping.
