The good part about this cornmeal is that it is organic - so you can hope there are no GMOs in  your evening polenta. The bad things about it is that a) its texture is too fine for polenta (which is why I purchased it in the first place); and b) it is BITTER. I am not sure if only my batch was bad (I did get 12 packs and I am only making my way through the third), or if it's something related to the type of corn they use, but the result is bitter. Only if I boil it for an hour, which is excessive, is the bitterness somewhat reduced. I will not be buying this brand again.
