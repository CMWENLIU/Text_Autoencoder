I really liked this collection which I purchased it the first time about two years ago.  Given that I am already familiar with these teas, I made this purchase because the product description included two teas that I had not tried.  I thought this was a new collection with a combination of new and old products.  Turns out that it was the same 'old' collection and despite what was in the product description, this collection did not include the two teas that I had not tried.  I thought it may have been a shipping problem because the two teas are also listed amongst the ingredients on the box.  Sale or no sale, I am making my tea purchases in a store so that I will know what is in the box.
