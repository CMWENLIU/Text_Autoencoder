No stars!!!<br />Other similar drinks of this size have been helpful doing what they promised. This brand failed to provide any uplift at all and did not taste good.  The bottle(s) appeared to have stain around the lid(s)once peeled open and actually made me ill. Bad batch???<br /><br />I will never buy this again or recommend it to anyone else.  I had to discard the entire case (minus the one I drank) away. Not pleased at all.  Preferred to return/exchange, but no available address for liquids.<br />Bad business!!!
