My usual supplier was out of mini cones, and I came across these.  In order to save a few bucks we got the bulk case.  Shipping and "handling" charges were Twenty dollars.  That would have been perfectly acceptable if they had used the money to actually package these properly instead of just make extra money like some infomercial.  The case arrived - all the cones packed in a single plastic bag within 1 box.  This box was in a larger shipping box.  The entire top and bottom rows were cracked to the point of rendering them unusable.  Several along both sides were also damaged.  On top of all that, they have almost no flavor whatsoever, even by wafer cone standards.  If you are looking for good cones, look elsewhere. [...] will send you mini sugar cones that are much more worth it.
