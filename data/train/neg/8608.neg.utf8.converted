A few months ago I wrote a email to Hershey about the new taste of their chocolet twizzlers and I told them why did they change the taste of them. They told me that they did not know of any other complaints and also sent me some coupons so I can get some free bags. But I told them in another email that I did not need their coupons because I was not going to purchase them again. I told them that as a kid I always loved to eat them and enjoyed the taste. Why in the world would someone decide to change them and even the texture was horrible like jello...so a few days ago I receive a letter from Hershey telling me that because of my letter and other feed back from others they're now bringing back the chocolet twizzlers as the classic. They sent me some free coupons..they could not of made mt day....just hope that they are as good as the original and to make sure I buy the ones that say classic on them. I am truly glad that there is a least one company that listens to the consumer...
