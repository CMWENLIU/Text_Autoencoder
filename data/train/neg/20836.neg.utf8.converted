I was excited about ordering these crackers. I ordered them from another site and there were so many rave reviews. These things are so nasty lol. It must be the soy? The taste is awful and these crackers are wayy too hard.  Not good-crunchy, but more like...these-must-be-beyond-expiration-date-crunchy...
