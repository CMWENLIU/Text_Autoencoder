I used this to amp up the chocolate flavor in a double chocolate cake. It tastes exactly how it smells - like alcohol with a mild chocolate scent. It didn't do any service to my cake or the frosting, and I didn't use a lot. You get much more alcohol taste than a chocolate taste (and it doesn't taste that good).
