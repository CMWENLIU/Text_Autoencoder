Oh sweet mother...this is the worst tasting low-carb bread I've ever tried!!  This reminds me of the nasty low-carb bread they made way back in the day when they didn't know how to make it GOOD yet! I tried making LC versions of french toast, toast with jelly, and a breakfast sandwich with bacon, egg, and cheese..but the nasty taste of the bread just overpowered everything.  It's like eating rubber.  I'm going back to what I was using before which is Julian's Bakery low carb bread.  I get it at a health food store here.  It's definitely more caloric and it has 1 net carb per slice(the cinnamon has 2)..but is so delicious!!!  Please take me back Julian's Bakery...I'm sorry I cheated on you! lol
