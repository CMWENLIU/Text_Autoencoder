I received a 5 pound bag today, March 9, 2011 that had a "use by 2/2011" on the package.<br /><br />When I contacted Amazon they credited me back the charge. Great customer service but would be hesitant to order this product again. If you order it I suggest you check the "use by" date on the packaging.<br /><br />Opened package, had a strong chemical/plastic smell, tossed it in the dumpster.
