This product is described as "All-natural whole "boiled" oysters," and "Harvested in Korea." From the label it appears to be nothing of the sort. It turns out to be a product of China, a country whose food products I trust not and always avoid. Moreover, these oysters are farm-raised, not harvested. I did not like the taste and consider the quality to be poor. Don't waste your money.
