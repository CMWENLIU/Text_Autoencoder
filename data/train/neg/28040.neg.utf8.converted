I like the effects of this drink, however, it gives me a headache that I can't get rid of.  I made it just like the directions said, I even weighed it out in milliliters, and measured one cup of water to it.  At that measurement, it is a little weak, but still good.  It gave me great energy, that lasted for 4 hours or more.  It's not the kind of energy that the energy drinks give me, where I'm all jittery and feel weird.  The second time I mixed it, I used more, about 3 times as much and it made me way to energetic and it felt like I was on speed.  If you are sensitive to caffeine, you need to be careful with this stuff.<br /><br />Pros---<br />Nice taste, tastes just like Hawaiian Punch.<br />Gives lasting energy.<br /><br />Cons---<br />Lid leaks, no matter how hard I screwed it on.  Don't get this on your clothes, or it will never come out.  I got it on my counter and had to use bleach to get it off, even though I wiped it right up.<br />Can be really strong to people who are sensitive to caffeine.<br />Tastes like a child's fruit drink, which some adults may not like.<br />Loaded with artificial ingredients and artificial red dye, but you most likely know that if you read about it.<br /><br />I am giving this 2 stars because of the headache issue.  I would like this stuff, if it didn't give me a headache.  So, if you are looking for a water enhancement that gives you lasting energy, you don't mind that the lid leaks horribly, and you like the taste of Hawaiian Punch, then give this a try.
