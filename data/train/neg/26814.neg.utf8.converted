They've had a recent bad batch of this particular flavor clearly.  My vet has had reports of several dogs all coming in with vomiting symptoms all within the last week!  My dog being one of them! I bought a bag of this product 1 1/2 weeks ago and my dog started to vomit uncontrollably!  It made him so sick.  I took him to the vet and $700 dollars later and after not feeding him this food, he is better.  The bag of food is so bad is smells like chemicals!  When I go to smell it, it burns my nose hairs!  Almost like an ammonia smell.  Why I went back to the place of purchase I was told that several other customers have returned the same food because of excessive vomiting and sick dogs!  I don't know what is in this food, but I'm going to have it tested.  I'm also getting in touch with the other dog owners.  If there is anything harmful in this food, besides just food going bad, they'll be hearing from my attorney.
