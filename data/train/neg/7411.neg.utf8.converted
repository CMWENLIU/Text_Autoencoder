<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M074ME">Melitta One:One Java Pods, Love At First Sip, Medium Roast Coffee, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>I was very disappointed in this Melitta product. The pods were too thick for my Senseo coffeemaker. And the coffee produced is definitely not as smooth as the Senseo Medium Strength pods produce.<br /><br />Do not use these Melitta's in a Senseo machine. The hinge of the movable top was very strained due to the extra thickness of these Melitta pods. I'm sure the plastic bits around the hinge would have failed if I continued to use the Melitta pods.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon and they, nicely, and quickly refunded my purchase price. Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />MJR
