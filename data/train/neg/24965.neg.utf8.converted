I am very disappointed that Gerber has added DHA to their green beans. My son used to Love his Gerber Organic Green Beans. I (unwittingly) tried feeding him the new formulation with added DHA and he kept refusing it. I did notice that the consistency was different than usual - it had more of a gel like texture to it. And then I read the ingredients and saw that it had added Tuna Oil. !? Today I learned that another of his favorites, Gerber Organic Carrots, now has DHA added to it too. I'm so frustrated! Looks like I'll be making our own baby food now.
