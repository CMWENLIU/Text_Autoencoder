We have three dogs.  One will eat anything, one will eat almost anything, and one is a picky eater.  Fortunately, the picky eater is the chihuahua.  Part of the picky eating comes from his sensitive stomach, and we avoid chicken and turkey because that consistently upsets his stomach.<br /><br />The first time he was offered Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, he devoured it with pleasure, and I was ecstatic to have a dry food that got some enthusiasm.  Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was gone by the next day, and he absolutely refused to eat it for two days.  We gave up.  If he'd rather eat the big dogs' food than eat his premium food, there is no  point in spending extra for a more expensive food.<br /><br />From my point of view, the "premium" seemed to be mostly the "Chef Michael" name, as it didn't seem to have any better ingredients than the other Purina foods.  Beef was the first ingredient, but it was followed by soy meal and soy flour. (Can we say GMO?) It also contained chicken by products (a long ways under the soy products, by the way.)  Even salt appears before green beans and potatoes.  It is cuter than regular kibble, but I don't think the dogs care.  It also has varying textures, but once again, even when I let the big dogs try it, they weren't overly impressed.<br /><br />My opinion is that either spend more and get real premium food or save your money (unless you want attractive kibble) and just buy a standard dog food.
