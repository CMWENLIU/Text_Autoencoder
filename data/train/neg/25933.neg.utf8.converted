What I received did not taste good at all. I saw this on the food network with high hopes as I love everything pork and bacon is at the top of the list. I was shocked that I did not like it. It had a very funny aftertaste that reminds me of bacon drippings that have been saved in a can and not refrigerated. One other reviewer said they received theirs in a cold pack. Mine did not come that way, it came in a regular box with paper around it but no cold packs. Maybe the 3 jars I received had gone bad but I have no way of knowing. What I received and tasted could not be what all these other 5 star reviewers receieved. I may order another batch later on after the sting of this purchase is gone and will update this review if it is different then what I received this time. All I can say is beware that it appears it might go bad very easily.
