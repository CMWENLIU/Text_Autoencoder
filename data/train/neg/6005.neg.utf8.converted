I don't think my expectations for this product were too high. I've had my fair share of diet foods, and especially Walden Farms foods, some of which I absolutely love. This product is not one of them.<br /><br />The texture is something like jello, and the taste is terrible. It's sweet and has a vague peanut taste, but the peanut taste is more of a background flavor. Most of the flavor is occupied by whatever disgusting taste this failed chemistry experiment has combined to make.
