Not a bad coffee at the 6 oz cup size, and using a good pod-brewer. Low acidity, and a smooth finish. At the 8 OZ size, you lose the sense of its character, but is still drinkable. (think- "Dunkin Donuts") Anything over 8OZ, and it is not drinkable. Oddly, only the off-notes are present at 10 OZ. Slight cardboard odor, and cereal flavor. None of the chocolate notes noted at lower brew volumes remain.<br /><br />Overall, not much to recommend. These would translate well into a 12 GM pod for the "light" coffee drinker. I measured a pod at just under 9 grams (tare weight for filter). Can't see how 9 grams can make a travel mug sized cup......
