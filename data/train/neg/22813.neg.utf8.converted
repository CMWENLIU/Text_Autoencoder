The Lavazza Gran Crema pods are fine if you're not too fussed about good coffee, or if you're using them for latte or other milk drinks.<br />My main issue with these was how they came from the seller.<br />The product description clearly states that the pods come in a "20 pack box" - this was important to me as I keep my pods on the bench in their display boxes.<br />Instead, my 20 pods came loose in a zip lock bag and each one was clearly marked - not for individual sale.<br />The seller obviously buys these in bulk and then on-sells them for a larger profit - very dodgy.
