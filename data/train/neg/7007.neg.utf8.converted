I found this coffee to be both bitter and weak. It does make a 12oz serving, but during the last half of the brewing cycle only clear water is coming out of the tassimo. To make this coffee bearable, I'm shutting off the brewing after about 4 oz, then adding a foaming milk t-disk. Actually, it does make a fairly good expresso if you only use the first 4-5 oz.
