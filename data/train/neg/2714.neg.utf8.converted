I ordered this as a gift for my husband, who loves Cel-Ray but can't find it locally. Unfortunately the bottles appeared to have frozen during shipping -- some still had ice chunks inside when I opened the box. Even worse, some had leaked, making the box bottom sticky and soggy. Most of the bottles were fine, but a few were flat when opened, probably from being frozen. I'd look for cans instead of bottles if I ordered them again; I suppose they could lose their fizz too, but at least it would avoid the soggy mess.<br />As for the flavor (which was new to me), it was better than I expected - definitely a recognizable celery component, but in a pleasant way.
