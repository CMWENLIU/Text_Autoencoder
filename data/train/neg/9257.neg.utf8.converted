Actually caused my dog to have bad diarrhea.  We have a border collie who has been on a raw diet due to allergies and we wanted to try a grain free kibble to see if it would be easier to travel with.  She liked it first time and then not so much for the next two times and then the loose stools began. I think the quality of the food is good - but not sure what is causing this side effect. Had to stop and go back to raw food supplemented with Sojo's grain free.
