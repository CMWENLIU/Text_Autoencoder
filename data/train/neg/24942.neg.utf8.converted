The coffee is rich and delicious... a great way to start the day or to end an evening meal.  But at $1.00 a cup it is way overpriced.  I bought my Nespresso coffee machine from an Amazon dealer.  The price was very good.  So I assumed that the cost of the coffee would be good as well.  I performed a Google internet search for the lowest prices on Nespresso coffee, and all search results linked to Amazon.  So I ordered 50 cups and paid $1.00 a cup.  Then, a few days later I found that I could order the same coffee directly from the Nespresso website for only $0.60 a cup.  This shows you how skewed the Google Search Engine is and also reveals that the "deals" on Amazon are not always good deals.<br /><br />Lessons learned: 1) The coffee is great!  2) Do not trust Google as a reliable source to point you in the direction YOU want to go in.  It only points you in the direction they want to take you in.  3) Buy your coffee directly from Nespresso and save 40% (and get faster shipping as well.)  4) Do not rely on Amazon for the best deals.
