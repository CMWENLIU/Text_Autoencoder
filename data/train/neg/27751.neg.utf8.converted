This product was not as I expected.  There was no decernable coffee flavor.  I probably was too vague in my search.  I have been  drinking Nescafe Iced Java Mocha for quite a while.  It is now longer available.  I went wearching for a replacement.  This was very thick and not to be used cold.  It only made chocolate milk.  I have Hershey's for that.  All in all, it was a waste of my money because, even though I could have returned it, it would have cost more that I would have gotten back.
