These are too delicious, but the oranges are from China. Unfortunately, the Chinese have become masters at fooling foreign governing bodies and many organic farms have been exposed in China for using the same (or worse) pesticides than the USA. In addition, these are in BPA-lined cans. It's a shame, they are tasty, but you are paying more for BPA-tainted fruit that may not even be organic.
