I really wanted to like this coffee and based on the other reviewers' ratings I was eagerly awaiting my shipment.  Unfortunately, for me this coffee although obviously super high quality is just too bitter in the brew for my taste.  I ordered this on subscription for repeat delivery certain that I would like it as I am a Sumatran coffee drinker but after trying several different grinds and methods of brewing this I just do not like the bitterness in these beans.
