My daughter fell in love with Toffifee while in Germany this past summer.  I found it on Amazon, but it was called Toffifay, instead of Toffifee, but made by same company.  I decided to take a chance. Luckly it tastes the same.  Unfortunately the chocolates did not look the same.  I am embarrassed to serve it to anyone but my kids.<br /><br />I'm sure it would have been good if the packaging were better.  When I recieved the TWELVE boxes I ordered, every single one of them was completely melted.  This was not the candy makers fault, but Amazon's packaging.  I gave them packaging feedback, but they have not responded in any way.<br /><br />So, lesson learned:  Assuming Amazon will not improve their packaging of meltable food products, ONLY ORDER THIS IN THE WINTER !!
