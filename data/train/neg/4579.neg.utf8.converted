I received this as a gift.  Company enclosed a receipt in box so I know how much the sender spent - had to hunt to see who it was from....plus once I saw the receipt, I realized they had paid $34 for less than $10 worth of candy.... all these candies can still be found in local stores.... gum was hard as a rock - taffy just about took my fillings out.  Really poorly done.  I will be passing this info on to the person that sent this to me.  Loved the idea of the gift -- just really bad quality.
