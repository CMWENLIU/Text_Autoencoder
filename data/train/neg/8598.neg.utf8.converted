The web site says delivers in 24 hours.  I have been waiting 7 days, the product has yet to ship and because it is in Amazon's "shipping soon" designation, it is impossible to cancel the order.  The current estimate is that I will receive my order in 23 days for a product that is in stock and ships in 24 hours.  Today I received a notification of a problem with my order but there is no information as to what the problem is.<br /><br />Very dishonest merchant.
