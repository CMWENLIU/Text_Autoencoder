I have numerous food allergies and got these as a healthy "on the go" snack. Unfortunately, I think the only way I would be able to enjoy them is cooked or baked in something since I don't like their taste "au natural." They are also extremely small and kind of hard to eat because when you put some in your hand, they roll all over the place!
