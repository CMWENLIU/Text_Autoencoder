While I received what I was looking for, the picture showed six sticks and the description said that the shipping weight would be 12.8 oz.  When it arrived it was ONE 12" stick, weighing ONE oz, and in a box that weighed nowhere near 12 oz.  For this I paid over $5 shipping.  The ad was misleading for not indicating exactly what would be received.  Additionally, this is the same picture that they show for some they sell for 4x the price and a shipping weight of 16 oz.  The shipping cost for this item is the same.  I would be hesitant to order this item for fear that I would not know what I would be getting.
