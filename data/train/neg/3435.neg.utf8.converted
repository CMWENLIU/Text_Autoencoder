*** I'm going to file an A to Z claim now since Vitacost has already stated they will not take any action for this error as they blame Amazon for misinformation. Per description and picture, a single order should be 6 bottles of Walden Farms Alfredo Pasta Sauce. I placed for orders and expected to receive 24 bottles. Instead, I received 4 bottles. I called Vitacost this morning and spoke to Tekatra who claimed that Vitacost shipped the order as placed by Amazon and Vitacost is not going to be held responsible for misinformation. I certainly feel cheated and would like a full refund or, more preferable, my order completed with the appropriate number of product with free shipping.
