My son has a gluten and lactose intolerence and the box says these cookies are gluten free, non-dairy.  So my family would puchase them for my son to have a treat when he visits them.  However, everytime he eats these cookies he comes home with bad diarrea, lethargy, etc, like he ate wheat.  However on the back of the box it does have a dairy symbol so now I think that maybe there is some dairy in there that could be making him sick. I am not going to be giving them to my son anymore.  I'm so dissapointed in this product!
