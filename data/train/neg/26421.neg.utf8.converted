I love smoked paprika. It's near impossible to find in my area.<br /><br />I have used another brand from another site, and loved it.<br />When I came across this one here on Amazon, it sounded like a good try.<br />Not.<br />This paprika has absolutely no smoke flavor, no smell.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's a perfectly fine regular paprika.<br /><br />There are much better options out there.
