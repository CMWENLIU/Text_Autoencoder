I love some of their other teas, I'm a chocoholic, and I love hazelnut coffee.  But I HATED this flavor.  It reminds me of the pharmacy's first attempts years ago to flavor medicine--has a wonderful smell but a weird, almost disgusting aftertaste.  It actually made me a bit sick to my stomach!  I'll stick with the Vanilla Chai--very tasty.
