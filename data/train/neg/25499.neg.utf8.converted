I was very happy to find this product as I've been wanting to try buckwheat flour. The packaging states that it is naturally gluten free and that buckwheat is the only ingredient. However, if you go to the website for Hodgson Mill and look up Buckwheat Flour, you'll find an extra note that they don't bother to put on the box. "Not produced on dedicated equipment." Translated: Probably contaminated. My advice, especially for those of us who are super sensitive? Take the time to find truly gluten free Buckwheat Flour from someone else.<br /><br />I've written to Hodgson Mills about their practice, so perhaps one day they will change things.<br /><br />In the meantime, there are companies that produce Buckwheat Flour specifically labeled Gluten Free, and I'll definitely be looking for one of them the next time I visit a gluten-free friendly store.
