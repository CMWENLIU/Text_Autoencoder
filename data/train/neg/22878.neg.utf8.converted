I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this for my sister. Just like all these other poor sufferers, by sister, her boyfriend and my mom all had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps just a few hours after eating some. This item should have a warning label: "Do not eat more than 10 in one sitting unless you you are constipated and need a quick and easy laxative." Too bad they taste so yummy. I'm going back to the sugar ones.
