This always seemed a little too sweet to me, but I still enjoyed it well enough. Then I went and tried Trader Joe's High Fiber Cereal which contains real sugar. Now I can't go back to this. It tastes so unnatural and the sweetness is just gross.<br /><br />It does fill you up well. I will give it that.
