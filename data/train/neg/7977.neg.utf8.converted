This is ridiculous! You are not SAVING $15.00, you are spending at least $5.00 MORE than you should be! The highest price for a 9oz. individual can in my area is $4.49 (I know, yikes!), so 27oz. would cost me around $14.00...why would I want to spend MORE MONEY?!? Thanks for wasting time- I'm obviously not going to find any savings from this company.
