I decided to try this coffee despite some of the bad reviews.  I LOVE Cafe Altura's French Roast. It is wonderfully rich and smooth and so good that I crave it.  This Peruvian Dark smells wonderful but tasted like it had been sitting on the warmer for an hour or two. To me it tasted burnt. It was bad enough it made me feel sick to my stomach and couldn't drink more than 1/2 cup.  Maybe if you use a flavored creamer it would be ok, but I don't like cream in my coffee. Altura makes wonderful coffee as long as you pick the right flavor.  This wasn't the flavor for me.
