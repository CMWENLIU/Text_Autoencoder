I have Celiac Sprue, and ate Ener-g foods bread during my childhood and teenage years, simply because I needed safe food and there wasn't anything better out there at the time. Now, there is. I commend Ener-g foods for providing truly safe food for those with gluten intolerance and other dietary  restrictions, but it has to be said- their breads are, for the most part, disgusting, and their cookies and other products aren't better. White rice loaf actually used to be my favorite (compared to the alternatives), but it is only edible when toasted, and it is a far cry from the other options now. Please, don't resign yourself to eating this. Try Whole Foods GF bakehouse breads or make your own from Bette Hagman's cookbooks. Once I started baking my own bread and realized how much better it could be, I resolved to never again eat Ener-g foods bread... and I haven't. Occasionally I think, surely it wasn't that bad, and try it One more time- and it just doesn't get better. THe only thing this bread is good for is for stuffing- toasted and slathered in seasonings and soaked in broth, your shoes would probably taste ok too. I'm sorry, Ener-g foods... I do appreciate you. If only your products could compete with the excellent alternatives out there now.
