I love cashews, was VERY hungry when I opened the container, and was ready to scarf down a handful of these!<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are nothing like "sea salt and pepper" flavor. This is one of those weird combos of ingredients that end up tasting very artificial.  In fact, the coating of sugar, granulated onion, and salt even has a strange texture that feels sort of plastic-y on the tongue and does not seem to dissolve.  The ingredient list is ridiculously long for a product marketed to appear simple and natural.  Why was all the artificial and processed junk added, when the basics of cashews, salt, and pepper could have been so tasty?<br /><br />If these had truly been as advertised I'm sure I would have eaten half the container. :)  Instead, I was only able to eat 3-4 nuts, then closed up the container.  When I find time I'll try rinsing them off with hot water in a colander so that they don't have to go to waste.<br /><br />On a positive note, the packaging is nice-- reseals easily and is convenient.
