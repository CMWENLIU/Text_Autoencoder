I sent the company an email and here is the conversation. Product bad and customer service stinks.<br /><br />I'm sorry that you are having a problem with the case of peanuts but you will have to contact Amazon regarding the issue below and they will be able to assist you.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Jackie<br /><br />Sent: Friday, September 23, 2011 11:55 AM<br />To: Peanut Shop Info<br />Subject: amazon order<br /><br />I bought a case of your boiled peanuts on Amazon and was very disappointed with them. Some of the reviews on the Amazon site stated that many of the peanuts in the can were empty shells. I thought it might be just a random occurrence and decided to order them anyways but after trying all 6 cans I found that to be the case with all 6 cans! 40% of the peanuts were small, withered or empty. I just thought you should know.
