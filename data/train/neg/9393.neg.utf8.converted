These chips are absolutely delicious.  But I was disgusted when I turned over the bag to find out that they are made in China!  It's bad enough that all of our other consumer products are made in China but now our food too!?  Chinese food safety laws are very different than ours, hence the recalls of tainted foods in the last several years.  So no thanks.
