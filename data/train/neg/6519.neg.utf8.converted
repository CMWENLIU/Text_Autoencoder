This is a convenient way to purchase. I had on the subscribe and save since last year, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110JMA2">Wheat Thins 100% Whole Grain Crackers, 10-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a> *notice it still shows 6 Pack* for 6 pack at 19.80 w/15% discount. Last order arrived as a 4 pack. No explanation. Price did not decrease. Increase of 33% with no warning to subscribers. I know Amazon is not hurting so what's the reason for the apparent gouging of us consumers? This at a 4 pack a terrible value
