I love truffles, truffle salt, truffle butter... i knew what i wanted when i ordered this.  I recommend the white truffle butter igourmet carries, you can get that on amazon. This product doesn't really deserve the name. It smells like truffles. That's about it. I get no flavor at all, truffle, butter, or otherwise. the butter quality is very poor, i'd compare it more to margarine. really greasy and oily. you can see black flecks of truffle (or something), just no truffle flavor. i won't be ordering this again. the quest for truffle butter that isn't a 90 minute drive away or $20 shipping continues.
