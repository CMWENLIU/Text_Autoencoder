I ordered this specifically for a recipe for Chi Chi's seafood enchiladas/Cancun on Recipe Zaar. The recipe consistently got five stars rating. It called for a tablespoon of lobster base (for a half recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, adding no salt and using no salt butter.  The dish was so salty that we threw it out.  Later, while trying to figure out what went wrong I found that this particular lobster base has 800 mg of sodium per tsp.  So, I had used 2400 mg of sodium in a recipe for 4-6 enchiladas.  We like salt--too much sometimes--but this was beyond the pale!!  Now, I've got 2 jars of this base and doubt I'll ever use it.  What a disappointment! Just be careful!
