My cats will eat anything - and I mean anything - probably because of the time they spent in the local shelter before I adopted them.  However, even though they will eat anything, I invest in the best food I can find.  I started out with Science Diet, then moved to Blue Buffalo varieties.  I was happy with both of those, but I saw the Wellness Indoor Dry Cat Food recently and thought I would give it a try. I followed the same transition process I always do with new food, mixing a bit of new with the current. Because both of my cats are so easy-going, it only takes a few days to transition, and the only reason I follow this is to prevent any upset stomachs.  My cats would be happy to jump right in with new food.  I expected nothing different with the new $35 bag of Wellness.  How wrong I was. For whatever reason, neither of my cats will touch this stuff. They ate around it when I had it mixed in with their other food. Once I started filling their bowls exclusively with this Wellness food, both of them stopped eating altogether. I carried the bowls to them, and both of them turned their faces away quickly and ran off.  I really don't understand what it is about this particular food that caused such a negative reaction.  The ingredient list appears fine, and I certainly paid a premium for this bag of food - which I will now have to throw out.  I thought about giving it to the local shelter, but if my former shelter cats hate it, then I don't want to pass it off on some other cats, especially if I happened to get a bad batch.  After another day of the cats refusing to eat, I headed out to 7-Eleven late at night to buy a little box of whatever cat food they had on hand.  I brought home a small $2 box of Friskies, and my cats ate it up immediately.  I don't plan to continue with Friskies, but the fact that my cats went nuts for Friskies (out of hunger, sure, but they had never eaten Friskies in my home before), just confirmed my decision to throw out the Wellness.  I cannot afford to ever buy this product again and I certainly cannot recommend it.
