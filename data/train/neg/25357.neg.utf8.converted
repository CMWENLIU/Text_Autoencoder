What do you see when you look at the label? "Extra Virgin", right? I was duped at the grocery store by this label. Small print in a font that is almost illegible states "Mediterranean Blend Italian Sunflower and . . . " When I realized this, I read the ingredients: 85% Sunflower Oil!! This is beyond marketing; it is dishonest, and because of that I won't buy any more Viola products. I prefer to buy from companies that I can trust.
