I read the reviews, but thought that all I needed was a visual marker, so that I could train my dog to go there.  I read so many bad reviews, that I decided not to buy it online, however, I thought the people who said "the dog will pee anywhere but near the post" were exaggerating.<br /><br />So there I found myself, in Petco.  I asked for a toy hydrant (just a visual clue for training).  They said all they had was the pee post.  At that point, I figured it was the pee post, or nothing.  So I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />As you can tell by the 1 star review, I felt compelled to post my own review on amazon to save others who might eventually cave-in like I did.  Stay strong.  The other reviewers are not lying.<br /><br />I opened the package and was immediately overcome by the smell of pee.  You certainly do not have to be a dog, nor do you have to be near to smell that thing.  "Whoopee, this should work for sure."  After all, dogs hate the smell of other dog's pee, they feel compelled to pee over it.  My dog refuses to go near it to even smell the post.  They must have used pee (pheromones) from a super-aggressive dog, because my dog is conceding the yard to the post and now choses to pee elsewhere.<br /><br />I am thinking about washing the post in bleach and seeing if it has better results.
