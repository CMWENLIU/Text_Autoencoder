I drink tea every day. When my regular English Breakfast stock ran out, I ordered this item based on Amazon user reviews, which have always been reliable. How disappointed I was!<br /><br />The package I bought is sold by "MarJam LLC", the larger outside box came in perfect shape. However when I opened it, the two tea boxes inside looked crushed and broken in corners. It was clear they were already broken before being put into the delivery box, it's hard to believe somebody will knowingly ship crushed boxes to customers. As I tried to clean up the tapes and wrapping, dark tea power made a complete mess in the kitchen.<br /><br />At that point I was still hopeful, after all it's the tea not the packaging we buy. Unfortunately the first taste didn't do much for me, it was nothing special, less flavorful than a lot of regular brands. There were two things that should serve as indicators: 1) I looked at the expiry date it's in 2011, no manufacturing date shown; 2) Each large thin paper box holds 240 loose bags, compared to some other brands that have much better packaging to preserve the flavor. The regular 48 bag box I buy has two foil packs inside.<br /><br />To summarize, I got two big crushed boxes for a total of 480 loose tea bags, some of them are in power form no longer contained in bags. They lack flavor as of now. Unless I drink them in a few months, they will expire in 2011.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more disappointed.
