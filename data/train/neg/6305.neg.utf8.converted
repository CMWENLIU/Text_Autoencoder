This is an outrageous price on the english muffins, $6.95 and then $6.95 for the shipping.<br />I saw the Today show's segment on this today also, I too had to check it out. But it's not Amazon.com that is selling them for this outrageous price it's the other sellers.  Shopping Shark is one of them. "Shark" is right. Outrageous price. Check out the 2 pack price sold by Lil-Big Shots, $6.99 plus $44.15 shipping. These stores are off their rockers. Who ever in their right mind would purchase these??
