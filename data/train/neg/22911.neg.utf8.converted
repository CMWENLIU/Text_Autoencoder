Came in a ripped packing envelope, rubber-banded closed. Plastic bag inside was intact.  Berries more like the texture of stale rice cereal than raisins, like they are supposed to be.  Old, musty taste.  Bag not dated.  Imported from China. Nutrition information on sticker not standardized for US.  Seller not set up for refunds or returns.  Thumbs down experience.
