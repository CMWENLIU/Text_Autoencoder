Everybody seems to believe that Snickers are awesome.  But I just don't see it.<br /><br />Up until recently, I had never tried a Snickers bar.  But unfortunately, I lost a bet with my friend (Walter).  Otherwise, I would never have eaten a Snickers bar.<br />Now that I have eaten a Snickers bar, I can say with absolute conviction that they taste awful.  I recommend Ding Dongs or Ho Hos.
