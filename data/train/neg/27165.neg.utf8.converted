These sugar free jelly beans are not a successful substitute for diabetics to use.  They are individually wrapped and very difficult to unwrap.I was so frustrated by trying to unwrap that I threw them away.  The taste is not superior to the sugar frees available at retail stores and sugnificantly more expensive, not including shipping charges.  I believe that the one pound weight advertised included the advertisment, making the net weight less that a pound.
