<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3OERW">Sezme Sesame Snaps,  1.4-Ounce Snaps (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Hi,<br /><br />I have been buying these from REI stores for the last few years and a big fan of Sesame Snaps.<br /><br />Recently I noticed that Amazon is also selling at a much cheaper price than REI stores, so I decided to buy it from Amazon. First purchase was good and this was my 2nd purchase, which I ended up throwing it away the 2 boxes I ordered because<br /><br />a) It didn't had any expiration date<br />b) The snap inside the individual packs were breaking up while packet is not even open and there was a white powder coming out and while eating you can feel it is not fresh at all, though I ate only one piece and immediately noticed this.<br /><br />So I called Amazon and as usual Amazon folks are great in customer service and they were happy to refund my money for this product but I am still waiting to get an answer as what caused this expired item to be shipped to customers.<br /><br />I love this product so much that I am waiting to order it again as soon as I get a response from Amazon for this order.<br /><br />Thanks
