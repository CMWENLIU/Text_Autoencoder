NO TEA!  They took the tea OUT of the bags!  This was my absolute favorite tea: I drank it every day and kept it on auto-order.  Then suddenly one month I couldn't believe it: instead of lovely tea bags that justified their high price, they sent these pitiful bags with only a little hint of tea -- not enough to make even a single decent cup.  You can tell the old bags from the new by the wrappers: the good old ones were printed to match the box design, the bad new ones are just anonymous solid green.  I would never order it again.  They should charge a reduced price that's proportionate to the radical reduction in tea.  A complete rip-off.  Do not waste your money.
