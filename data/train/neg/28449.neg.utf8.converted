I'm not a member of the food police. However; I get really mad when a company short changes their customers hoping they will not notice. ESPECIALLY a supposed higher end "GOURMET" producer like Ghirardelli!<br /><br />The quick and dirty for those who don't want to read my detailed review.<br /><br />**Is it better than "Swiss Miss," YES.<br /><br />**Did it used to be better before they over-sweetened, cut the # of servings from 20 to 12 and generally ruined a decent product? YES!<br /><br />**Is it over-priced and resting on the Ghirardelli name? OH YES.<br /><br />**Is it a way to impress people who don't know any better albiet for a price? Probably.<br /><br />**Do I still recommend Ghirardelli Hot Chocolates. NOPE Not Any More. (want to know why? read on)<br /><br />For years I have enjoyed the Ghirardelli line of hot chocolates. That is about to change!<br /><br />NOTE: Until this year they have born the subtitle "Old Fashioned." That designation has been dropped for reasons which will soon become apparent. They have also quite conspicuously dropped the Product Satisfaction Guarantee along with the Ghirardelli address for applying for reimbursement if you the consumer were dissatisfied. Does this bode well for us? You be the judge and by all means let Ghirardelli know. I cannot include the address due to Amazon review policies. You may however contact them by email at their website.<br /><br />Something I strongly encourage. As a hot chocolate lover I want the original recipie back. I hope after reading my review you will too.<br /><br />What is Ghirardelli doing? Quite simply boosting the sugar levels to astronomical levels and engaging in what I call "shorting."<br /><br />Before a serving of any Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix consisted of (3) Tbsp., (22g) yielding twenty, (20) servings per 16oz. can.<br /><br />NOW one serving is (4) Tbsp., (39 grams) yielding only TWELVE (12) servings for the same 16oz. can. This gives us 40 percent LESS servings per can. And at an average of $5.50 per can less s&h an increase from 27.5 cents/serving to 45.8 cents/serving. -- Some may say this is gourmet hot chocolate why quarrel over a few cents. Fair question, but lets be sure were talking about chocolate and not cheap fillers.<br /><br />I have a few cans still left from the "Old Fashioned" style which is what Ghirardelli has marketed for years. It IS different and I can taste the difference. However, I will post both Nutrition labels side by side for you to compare and add my analysis at the end. Hopefully the facts will be as clear to you as they are me.<br /><br />NOTE: the nutrition label is a requirement of the USDA. Further they are reprinted everywhere so I am assuming that this is PUBLIC DOMAIN information.  (That doesn't mean that Ghirardelli will like me telling you about it.)<br /><br />I will be comparing Ghirardelli OLD FASHIONED HOT CHOCOLATE "DOUBLE CHOCOLATE" to the new replacement Ghirardelli PREMIUM HOT COCOA "DOUBLE CHOCOLATE."  Note it is now called Hot Cocoa & not Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I have Chocolate Mocha and Chocolate Hazelnut to compare as well and that the differences are negligible. It is usually only 0.5g of fat but mostly 1 - 2g of sugar is the usual difference. And of course both use natural & artificial flavors.<br /><br />THE COMPARISON<br /><br />OLD FASHIONED HOT CHOCOLATE_________PREMIUM HOT COCOA<br /><br />Serv Size 3 tbsp (22g) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

To my taste the NEW formula is much too sweet!<br /><br />The Nutrition label bears out my biggest gripes with this REFORMULATED product:<br /><br />  (1) It was sweet before. Now by UPPING the SUGAR so dramatically and adding salt as a sugar booster I no longer like it.<br /><br />  (2) Not enough fat and other ingredients were added to convince me that any REAL gains in CHOCOLATE were made.<br /><br />  ## The TASTE of the new formula bears this out. (I have taken to cutting the serving size and adding Cocoa powder to get more Chocolate and less sugar.<br /><br />  (3) I DESPISE the shorting (Pumping it full of sugar and Cutting the servings by almost HALF.)<br /><br />  (4) And the price stays the same for less. That really frosts my goblet<br /><br />I can no longer recommend this product.<br /><br />Ghirardelli You had a decent thing going and you blew it.<br /><br />PERSONALLY, I'm forwarding this review to the company and since Hot chocolate is just that. I'm going to experiment making either a home-made ganache syrup (melted chocolate & cream) or trying to find a way to finely grate or powder high quality chocolate to make my own brand. That's Really All The Old Style Was. Hot "Chocolate" not Cocoa.  I'm sure for people with way too much money there are Hot chocolates available through boutiques where price is no object or... it IS the object. I'm not that rich. Besides if I come up with a home version that curls your toes then I may go into business myself or just enjoy it with a few friends.
