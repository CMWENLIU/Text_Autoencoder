This syrup is indeed sugar-free; unfortunately, it is also pretty much taste-free as well. I bought this syrup for several years before I moved to Chicago and found it had excellent body and added a rich flavor to coffee.  This stuff is watery and practically tasteless. It was a total waste of money;  I should have returned it, but it was too much trouble.
