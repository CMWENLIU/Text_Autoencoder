Preparation for this product is easy. The hardest part of preparing it is cutting the chicken into 1 inch cubes. (I got my husband to do that part.) It's no more difficult to make this that it is to make Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where the positives end. It doesn't look particularly appetizing until you add the cheese at the end. Though the cheese flavor is pleasant, there is another seasoning packet that you add while it's cooking. I'm not sure what it's for since I couldn't taste it. The chicken had very little flavor at its core. The pasta (orzo?) looks deceptively like bowties on the box but actually more closely resembles rice. The broccoli "florets" may as well be left out. They add nothing. They come dried in a packet. They look like dust as you throw them into your food. My husband described them as unpleasantly textured despite the fact that they are little more than bits. Certainly not what I would consider florets.<br /><br />I'd actually been planning on trying this. The description is great, but the actual flavor falls short. We have leftovers that no one wants. I wouldn't be willing to try this again.
