i was not impressed one bit with this stuff. if it was any thinner you could pour it out of the can. i tried chicken soup for the dog lovers soul and it was an instant success with my dogs. actually had to break it up with a spoon. also it is much cheeper than blue buffalo and the quality is right up there with all other designer dog foods. most importantly it's also made in USA.
