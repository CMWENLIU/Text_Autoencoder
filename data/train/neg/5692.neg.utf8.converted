original review below *****<br /><br />finally made coffee drink from coffee bean direct sumatra blend; otherwise only espresso with milk. so was able to taste this sumatra coffee naked. it is not good, but i would not rate it in taste any worse than starbucks, whose house coffee is poor. but then i am comparing it to italian coffee beans -Moreno, LavAzza and illy- and Kenya AA, all medium roast.<br /><br />changed rating from 3 stars to 2 stars.<br /><br />*************<br />medium roast, taste is lighter, ergo not as bitter, as typically burnt american beans.<br /><br />but found on the company website that the decaf process is Methylene Chloride.<br /><br />Wikipedia describes in depth the dangers of this chemical. hopefully coffee bean direct will encourage their suppliers to switch to the CO2 or swiss water decaf process.
