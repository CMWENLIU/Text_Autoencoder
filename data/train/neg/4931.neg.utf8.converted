I introduced this expensive dry cat food to my four little ones yesterday, and all night long they were jumping around on the bed waking me up (they only do this when their feeder is empty) because they were hungry and didn't want to TOUCH this food. Only one of them (who will eat practically ANYTHING) is okay with it. The rest nibble a bit, and then shove it around on the floor in front of their bowl. I read the reviews and thought this would be an instant hit - so what am I doing wrong? Should I mix it with some of their old kitty "junk" food (aka Purina One) or is it a lost cause? Please help, I want my babies to be healthy!<br /><br />PS. I will change my rating if they actually start eating it, but until then it's one star for the 1 out of 4 cats that are eating it. One of my cats would rather eat foam peanuts than this food (NOT good or healthy)...
