Considering the candy only had to come from Texas, I thought a week,from order to receiving, was a long time. When I checked the wrappers on the bars, I found out that they are best when eaten by Dec., 2009!!I only got them on the 22nd of Oct.!!When I opened the first candy bar, i really found out how old it was. The chocolate had started to separate,turning a milky white in color.Next time I want some Aero bars, I'll pay a little more from another vendor, and hopefully get a better product.
