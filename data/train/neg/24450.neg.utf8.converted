I bought this mix because Amazon was out of the Stonewall Kitchen mix.  It is easy to review elecronics and such because you can talk about those things objectively. In reviewing things that relate to taste and flavor, its difficult to say anything other than "I don't like it!"  So here is my best effort....the taste, the texture, and the color were all off.  I have only used it as a waffle mix so I can't speak to how the pancakes taste.  For the waffles, the taste was 'too' malty (yes, I know its a malted mix).  Also, the waffles were too dense and it was hard to get the insides cooked and the outside to look perfectly golden.  For me, Stonewall Kitchen wins hands down!!
