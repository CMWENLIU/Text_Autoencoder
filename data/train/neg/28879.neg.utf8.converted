I can't recommend Splenda (sucralose) for people (like me) who have low thyroid problems. I loved Splenda for 10 yrs until I realized the connection - chlorine interferes with thyroid production, Splenda is made of chlorinated sugar, & over the years my thyroid was doing worse & worse. I now have to treat with medication & I still have low thyroid symptoms. I'm sick everyone telling me how hot it is when I'm always freezing. I wish I knew about Splenda & chlorine from the beginning...I wouldn't have 'poisoned' my thyroid for the past 10 yrs.
