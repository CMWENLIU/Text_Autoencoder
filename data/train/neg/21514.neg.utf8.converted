I had enjoyed these cookies when I had purchased them through a local coffee drive-thru.  I decided to order some to help fill me up and keep me from eating unhealthy foods.  I had really enjoyed the ones from the coffee place.  When I ordered them they were flat and didn't look right.  When I opened the first one it had a white spot in it and I thought it was just part of the mix not mixed all the way, but when I opened the second one I realized that it was actually mold.  I had ordered two-dozen and had to throw most of them away.  I wasted my money.  I also wrote in to the company but haven't received an email or anything back.  I'm very disappointed.
