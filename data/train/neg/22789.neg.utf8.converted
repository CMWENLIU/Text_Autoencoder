Ok, maybe it's me, but when I see that this is a sampler, with TONS of different flavors listed, I assume that I am going to get just that - tons of different flavors. Or atleast give me a similar number of each flavor. This order was a joke from the beginning. It arrived in a punctured box but perhaps that happened in delivery. I open the box and find a paper bag, stapled shut. I open the paper bag & find a bunch of tossed in k-cups. Then when I pull them out, I counted that I had like 9 of one flavor, and 1 of some and 2 or 3 of others... This really is incredibly unorganized. I will not buy from this vendor again.
