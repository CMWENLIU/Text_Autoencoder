I purchased 2 33 oz. bags of 8 o;clock columbian whole bean coffee from Amazon.Ive been using this brand for about 1 year. The 1st bag the beans had no oil on them, but made a decent cup of coffee. I just opened the 2nd bag and was very disapointed,the beans were dried out,they smelled like staw and had a bad taste. I will not waste my money on this product again.
