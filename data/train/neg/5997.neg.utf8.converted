I am on the Medifast diet, so was looking for a few low carb/low calorie options to add to my daily diet.  When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.  I will say that their caramel dip is very good, but I wonder why they are still able to make enough money from this "peanut butter" to keep producing it!
