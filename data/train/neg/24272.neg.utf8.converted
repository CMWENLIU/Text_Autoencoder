bought this "pretzel salt"  was expecting the type of salt you get on a pretzel from pretzel vendors (which is actually fine salt pressed together to make larger granuals) this salt is just a little courser than kosher salt and much smaller than course sea salt ... if your looking for an actual pretzel salt this is not for you
