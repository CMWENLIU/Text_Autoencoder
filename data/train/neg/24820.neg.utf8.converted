First let me say that I eat a healthy, balanced variety of foods, and am not prone to hardly any bodily disorders.<br />I eat lots of bread and cereal, so this seemed a good choice for supposed good benefits.<br /><br />I noticed after only one bowl, some stomach discomfort and bloating - something I never get save after the massive Thanksgiving dinner.  It lasted 1 full day, and made me wonder...  I ate another bowl 2 days later, and sure enough it happened again.  After checking online I found a vast amount of space already dedicated to the potent side effects of eating Kashi (noxious gas, bloating, diarrhea...)<br /><br />So, a word to the wise - see if any of these symptoms develop coincidentally with the eating of this cereal.  Otherwise it has good flavor - but is overly dry and reminds one of chewing styrophoam...  I guess I'll pass and keep eating my Triscuits and Raisin Bran :)
