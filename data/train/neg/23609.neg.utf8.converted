I thought this was all coconut oil but it's not<br />  the taste is plain, I was not impressed. I would rather buy REAL<br />  Coconut oil.<br />  I wont spoil, it taste great, you dont have to refrigate it, and<br />  its lower in the bad fat than any other oil including olive oil.<br />  It will not make your food taste like coconut.<br />  It can stand heat up to 375 degrees without smoking.<br />  Be sure and buy the cold pressed coconut oil.  Happy popping!
