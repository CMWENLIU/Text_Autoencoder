Sorry, but the first reviewer was right.  I have tried this brand a couple of times hoping I had just bought a bad box the first time.  The taste is like cardboard and the textture is grainy.  I eat all natural foods and this one is not up to my standards.  Try Back to Nature brand or Annie's Home Grown.  My kids prefer Annie's Bunnies but I like the Back to Nature sticks.
