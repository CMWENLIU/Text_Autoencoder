I bought this to use in baking. As a low-carber of many years, I have learned to use several dry ingredients together to take the place of plain flour. Even though I only use this as part of the dry ingredient mix, the soy taste is still prevalent in the end result. I now add just a tablespoon or so to my baked goods just so that I can use it up, but I will never buy it again. Everything else I have used from Bob's Red Mill has been very good, so I had higher hopes for this product.
