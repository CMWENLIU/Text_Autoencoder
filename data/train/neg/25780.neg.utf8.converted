As with other reviewers, I got so far then Cutter stopped coming out around the 16 oz. mark. What is even more frustrating is filling out the entire customer contact questionnaire on their website including UPC, lot #, and personal info then the "submit" button conveniently doesn't work (nor did "enter").  I know that I am not in alone in the feeling of being constantly jerked around by these corporations that are only looking out for their stockholders which, obviously,  no longer includes customer satisfaction.  When this happens to me, I stop doing business with the offending company period, end of story, bye-bye. If more of us did this, it would speak volumes....just saying
