I've ordered Hawaiian Sun products before and was satisfied. This time I found little bugs and eggs under the cellophane wrapper on one of four bottles I received. They even got all the way under the plastic cap along the threads of the cap. I understand that there are (it looked like cockroach eggs which I have seen before) dirty, nasty stuff in warehouses, but like to think the person who packed the order would have seen it and not include it. Maybe needs better light in the warehouse. I was gross out about it but am not  average person, so I rinsed it off and used it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GU0A06">Hawaiian Sun Premium Coconut Syrup, 11.5-Ounce Jars (Pack of 4)</a>
