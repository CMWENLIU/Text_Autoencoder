If this stuff gets near your eyes you will look through a haze for days (for example, you put it on away from your eyes but as you sleep it gets on the pillow then on your eyelids).  It takes forever to sink in your skin.  Smells nice, though...if you are a coffee lover.  The pump was broken on mine when I got it so I had to take the lid off to use.  It is very thick, almost like cream cheese, so it's difficult to get out of the jar (I figure that's why the pump wouldn't work).  I used (nightly) almost the whole bottle with no results in face condition.  It sits on top of the skin so I generally had to wash it off in the morning before applying make-up.
