Beans arrived and were promptly ground and brewed. Upon tasting I noticed the coffee was a fair bit weaker than I remember when visiting Sant'Eustachio in Rome. 3/4 through the can of beans I flipped over the can and noticed the date. 2007. Wow. Talk about super expired out dated beans.<br /><br />Given the other reviewers postings -- I'd give up and just buy beans from somewhere else. It won't be the same but won't be as disappointing as these ones.
