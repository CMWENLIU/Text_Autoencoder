Got some of this at wally world ...maybe it was old or something but it was awful....bitter...useless....i threw it out...this price here is ridiculous... NOT RECOMONDED !!!! One reason I did buy it was because it was not in a clear bottle, olive oil should never be in a clear bottle, but when the oil in it is lousy i guess it doesent matter. Cant blame this on china i guess :|
