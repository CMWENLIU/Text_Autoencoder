I have done considerable reading on olive oil quality and sad to say, there is quite a bit of adulterated oil on the market. I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test.
