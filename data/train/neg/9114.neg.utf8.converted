I used to buy this and the green curry paste and loved it. The last batch I purchased is very bland - I used more than half a jar for a two-person serving, and it wasn't very spicy at all. I am sorry that I bought four jars of each flavor - now I'll have to find someone who doesn't know what Thai food is supposed to taste like and give it to them.
