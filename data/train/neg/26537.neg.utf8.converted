These are cute, and came complete, no broken pieces to contend with. However, I am really dissapointed that there were only enough pieces to decorate nine cupcakes. It didn't sepcify in the listing how many sheets it included and I naively assumed that there were many sheets. It just seems rather expensive for what you get.
