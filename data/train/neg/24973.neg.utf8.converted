It's a shame, because I really wanted to like Fiber One. The texture is great (nice and crunchy...though it makes me think a little of pet food XD ), and the fiber content is super. But the aspartame is a dealbreaker for me. I used to consume aspartame (in chewing gum and 1-4 cans of diet coke a day) and discovered that it was actually giving me migraines and hiking up my anxiety level (haven't had a migraine or panic attack in 4 years since quitting it). If I accidentally get some, I get headaches and start feeling nervous right away... So, while the studies on brain tumors is controversial, I avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />But I found today a wonderful alternative to Fiber One is Smart Bran. It has a whopping 13+ grams of fiber and tastes pretty good without the nasty artificial sweeteners. It also doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. It would be lovely if General Mills changed their Fiber One to be healthier. 10-20 calories less in a cereal isn't worth headaches and other health impacts from Aspartame...plus it's nice when cereal has a decent aftertaste.
