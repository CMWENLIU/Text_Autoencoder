First let me say that I did purchased this from the Amazon option, the pictured product, EQUALis not what you will receive, you will get a sweetener called "Sweet Mate" which sells at the 99 cent stores. This is a cheaper product made with different quemicals and ingredients than Equal. I informed Amazon and I still can't believe they haven't removed or change this product. Another reviewer says that the product is made by EQUAL, not true,it is just distributed by a vendor that also distribute Equal. This do not taste like EQUAL at all.  Amazon wanted me to reorder it to see if I got a different one again, even after telling them that all feedbacks said they received a different product than the one listed. Doesn't make sense at all, how many people ned to receive the wrong product for them to do something about it? I love Amazon but this is a big disappointment.
