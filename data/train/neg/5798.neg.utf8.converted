I love coconut oil.  It should last about two years unrefridgerated and this product came to me out dated by one month and the seperate product that I took out to use, went rancid and smelled terribly. I have never had coconut oil go rancid on me.  I kept the jar in the fridge and still used it for cooking and on my skin. The product turned black when heated and this is not a good sign.  I think Vitacost is a great company and they made a mistake and I would buy from them again, but I will send back outdated product from now on.<br />Deb
