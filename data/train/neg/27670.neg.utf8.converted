I purchased four boxes - one of each variety for around 40 bucks total. These things are the size of an oreo and you're paying almost a dollar a cookie and they're way too sweet. You have to be crazy to spend this kind of money on these things. I'll take the Kashi cookies any day over these. They may be healthier than Kashi but you'll tire of Caveman real quick and I still have some in the fridge because they're horrible and I can't even finish them off. Dr. Oz recommended these cookies and it cost me $40 bucks to find out I hate them. Save your money and buy KASHI. Enjoy a real cookie for God's sake. I can't believe this company can stay in business with these overpriced novelties.
