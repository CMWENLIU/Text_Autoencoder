This item arrived fairly quickly but was unedible. I can't help but wonder if it spoiled in transit or was it spoiled at the warehouse. For starters, the color wasn't anything like the picture. It wasn't bright orange. It was more brown in color. It was only half full and it definitely wasn't "fluffy" looking. Against my better judgement, I spooned more than a few into my mouth only to discover that it had a horrible bitter taste to it. Because it is a grocery item, Amazon's policies prohibit its return (for safety reasons). However, Amazon did continue to earn my business by quickly refunding the $20 I paid for it. The refund processed within a day. I won't ever buy this product again.
