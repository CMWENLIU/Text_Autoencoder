I had 7 chips and will never eat another.  The taste and texture were great, but then a sensation of grease began to build in mouth and throat.  I thought it was because I've been eating so little fat, but then looked for reviews and discovered that it's not just me.  Will have to toss in the backyard compost pile.  Too bad.
