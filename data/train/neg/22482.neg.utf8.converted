I've been using my new Beaba Babycook less than once a day for three months. It started leaking terribly whereby my entire unit would be sitting in a puddle of water after each cooking session -- VERY dangerous given this is an electrical appliance, so I contacted Customer Service. They very correctly told m that if the pitcher leaks, it is because the gasket needs to be replaced. I did exactly as told and it did fix the problem. However, I was concerned that I have used the Beaba less than once a day in the course of two months and the gasket already needed replacing. I was only pureeing poached pears and zucchini after all, nothing hard. Anyway, I raised this concern with Beaba and they basically expect you to buy a new gasket every month to replace the broken one. That's $2+shipping every month ON TOP OF $150 for the basic unit?!?!? That seems a bit ridiculous to me. Very disappointed in the overall design of the Babycook if this is what I am to expect.<br />Out shopping for a different baby food cooker and NOT recommending this one nor buying it for any expectant parents ever again!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have also had problems with the lid not matching up to the pitcher, and the food being pureed always shoots out the back and sides. This happens EVERY time I use it and sometimes, when using more water, it is very dangerous: Today, I scalded my entire forearm because the boiling hot water sprayed out when I was pureeing my steamed veggie. This is a very dangerous (and messy) design flaw and I don't see why for $150, Beaba can't make something where the lid actually covers the cooking unit.
