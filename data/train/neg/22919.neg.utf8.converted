I've tried many, many gummis made by Haribo.  This one is TOTALLY different from the others in terms of taste and texture.  They are not as chewy as the others, almost more like a gumdrop?  I'm not even sure how to explain it.  Others may like this texture, but if you are expecting the standard Haribo chewiness like I was, you might not like this either.  The texture just ruined it for me...
