I buy McCormick bacon bits at the supermarket specifically because they are the only brand I can find that does not contain partially hydrogenated oil, and I jumped at the chance to stock up on these at a greatly reduced price vs. the supermarket. When I opened the package I found that these in fact have partially hydrogenated soybean oil. Gross. And worse yet, Amazon doesn't allow returns on this so it looks like I am stuck with this inedible mistake.
