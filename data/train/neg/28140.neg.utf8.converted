I have also just noticed that the company has changed the product it is delivering.  It is distilled water, not the spring water.  I am very unhappy and have decided to stop purchasing this brand.  The distilled "vapor" water has a flat, nasty taste and is a far cry from the wonderful refreshing New Zealand spring water.  I am quite unhappy that they have changed and are still marketing it as the EXACT SAME PRODUCT.
