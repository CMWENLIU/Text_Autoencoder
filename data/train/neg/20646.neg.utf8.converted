Hi Tommy Here<br />Purchased 2.5 sopressata as price and shipping were great.I was going to slice a half pound at a time and give to my kids when they came over.I tasted one slice and found it to be medicinal and very sour.Its texture and smell were perfect,but was inedible.I asked my 27 year old daughter to taste(in case it was me)and she spit it out.She loves sopressata.So sorry Columbus<br />Maybe Californians have no taste buds.Was refunded by Taylor's.
