The most I can say about this product is that it has an interesting label. I had a palm full which left a terrible bitter taste in my mouth for six hours until dinner when it started to go away. I didn't feel so good either. The pieces were very stuck together and some appeared to have very tiny pieces of leaf attached to them. I have purchased several other brands from local natural food stores with no problem whatsoever, so I figured that all would be well to order something unknown online. I also didn't want to run out of goji berries and have to pay for shipping very soon, so I ordered to two sets which totals four bags. I finished my supply from the natural food store today, and I started on the Extreme Health which is one day beyond the Amazon.com return policy. Therefore I'll have to throw in the trash about $60. LESSON: Never order any food that you're not sure about even if it has a pretty label and/or try it out before one month or you can't return it to Amazon.com.
