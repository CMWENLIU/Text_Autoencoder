Don't be fooled by the "600 count" marketing: the gum pieces are very small, to the point that I just consider there to be 300 pieces that come in half-piece chunks.  As the other reviewers say, the flavor disappears very quickly and unsatisfactorily.  Also, the package came destroyed, which means that I only had ~200 usable pieces of gum, since the rest had fallen out.  It can, however, get the job done if you have nothing else, hence the second star.<br /><br />I would suggest getting Trident instead, which is the same flavor and also contains xylitol: it's cheaper, you get more pieces of gum, and they're better.  Don't waste your time with Spry.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Trident-Tropical-Sugarless-18-Piece-Packages/dp/B001IZ431I/
