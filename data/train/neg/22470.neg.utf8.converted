I ordered this and I got confirmation they sent my fruitcake to my PO Box via UPS.  Which of course, can't be done!!  My fruitcake arrived 19 days later.  It was vacuum sealed.  It was not moist.  It was as heavy as a brick and very tiny like half a brick.  Careful around small feet and pets.  As I was trying it...I was also reading the ingredients on the back.  Horrifying....They say "fresh" but the ingredients list says mono & diglycerides 2 times, artificial flavor 3 times (one is artificial butter), partially hydrogentated oil, many preservatives including Sulfur Dioxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Benzoate of Soda and also something called Gum Tragacanth.  I always knew the candied fruit in fruit cake may not be naturally dried fruit, but I prefer that the rest of the cake is truly fresh.  I tried this `cause it came in a small size and was less expensive, but normally I get the Assumption Abbey Trappist Monk (Missouri Ozarks) cake, which only comes in one size, but does also have 4 stars on Amazon reviews.  It's ingredients list was much less of a shocker.  It is very very moist, you can taste more remnants of the  rum (but not boozy - my kids like too).
