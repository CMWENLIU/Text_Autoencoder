as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit "homesick", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the "original", much better.
