I've had these M&Ms before and they are delicious. The bag sold by this reseller however is absolutely terrible!<br /><br />When I opened the bag, much of the color had faded from the candies. This was the first sign that they were old or expired. I tasted a few and they tasted miserable. The crisped rice center had the most horrendous after taste I've ever had from a candy. There was also a fruity flavor, which is totally creepy given that these are chocolates.<br /><br />Bottom line: DO NOT BUY THESE M&Ms FROM THIS RESELLER.
