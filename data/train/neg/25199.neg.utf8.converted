My dog did not like this food much at all.  A lot of the other reviews I read stated that it helped their dogs w/ itching and flaky skin, didn't help mine at all. For me, it was a waste of money. Every time I put it in his bowl, he looked at me w/ a sad look in his eyes as if he was begging for something else.
