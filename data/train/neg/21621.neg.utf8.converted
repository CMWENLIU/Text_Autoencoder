I bought this at Costco after reading the ingredients - only chicken, sweet potato and glycerin.  Only later did I see that were made in China.  I had given my Standard Poodle 2 of them about two months ago and afterwards she couldn't poop for 3 days, a problem she never had.  I thought it MUST have been something else she ate but was concerned so I put the treats away.  Three days ago, I thought I was being neurotic and decided to give her 1 treat and see if there were any problems.  The next day she didn't poop and by that night a bump was forming next to her anus that clearly made her uncomfortable; by morning it was red and looked awful.  I drove her to the vet when it opened.  Her anal sac had ruptured.  She needed general anesthetic, surgery, and 14 days of antibiotics.  I told the vet my theory about the treats; she said that two weeks ago, another dog was brought in after eating the exact same treats.  She said that dog died of renal failure.  The vet also said that she had bought the same treats for her dog, and her dog was sick afterwards, so she threw them away.  I wrote an incident report to Costco and hopefully an investigation will follow.  These treats are potentially deadly.  For my dog, it made her very very sick.  The vet bill was $450.  I don't believe there are only three ingredients in these treats.
