WARNING WARNING!!!!  This is DOG Food,  I fed my precious cat 10 cans of this, (he was not fond of it) before I realized it says DOG Food on the label in such tiny print!!!<br />I have used Weruva products before that my cats love, especially the Asian fish but Amazon was back ordered so I ordered this because Amazon says it is cat food --WRONG.  Buyer Beware!!  I don't own a dog so I guess the neighbor's dog will  enjoy some expensive food.
