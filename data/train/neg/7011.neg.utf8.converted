I had been using Monin Dark Chocolate and love and flavor.  Just for variety I ordered some AhLaska.  What a mistake!  AhLaska is way too sweet and it has some kind of odd overtone in the flavor.  Sorry to say, it is at the point that it ruins anything that I put it on.  So I'm giving up on the AhLaska and going back to Monin.<br /><br />To help you decide whether my review relates to you, I'll tell you about my taste preferences.  I like dark chocolate, not on the sweet side.  I like my coffee and tea with no sugar.  When it comes to ice cream, I like just about anything that's high quality and well balanced.  Vanilla, chocolate, fruits and nuts are all great for me.<br /><br />I hope this helps you with your selections.  Bon Appetit.
