I was super stoked when I saw that Kellogg's was offering gluten free Rice Krispies. I mean, it's rice so it should be gluten free, right?! Well, like communism, that's a great theory. These GF krispies could not be farther from what actual rice krispies taste like. Blerg. They taste like cardboard and turn to mush in your mouth, even when you use them to make rice krispie treats.<br /><br />I think it was the choice to use brown rice. I'm not sure why they chose to do this, possibly because many people who are gluten free are also very concerned about eating "natural" foods. I'm all for balanced nutrition and whole grains, but for the love of god, I'm gluten free because I have Celiac. I've given up enough. Must I also suffer through Rice Krispies that taste like sticks?! If I wanted some hippie-dippie cereal, I would have no problem choosing one from the vast array of buckwheat twigs and no-sugar added corn knobs at Whole Foods. But I don't want that; I want Rice Krispies. I desire to drench these little pellets in melted marshmallow and margarine, so let's not kid ourselves: this is not a health food to many people, and I'm not sure why they tried to turn it into one.<br /><br />In short, these get a "participant" ribbon for showing up. If they would have tried to stay closer to the original recipe without the malt flavoring, then we'd be talking about a big ol' blue 1st place award, but alas, it was not to be.
