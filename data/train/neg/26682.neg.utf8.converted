My husband and I bought an "Annies" mac and cheese one night at our local store.  It was amazing, and we were so excited that we decided to buy a large lot online.  I couldn't find the exact style we bought, but the lable on this box was almost identical to the other Annies.  I was WRONG, this was awful - the cheese was a powder instead of the pre-mixed packet that came in our original box.  It was watery and smelled like vomit.  It left a bad after-taste.  I do not recommend this particular type of Annies.
