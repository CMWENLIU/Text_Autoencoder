this is not what i expected, the bag is big but it looks heavier than it is. this product doesn't have much weight to it at all, and you have to use so much just to notice any sweetness. they say this compares cup for cup with brown sugar, i'm going to have to disagree with that.<br /><br />I also bought the small 50 packets by ideal. and had the opposite effect. I think it is an excellent product. it seems like there's hardly anything in the packet but to me one little packet compares to 2tsp of sugar when i put it in my coffee.
