Before trying this product, I tried making a native starter, just picking up whatever yeast was flying around in the air in Austin, Texas. That worked from a functional point of view, but had no sour flavor.<br /><br />In the process, I got myself a nice glass jar (formerly a Clausen pickle jar) punched holes in the lid. I made sure to use wooden utensils when mixing. I went to the baby aisle of the grocery store and got a bottle of distilled water to make sure there would be no chlorine present.<br /><br />Everything worked as described all over the place...very active starter...somewhat slow rising...pretty good bread texture...just no sour flavor.<br /><br />So I purchased this product.<br /><br />I followed the instructions carefully, feeding every 12 hours, using a glass container, stirring with wooden chopsticks and using distilled water.  It took three days to activate and another day or two to get very reliable...and at that point it was....indistinguishable from the local starter. No sour aroma or flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />In other words, a packet containing 1/2 tsp of ordinary flour would have worked equally well.
