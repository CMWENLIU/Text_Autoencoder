I've had much tastier creamy potato soup for a much cheaper price.  The other reviewer is right when stating Amazon's price is of the "32oz" at the stores.  The onion gave it an off taste and the texture wasn't as creamy as the others like carrot and tomato.  And..it was bland.  Too pricy for something so bland, with such little nutritional value, so high sodium..what's the point?  At least the carrot soups were high in Vit A.<br /><br />Also beware:  My boxes didn't have the snap seal on top which upset me.  I have to put a bag over them in the fridge.  NOT worth it!
