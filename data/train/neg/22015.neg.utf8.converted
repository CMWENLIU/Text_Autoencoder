I loved the taste of this product but just noticed they are made in China.  I contacted the company to get more information. They said they test for quality but in fact the list they gave me was for bacterial contaminants only. They do not test for lead or other heavy metals, just salmonella, aflatoxin and microbiological testing. And they do not own the factory, they just contract out the production and inspect the factory.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, some of them are from China, such as the malt syrup. And the US ingredients are shipped all the way to China, the product is made, then it is shipped all the way back. This was to cut costs according to a business journal report on the company. I hate to see what the carbon production is for each bar based on that practice. And for the price they sell the product for, which is quite expensive, this way of saving a buck speaks poorly to the company's ethics. I for one will no longer buy this product.
