I picked up four cans of Snow's Clam Chowder.  I noticed it said Bumble Bee on it but didn't think anything of it.  I prepared one can and when I took a taste to see if it was hot enough, I was suprised at how yucky it tasted.  I thought I had done something wrong, so I rechecked my steps.<br /><br />1.  Open the can.  CHECK<br />2.  Pour into small pot.  CHECK<br />3.  Add milk.  CHECK<br />4.  Heat while stirring.  CHECK<br /><br />It should have tasted like a slice of heaven, but instead tasted like dog food.<br /><br />DOG FOOD!!!<br /><br />I doubt a dog would even eat this garbage.
