This was advertized as an herbal tea sampler of Bigelow and Celestial Seasons products. There were very few teas that met this standard.  The majority were decaffeinated and teas from other manufacturers. There was also a caffeinated breakfast blend! This combination was definately not indicatd in either the picture or the written description!
