Companies don't change things to make them better, they change them to try and increase their profitability.  Kraft has taken what was a great product and turned it into pure crap.  I'm sure some bean counter somewhere got a big raise for coming up with the "new" version of these bars and saving the company one penny per bar.  I'm sad to say that the great peanut butter bars I enjoyed are now gone.  Thanks Kraft.
