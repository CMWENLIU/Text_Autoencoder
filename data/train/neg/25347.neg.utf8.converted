The shipping speed was ok.However, like the others have said the picture is decieving.<br />The product was much smaller and the portions was for one person alone. If you are ordering this and thinking that you are going to get something that more than one person can share dont get this.<br />There was nothing fancy about this at all and I have had oreros taste better than what was included in the box. I think this was my first and last time ordering this.
