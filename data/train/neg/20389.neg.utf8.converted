Innova pet foods, the maker of Evo, have been found to test positive for Acetaminophen (Non aspirin pain reliever) which is ----TOXIC TO CATS ----. This information is according to many online sources. To read more about Acetaminophen contamination try this search on Google: innova+acetaminophen.<br /><br />We were very disappointed when we came across this information as this cat food costs a lot of money and yet was not safe for our cats. We had fed several bags of Evo to our cats so we contacted the folks at Innova for some reassurance but there was no response.<br /><br />We have since switched to Halo Cat Food. All ingredients in Halo are from the USA and our cats love it.
