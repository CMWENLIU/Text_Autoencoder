This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think "Lickety Stik" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions ("give a lick" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless.
