I have a professional expresso machine and have had it for nearly 10 years. I decided to try these beans because the hype was convincing.  The express / lattes that were made using these beans was really awful. It tasted like gas station out of a vending machine coffee.  It was so bad that I had to brew all the beans to remove from my machine and it did this so that i could put in Starbucks beans. So much for experimenting.
