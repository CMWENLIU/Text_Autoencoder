I ordered this version b/c my other Subscribe & save was out of stock, what a mistake! This favored coconut water is horrible! I liked the Vita Coconut juice with flavors since the taste was light and not too sweet or overpowering. This was just horrible in that it totally overpowered the taste of the coco water and it was so sweet / artificial tasting. I just wish I could return food items b/c this is terrible. Now stuck with 12 of these....
