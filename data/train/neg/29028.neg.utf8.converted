I felt compelled to donate this product to my co-workers who crave pretty much anything as a snack.... and left it on the counter for others to eat, package comes in 3 stacks of cookies....If you like ginger and lemon as a combination then go for it...but personally the ginger without the lemon taste would be much better, my taste buds were not happy with this purchase! NOTE: THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT HORRIBLY BAD.... BUT NOT AS TASTY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BASED ON THE ABOVE REVIEWS....
