I bought a package of these gummi bears and was surprised that there was no caloric information, no serving size, no listing of how many carbohydrates, sugars, sugar alcohols, etc. on the label. Being a diabetic, it is very important to have this information. And what happened when I sent emails, TWICE, to Haribo requesting this information? I was ignored both times.<br /><br />So that makes me wonder what Haribo is trying to hide. Why won't they give me the information I have twice requested from this company and which is to the best of my knowledge, REQUIRED on ALL food labels on products sold in the United States.<br /><br />Because of Haribo's refusal to acknowledge my request for this information, I am now very seriously contemplating contacting the FDA to see what they have to say about Haribo's failure to not only put this information on their labels for this product, but for their continued ignoring of my repeated requests.<br /><br />Please, buy this product at your own risk.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I FINALLY received a response from Haribo regarding my request for the nutritional info. Took two months. I'm guessing that someone from the company saw my remarks and decided to cover themselves. At any rate, I was going to post the nutritional info in my post to help anyone else looking for this information, but I see that Haribo has already done this since I see that there's now a nutritional link provided. It shouldn't have taken an angry email and posting here to get the information we need posted, but at least it's posted now, and you all can be better informed when making the decision as to whether or not you wish to purchase this product.<br /><br />Btw, according to their nutritional info, a serving size is 17 bears. As many of you have already posted, eating that many has caused gassiness amongst other issues, so if I were you, I'd adjust your serving size to suit your personal needs accordingly. Especially if you are watching your calories since 17 bears = 160 calories.<br /><br />Good luck everyone!
