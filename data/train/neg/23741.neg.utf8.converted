This looked like a great way to buy a variety pack of nuts, in snack sizes that would keep me from eating too many. The problem is that peanuts are sort of the "junk" nut if you're trying to eat healthy. (stick to almonds and walnuts)<br />Plus buying individual packs is more expensive. But the worse offense- several packages were rancid! It seemed to be the plain salted peanuts mostly. The honey nuts had a slightly off taste, but not as bad as the salted peanuts. The cashews were OK, but not as good as cashews I've had from regular cans of Planters. I think what might happen is that shipping in the summer in the Southern states causes a lot of degradation in the flavor in the packages.<br />Don't waste your money on this, because you just don't know what you're going to get.
