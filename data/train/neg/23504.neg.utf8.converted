I, myself always enjoyed this movie, it's very funny and entertaining, so I didn't hesitate to pick up the clamshell edition.  I guess it was a marketing plan to make the movie more for families or something, but they  have eliminated all strong profanity and elements that are usually edited  in the television version.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  If you want the uncut  version, AVOID THE CLAMSHELL EDITION!
