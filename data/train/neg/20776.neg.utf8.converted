I really wanted the Havahart Critter Ridder to work, but unfortunately it hasn't helped with our critter problem. We have squirrels around our house daily, and skunk and raccoon that come into our yard every week or so to dig up our ground cover looking for grubs. I have tried repellent sprays and other products before, but nothing seems to deter them. I followed the directions on the Havahart Granular Shaker, and applied it where we most often have a problem. Although we continued to have squirrels appear every day, I was hopeful about keeping the other animals away because nothing happened for about a week. However, after about seven days I awoke to find my ground cover dug up in many of the places where I had applied this repellent. Even if it did work for seven days (which is doubtful because we've gone that long before with no incidents) it would be far to expensive to apply it every week. I won't try this product again.
