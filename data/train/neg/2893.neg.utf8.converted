I also purchased this product in March and within a couple of months 10 of the 48 cans I purchased were bulging severely (looks like they are about to burst), plus many others bulging slightly.  I've contacted the manufacturer and they weren't very responsive at first, but have promised to give me a refund after I go through the hassle of peeling labels off every one of these cans and send them to them.<br />Note: the date code on my cans is A8KX24, same as the previous reviewer with this problem.
