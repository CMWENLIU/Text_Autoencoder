When I ate my first handful of these I thought "wow, these bad boys are amazing and I have a feeling I'll be pounding through a canister really quickly". However, shortly thereafter I had that awful aftertaste in my mouth of artificial sweetener. In shock, I looked at the ingredients and sure enough, there was the dreaded ingredient.<br /><br />All-in-all, not bad if you don't mind artificial sweetener. I hate the stuff so these were not for me.
