I used to buy this product all the time at walmart, it was always very fresh and not too over powering. Well this improved flavor or what ever you want to call it, is way too sweet. I wanted a meaty protein snack not a big bag of sugar! This product had high marks from me before when i got it from walmart, but i havent seen it at walmart for a long while now, it may have been discontinued so when i saw it here i thought i knew what i was getting into....boy, was i wrong....too much sugar, it has killed the flavor for me. will not be buying this again.
