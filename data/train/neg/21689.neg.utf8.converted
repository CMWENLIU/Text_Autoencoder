I have been trying to build up a reasonable supply of shelf stable supplies in case of emergency (or just to avoid going to the store for a few days longer). I knew milk would be challenge, so I ordered Nido and Saco to compare. Nido tastes like baby formula and I find that to be so repulsive that I breastfed all my kids partly to avoid smelling it myself! Buy the Saco!!! It's really quite good even though it's fat free. If you want it to taste more like whole milk, you can add more powder. Nido has full fat, so it may be a useful product for very young children who should not be drinking skim milk. I will be using mine up in soup and mashed potatoes (great for that actually), as I could not even stand it in coffee. Again I urge you to try the Saco for a more natural taste. It also mixes very nicely and is available in one quart envelopes as well as the large box. P.S., the days of buying powdered milk because it's cheaper are long gone. Fresh milk is a far better deal in most large grocery stores.
