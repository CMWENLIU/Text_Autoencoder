These Frankly Natural Bakers' Carob Energy Squares arrived MOLDY, and since they are individually wrapped in clear plastic, it was clear to see the green FUR growing off of each bar. I called the company (found the phone number on the box) and they mentioned that Amazon purchases these bars in bulk and sells them seperately and I would need to get my refund through Amazon. I called Amazon and explained the moldy mess. The agent apologized and immediately issued me a refund over the phone. Good customer service in the end, but I think the bars need to be refrigerated for the duration of their storage at Amazon, and the moldy mess could easily be avoided.
