Although I have not tried baking with this product yet, I have gone through 2 replacement orders and found the canisters leaking both times.  I think the manufacturer has a bad packaging design for this product that is definitely not mail-friendly.  It is a shame that I cannot find this product in my local grocery store.  But I believe Saco can do something to make the canisters more durable - plastic construction instead of flimsy cardboard and a tighter seal (maybe metal) instead of paper.
