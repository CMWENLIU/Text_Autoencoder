Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature.  Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way.  Not so.  It comes in a small box with little insulation and a couple of (melted) ice packs.  I'm going to eat them anyway.  I'll update this review when (if) I survive, but when one orders high-end food products, one expects first-rate handling of the product by the shipper. I'll be looking somewhere else for my next anchovy fix.<br /><br />Update.....<br />Well, I had four of these little things a couple of hours ago.  They are very good, and I'm still alive.  I've had better in restaurants, but these are better than any I've bought in a store or ordered online.  Still, I won't order them again because of the poor shipping practices.
