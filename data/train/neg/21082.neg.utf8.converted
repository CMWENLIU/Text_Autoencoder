I recently bought a box of the Jolly Time kettle corn popcorn because the store was out of our favorite brand.<br />To be concise Mrs. Spudman and I did NOT have a jolly time eating this popcorn. It's excessively salty and tastes nothing like the kettle corn popcorn we are used to. It's so bad that even splitting a bag, we couldn't finish eating this one bag of popcorn. Treat it wasn't. Even Piper our begging shih tzu turned her nose up when offered a few pieces.<br /><br />Maybe we got a bad batch, but I'm not willing to buy more of this disastrous snack to find out for sure.
