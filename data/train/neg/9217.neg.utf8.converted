I thought I was getting a pure unsweetened nothing added black tea.  For those of you like me who HATE lemon in their tea beware - this tea does contain hibiscs and citric acid, probably as a preservative, but it gives it a bit of that canned lemoney nestea flavor.  Yuck.  I should have read the ingredients more closely ...
