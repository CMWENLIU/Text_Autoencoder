Chex has recently gone through a confusing period-- especially if you are CILIAC.  My local grocer carried Chocolate Chex, which originally were CORN or CORN and RICE in composition.  Then some pencil-pushing office nerd decided that no, we should change the recipe to ALL RICE. The rice-only product leaves me feeling bloated.  So I went to Amazon, read the product description very carefully, saw that it was the corn/rice blend,and ordered a crate.  I was not happy to find that the product they shipped to me was ALL RICE.
