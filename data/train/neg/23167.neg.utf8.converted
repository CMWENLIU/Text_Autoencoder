I used these, hanging them very close to my swarm of flies, for about two weeks. The swarm of flies seemed to like about two feet off the ground above a Persian rug. I had about 10 flies. In two weeks, these TWO traps collected one fly, while the other ~9 just swarmed around and refused to leave or die.<br /><br />The flies popping into my house lately are different from the buzzing house fly I grew up with. The bzzzzzz house fly I can swat pretty easily. These new flies are silent and fast moving and not interested in ever landing on something. They are also long-lived.<br /><br />I tried schmalyn's recommendation and moved them around, even left on one the floor where they were swarming. Still no luck.<br /><br />I do not rec these traps.<br /><br />Afterward I got the SUPER sticky strips that you unroll. My flies were too smart for that stuff too, but if I waved them around I could catch flies in the air with the extreme stickiness that doesn't exist on these Victor traps.
