I personally wouldn't order from this company. Here's my story. Today is 29 Jan 08. I placed my order 8 Nov 2007. I ordered 2 bags of this tea. I received one bag after about a month. I contacted the seller by email and they said they had made a mistake and another bag would be shipped immediately. Anyhow, I waited another month and still no tea. I contacted them yet again and they claim a mistake was made! I'll say. There was no offer of a refund. Indeed communication seems to have ground to a halt for some inexpicable reason. Anyhow, today I called my bank and requested that half the amount I paid be refunded. So, that's my story. I think if you look at the comments page for the sellers page you will see other tales that make this more than just an anomaly. So, you've been warned.
