I'm convinced these things are a placebo.  After taking one per day for a week and noticing no difference, I 5-hour-energy roofied my roommate's soda before bed and he went to sleep without a problem.<br /><br />Maybe if you believe they work, they'll work for you; they didn't do anything for me.  For this price, they should make my eyes incapable of being closed.
