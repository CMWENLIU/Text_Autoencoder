My dogs love these treats, but the news that they are made in China puts an end to their love affair.<br />Here is a letter from Del Monte admitting that these treats come from China:<br />Many of my clients feed Milo's Kitchen Dog Treats to their pets. After seeing recent stories about dogs becoming sick from treats, I decided to write to Del Monte, the company that makes Milo's Kitchen brand treats.  I asked Del Monte if they could tell me if 100% of the ingredients of the Milos Kitchen Beef Jerky & Sausage are made in the US, & if any part of the beef products were sourced from China. Here's the reply:<br />April 20, 2012<br />Dear Michele,<br />Thanks for your e-mail and your interest in Milo's Kitchen Beef Sausage Slices. Three varieties of Milo's Kitchen dog treats are made in the United States - Beef Jerky, Chicken Meatballs and Beef Sausage Slices.
