Since I have gotten new info on the best dog foods for my pets, I have been looking for a wet food that did not have that stabilizer in it called carreeghan[mispelled] and when I read the ingredients in AvoDerm that WAS NOT LISTED. When it arrived--just out of curiosity I checked again and there it was! There is some research which supports a risk of cancer when using this ingredient. So I have now had to switch again and I now feed my dogs LIFE4K9 wet food which hasn't got that ingredient and I feel much better. I feel this omission must have been intentional  by AvoDerm and I won't support deception when it comes to the safety of my precious furkids.
