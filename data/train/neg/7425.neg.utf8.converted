They smell good, but my baby isn't interested.  She sucks on them for a minute or two but then chucks it on the floor.  I think part of it may be the biscuits are too hard.  Unlike other teething biscuits that eventually give the baby something to eat and swallow, these remain rock hard.  That said, my baby does like to chuck stuff on the floor.
