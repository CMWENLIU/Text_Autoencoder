Silk is great stuff, and these aseptic packages are supposed to be good for a year.<br />That doesn't do much good when there is less than 2 months left on the product when received.<br />I stocked up for the winter in case we can't get to town to buy fresh.<br />Ordering Silk via Amazon is a bogus shopping experience; they can't be returned because 'technically' there is nothing wrong with the product.<br />5 stars if you're drinking it next week.<br />0 stars if you're stocking up for 6 months from now.
