The Cookies and Cream flavor turned out to be a disappointment from the moment the carton was opened.  As other reviewers have mentioned the color is disturbing, an unappetizing solid purplish grey.  It's not an easy or very appealing color to describe.  The taste is similar.  At no time would I ever describe it as Cookies and Cream, it more of an overly sweetened bad vanilla?  I can't quite put my finger on what the flavor is.  Something went wrong in the Arctic Zero kitchen on this one.  It's not so bad that it has to go in the trash,(especially after the hefty price tag) but I have to add toppings to help it go down easier.<br />I've tried all the flavors (except the newest coffee flavor), and below is my flavor ranking.<br />1.Mint Chocolate Cookie<br />2.Chocolate<br />3.Chocolate Peanut Butter<br />4.Pumpkin<br />5.Strawberry Banana<br />6.Vanilla<br />7.Cookies and Cream
