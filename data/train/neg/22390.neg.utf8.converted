WARNING!! Without changing the look of the packaging, Greens+ has changed the ingredients and has ruined a once-great bar (I along with other loyal customers I knew would order them by the boxload). Supposedly to "increase production," they've ruined the 40:30:30 balance, adding far more calories, fat, and carbs, while decreasing protein content. Sad, as they were once the perfect energy bar... I'm still in mourning. I am sending all boxes back directly to the company. Hopefully, if enough people do so, they can be persuaded to continue manufacturing the old formula, as I'm willing to wait and stock up on the original product, but not this pale imitation...
