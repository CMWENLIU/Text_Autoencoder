I bought this item with such great expectations but I am disappointed in the taste.  Yes, it is true that it smells great, just like peaches, and it has no calories but when you taste this beverage, it reminds me of alka seltzer (yes, the pop-pop fizz fizz medicine).  I don't recommend this product.  However, if you can get past the bitter taste you may like it, buy with caution.  You may want to buy only one case, (24) cans, for about $12.00 on subscribe and save to make sure you like it.  I have tasted the Talking Rain kiwi strawberry which is five calories a can but it tastes great; the calories are probably because of the juice and splenda added but I don't mind the five calories per can to have a great tasting beverage!
