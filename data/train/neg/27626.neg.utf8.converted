I suppose this is a healthy cereal but it tastes horrible, much like eating a piece of splintered wood.<br />So gross, I'm so sorry I purchased the subscribe and save 6 boxes!!!!!!!! I'll try adding it to a more palatable cereal so it doesn't go to waste but WHAT A WASTE THIS IS.  Don't buy it unless you taste buds are damaged.
