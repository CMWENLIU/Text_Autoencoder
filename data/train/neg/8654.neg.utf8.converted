Most of my family of eight managed to eat this cold the other night with chips.  We thought it tasted weird--kind of like it has green olive juice in it.<br /><br />Tonight my family was gone and I decided to heat some in the microwave.  It had just finished heating when the family returned.  They walked in the house and covered their noses.  One said it smelled like a terrible poopy diaper.  Another said it smelled like vomit.  My nine-year-old thought I had somehow invented something new and utterly disgusting.<br /><br />Is it more like poop or vomit?  Buy a case and decide for yourself!
