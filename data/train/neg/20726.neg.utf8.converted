As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers. I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot. This was a dissapointment. Nearly half the kernels never pop and the kernels that do pop are very small. I'll try buying other kernels but I would not buy this again.
