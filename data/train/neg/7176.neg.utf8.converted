My wife and I fancy ourselves coffee connoisseurs.  We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the "i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed "cheap."<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla "flavoring" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty.
