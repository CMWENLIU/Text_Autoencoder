I have to say, this is an interesting product that I was very excited to try. It's different! I mean how often to you hear someone say they drink black water!<br />When I received my package, first thing I did was open a bottle and took a whiff. I wasn't expecting any smell considering it's supposed to be just like water. I have to say there is a slight subtle smell to it initially, but after a while it was gone. So now it's time for the taste! I took a sip, expecting off-putting flavor and quite frankly, my body was prepared to gag because we don't normally drink black water. I couldn't get past imagining I was drinking a mixture of gasoline and water. Unlike regular water, blk tastes a little bit smoother. I do also detect more of a metallic taste to it but it's very subtle. Once you swallow, it leaves a little dry feeling in the back of your throat like when you drink gatorade. I wouldn't consider blk to be very refreshing. I find myself needing a drink of regular water after the sampling. The only reason I can see anyone drinking this is if they're wanting the benefits of fulvic acid.  Other than that, I can't see myself repurchasing this again. It seems to be like when Heinz released blue ketchup and it failed. Food/drink needs to be visually appealing.  Unless it is flavored, regular blk is just going to make people gag. I wouldn't recommend this product.
