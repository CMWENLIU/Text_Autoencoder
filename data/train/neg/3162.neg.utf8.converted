I started buying Kashi Blueberry Cluster cereal about 3 years ago, at that time there were blueberries..however, the last few boxes I've purchased are only tiny cluster, and NOT blueberries. The reason I started buying the cereal in the first place was because of less sugar and oat flakes. I won't purchase another box of Kashi cereal, instead I am going for Natures Path cereal which HAS REAL BLUEBERRIES.
