If you are looking for a healthier alternative to a potato chip with the same taste, LOOK FURTHER!! These chips taste COMPLETELY different than a white potato chip.  I was definitely surprised when biting into this chip--it tastes saltless and almost bitter! Tastes a little like fried plantain bananas--definitely not on my top ten list of favorite snack food!
