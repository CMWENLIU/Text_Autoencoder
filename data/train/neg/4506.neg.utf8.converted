Customers with gluten-intolerance: Be aware that this product is described as "gluten-free" and "wheat-free," but it is "processed in the facility that uses wheat and egg."<br /><br />12/02/2011: As "food," this item cannot be returned. However, Amazon still issued me a refund. Thank you very much. I am going to donate the item to a food-bank.
