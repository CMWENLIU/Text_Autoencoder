I decided to buy one of these in the grocery store before buying a case and I'm glad I did! I got through two bites of this disgusting 'brownie' before tossing the rest of the $2.00 bar in the garbage.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste my 'treat' on something that tastes of a mixture of cardboard and chemicals. Whether or not there ARE any chemicals in these bars is irrelevant. If it tastes like it, that's all that counts.<br /><br />Now if I were starving to death & had only these bars on which to subsist...I'd get very, very thin.<br /><br />Nuff said?<br /><br />I'd rather eat fruit.
