For my purposes, this tofu just doesn't work.  I like to drain my tofu, slice it, marinate it, and then bake it (for use as part of a stir-fry.)  This particular type of tofu, however, is true to the "silken" variety.  If I were using it as part of a recipe that didn't require firmness as part of the equation, I'm sure it would be fine.  However, you have to be EXTRA cautious when handling the tofu because it is "silken" (and therefore a ton more fragile.)  In addition, if baked, it produces a very unappetizing, rubbery texture.  I didn't hate it, but I definitely won't be buying it again.
