None of the BEAR NAKED GRANOLA products are organic nor do they contain any organic ingredients.  Further they DO contain genetically modified ingredients (GMOS).  These very misleading statements/descriptions by Amazon.com need to be removed immediately.  For those of us for whom eating organic food is very important because we do not want GMOs in our food, this is deceiving and potentially dangerous.  Please update the necessary listings at once and remove the erroneous information.  Thank you.
