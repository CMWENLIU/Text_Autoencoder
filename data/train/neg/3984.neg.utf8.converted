Ineffective and worthless. I bought this product for indoors and two other outdoor fly traps.  The outdoor traps worked immediately and I have noticed less flies in my home from my backdoor over the past week.  However, this indoor trap has caught zero flies yet over one week, while the outdoor traps have caught a combined 75-100.  I get excited looking at the trap thinking a fly was caught, but then realize that is the picture of a fly instead:-(.  Don't waste your money on this product.
