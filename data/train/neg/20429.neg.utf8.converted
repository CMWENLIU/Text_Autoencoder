I was excited about this flavor, but the tea did not come in a resealable pouch. It came in a regular brown bag. Though it smells divine, it is definitely old and stale. The taste is unpleasant even though I have played around with water temperatures and brewing times. Very disappointing and a waste of money; I will have to throw it away. DO NOT BUY!
