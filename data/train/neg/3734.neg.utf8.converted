mom said is tasty but is expensive and shipping is costly. will not buy again just because of cost of this item. way too many sellers charge way too much to ship. you dont get much for the price. Is more like a sample size. Also beware beets are genetically modified organisms... not sure of their product origin. I asked but they did not provide an answer if this was a monsanto genetically modified beet product. monsanto gmo products have roundup weedkiller genetically added to their seeds. the plant is a pesticide and weedkiller. so anything that grows on it(food) also has that pesticide weedkiller in it. you therefore ingest this and it alters your dna. monsanto gmos have been linked to organ failure and birth defects. so beware.
