I was shopping at my local Kroger and saw this on clearance for 2 dollars, I always wanted to try feline pine so I figured I'd give it a go. I poured the litter and was very pleased with the smell, my apartment smelled like the mountains :D. My cat is 14 weeks old and completely litter trained and has never had an accident... until we tried this stuff. She wouldn't even go in the litter box and stood on top of her litter box staring at me like I was crazy. I woke up this morning, walked to the bathroom to find to my surprise a huge turd on top of the toilet seat... Needless to say we won't be using this stuff anymore.
