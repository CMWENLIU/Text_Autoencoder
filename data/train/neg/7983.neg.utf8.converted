I have used and loved Crystal Light Lemonade Drink Mix for years.  However, I have noticed that the taste is much weaker now.  I have to cut the water down to 3 quarts instead of 4 (2 packets)to get the same taste as before.  The drink was already expensive and now even more so. Did the manufacturers think we would not notice???  I gave 2 stars because the taste, with less water, is still very good. I am looking for a substitute because I feel cheated by the manufacturers.
