Watch out people, the amount they claim they charge for shipping is almost 1/3 what they try to nail you for at the check out.  I've already filed a complaint with Amazon about this as I didn't catch the bait and switch pricing lie until after I had placed my order.  Lucky for me Amazon canceled the order.<br /><br />Don't get cheated!
