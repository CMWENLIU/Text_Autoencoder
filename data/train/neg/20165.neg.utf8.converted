Advised to cut back on my sugar consumption years ago, I STILL hover in the Pre-diabetic shadows that are not stacked in my favor.  My life long journey with artificial sweeteners is littered with little packets of pink, blue, yellow and my older relatives' little saccharine tablets.  Each having one unpleasantry or another including bad aftertaste, mouth tingles, headaches, or tummy  issues.<br /><br />I welcomed Nectresse to the party. Added it to my usual coffee with cream and iced teas. It dissolved and sweetened  nicely, but the aftertaste wasn't so pleasant. I did go to bed feeling headache-y that evening. Tried it the next day with the same results, including the headache.<br /><br />Nectresse and I are parting company. The container is cute and can be used to sprinkle, spoon or scoop the sweetener.  It's just that Nectresse needs more than cute. The formulation needs more Monk Fruit, other natural sweeteners and LESS sugar alcohol - Erythritol for me to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />This new product may work well for others, it just didn't work well enough for me.
