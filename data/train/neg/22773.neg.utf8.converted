I just received this product and I am very disappointed.<br />The description led me to believe that the product included its own cup and the convenience was the ONLY reason I purchased it.<br />What I got was a box filled with little bags of noodles and little bags of powdered cheese.<br />Not so easy after all! If I had wanted the basic original version I would have ordered Kraft mac and cheese...<br />As it is, I feel like I am the victim of a bait and switch routine!<br /><br />Here is the actual product description copied and pasted from the page here on the Amazon site:<br /><br />Consumers in the US are turning to Kraft Easy Mac cups for the great taste of macaroni and cheese. Easy Mac cups are simple to prepare - just add water and put in the microwave for a few minutes - plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean-up easy. Easy Mac cups are perfect for any need-to-eat-now occasion. Kraft Easy Mac cups is available in several flavors like original, triple cheese, bacon, cheesy taco, roasted garlic parmesan and Alfredo.<br /><br />Please note the frequent use of the word "cups" and the inclusion of the statement "plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean-up easy."<br /><br />I can't help but feel ripped off...<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone - it is grossly overpriced for what you get.<br />And I will never order this product again.<br /><br />Unless you want to pay top dollar for tiny little snack-sized bags of mac & cheese, DO NOT buy this product.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035XVQF2">Kraft Easy Mac Original Macaroni and Cheese Dinner 18 Microwaveable Single Serve Packs</a>
