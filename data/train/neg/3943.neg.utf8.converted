Does it give energy? yes.<br />Does it have more caffeine than Mt. Dew? Yes (83 v 54)<br />Does it have substances of questionable value and safety? Yes (Arginine, L-carnitine, Taurine, Inositol, and several ingredients conveniently blurred to be difficult to read)<br /><br />Does it taste like crap? Yes (Unless you like carbonated grapefruit)<br />Does it leave your fingers numb when it wears off? Yes (Seriously about 12 hours after drinking my fingers went numb and the room went spinning... talk about "hitting the wall" or "crashing.")<br /><br />Must be an energy drink... eat an apple (it's healthier and will keep you awake much better).
