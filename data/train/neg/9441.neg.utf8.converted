I purchased Emergen-C Acai Berry instead of my usual Super Orange, because this was on sale. Not a good substitute at all!! This flavor tastes much more artificial, like a too sweet candy that leaves a weird chemically aftertaste.  I like Super Orange, because it has a noticeable, yet not overwhelming, flavor...Bottom line is that I will not be purchasing this flavor again. Yuck.
