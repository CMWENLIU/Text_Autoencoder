This made me wish I was born without taste buds.  It tastes sickeningly sweet at first and has an absolutely horrible, disgustingly bitter aftertaste.  This tasted like it would be poisonous.  If anyone has any suggestions about what this might actually be drinkable with, do let me know, because I have nine more of these things sitting in my refrigerator.
