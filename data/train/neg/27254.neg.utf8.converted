This is a shame. When Merricks introduced its canned cat foods, they were truly out-standing.  There was no filler of excess liver, no bone, no cartlidge, no cheap grindings swimming in gravy--things which are typical of the majority of cat food producers.  There was minimum grain and lots of turkey, in addition to the obvious nutritious veggies and berries. Merricks truly was the King. However, as I continued to buy over time, I noticed a distinct degrading of quality.  I usually buy directly from the company's website so I addressed these issues to them the day I found chunks of obvious poulty vertabra and cartlidge, large chunks--whole vertabra bones-- and ground, in a particular lot.  I had already seen the qualities of the foods going downhill but this addition of bone and cartlidge was upsetting. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and wrote to inform them that perhaps an "accident" had happened. They were cold, uncaring and wanted my remaining cans after I send them photographs of the foods, bones and cartlige matter and cans with the lot numbers clearly stamped. I admit I blew my stack at this attitude, but the last straw was receiving the final lot(which unfortunately I had ordered before the discovery of the literal garbage in the previous lot) and the result of the new came pouring out of the cans in a gray-ish brown mass of "gravy", with no visible pieces of turkey, just unhealthy-looking masses of liver and some cheap ground poultry that was hard and brittle to the fingers.  Merricks has been informed that they have a problem with quality control and the customer should be very aware that the lots differ dramatically. I'm very glad I kept and presevered the cans, bones and photographs as proof. If you want to pay premium prices for the kind of crap you throw away in your garbage every day then by all means buy Merricks and take a chance. It's feast or famine from a company who has clearly taken advantage of the fact that most consumers really don't bother looking at their cat's food. Shame on them for feeding cats and kittens bones and cartlidge and liver-filler. Merricks blows.
