First I wish to say I have no problem with the quality of this product.  It is a good, fairly low sodium turkey.<br />My problem is in the serving size information.  The can says serving size is two ounces DRAINED and there are "about four" servings a can.  To me this means between 3.5 and 4.4 servings a can - or 7.0-8.8 ounces of turkey per can.<br />I have weighed the last three cans and the drained weights are 5.7 ounces, 6.0 ounces and 5.9 ounces.  This is about 15% less than the stated minimum on the label. At this average you are paying $8.75 per pound of meat.<br />Quality product but you are NOT getting the quantity advertised.
