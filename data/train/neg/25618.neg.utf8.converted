Whether or not you like this stuff (ehhh for me) consider boycotting this company's products.  Google for the details as to why Monster Energy (sounds like Monster Cable) feels they should bully little small fry brewery Rock Art in VT for naming a beer VERMONsTer.  Clearly after the state for Vermont and clearly because this is a heavy duty beer.
