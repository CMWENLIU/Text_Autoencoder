I have worked at Starbucks for 8 years.  In November, I left my job to have a baby and my husband and I didn't get coffee beans for free anymore (Starbucks gives you a pound a week).  We tried various brands in the store and didn't like it.  We were looking for something economical and realized that some of the 5 pound bags are actually less per pound than Eight O'Clock Bean.  We used Coffee Bean Direct twice and really liked it.  This time, we ordered this from Copper Moon. It is so stale.. no shine to the beans and it tastes like Maxwell House.  When I started at Starbucks we tried Maxwell House canned coffee and compared it to Starbucks coffee that had been opened and ground for a few weeks and they tasted the same. Fresh coffee gives off gases and cannot be canned until it is stale and that is why most packaging has one-way valves.  I will go back to Coffee Bean Direct.. it wasn't worth saving 3 dollars.
