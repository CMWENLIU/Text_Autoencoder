I bought 4 boxes of Russell Stover assorted chocolates for gifts.  I opened one box.  They were horrible.  Chocolate was of poor quality.  The candy has a chemical artificial taste.  I am going to toss these.  I would be embarrassed to give these to anybody.  For anybody with discerning taste, forget it.  I personally will stick with See's candies.  Customer service is checking this out, but I don't care to take another chance on them.
