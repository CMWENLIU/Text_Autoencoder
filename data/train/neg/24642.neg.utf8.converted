The package I received had clearly melted, been smashed, and then congealed.  Few of the candies arrived shaped anything like eggs.  The chocolate looks and tastes old.  Even the kids don't want to eat this stuff.  I notice now that the only other review is one year old.  I suspect my particular bag of candy is even older than that review.  I am normally a fan of Nestle Chocolates, but I cannot recommend this purchase to anyone.  Don't waste your money like I did.
