I realize that perhaps I should have read the label, but if the bottle doesn't say "artificially sweetened" then the consumer has an expectation that formulations have not been changed.  Tang is now just nasty tasting.<br /><br />Tang has been reformulated to include not one...but Three artificial sweeteners, two of which have not had significant peer reviewed human testing and one of which is a known chemical danger.<br /><br />I realize that companies want to make a profit by using something cheaper than sugar, but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />sucralose = splenda: Splenda (sucralose) is trichlorosucrose. It contains a primary unhindered alkyl chloride that one would not be surprised to find reactive as an alkylating agent with protein pendent lysine residues and other nucleophiles (including anchimeric assistance with one anomer and the open form). One is generally ill-advised to chronically ingest halogenated organics as food.<br /><br />Acesulfame potassium: Several potential problems associated with the use of acesulfame have been raised. They are based largely on animal studies since testing on humans remains limited. The findings showed the following: Acesulfame K has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in rats in a dose-dependent fashion thereby possibly aggravating reactive hypoglycemia ("low blood sugar attacks"). Acesulfame K apparently produced lung tumors, breast tumors, rare types of tumors of other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease in several rodent studies, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned for a stay of approval by the FDA because of "significant doubt" about its safety.<br /><br />NeoTame: As its patent for aspartame was running out, Monsanto developed a new, more potent version of its synthetic sweetener.  By adding 3-dimethylbutyl (a chemical the Environmental Protection Agency lists as hazardous) to aspartame, scientists at Monsanto drastically increased the sweetening power of the additive. The new version was named neotame.  The non-profit group, Truth in Labeling, gained access to some of the neotame studies. They write, "At the time of our review of Monsanto's application, three human studies on the safety of neotame were presented. The studies had few subjects, all of whom were employees of the company. Some of the subjects reported headaches after ingesting neotame, but the researchers concluded that the headaches were not related to neotame ingestion. Not mentioned in the studies was the fact that migraine headache is, by far, the most commonly reported adverse reaction to aspartame in the files of the FDA."
