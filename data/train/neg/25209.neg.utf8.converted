i just received the ajvar today, it is so horrible. i cannot believe this is what they sell as ajvar. i am from Macedonia and the ajvar over there is nothink like this one. do not buy this if you think thats ajvar, because is not. the smell is pretty bad, and you will not want to taste that. pretty disappointed, i paied $14 for it to be that bad. i do not recomend it to noone.
