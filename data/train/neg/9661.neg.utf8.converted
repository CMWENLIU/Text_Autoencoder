Flavorless black jujubee- all filler no flavor. Barely discernible licorice taste in a starchy semi-hard gel that doesn't really chew - After the first bite the candy tube collapses and it just fragments into smaller gel bits. It's like they made the candy for someone who doesn't like the taste of licorice- and I bought five lbs. of this waste.  Stupid me. Hope you licorice lovers don't get burnt. Good luck.
