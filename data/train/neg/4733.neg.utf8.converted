Comes out of the package in a gelatinous slab that must be broken up and heated.  Apparently it was radiated or in other ways sterilized. It is approximately 15 grams of fat per serving and tastes oily and unpleasant. It is cheap for a reason. Mine is now in the trash. Save your money and perhaps your health.
