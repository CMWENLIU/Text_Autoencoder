These Pringles taste great. I bought 3 tubes of the from the grocery store yesterday and snacked on some of them last night after getting home. That's the only reason I didn't give them 1 star.<br /><br />I recently tried these out by eating 3 or 4 of these chips at someones house. I felt fine and was and thinking that the Olestra didn't bother me at all, so I decided the whole evil Olestra thing was totally blown out of proportion and wanted to get some. I came home from shopping and made myself a light dinner of chicken and rice. Then, while watching a movie, I ate about 1/3 of the container of chips.<br /><br />The next morning, about an hour after waking up, my stomach started hurting like CRAZY. The abdominal pain was so bad it nearly brought me to tears. I can snack all day on a bag of Dorito's and not bat an eye, but a bowl of Pringles with Olestra brought me to my knees! The pain did not stop for HOURS. It lasted from about 10am until 3pm.<br /><br />Even after the pain subsided, my insides felt sore, as if I was punched in the stomach over and over. I wish so much these didn't cause such a bad reaction. They would be my new favorite chips! But I'll stick with the regular Pringles and take the fat over that pain again any day.<br /><br />I'm not saying everyone will have the same experience as I have had. But I would HIGHLY suggest snacking on these on a day when you do not need to be at work or kids be at school afterwards.
