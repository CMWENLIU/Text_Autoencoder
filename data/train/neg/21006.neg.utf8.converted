I bought these for my kids.  They are TERRIBLE!!!  If I could give them a 0, I would.  They are WAY too hard AND they don't bounce very well (though that is definitely the lesser of my two major concerns).  They could easily hurt a child, a pet, go through a window, or damage furniture. Unless you are game for those scenarios, do not buy these!
