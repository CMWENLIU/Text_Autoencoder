I'm sorry to give this a poor review, but tea has to taste good in order for me to drink it. I often drink a large variety of bedtime teas and have never tasted any tea this awful. I can't speak for how well it works because I couldn't drink the whole cup even though I attempted to force myself. Yogi makes some good teas, but this I just couldn't stomach.
