I never expected granola to contain flax seed -- something I'm allergic to.  I sat down to a nice bowl of granola, and it sure tasted good! Then my throat started to itch. Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'.  My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT!
