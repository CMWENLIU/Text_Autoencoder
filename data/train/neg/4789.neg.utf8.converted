Thought I would give it a try since we love the velveeta shells and cheese.  This is NOT a good meal at all. The "pasta" was like thick, thick rice pieces that once it was in your mouth it felt as though you were eating bugs, I've never had a pasta with that shape and texture before.  The "broccoli" was dried powder. The kids didn't like this meal nor did my husband and I.  I think Velveeta should just stick with their shells and cheese.
