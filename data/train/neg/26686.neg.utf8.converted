I really wanted to like these, but unfortunately, can't stand the taste of the cheese sauce.  (I don't care for Kraft either).<br /><br />The ingredients are better in Annies Homegrown Mac & Cheese, so if I could stand the taste, I'd eat it without question.  But the taste is, is my opinion, acidic and just bad.  Almost like another reviewer said : vomit-like.<br /><br />Now what will I do with the case that is left?
