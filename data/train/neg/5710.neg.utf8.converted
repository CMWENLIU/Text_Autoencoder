I have been on a lifetime quest to find the best Earl Grey tea on the planet. Other reviews said Dilmah had a strong fragrance, and was an excellent Earl Grey. Bunk. I LOVE to breathe the wonderful, exotic aroma of a freshly-opened Earl Grey tea box or pouch. But when I opened a brand new box of this tea, I got nothing.Perhaps it's because of the foil wraps, I mused. Alas, even when I hold the pouch with a tea bag still inside it, I get no aroma-none. There is no oil of bergamot in this tea. It is not Earl Grey. The label is misleading. As a Ceylon tea it is fair, with average to weak strength. But as an Earl Grey it is an abomination. Stick to the proven winners- Stash is great, Yorkshire is very good, Harney and Sons is superb, as is the Republic of Tea. Don't buy this tea! There's a reason it's marked down.
