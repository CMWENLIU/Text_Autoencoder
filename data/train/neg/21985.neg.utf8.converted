Neither my wife or I could tolerate the taste of these chips.  We found one person who like them & gave them to her.  I can see how kids might like them but for us they were too sweet & had an off taste.  Two stars since we eventually found someone who like them (tried several people who didn't want any after the 1st chip)>
