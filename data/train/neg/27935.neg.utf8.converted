I bought these candies because I thought I recognized the colored wrappers of the strawberry candies we were used to as children... the ones that have been around for about 50 years. These are NOT the original candies. These candies are imitation ones made in Columbia. The same wrappers are used to deceive people into thinking they are buying the originals. These candies from Columbia are dried up on the outside. The papers stick to the candies. Most importantly, this Columbia brand does not have the strawberry gel filling that the original candies have. If you are looking for the originals, they are by Arcor. Don't settle for this substitute. They don't compare.
