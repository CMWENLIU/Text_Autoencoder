These flowers arrived to my door on time, and as expected they were in bud form. So, naturally, I gave them time to blossom. Unfortunately, once they did, I realized that there were SIGNIFICANTLY LESS flowers in the vase than in the picture advertised. They do smell nice and the individual flowers themselves are very pretty, but I will not be buying from ProFlowers again. I can do much better with my money than what was delivered to me.
