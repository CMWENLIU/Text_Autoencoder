I was excited to try these flavors but unfortunately they did not live up to my expectations. For one thing, they were stale when they arrived. This would not have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the flavors were nasty (for the most part). One of the superfruit flavors tasted (literally) like dirt. The most tolerable flavor was the Crush grape soda. Jelly Belly should stick with its traditional flavors, this is a bust.
