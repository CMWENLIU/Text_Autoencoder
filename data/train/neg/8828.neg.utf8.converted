KEEP YOUR RECEIPT. The product is NASTY...The product is guaranteed...but the process to get a refund is onerous (in my opinion).<br /><br />"I am sorry that you were not satisfied with our Mayo.  Please send a proof of purchase, a note with the expiration date of the product and an explanation as to why you were not satisfied to the address below and we will gladly refund your money.  Thank you and again, my apologies.<br /><br />Walden Farms<br />1209 W St Georges Ave<br />Linden, NJ 07036<br /><br />OK..this is white "stuff"....really NOTHING like real Mayo. I had a hamburger...took a taste of this plastic garbage and said I'll pass. If you need a cream base for tarter sauce...go for it. Use sparingly this stuff is WEIRD.<br /><br />I used it like "sour cream" mixing in with STIFF beaten egg whites and stevia for a nice dip for strawberries on the HCG diet.  (I used Powdered egg whites.....and you could use a little juice for the warm water).<br /><br />I mixed a little with Picante sauce to make a nice Russian type salad dressing.<br /><br />I tried with a little lemon grass..to do an asparagus dip....but balsamic vinegar worked better.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much since I read the other reviews.<br /><br />If you are not on an HCG diet (very Low Calorie Diet)..don't buy this stuff.<br /><br />If you are...and you like to experiment, go for it.<br /><br />You could probably rub it lightly on fish add some dill or whatever..and broil the fish.<br /><br />Maybe make some "Aoli"...Garlic mayo with some fresh cloves of Garlic and lemon zest or juice.<br /><br />As in all my other Walden Farms Zero calorie Product reviews....if you are NOT on a Very Low calorie diet, like HCG, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I got the mayo because the store I was in. had a very limited Walden Farms selection. If I had other better choices, I probably would have skipped the mayo (based on the Amazon reviews). Thank goodness for Amazon.<br /><br />Stores have Walden farms Products  in different areas. I found some near frozen..in a dietetic section...Some in produce (the salad dressings)...and saw some of the non zero calorie in with the other salad dressings in another store.<br /><br />I wasted half of this GARBAGE trying to recreate a strawberry dip. Gave up and threw it out.
