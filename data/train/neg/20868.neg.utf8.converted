I had high hopes for this popcorn, but was really disappointed. It has a very strong fake apple taste, which overpowers any caramel (and there wasn't much)that might be in the bag. The picture on the bag makes it look like there's caramel coated popcorn in there, but there's not, the three or four pieces like that and they have an even stronger fake apple taste. I guess there's really no such thing as good tasting light caramel popcorn!
