For whatever reason, the sugar in this product isn't mentioned in the advertising.  If you check the ingredients, the 1st one listed is evaporated cane juice, which is sugar, although a natural form of it, and sugar (the regular kind) is also listed a few ingredients later.  I was excited about buying this product because I believed it was a Truvia-only sweetened product (which i prefer to artificial sweeteners).<br />However, I definitely won't be purchasing it because it contains sugar and Truvia.  A 70 gram container (a whole box) contains 210 calories - all from sugar.  To some people this may not seem like much, but to others who consume lots of drinks sweetened with Truvia or artificial sweeteners, it can be a problem not knowing about it.<br />If you're diabetic or on a low-glycemic diet, you'd be better off buying unsweetened Kool-aid and adding Truvia to it.  Why the company decided to do this is beyond me - Truvia tastes fine on it's own.<br /><br />Here is the nutrition information for this product from their website:<br />crystal light - fitness drink mix - grape pure fitness on the go 0.31 oz<br /><br />Ingredients: EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, CITRIC ACID, MALIC ACID, MALTODEXTRIN, CALCIUM LACTATE, SUGAR, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF NATURAL FLAVOR, REBIANA (TRUVIA BRAND SWEETENER), POTASSIUM CITRATE, MAGNESIUM OXIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SALT, DRIED PURPLE CARROT EXTRACT AND DRIED HIBISCUS FLOWER EXTRACT (FOR COLOR).<br /><br />[...]
