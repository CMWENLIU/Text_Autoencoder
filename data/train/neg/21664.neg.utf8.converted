This was unspeakably bad.  Tasked like raw chemicals and I love cider enough to tolerate a minor bad taste.  Afraid to try the caramel that I also bought.  I guess the 1 carb should have been fair warning to avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Would have returned, but cannot.  Too nasty to even bring in to work and pawn off on unsuspecting co-workers for fear the clients might have some and keel over.
