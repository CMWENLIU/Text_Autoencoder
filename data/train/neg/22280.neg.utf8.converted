I was only able to use one of a dozen cans - they had to be disposed of as they were rusted, dented and dirty. After disinfencting the only undamaged can, i found this product to be delicious , it is a shame i won't attempt to reorder. This is the 3rd Loma Linda product that has arrived in such horrible , unsanitary and unusable condition ..
