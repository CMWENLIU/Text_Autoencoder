The packet says "Contains Two Servings". The instructions call for 6 oz hot water to 3 "heaping" tablespoons of the cocoa powder. Both packets I opened contained less than 5 rounded tablespoons, which definitely doesn't equal "Two Servings". 3 heaping teaspoons makes an adequate cuppa, but only adequate. Add 1 tsp to get a good flavor. And by the way, the instructions say "Watch it magically trun purple" It turns an unhealthy shade of pale blue grey. Really pretty lame stuff, & the seller hasn't bothered to respond, which makes them lamer than this crap. BTW, I just hoticed that my review of this seller has "been removed". I didn't remove it. They are truly lame.
