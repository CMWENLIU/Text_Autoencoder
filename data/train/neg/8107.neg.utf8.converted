Being someone who's baked a great deal in my life, as well as finding creative ways to making eating healthy delicious, I guess you could say I am a "foody" of sorts, as well as a connoisseur of foods of all types, especially when it comes to flavor. Considering the economy and the fact that it's hit each of us a great deal, I usually do my shopping for spices and extracts at places like Christmas Tree Shops, or Ocean State Job Lot, with the occasional time here on this site when purchasing something else. That said, I did none of those three. Also, I'd like to add, considering the first two options for shopping, I've never ONCE had an issue with flavor, or freshness when it comes to those products. I decided on one recent trip to Walmart, only initially purchasing almond milk, walking towards the register, as I was passing the baker aisle and noticing the Watkins label, to buy a few extracts from this particular brand, as, I figured, it was a decent, reputable brand. How could I go wrong?? And so, ideas of delicious oatmeal recipes and once in a while, adding a flavor that would go well with my chocolate casein, or whey protein, my grubby hands grabbed a few of Watkins flavor, rum being one of them. In fact, rum extract has become somewhat of a staple when I decided to buy it on a whim at Ocean State. I LOVE adding rum flavor to my shakes! This one was such a HUGE disappointment, and not to mention, questioning what is in it, aside from the ingredients listed.<br /><br />Once I got home, I opened each package, and, in doing so, smelled each one, as we all know, every extract from every brand can differ in taste and smell. Once I got to the rum, I cringed a bit. The smell is most familiar. A bit of a plastic-type smell, but oddly, more of a smell of something out of a nail salon or nail tech school. I should know, I used to do  my own nails. The smell was that of acrylic liquid! I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking, it probably tastes fine ,but it doesn't. Tastes gross. Like a chemical, or plastic, or, who knows, maybe it is acrylic liquid. I know everyone's taste buds are different and if you're willing to give it a go, by all means, go for it, but as for me, I will NOT be purchasing this particular brand of rum extract again! GROSS! If I could give it zero stars, I would. It's that bad to me.
