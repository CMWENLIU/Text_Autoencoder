After playing sports for many years I thought the "Lace Cover" would save me a lot of electrical tape that I normally use to secure boot laces. So when I saw these I thought what a great idea. Well yesterday they were used for the first time and......FAIL. The Lace Cover comes in 1 size only ( too large for most people ). I have a reasonably large foot ( size 13 US )and although the Lace Cover is elasticized , was reasonably loose fitting. Hence , they never really did cover the laces properly. Then after some scrummaging ( Rugby Union ) , one of the lace covers vanished completely. Although the item is not expensive , save your money. It's back to the electrical tape for me !
