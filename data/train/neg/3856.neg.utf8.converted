picture of the product looked good - when i recieved it the individual candies were all upside down & a complete mess.  the cardboard strap holding the candies together was almost completely ripped. the crate was all chipped & discolored. i would never order or recommend this to anyone. i never did recieve the other 3.90 shipping charges i was entitled to .
