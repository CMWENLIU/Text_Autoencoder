There was no expiration date on the box or the jars, so I phoned the distributor, Beaverton Foods.  Based on a short letter-number sequence on a sample jar, which, they said, represents the Julian date of the jar's production, this whole case, which I received yesterday, will reach its early expiration date in 8 days.  It was made in January 2009 and has a shelf life of only 8 to 12 months.  It is now September.  I'm not picky and will use it until the farthest date, but some people might be concerned.  I do recommend that the manufacturer clearly mark the expiration on these jars.
