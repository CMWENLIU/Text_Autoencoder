When I first opened the canister the smell of pepper was burst forth.  At the first taste, first the salt and then the pepper flavors completely overwhelmed the cashew flavor.  Finally a hint of cashew came through. When  other family members tried these their reactions were similar - too much seasoning and too little cashew.<br /><br />Those who are fans of cashews will  probably be disappointed that there is so little cashew flavor but those who like salt and especially those who like pepper will be pleased.  It just seems to me that there is no need to use cashews in this product, peanuts would do just fine since the salt and pepper flavors completely dominate this product.
