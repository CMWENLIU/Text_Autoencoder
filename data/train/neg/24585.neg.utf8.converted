Please do not be fooled as I was when it came to eating this seemingly healthier alternative to regular Cheetos. Also, do not believe everything that is listed from these sellers on packaging or the internet, they are all marketing ploys to get a wider range of consumer to buy their product, in this case they are trying to attract the consumers who are usually very health conscious and read labels. I saw one of the sellers here list this product as having NO MSG.<br /><br />That would seem to be correct because the company has chosen to cleverly market this particular brand to people who are trying to eat healthier. They have changed the name on the ingredients from Monosodium Glutamate to Torula yeast which is a free glutamate. In my opinion if your going to eat and enjoy Cheetos just buy your favorite kind because they are all the same and this bran is no healthier for you than the rest. It's made from GMO corn, and has MSG in it wether thats the name they are going by now days or some new gimmick to poison you, either way your feeding yourself and children unhealthy foods, this should in no way be viewed as a natural alternative to "regular cheetos." I once was fooled and felt I was making a "healthier" junk food choice for my kids when they would want something that I normally wouldn't buy. I was dead wrong and have discontinued this product from my grocery cart. Just thought I would let others know so they can do their own research on the matter.
