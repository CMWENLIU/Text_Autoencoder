I've tried to grow 2 of these plants now with the same results, immediatly, both times.<br />The exotic, interesting plant arrived crushed to begin with, but within 2 weeks it was dried up.<br />After the first dried up, I did some research to make sure I was caring for it properly.<br />I've never had plants that I could not keep alive..let alone for 2 weeks.<br />If you get one...good luck!!!
