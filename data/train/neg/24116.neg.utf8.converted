I love coffee. I love chai lattes. I love my Keurig. But this combination was disgusting. The taste when first prepared was STRONG. OK, I get that and could even even like it... if the aftertaste didn't kick in. I have never tasted so much artificial sweetener in any product. This is not listed as lo-cal or diet.. so it was not at all what I was expecting. I would rather have an aspirin dissolve in my mouth. I am returning this to the store. Absolutely terrible.
