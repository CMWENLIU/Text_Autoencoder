Seriously, 60 dollars for 3 small boxes of snacks.  The candies are worth 4 dollars and the rest can be purchased for 15 dollars at you local grocery store.  I feel cheated.  The picture is highly misleading and makes it seem like you are getting a reasonable amount for 60 dollars, however you are not.  Recommend you look elsewhere.
