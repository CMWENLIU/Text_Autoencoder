Unfortunately, two out of my three bottles were smashed.  They went through the trouble of wrapping them in bubble wrap and putting them in a medium box with lots of air pillows, but because the three bottles were all put together inside  of one bubble wrapped bag,  they were broken.  It's very disappointing that they haven't resolved the packing issues, what a waste.  The glass bottles need to be individually wrapped.  It was a mess to clean up -  tiny shards of glass and extract everywhere.  Smelled fantastic, though. It's clearly a good product. I'd love to give it a higher rating.
