Whoever formulated this couldn't tell the difference between pepperoni and soy.  At the risk of looking low-class, pepperoni gets its flavor from salt and oil, not eleven all-natural herbs and spices.  Even worse, the flavor is truly vile beyond the ability for words to adequately describe.  I shall save this so-called food for torturing the next classmate who says we should, for the good of the environment, discontinue ranching.
