I tried this litter hoping to find a natural alternative to my current clay litter. It has a nice consistency but it's fairly dusty. After it's used, the urine sticks to the bottom of the litter pan so much that I really struggled to clean the litterbox! Feces were barely covered up and the odor control is non-existent. In fact, after one day of use, there was a strange sour smell that filled the room from this litter. This was even after the box was clean. I had just tried a pine litter which worked great for odor control but the urine didn't clump as hard. I will be trying World's Best litter next and definitely won't buy this again.
