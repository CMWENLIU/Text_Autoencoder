Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.
