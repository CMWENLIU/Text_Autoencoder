I really like several teas of Taylors of Harrogate, so I decided to try their Earl Grey. I was really disappointed: although the tea did smell deliciously of bergamot, there was no taste to it to speak of. Now, I can only drink it mixed with other Earl Grey teas to have a nice combination of taste and smell (and can recommend it in this capacity).
