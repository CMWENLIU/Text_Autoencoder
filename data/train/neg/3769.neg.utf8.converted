This tea is ground not whole leaf. The label on the front of the can states it is leaf tea. If you read the label on the back of the can it states that it is 'rolled to release the flavor. I wish they had let my hot water release the flavor instead of leaving it at the roller.<br />I will not purchase Taylor's of Harrogate again. False advertising, it's not leaf. Might as well buy bags.
