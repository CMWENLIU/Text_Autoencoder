My relationship to food is very much a balance between cost and taste -- I'm willing to pay for pricey food that's amazing, but I have a very keen internal sense of what's "worth" it and what isn't. This box of snacks ain't worth it. First of all it's only a meal for folks who tend to eat smallish meals. Yes, it has 410 calories, but I would guess most of that is the chocolate and trail mix. There's not enough bulk here to constitute what I would call a meal, and unfortunately, the "main dish" is awful. The box contains:<br /><br />A 1-oz. package of roasted and lightly salted edamame, which I actually liked, but I suspect most people will hate. It's got a very subtle flavor that most people I know hate.<br /><br />A .75-oz. package of fruit/nut/ginger trail mix. I like trail mix, this struck me as a bit sweet and the two handfulls don't last long.<br /><br />A 1.6-oz. packet of "chili lime salmon spread" to have with 6 small circular crackers. The crackers are totally fine (hard to screw up a cracker), but the salmon spread is awful. I love salmon, I love chili lime concotions, I love seafood spreads. This was nauseatingly bad, way too fishy and the red pepper base totally overwhelms the chili lime flavor. This part of the package needs a completely new recipe. (And why is this packaged with a plastic fork? It's a spread, it needs a knife!)<br /><br />A .4-oz. square of dark chocolate. This was quite good and just the right size.<br /><br />So, a pretty mediocre bundle of organic snacks at an outrageous price makes this a terrible value.
