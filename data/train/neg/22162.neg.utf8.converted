I do not recommend this product , I had bought it to sprout,  out of whole cup full of seeds I only got 4 shoots of sprouts , I tried cup full 3 times , that means they have pretreated this with some chemical to give it self life or its GMO, if you wish to find out true quality of any seeds you buy sprout  some of it , if it sprouts well then you know they have not been messed with in lab , if they do not sprout means nutritional value has been taken out by some form of pretreatment , this was disappointment
