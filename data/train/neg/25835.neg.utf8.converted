I bought this coconut oil from the Tropical Traditions website.  I hated the smell and taste of it.  To me it tasted and smelled rancid, nothing like coconut.  I contacted the manufacturer and they told me that for some people it does smell and taste different but the oil was good.  I asked my mom if it smelled or tasted strange to her.  Surprised me when she said she loved how it smelled, very coconutty to her.  So I gave it to her.  I have used other virgin, unrefined coconut oils before and loved them all but this one just was horrible.  Maybe I have strange tastebuds.
