i have not purchased this product, yet.  i doubt i will purchase it through amazon since it takes way to long to even be shipped out.  it says "Usually ships within 2 to 4 weeks."  in less time than that, i can go to a local store and have them order it directly for me to purchase.<br /><br />second problem i have with this is math related.  its my understanding there are 16 ounces to a pound.  these are sold in 12 ounce units which is just fine.  the problem i do find is this, "Shipping Weight: 1.9 pounds" and "Ghirardelli Caffe Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Caramel, Light Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)"<br /><br />so, 12 oz time 3 packages equals 36 oz.  2 pounds is 32 oz.  so how is it that if i order this three pack of 12 oz bags of coffee beans, i would receive a package that weighs less than two pounds for product that is supposed to weigh over 2 pounds?<br /><br />i am confused by too many things having to do with ordering any consumable products from amazon's Grocery & Gourmet Food section.  but this is one item i really wanted to try and i wish i could just send a message to the seller, but that link isnt on the product profile.  honestly, im noticing that link is missing from more and more product profiles.  i take it amazon only wants people to contact sellers about their merch after they have purchased it.  that sucks, cause the info i get from profiles, reviews, and contacting the seller before purchase if needed, is what helps me to determine if i will enjoy the product im thinking of buying, if the product will be worth its cost, and how well various products work in various situations.<br /><br />this coffee, i would course grind and use in a press if i were to buy it.  thing is, i want more info.  i want numbers to add up properly and if i order something, to get what i pay for.  when i order something, i want it shipped within 3 to 4 days or less, not weeks later.  i know amazon has a shopping system for consumables that allows you to order a quantity and have it reordered automatically after the selected time of your choosing.  but this is insane, its not like im pre-ordering a book, movie, game, cd before it goes on sale.<br /><br />sorry for my bitching.  this coffee sounds like it will taste wonderful.  i just wont be purchasing it through amazon because of too many little things that dont make sense or add up.<br /><br />thank you for your time and putting up with my ramblings.
