When I ordered this product, I had no idea they had changed the formulation. I sure wouldn't have ordered 8 tubs if I'd known... Anyway, the texture is completely different, it's gritty, the flavor is less sweet, it has more calories, less fat, it's made out of tofu instead of soy beans... There is nothing that is the same! I will use this product until it's gone because I don't like wasting food, but then I'll be in the market for something else!
