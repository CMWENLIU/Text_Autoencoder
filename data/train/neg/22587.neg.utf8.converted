I sat and read each and every interview...until I couldn't stand it anymore and had to write my own.  The "new" mountain bars are OK-that's all.  The "original" mountain bars were "great".  They were taller, thicker, heavier, better looking etc.  Two of my aunts retired with Brown & Haley so I am sure I am correct.  Not only have the bars shrunk considerably...they are all made flatter due to being stamped out by machine.  There used to be more peanut bits on the surface...you could see them and you could really taste them.<br />  No offense everyone but you don't really remember the original bars.  Ain't progress great?!!
