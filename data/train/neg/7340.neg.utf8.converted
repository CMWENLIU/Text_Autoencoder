This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!
