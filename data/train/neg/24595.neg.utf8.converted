As no one has reviewed this, I thought I'd take the plunge and be the first. I'd like to give it a bad review, but "bad" would imply it having some qualities to describe. This tea can no more be "bad" than distilled water can be bad--there is essentially nothing to like or dislike about it.<br /><br />It was a bad sign when I opened the bad and smelled...nothing. But that doesn't always mean much, so I brewed up a pot, using about a tablespoon for a 14-ounce mug. I tried it after a couple of minutes and it didn't have much flavor, so I gave it another two or three minutes...still nothing. While it develops a lovely color and is composed of what open into large leaves, it has no aroma, no flavor, really no distinguishing characteristics at all. At work later on, I filled up the strainer in my three-cup Chantal teapot and gave it a good 10 minutes. It's possible some flavor may have developed, I'm not sure. I could have been imagining it.<br /><br />And now I'm stuck with 2.2 pounds of this stuff. I'd better develop a taste for a nice, hot, steaming cup of water, because that's what I'll be having for quite a while.<br /><br />I previously purchased the Malden sencha; it's more than adequate.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003466CMM">Fine Japanese Sencha.
