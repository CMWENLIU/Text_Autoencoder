NOTE: This review is based only on the advertisement of this product as a flea deterrent.<br /><br />With all the rain in the Northeast this summer we are really battling fleas with our two labs. We've used (and are still using!) all of the normal "vet" stuff (Capstar, FrontLine, Interceptor, flea shampoos) and we just can't get rid of them. Then I found this product and read that it has been used with success against fleas. I beleive in home remedies but this one has not worked (yet?)<br /><br />We have been putting 4 squirts of the juice twice a day for two weeks and we're still finding fleas.
