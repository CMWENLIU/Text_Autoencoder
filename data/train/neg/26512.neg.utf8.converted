Received my order today, and i am having the same problem as the previous commenter.  What should have arrived as a case of six-packs instead contained a single six-pack of mini cans.  Obviously the listing error has still not been corrected and no action was taken with the vendor.  I have a request in with Amazon now to see if the issue is corrected and my order is fulfilled correctly - until then, i'm giving this a single star.<br /><br />Update:  After 2 days, no response to my request for assistance via the customer service portal.  Called customer service, and after explaining issue and being placed on hold for quite some time, i was advised that the pricing and shipment was correct.  As i was extremely dissatisfied, i was given a refund for the price paid.<br /><br />So, for the record, the seller is indeed charging over $20 for a SINGLE six-pack of 3.5 ounce milks.
