We were hoping to like this fairly pricey product but warm or cold we found it unappealing. Thankfully we just purchased 1 jar. We would have been happy if it didn't taste like bacon but was tasty just on its own merits. But it isn't something we would put on anything. Our advice save your money and get some real bacon:)
