I think the Mars bar of my youth was the best candy bar I ever tasted, much better than Milky Way, Snickers, Clark, Payday or any other bar.  Now what you pass off as a Mars bar is alright if you call it something else, but it is in no way the candy I used to love.  What happened?  Did Kraft or some other giant change the recipe to save money?  If there really are Mars bars like the ones I grew up with I'll be happy to make the exchange.  In the meantime warn people that only the name Mars is the same.
