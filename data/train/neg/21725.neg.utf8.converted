I bought these because they are made in America and my dogs are worth it.  What I don't like about them is that there is a thick string, or maybe just a thick vain of some kind, going through each piece. A much smaller issues is that these are very hard, even hard to break by hand.  We have been using a pliers to break the pieces up before serving and then a scissors to cut the string part!  A dog could choke to death with these.<br /><br />My biggest problem is that I am looking for an alternative USA raised chicken solution for treats.
