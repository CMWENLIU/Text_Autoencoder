I've had a couple of other PB&Co peanut butters and was pretty happy with them so I wanted to try the maple. But I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentions the gritty texture. I'm guessing that the maple syrup added to the mix has, at some point crystallized. I'm not enamored of the micro-crunch but the flavor really is great. Despite my only giving 2 stars, I'm not going to return any of this. And I am going to try toasting a PB sammich with this PB because I think with heat, it might melt into smoothness.<br /><br />I'd really like PB&Co. to do some testing to ensure that they kill the grit. Then this would be an absolute 5 star product for sure. Also, the other highly positive reviewers don't seem to be bothered by this so perhaps it's an intermittent problem. Bottom line: flavor worth it but be ready for the possibility of a very fine grittiness.
