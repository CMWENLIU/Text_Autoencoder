The details on the packaging was ideal.  Everything I could have wanted. Unfortunately, the beans inside was not ideal.  To start with the whole beans were not whole.  They were in pieces and crumbling.  In addition the beans were of lower quality, because they were very small.  Eventhough we grind these beans to make our coffee, we want to start with a high quality whole bean that holds those flavors that we seek.  Unfortunately, 100% Arabica does not mean high quality arabica.
