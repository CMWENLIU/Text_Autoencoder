I wanted to get a variety pack of K-Cups so I thought I'd try this out even though it was a bit pricey (I thought it would be worth the extra bucks to get to try 20+ different flavors).  The only reason why I purchased from this buyer specifically was because I wanted ONLY Extra Bold K-Cups.  I knew there would be double of flavors, etc but I was disappointed to find that almost half of them were not extra bold. But, I was glad that it arrived much earlier than the expected delivery date....
