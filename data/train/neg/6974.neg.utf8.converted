I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.
