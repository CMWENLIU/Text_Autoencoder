I used to be allergic to peanuts as a child, and I have a strong taste aversion to peanuts and peanut butter, but I love almond butter. After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds.
