I hardly order chai teai, then I tried Tazo chai tea, due to the nice reviews on Stash brand  and cheaper price I went for it.  Way too bitter in comparison to Tazo, I used  almost 10 ounces of water and I wasn't able to finish my cup.  It is very bitter!!! Be aware, and only buy it  if you like real real strong black tea.  As a matter of fact is more like black tea than  chai.<br /><br />Keep in mind I am not a tea expert, but if I like a nice cup of tea, and never have not finished one, like in this case.
