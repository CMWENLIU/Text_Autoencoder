The bonsai in the photo is nothing like what I received.  I received a little tiny thing that is only 2 inches tall and isn't growing out to the side at all. I chose this bonsai  because it was growing sideways.  I know the actual plants vary but I thought that it would at least have some resemblance.  The quality of the plant isn't that great either.  It's mostly all stem and has very little green on it and even that has brown dead looking patches on it.
