I bought this because of the soups I've had by Pacific, most are great... the broths are bleh, too weak and watery, but the tomato ones and *the new veggie lentil and roasted red pepper mmm* are souper-duper.<br /><br />First, the texture... a mix of rice flour thickened broth and creme fraiche and milk, it had separated so one section was clear goopy broth and the other was the creamy-ish part (more starchy than creamy, like potatoes--in this case rice flour--blended with some broth and skim milk, nothing like Campbell's, not condensed enough to work for recipes that need a thick base). I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).<br /><br />The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.<br /><br />What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.<br /><br />When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.<br /><br />The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got "responsible" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.<br /><br />Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!). Healthy shouldn't have to taste like wartime rations, not in this day and age.
