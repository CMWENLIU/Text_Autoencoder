We recently purchased seven unsweetened chocolate bars for comparison. The goal was to find an unsweetened chocolate that was so good (to snack on) that it didn't need sugar.  It does exist:  Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate.  The Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar came in last. Our rankings (which of course reflect out personal tastes) from love to freecycle:  1. Pralus French 100% Cocoa: Criollo Chocolate; 2. Vintage Plantations 100% Cacao Arriba Bar; 3. Michel Cluizel French Chocolate - "Chocolat Noir Infini" 99% Cocoa Dark Chocolate (has more ingredients added); 4. Sunspire 100% Chocolate Bar; and it was difficult to rank the last three as we did not care for them at all - 5. Ghirardeli 100% unsweeteed Chocolate Bar; 6. Callebaut Unsweetened Liquor Chunks Cocoa; 7. Schaffen Berger Unsweetened 99% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar.
