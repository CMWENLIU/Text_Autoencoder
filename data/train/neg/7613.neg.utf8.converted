Desperation led me to try this food although I wasn't crazy about the brewers dried yeast or potatoes. I needed to try something without fish in it for my kitties when 2 of my 3 cats started to get flaky skin from food that did contain fish. I found it quite a challenge to find a good food that doesn't include some type of seafood.  As this one did not, I reluctantly decided to give it a try.  All 3 cats seemed to enjoy it, but I will not be buying it again.  Even though the moisture is only the usual 78%, it is so mushy and just awful to work with.  My girls didn't seem to mind, but between the consistency, yeast and potatoes this just doesn't cut it for my cats.  I'll have to be satisfied with fewer foods in their rotation.
