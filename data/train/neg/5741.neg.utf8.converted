I searched high and low looking for gluten free, casein free, and dye-free sprinkles.  I thought I had finally hit the jackpot when I fell upon India Tree products and read the ingredient description here as of this review's writing.  Many India Tree products are indeed dye-free and good for those of us on the GFCF diet. I thought that these non-pareils would be the same high quality and natural ingredients as the rest of India Tree's decorating sugars.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Got the HUGE jar of sprinkles today (dented; thanks Amazon shipping) and the ingredients are as follows:<br />Sugar<br />Corn Starch<br />Confectioner's Glaze<br />FDC Yellow 5<br />Red 5<br />Blue 1<br />food grade carnauba wax<br />FDC Red 40<br />Yellow 6<br />and Blue 2<br /><br />I'm willing to pay a premium for good naturally colored sprinkles.  But when you're just the same as the sprinkles in the grocer's aisle, I don't know what's the point?  Next time, only buy India Tree's "natural" product line.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful, please let me know.
