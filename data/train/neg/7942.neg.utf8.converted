I was disappointed with the variety pack and should have ordered the honey roasted or dry roasted macs. The chocolate covered macs have so much chocolate that I could not taste the macs, the kona flavored ones were bitter, and the onion and garlic ones were too salty. I love the flavor of macadamia nuts and was disappointed that it was overwhelmed by low quality ingredients.  Definitely not worth the price!
