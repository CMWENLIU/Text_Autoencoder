I have an 80 pound Boxer with a big drooly mouth but a soft jaw. He loves raw hides and needs something he can't easily destroy. These flimsy raw hide bones are a choking hazard.<br /><br />In his 8 years on one of these and I had to pull a soggy piece out that was caught in his throat. This happened twice before I threw this bag (and my good money) away.<br /><br />Thankfully I only let him chew under direct supervision despite the fact that he's never had an issue with his hundreds of previous rawhide bones. Looking for another brand to purchase from Amazon...
