The description states: "Labeled specifically as a Pure Vanilla Extract".<br />The actual ingredients are: Sugar, Water, Vanilla Extract, Vanilla Beans, Gum Tragacanth (a natural thickener).<br />Nielsen-Massey is that what you call, "pure"? I don't, I call it false advertising.<br />I use Batko Vanilla extracts, they contain no sugar and I rate them just as good as or better than Nielsen-Massey.
