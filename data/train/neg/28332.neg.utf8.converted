This product is definitely not as advertised or pictured.  The photo clearly shows 100 calories but in fact this item has 170 CALORIES.  The photo shows "No Sugar Added" but in reality this item has 28 GRAMS OF SUGAR!  Product Description:  "Delicious chocolate milk, now available in a 100 Calorie Pack."  BEWARE this is not what it seems and I was duped!  Conveniently they have a legal disclaimer in small print tucked away at the bottom:  "Disclaimer: While we work to ensure that product information is correct, on occasion manufacturers may alter their ingredient lists.
