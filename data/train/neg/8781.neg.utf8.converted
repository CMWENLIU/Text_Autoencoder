I bought this for me because once upon a time, a friend of mine got a little tub of red vines as a valentine's day present and they were SO good. Tart and chewy and delicious. The ones you buy in store are dusty and gross. I figured these would be better.<br /><br />Upon arrival, I noted that these ones don't look like they've been sitting on a shelf for about 20 years. But they also taste just bland. They're sugary for sure, but they have no taste other than vaguely sweet. They weren't stale or anything, just not good. Back to Twizzlers!
