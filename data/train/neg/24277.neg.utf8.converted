Only 11 1/2 in. wide which Amazon does not disclose plus it's paper thin and tears easily. You'll need to use 4x the amount of this product as compared to a decent brand. Note carefully: Amazon will not allow you to return this item if you're not satisfied though they did issue me a refund when I complained. I'm all for recycling but this company markets an inferior product as been green...just marketing nonsense.
