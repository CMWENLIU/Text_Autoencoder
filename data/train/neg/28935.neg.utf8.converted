I can only imagine that the other reviewers are principals in the company selling this product.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing bar purchases I've ever made. If you look at the ingredients before you purchase the bottle, you won't purchase the bottle. I had read about Fee Brothers Bitters in an old New York Times article about the rebirth of cocktail culture, and I had very high hopes. Unfortunately, I assumed they were artisanal and naturally flavored, and alcoholic like Peychaud's or Angostura. The ingredients list reads like a pack of Orange Drink: Water, Glycerin, Flavors - Natural and Artificial Extracts and Flavors. Also, no alcohol, which is a no-no, if you're mixing real drinks.<br /><br />These bitters taste bad. They smell like an orange popsicle but have a truly bad and overpowering votive candle scent. If you want orange flavor in your drinks, pick any other orange bitters. This is a sure way to water down your drink, without adding natural flavor. I've used this in a couple of drinks and been duly disappointed in each one. The only tastes it imbues are those of chemicals and sourness. DO NOT USE THESE BITTERS!!!
