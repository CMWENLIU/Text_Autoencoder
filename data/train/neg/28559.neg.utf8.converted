I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount.<br /><br />I hesitate to order this item again.
