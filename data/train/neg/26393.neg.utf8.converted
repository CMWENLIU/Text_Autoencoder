I ordered this package because 12 of the listed coffees were what I had put in my cart at bigcatcoffee.com to try and I thought it was worth paying a higher price per cup to not have to buy 5 cups at a time in case I didn't like the coffee.  I only received 10 of the products listed, there were 5 decaf coffees which wasn't listed and I do not have any use for decaf coffee. I didn't receive Jet Fuel; Sumatran Reserve; Southern Pecan; Italian Roast, Breakfast in Bed; Hawaiian Hazelnut; Jamaica Me Crazy; Rodeo Drive; Vienna Coffee House; India Spice Chai Tea.  I realize there is a disclaimer that the product may not be exactly as listed but to not have 50% of the coffees and to receive 3 of some of them when they weren't even listed was very disappointing.  The coffees that filled in the missing products had 8 I would never consider buying and only 4 that I would consider buying.  If you are wanting a sample pack to keep on hand for company or if you like a lot of flavored coffees and decaf then this might be a good buy for you; however, if you are wanting this to try coffees from all over then I would not recommend this product for you.  Peace and Blessings
