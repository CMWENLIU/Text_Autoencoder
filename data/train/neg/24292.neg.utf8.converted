I was a long term subscriber  on the Amazon plan for Fancy Feast Fish and Shrimp<br />I just cancelled my subscription today.<br />Let me start out by saying Amazon is top notch with their program of subscribe and save<br />Which is why I placed it at two stars.<br />However I would like to know what the Friskies corporation DID with this product....<br />I think that there has been a change to the formula.<br />It now stinks so badly my cat who is not overly fussy and ate this flavor happily and eagerly for 3 years and now will not even touch this stuff!!<br /> She is a healthy 3 year old cat, who loved her Fancy Feast treat.<br />And I noticed the change when serving it to her with the horrid almost rancid over-fishy smell and texture within the last month or so.<br />And yes, while I realize, that it is a fish and shrimp mix and will smell somewhat the smell seems now completely atrocious.<br />My guess is that the company started using a lower grade of product.<br /><br />I put this review out here to see if anyone also has encountered this with this product recently also??<br />So I was resigned to cancelling my subscription- Again through no fault of Amazon<br />And I now ordered from Amazon,  "Halo Spot's Stew" Crab, shrimp, and chicken flavor mix canned cat food<br />And I will see how that goes...<br />Just wanted to leave my feedback on my disappointment on what this product has seemed to become.
