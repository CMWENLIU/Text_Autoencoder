First, I happened to be the customer who told Pamela (and Amazon) the declared weight of this product is wrong. It is listed (here on Amazon as well as on Pamela's own website) as .7 ounce each. In fact, each packet, a single cookie, is .2 ounce or slightly more. After lengthy email and phone correspondence they sheepishly admitted the error in weight. You could say this is not worth troubling oneself over, but that's more than three times exaggeration, .7 to .2, so the goal of truth in advertising should have straightened them out. (If you order these cookies and have a postal scale, you can weigh them yourself; you won't find them weighing in at .7 ounce, nor the .43 ounce suggested with their chocolate version.)<br /><br />Second, before I had finished corresponding with the company, I had ordered the Extreme Chocolate version of this cookie product (100 packets of .7 ounce each). I'd tried them previously in the other package they offer, 7 ounces. These individually wrapped cookies are dry/stale, nothing at all like the larger package version. If you do order them, and you have a postal scale, check out the weight for yourself.<br /><br />Try them if you want, but be prepared to ask Amazon for credit. I did.
