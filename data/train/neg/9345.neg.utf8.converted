Ordered for my elderly parents in another state on a special Christmas promotion,  then visited and was able to see and taste the products.  Disappointing and embarrassing!  The steaks were small, thin, and tasteless.  The filling of the stuffed sole, while being made with crab supposedly, was pasty and bland.  The twice baked stuffed potatoes were tasty and appealing (though only the top half was filled, the rest just baked potato) but what you really want when you buy a steak package, is good steak!  The advertised "gifts" were not even kept by my recipients,  so poor were the quality of the knives.  In all, a waste of money.  Even at half price, not worth it!
