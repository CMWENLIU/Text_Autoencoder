I too made the mistake of buying a bunch of these horrible "noodles" and threw away almost all of them.  I am not a picker eater, I like most any food, but I could not stomach the texture of these noodles!  No matter how much you chew them, they just bounce around on your teeth like rubber. I tried them in soup, with stir fry, and with pasta sauce - all disgusting.  Don't commit to buying a whole box of these, look for them at Central Market or an Asian store and just buy one bag.
