I have been to Nicaragua, and I have had real, organic coffee there (some of the best was by workers in the vicinity of Esteli.  Real Nicaraguan coffee is earthy and fragrant with low bitterness and acidity.  One can thus jack up the quantity of coffee per pot and get as intense a flavor as one wants with no downside.<br /><br />I purchased this product with great excitement after the bags of coffee I took from Nicaragua were finished.  I was dreadfully disappointed.  Indeed, I would say that this is, as close as I can tell, anti-Nicaraguan coffee.  It has none of that earthiness and fragrance but plenty of bitterness and acidity.  It is completely, in other words, lacking in character.  Indeed, I think this is closer to Folgers than to gourmet coffee of any kind.<br /><br />I am aware that negative reviews tend to get panned.  But I want to make clear that I sought, as was given, a refund for this "unrefundable" product.  I said at the time that I would be posting a negative review to steer others away from this product.<br /><br />I will try with some other brand of Nicaraguan coffee in the future.  Maybe I'll just pre-pay to have the real stuff sent to me from that country.
