I googled Organic Valley to find out how to let them know the lot number of some spoiled aseptic chocolate milk.  I was planning to return the milk to the local grocery where I bought it, but since I've always thought Organic Valley was an ethical cooperative, I figured they would want to know about the spoiled milk.<br /><br />To my horror, I happened upon a recent article (April 2011) describing how Organic Valley is allowing giant factory farms that abuse their animals to sell milk and eggs via the Organic Valley label. I am so disgusted. Here I've been paying a premium for organic milk, eggs, and cheese (carefully avoiding Horizon since they are notorious for factory farms), and now I find out that Organic Valley has been lying to us about all the "family farms" in their cooperative.<br /><br />The board of directors of Organic Valley should be ashamed of themselves.  Honestly, the only thing that has kept me from going vegan was thinking it's OK to buy organic. Guess what--it's not OK to buy organic dairy products. Animals are still being abused.Organic Valley is evil.
