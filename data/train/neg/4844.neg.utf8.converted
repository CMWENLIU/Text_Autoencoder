Other reviewer is right. The flavor is odd (elderberry flavored cranberry pieces). Not what the palete is expecting when it thinks it is getting strawberry. They are pretty the same way waxed fruit is and just as inedible. All the fiber one bars have an odd raw flour flavor that is a little adjustment at first. The chocolate and caramel are very good. This one is for the birds. From seeing what they left on my car, a little fiber would be helpful.
