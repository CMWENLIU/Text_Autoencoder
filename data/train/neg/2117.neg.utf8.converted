This drink was so weird, I had to review it.  The front says "Naturally Flavored Snapple Apple with other natural flavors juice drink."  And then "All Natural Snapple" and then there's a picture of an apple.<br /><br />The ingredients are: Water, Sugar, Pear Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Natural Flavors, Vegetable and Fruit Extracts (for color)<br /><br />First of all, the color is not anything that occurs in nature.  It's roughly the color of fruit punch.  And where exactly on that list are the apples?  It's pear juice, and it tastes like pear juice.  Which is fine: I like pears.  But why is it advertised as apple juice?<br /><br />It's also pretty disingenuous to make such a big deal about how natural this stuff is, when it's really just sugar water.<br /><br />So, no, I wouldn't recommend buying this.  Especially if you want real apple juice.
