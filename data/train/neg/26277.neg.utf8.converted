STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search "chicken jerky treats china" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am "fortunate"... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal in 2007 that killed 1000's of our best friends. TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY until it is proven saFe (and even then I'd avoid it)
