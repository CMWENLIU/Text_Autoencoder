I would give it a zero if I could. Please do not give this to your child. I have been giving it to my 9 month old for 4 months now. Look into the formula history and the non-bias studies showing that there is arsenic in the Organic Brown Rice Syrup. Please do your research and do NOT give your little one this formula. We as parents go out and research and try to provide the very best for our children and this company is okay with the amount of arsenic that is in their formula. I am not okay with that...there should be NO pesticides in the formula. Shame on YOU Nature's One Shame on YOU. Please do not be deceived like I was.
