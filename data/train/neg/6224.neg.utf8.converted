I ordered this product to make white, strawberry-flavored icing for some cupcakes for a wedding. since it was so expensive, i did not test it to make sure it actually tasted like strawberry before baking day. My Mistake! It smelled like bad bubblegum and tasted like Windex or something - just a terrible, chemical taste. i made the icing, then tasted it and thought "what was on my finger!? nail polish remover or something?" well I hadn't done my nails, it was the icing! i could not serve that. I had to start over and use vanilla at the last minute. Thankfully the bride was very understanding. I DO NOT recommend this product. (Also, when I contacted the seller to try to send it back, they would never reply. Obviously they don't stand behind what they sell. Money Wasted.)
