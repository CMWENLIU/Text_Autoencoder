I know instant noodles aren't considered to be a health food, but I can't see any reason for some of the ingredients in this soup, unless it's to hide other poor quality ingredients.  Most of the ingredients are chemical sounding names that I had never heard of, so I looked them up.  Among them, propylene Glycol is a colourless viscous hydroscopic sweet-tasting compound used as an antifreeze and brake fluid (WTF!!!), and most of the others I couldn't find (even using Google).  Then there are the 8 -- that's not a misprint; I said eight -- times sugar in its various forms are mentioned in the ingredient list: Sorbitol, Sucrose Fatty Acid Esters, High Fructose Syrup, Glucose, sugar (listed THREE times), sweet cooking wine.  Then after adding all that sugar, they added an artificial sweetener (Sucralose).<br /><br />I don't care how easy this is to make -- or how good it tastes!  With all the sugar it contains, anybody who is the least bit sensitive to sugar (for instance, diabetics or hypoglycemics) would really experience major sugar overload from eating it!
