People who feed this bag of chemicals to their dogs shouldn't be allowed to have pets...They don't have a clue. It's frightening to read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews. I'll bet these same people's entire families are over weight and have health issues...Log on to "WebMD" if you want to know what to feed your pet and/or family....Bake some organic chicken legs and/or thighs for a less expensive and much healthier treat.
