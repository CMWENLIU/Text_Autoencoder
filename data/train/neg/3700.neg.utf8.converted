Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai is a iced tea mix that comes in packets that you add to a bottle of water. Easy and convenient for on the go.<br /><br />It has a strong strawberry flavor but it leaves a a strong aftertaste that I didn't like.<br /><br />It's supposed to be sweetened with honey, made from real tea leaves and real fruit flavors but I didn't taste the honey and it wasn't that sweet, kind of a bitter taste.
