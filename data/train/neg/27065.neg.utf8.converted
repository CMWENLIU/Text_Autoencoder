These are vegan marshmallows, but contain soy.  Given soy is a common allergen, I recommend the description be rewritten to include this info.  Disappointed in discovering they had soy, the small size of the marshmallow, and the expensive price.  Still looking for a vegan, non-soy, campfire marshmallow....
