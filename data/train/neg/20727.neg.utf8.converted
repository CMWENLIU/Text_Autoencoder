My husband picked up this brand because it was a few pennies cheaper than Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk, our usual brand. Bad move.<br />I opened the can and right away noticed an "off" odor, compared to my favorite brand - Thai Kitchen.  I did not like the taste at all, and noticed that it is preserved with sulphites.<br />I will return all the cans he purchased, and continue to spend a bit more for Thai Kitchen's brand, which contains no preservatives. It is so delicious I can eat it by the spoonful straight out of the can!
