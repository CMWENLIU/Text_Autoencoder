I no longer feel comfortable buying Nutro for my beloved felines. Shortly after we purchased some indoor Max Cat formula for them, our male cats started vomiting and having diarrhea. We gradually tapered off the Nutro and introduced some new stuff. The cats stopped having problems and were no longer vomiting or having loose stools. A couple months down the road our male cat started peeing in different places and wouldn't go in the litter box. We took him to the vet to find out he had a severe UTI and that this had been going on for 2-3 months. We traced it back to about the time we started feeding him this Nutro Indoor Cat formula. I feel this food is to blame for his severe UTI conditions. Perhaps it's not the only culprit, but considering the awful side effects, it might have been the top contributor.<br /><br />Lots of pet owners are disowning Nutro and switching to something with better quality checks.<br /><br />If you are having problems with Nutro, call the company at 1-800-833-5330 and tell them your claim and what is happening to your pet.<br /><br />Here is a link of pet owners with problems with this cat food :<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I no longer feel safe purchasing any type of Nutro cat food for my beloved pets.
