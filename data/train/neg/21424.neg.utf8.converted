According to my sister she like this coffee.  I've tried it and think it's not the best coffee I ever tasted.  In fact, in thier discription this coffee was grown in different location than the original Jamaica Blue Mountain.  This may had an effect of the overall tast. This is not a bad coffee just not worth the price...
