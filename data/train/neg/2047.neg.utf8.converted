I purchased this thinking the tins would be filled with Harry Potter treats! Looking back, I see there was no mention of the food/candy in the item description so that was my fault, but I think these are way overpriced. Thankfully for me they only sent one tin instead of six, so I sent it back for a full refund. Without the actual treats to put in the tins I don't really see the point of this set.
