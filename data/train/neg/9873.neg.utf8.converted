The cans I received were severely bent. This did not happen in shipping. The box was in good condition and packaged well. Amazon needs to indicate the condition of the canned good they are selling (or at least mention the possibility of the cans being bent, because it is starting to appear from the number I have received that they are selling damaged canned goods). I had to throw one of the cans away since the product in it smelled off.
