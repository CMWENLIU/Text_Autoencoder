This maker got great reviews, but the machine I purchased was not the quality you would expect for the price. My machine is almost all plastic and the doors and trays do not fit snugly. I had to ship it back under warranty in under 3 months as it had quit working.  I had to foot the shipping to the warranty repair center to the tune of $35.<br /><br />When it was returned, day before yesterday, it was dirty and the repair order stated it was either my beans or water as the cause.<br /><br />We have used it for under 10 cups since and it's already not working properly again using their coffee.<br /><br />I would not purchase again.  I will say the customer service rep was very nice on the phone.... but that's not enough when spending $500.
