I ordered regular shipments for the cacao powder and drink cacao daily; the most recent batch was terribly bitter and had a burnt woody flavor and texture.  Clearly there was a change in the quality; I sent an email to the company (they;'re based in Novato, so not far away) and heard nothing back.<br /><br />Not impressed, am looking for a new brand.
