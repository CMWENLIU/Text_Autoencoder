Just bought few hot sauces for a personal review. This one was the obvious choice, being the most selling here on Amazon. Reviews was also favorable. I am quite surprised no one mentioned it stinks, and I mean bad. Makes your stomach turn (few people besides me feel the same way)!<br />Sure, it's hot but there are far more better alternatives out there, for one, 100% natural Blair's hot sauces (Mega death being the hottest from their standard line). This was actually the second one from package and I love it. Third one was "West African VooDoo Juice" that actually comes with handmade voodoo doll :), but besides that makes a great and original addition to your food and therefore deserves recommendation. Keep in mind that all of these are extremely hot and you will probably never eat them directly so bad smell (in case of Dave's Ghost Papper) will not be so intense. Still, I'm gonna give mine away and hope my friend will like it better.
