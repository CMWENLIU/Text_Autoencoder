This product is very weird. I mixed the powder with water like it says in the directions and it doesn't have a good taste at all in my opinion. You can go to the company's website and get recipes from people. I tried the PB2 in a muffin/cupcake recipe and they were delicious, I also really liked it in my oatmeal. Overall I would not buy this item again; I don't think its worth it when I can just go to the grocery store and buy regular peanut butter.
