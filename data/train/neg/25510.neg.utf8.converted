This package is misleading in that you expect it to be the same product as PopSecret's normal Homestyle popcorn but in a smaller package. This is not the case - it is a lighter formula with not nearly as much flavor. I know many of the 100 calorie packs are not the same as their full calorie counterparts, but they are normally labeled as such (ex Oreo baked Wafer snacks). Overall it is disappointing.
