In order to be a successful chip substitute, kale chips need to have:<br />1) Crunch and/or crispness<br />2) Salty flavor<br />3) Appropriate price for the increase in health<br /><br />Sadly, these "chips" do not meet the standards I've outlined. First, there is so much gunk on them that they aren't even all that crispy. Dried nori is a better solution, which is crispy and crunchy. Secondly, the kale isn't even that salty! Weird, yeasty veggie taste? Check. Salty goodness? No. Well, one can assume then that at LEAST these chips would get the third point right, having the healthy benefits of being kale right? Wrong again! These chips have a surprising amount of calories because, well, of the gunk. Apparently in the gunk is sugar and sunflower seed paste which, not surprisingly, bumps up the calories and sugar content significantly.<br /><br />Are they better than doritos? Yes, but barely and not enough to justify the loss in taste or increase in price. My suggestion is to make your own chips, find another brand that stays more natural, switch to popcorn, or try dried nori as a healthy salty alternative.
