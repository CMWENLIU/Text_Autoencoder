After getting this make believe product I wrote to the distributor of Bookbinder's soups and Bookbinder's in Philadelphia to give them my opinion of their snapper soup. This isn't even close to what Old Original Bookbinder's soup should taste like. It is thin and the only additional item that you can chew is not Snapper, but carrots. It is the worst I have ever tasted, period.<br />It was also reassutring to me to just this week have a food commentator say the exact same thing that I said. It is a make believe Snapper soup.
