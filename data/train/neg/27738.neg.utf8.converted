This product, although still usable, is not what I would call high quality onions. The color most of us are used to is white and the texture very fine. This is not the case with this product. It is a medium brown color and tastes as though it has been toasted to a degree. To me, it does not do as well in recipes as other brands on the market. It plumps up much more leaving a grainy texture and throws off the color of recipes.<br />It is not a replacement for onion powder by far, and I really will not purchase it again.<br />On the flip side though, if you are looking for a coarser texture with a very mild onion flavor, you might like it.
