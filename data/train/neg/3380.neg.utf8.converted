I am in the process of trying all of the Annie Chun's Soup Noodle Bowls and Noodle Bowls. Of all the ones I bought I tried these first because these are the ones that I actually wanted to like the best. They were AWFUL !! Very overpowering lemony taste. I tried to eat them but could not even finish them. Now, you have to understand something, I am really not very picky as far as food is concerned. If I dont like something, I usually can pretty much finish it because I hate wasting food but I actually threw these away. I was so disappointed !! Since then I have tried a couple of the other noodle bowls and a soup bowl and have really liked them so it isnt the Annie Chun's products but this particular noodle bowl. I have read a couple of the more recent reviews on this product on Amazon and their facebook page and was relieved to see it wasnt just me. That other people had noticed this overpowering lemony taste. Seems they havent always been like this though. One gentleman stated that he had compaired the ingredient label of a new batch and an old batch and it seems they have changed some of the ingredients. Annie, if you read this, go back to the old way because pretty soon no one is going to be buying these.
