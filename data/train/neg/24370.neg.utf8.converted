I'd heared so many good things about this product that I just had to try it for myself.So I decided to order it.I made an order for two packages of the noodles and it took two long mths. to finally receive it.(I constantly called and left mess. to the comp. but NO RETURN CALL!)So,I expected the noodles to be the best thing since slice bread when they did finally arrive.But, they Tasted Terrible.I wouln't reccomend this product(Not to mention the company.They had a mess. on their voice mail stating that it was DIFFICULTING MEETING DEMAND!If they can't meet demand for this product,then they need to look for another field of work!)
