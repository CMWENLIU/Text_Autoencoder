UPDATE - I bought a tin of Liquorice Altoids at Trader Joe's and they are definately different (and better) than the ones I purchased from Amazon. The tins from Amazon don't have the purple flowers on the top and the Altoids themselves have more of a bitter taste. Original Review: I'd never tried licorice Altoids before, but based on all the great reviews and the fact that I love black licorice, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Now I'm stuck with all these lovely tins of horribleness. They taste very bitter to me and I can't even finish one. In another review someone thought maybe they got a bad batch. The numbers on my tins are L191009 110 Z3.
