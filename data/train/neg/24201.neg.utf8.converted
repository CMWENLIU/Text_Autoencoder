Received my 6 pack of "CERES 100% Apricot Juice" today and was shocked that it was "100% Ceres Fruit Juice Blend".  It was still warm but I could not wait to taste it, I absolutely love Apricot juice but, to my dismay this tasted like Pear juice. So I refrigerated it and when it cooled I tasted it again, again, Pear juice is all I could taste. I looked at the list of ingrediates to my surprise it read Pear juice first and Apricot puree next.  The puree I believe was supossedly for the color as it is not Apricot in color but very light orange. When ordered, it stated "100% Apricot juice", what I received was "100% Fruit Juice Blend" under that Apricot. To me this is very misleading as you can see by the picture it  states "100% Apricot Juice" and NOT "100% Fruit Juice Blend" which by the way tastes like "Pear juice".<br /><br />Save your money on this product and do more research first. Terrible, unless you like 'Pear Juice" which I do, but not when I expected "100% Apricot Juice".
