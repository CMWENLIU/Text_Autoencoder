These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that the fancy packaging makes no mention that it contains sucralose (aka Splenda - just google what artificial sugars do to your body) and modified food starch (contains glutamate/glutamatic acid like MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome enough to put this garbage into your body. You might as well just eat sugar free candy. It tastes a lot better.<br /><br />Emerald needs to realize that people eat nuts for a healthier diet; they don't want to eat the same artificial junk that you can find in a candy bar. Emerald is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage. All the other brands have more natural ingredients. Stay away from the Emerald brand.
