After reading all the rave reviews about Nielsen-Massey vanilla, I purchased the 32 oz. for my Thanksgiving pie baking and Christmas cookie baking.  I must say I was disappointed, and feel that the vanilla I purchase at Sam's Club is just as good or perhaps better.  This didn't add anything extra to any of my baked goods, but didn't hurt them either.  I would say it's just another vanilla, but way overpriced.  I won't be buying it again.
