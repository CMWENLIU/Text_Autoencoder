I don't know if the packs I had were old  (although they are stamped 06 18 11 so it seems fresh enough) or poorly stored or if it was just the coffee, but I was very disappointed with the coffee it produces.  It was weak, and bitter.  And did not have the same sort of buttery texture that can be produced with Sumatra pods for example.  I have an older model at home and the new model at work with an espresso holder.  The newer model makes a slightly but noticeably better coffee.  In neither case will you get an actual espresso but is a far cry better than drip coffee.  So far I have found the Sumatra blend pods provide the best results for those who are trying to get the texture and flavor of espresso.
