To prefix, I will eat almost anything, dried squid jerky, octopus served in its ink, sesame and seaweed Chinese candy (unleaded), intense ginger candy, and strange sea creatures that are squishy. Pulparindo and other Mexican salt candies must require some kind of tongue that I was not born with.  It causes my brain to do flips, not comprehending what I am eating.  Is it a salty snack, or is it candy?  These are two worlds that should not come together.  What next, pork Jolly Ranchers, or shrimp Jelly Bellies?
