I purchased the 2 pack, so I could gift one set. I decided to buy lemons, oranges, grapefruit, apples and pineapple. I sat the tablet on my tongue and let it dissolve completely, moving it around on the surface area to "coat" all of the taste buds. Well, there was no effect when I ate any of the fruits I bought. I followed the directions, and used foods recommended. So, I am just disappointed that this didn't work.
