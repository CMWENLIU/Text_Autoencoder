I have had Kashi 7 Grain Pilaf before and it was excellent. However the pilaf I recieved from this vender tasts very stale. I looked at the expiration date on all the boxes and they are not out of date, so the case must have been stored someplace hot to make the pilaf taste almost....musty is the closest word I can use to describe the flavor.  Had to use many spices and lots of salt to make it edible! Kind of defeats the definition of Healthy to need so much salt. If there were any way to return this stuff I would!
