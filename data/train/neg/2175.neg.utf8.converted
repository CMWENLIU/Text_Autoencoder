I was SO excited to get these pens so I could do some decorating of Christmas treats.  But when I opened them up, some of the pens were completely dry.  I read the ingredients list, but wasn't sure if it would mess them up to dip them in water - so they are now just taking up space in my cupboard.  I'll try to contact the seller, but according to one other shopper, they aren't very cooperative.  We'll see.
