Well it seems Prince of Peace has once again raised their price. A box of white tea and pu erh tea is now nearly THIRTY dollars to have shipped to you. Five dollars shipping per box plus the insanely raised price of 16.99. Apparently Dr Oz has created a lot of suckers who will pay this ridiculous price but I won't be. So much for good advertising of a product.
