This is ridiculous - I shop Amazon all the time and I am definitely pro-Amazon but the price on the package of Thomas English Muffins is insane - $6.95 for one package of 6.  You can purchase a pack at Walmart for $2.  Who would pay this price?<br /><br />Amazon you get it right 99% of the time and are spot on but maybe not on your food prices.  This is the first time I have checked prices on food.  Today Show just did a segment and I had to check it out - and sure enough your muffins are $6.95.
