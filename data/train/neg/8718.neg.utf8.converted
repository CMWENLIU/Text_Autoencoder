update 2/18/2012:  I GOT MY MONEY BACK about 1/17/2012. If you truly want ceylon/mexican cinnamon, use this link instead<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAU1F0?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER FROM LATIN PRODUCTS!! I received the wrong type of cinnamon poorly packaged. It looked like it was done at someone's house and they used twist ties to seal it in thin plastic bags. I complained twice (first Richard, then Lance) before anything was done. francisco (lowercase on purpose) came to the phone with a nasty disposition. When I did attempt to talk, he kept talking over top of me, being irate because it was not an error, his bait and switch of the product was deliberate. He said "I don't care about your business, I'm the owner".  After being threatened with legal action, he emailed me a label to ship it back, "I'm going to weigh it and if any is missing you won't get a refund". What reputable business comes to the phone with a combatative demeanor and attitude?  This operation is a team of con men in my opinion. Clearly he told the truth when he said he didn't care about my business and I'm sure he will against the law, put this merchandise back in stock.<br /><br />There are several addresses floating around for this 'business'.  Save yourself the hassle by ordering from someone else!
