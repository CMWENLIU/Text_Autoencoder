I needed a squirrel repellent for my bird feeder.  Nasty little critters were do'n a job on the feeder.  Critter Ridder was a little on the expensive side but I decided to give it a try.  The squirrels totally ignored it. Where bird seed fell to the ground I tried sprinkling CR.  It did not faze the squirrels at all.  I may resort to a bee bee gun.
