I had purchased the regular coconut flakes which were so delicious that I decided to buy this product. Night and day difference! Granted this product is reduced fat, but it is soooo dry and rather bitter tasting. I will reorder the wonderful flakes which I eat right out of the bag and will try to use this up in baking.
