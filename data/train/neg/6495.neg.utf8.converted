I purchased this from a local grocery store.  I have used La Tourangelle oils before and was impressed.  However, this oil is bland in taste and doesn't really have any truffle flavour.  Checking the list of ingredients, it confirmed my suspicion, there is no truffle in this product.  It is flavoured with Truffle aroma, whatever that is.  I returned it to the store and bought a better but more expensive brand.
