While I am usually a big fan of herbal teas/beverages, this is a seriously disgusting drink.  It was all I could do once I'd brewed it to actually take a sip after smelling the odor, and even my five year old (who also likes herbal beverages) smelled it and said, "You wouldn't want to drink that!"  He was very correct; one sip was more than enough for me.  I would never, ever pay money for this drink and would be happy to never have another taste of it again.
