This tea has a nice taste but is not very decaffinated. My husband has rather significant reactions caffinated beverages. I thought this would be a step up in quality from the local decaffeinated tea from the grocery store. It is a nice blend from a taste angle but left the consumer with vertigo - dizzy, headache and nausia. In fairness to the tea he tried it a second time and had the same reaction. If you are looking for a less caffinated tea this might be fine but it is certainly not decaffeinated.
