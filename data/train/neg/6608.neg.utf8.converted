I bought this product because of its decent price and relatively healthy nutritional contents. The reviews aren't bad either. When I opened the first pouch, I first noticed that it had a strong smell, and the smell was not of chicken. Being the hungry adventurous eater that I am, I consumed the whole pouch. The texture and appearance are actually not bad for chicken-in-a-bag, and it was satisfying going down. However I couldn't get over how odd the smell was - it smelled exactly like tuna. Also, the meat is cut into little cubes that smush easily so the texture actually tastes pretty similar to tuna as well. I thought I had gone crazy. I had to examine fibers to be sure it wasn't an error at the packaging plant that gave me tuna instead of chicken. When I gave two friends the sniff test with other pouches, they both said they smell tuna. Overall, this is not a huge problem because I like tuna, I may even make a chicken/tuna salad out of it, but I believe someone who hates tuna would find this product intolerable.
