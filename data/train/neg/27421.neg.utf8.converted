I bought the 5 pack for a two year old rat terrier. After a few sniffs he refused to eat one bite. I offered it to two beagles and neither would eat a bite. A large poodle Took a bite and tried to spit it out. Two othe neighborhood dogs would not eat any of it.  I bought twenty two pounds because of the good reviews and the free shipping. I will give the other four bags to the SPCA. Maybe there is a dog somewhere that is hungry enough to eat it.
