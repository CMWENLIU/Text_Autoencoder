I bought these because I was hosting a baby shower for my sister. My daughter, my daughter's friend and I were making cake pops for the event.  I bought these because they were the least expensive and I thought that they would be comparable to other name brands.  edible pens are edible pens, right?  Wrong! We made 60 baby themed cake pops and we needed these pens to draw the eyes, hair and cheeks on the "babies."  My daughter and her friend were practically cursing these pens before the night was over.  The black marker held up a little better that the rest, but the other colors were not good at all.  They smeared everywhere after a while.  The tips were not the best.  It was almost like they could not handle the interaction with the chocolate.  They got the job done, but barely.  Next time, I would add a little money to my purchase and get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020ZURDI">Americolor Food Marker Writers- 10 Color Pack</a>.  I have heard nothing but good things about these pens, and plus they are the ones that Bakerella uses and recommends on her cake pops. :)
