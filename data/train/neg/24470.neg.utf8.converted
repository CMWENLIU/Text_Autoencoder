This tea has been our favorite green tea for years.  According to the manufacturer, Hain Celestial, the ingredients have recently changed.  They removed the hibiscus.  Be warned, the tea is now yellow-green and tastes awful.  The box and ingredients list have not changed.  We are stuck with 2 cases that we can't return to Amazon.
