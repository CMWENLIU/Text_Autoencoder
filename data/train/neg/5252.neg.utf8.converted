While in China, I had everything from the cheap tea to the much more expensive high quality leaves. This tea isn't even on the scale, as it appears the quality is below what people in China would buy for the cheapest price at a local supermarket. To begin with, the tea is chopped or broken up into something resembling large flakes of fish food. (Note: it does not resemble the picture of the tea leaves shown on the product page at all.) Second, because of this condition, the tea has an overall powdery and dry character to it. Now, maybe you will say, "But what about the taste? Maybe it tastes just the same..." No, it doesn't. It is basically tasteless and bland, the opposite of high quality green tea in this style. The best quality green tea leaves in this style are small and bright green. When steeped, they give a fresh and vegetal flavor with all sorts of subtlety and deliciousness. This tea has none of those qualities. In summary: this tea is not good, and especially for the price. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it. In China, I doubt even poor people would drink this tea, which makes me sad to say since I bought it. :-(<br /><br />Foojoy's Longjing in teabags is infinitely superior to this tea, and is a real Longjing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V1Q7I">Foojoy Lungching (Dragonwell) Green Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags</a>
