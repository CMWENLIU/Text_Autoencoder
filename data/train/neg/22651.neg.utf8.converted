I ordered these kabobs for my very picky Havanese. I used them as his special bedtime treat (after teeth brushing).  The kabobs in the first six bags I ordered looked just like the picture (like chicken treats wrapped around a stick) and my dog loved them.  The sticks in the first two batches were about 4 inches long and I broke the treats in half.  I just received my third batch of three bags.  They look horrible and nothing like the picture (in fact they don't even look like chicken!).  The sticks are about 2 to 2-1/2 inches long (not long enough to break).  My dog turned his nose up at what used to be his very favorite bedtime treat.  What makes it worse, is that when I read the description on the bag, there's a warning to wash your hands after handling and something about the treats being exposed to radiation for your safety.  I have no idea what that means, but safety and radiation in the same sentence seems contradictory to me and a bit scary, and of course I don't have the bags from the first orders to compare to this most recent order.  I will not order these treats again.  What a shame.
