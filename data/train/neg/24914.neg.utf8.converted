I love boiled peanuts and have tried a few brands but this one is by far the worst.  Most of the peanuts were soggy or empty.  Also, very small.  I wont order these again.  If on Amazon, I recommend these: http://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Holmes-Green-Boiled-Peanuts/dp/B001YXO0EO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325488826&sr=8-1
