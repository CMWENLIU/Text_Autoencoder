I have purchased items from Fantastic Foods before and I love all of their products.  Easy to make for quick meals and they taste great.  I was very excited to see that Amazon.com has these items in bulk so I purchased a few.  All products arrived in great condition except the Vegetarian Chili Mix arrived in a bag and not a box like the other items and it is NOT 10 lbs.  Judging by the size of it compared to the other items, it weighs around 5 lbs.  Amazon.com customer service is sending a replacement, hopefully it will be the right size.
