The reason I gave this only 2 stars is not because of the taste. It tastes great! I actually had this at a restaurant for the first time, which is what prompted me to find it online and buy it.<br /><br />But, almost every ingredient is artificial. Hardly anything about this product is something I would willingly put into my body on a regular basis. It's a powdery mix when you open it and pour one scoup into a cup of hot water. It makes you wonder where the tea actually is.<br /><br />I don't recommend this highly processed, chemically manufactured, mostly artificial ingredients, product to anyone. Unless you just don't care what you put into your bodies and just want it for the taste.
