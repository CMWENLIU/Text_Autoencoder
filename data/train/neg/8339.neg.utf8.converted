I was very excited to receive arctic zero but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.  I completely agree with another reviewer that said it tastes like a frozen protein shake...which isnt bad mind you but not worth the price in my opinion.  I am not interested in eating the pints right from the freezer with a spoon but they  do make a tasty breakfast when mixed with shake mix ins like fruit, milk, ice, cocoa, pb2 etc.  Its not offensive at all, just not delicious and yummy.  I like large portions and I'm health conscious ..so the volumetrics way of eating appeals to me... but in this case, I'd rather have a 1/2 cup of light ice cream than a pint of arctic zero.  Great concept but I will never crave it.  Unlikely I would buy again.  Sorry. BTW I never wrote an Amazon review before but I felt compelled to do so.
