I tried this food for about 6 days.  The first day our elderly cat began to throw-up.  At first I thought it was just a coincidence since he is so fragile.  I stopped giving him this food and with tummy meds he got better.  By the 4th day, more cats were sick.  By the 6th day, all 4 young healthy cats were sick.  I stopped feeding this and went back to Iams.  All were better overnight.  This has happened to my cats before with "generic" brand foods.  I thought this food would be good because of the supposed quality of ingredients.  No so.
