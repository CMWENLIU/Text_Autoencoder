I'm trying to find coffee I can order over the internet for a reasonable price.  The cost for shipping is usually the problem, so added it on to another order to get it shipped free.  The other order came in good time.  It took the coffee close to a month before it arrived.  It tasted like it'd been sitting in a warehouse the whole time; definitely not fresh.  The roast was also not dark enough for espresso.  Poor delivery, poor product.  This was not my usual Amazon experience.
