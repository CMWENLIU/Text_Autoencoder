Item uses artificial flavor. Description was misleading in that it strongly implies that the product is natural by using phrases such as "without artificial colours or preservatives" while neglecting to mention other artificial ingredients (namely flavoring). I never use products that contain artificial ingredients; I want my recipes prepared by cooks, not by chemists. If that's not important to you then you may like this product.
