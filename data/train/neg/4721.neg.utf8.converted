We followed all the instructions and did not freeze the bread.  Once we opend a loaf we refrigerated it.  A day or two after opening a loaf the bread went moldy. This happened to two loaves.  Because of this I would not buy it again.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK9XQ6">Ener-G Brown Rice Loaf Gluten and Wheat Free -- 16 oz</a>
