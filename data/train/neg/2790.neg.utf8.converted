Let me start by saying that I am NOT a person that ever reviews anything. If I dislike something, I throw it away and use it as a learning experience. With that being said, I must also say that I am a HUGE lover of everything Zevia and anything related. Every single Zevia product that I've tried, I've LOVED! That is until Dr. Zevia. I am an avid lover of anything cherry and anything Dr. Pepper related. I was so excited when my case of Dr Zevia arrived that I ran inside, opened the box and immediately opened one. This is when I gagged LOL! It is soooooooooo similar to robatussin that it's nauseating. I thought that maybe it would get better if it was super cold, no it actually got worse. I have 23 cans of Dr. Zevia that I have NO idea what to do with lol. It might be good in a milkshake or in some sort of food as a flavor enhancer but it definitely isn't a great soda.
