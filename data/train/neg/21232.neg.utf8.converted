I've tried many of the Hodgson Mill bread mixes, and this is my least favorite. This mix does not rise the way I'd like a mix like this to rise. At first, I thought maybe I got a bad batch of yeast, so I tried using my own (which I know is good) with the same results. It's almost as dense as a low gluten bread (like the Barley mix), which I was not expecting with this one. Their Caraway Rye mix has the same protein content, but rises much better than this one. I may try it one more time to see if I got a bad batch. To be edited later.
