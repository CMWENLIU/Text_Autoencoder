After Taza's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L9WI76">guajillo-chili chocolate</a> seduced me with its rich and complex flavor, I assumed that Taza's other improbable combinations would work equally well. As a result, this disappointed me even more than if it had been by initial introduction to Taza chocolates. The chocolate/salt mix didn't do it for me, the almond flavor didn't really come through, and the rich darkness of my first Taza experience gave way to a paler, poorer chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I'll go back to the guajillo flavor any day, and I'm still interested in the other Taza flavors. After this discoragement, though, I'll approach them more cautiously.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
