I received a 7 pod aero garden a couple years ago as a Christmas gift.  For 2 years I really liked it.  I had fresh herbs all winter long it was great.  Then last Christmas I received more seeds to plant.  I got the seeds all ready and plugged in the Aero garden.  It was broke and unfixable and the warranity had run out.  I really would like another one but it is not worth the money for just 2 years.
