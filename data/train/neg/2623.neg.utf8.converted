You will only receive one box of taco shells. In the box is a count of 12. Do not believe the list price or the great sale price or how much the shipment weighs. All of them are wrong. You will end up paying $8.01 for one box of taco shells 12 in the box. This ad should be removed for being soooo miss leading. Who would pay $38.40 for one box of taco shells but that is the list price? What box of taco shells weighs 5.9 pounds but that is what the product details states? In the reviews it is mentioned that you receive 144 taco shells. Add it all up and the ad leads you to believe that you will receive 12 boxes of taco shells. You will NOT.
