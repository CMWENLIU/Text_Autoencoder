One star.  These Apricots aren't dried all the way through.  Some of them were fine, but others were wet inside and tasted off.  They gave me a stomach ache and the runs.  They were even stored in the refrigerator after opening.  I ended up throwing out the rest of the first package.  I thought I just had gotten a bad batch.  When I went to open the second bag, I noticed that two of the remaining bags (out of the 6 pack) were fat with air - like they could explode eventually.  That is bacteria inside giving off their gaseous byproduct.  If you've ever seen a can of food that wasn't properly canned, you'll know what I mean.  They can rupture.  I threw out the remaining bags because Amazon only has a thirty day return policy.  Don't waste your money!  There are better dried fruits out there that won't make you sick.
