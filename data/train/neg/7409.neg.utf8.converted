Since Senseo pods are impossible to find, I thought I would give these a try.  Using one pod was like drinking hot water with a coffe colored tint.  Using two pods was marginally  better, but still did not yield a fuller flavor/robust cup of coffee.  I cannot recommend unless you like watery weak coffee.
