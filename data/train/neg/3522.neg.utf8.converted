This sounded SO good I ordered a double box. It is bitter, doesn't taste anything like chocolate, much less glazed donut. It has a TEENY bit of aroma of chocolate glazed donut but all those sweet vibrations get blasted right into the dark zone the MOMENT your tongue touches this coffee ... hard to explain how awful it is. I thought maybe it was just me but my husband actually came after me wanting to know what was wrong with that coffee ... I packed it up the same day and sent it back.<br /><br />Just don't buy it, that's all I have to say.
