Personally, I have read too much and heard too many news reports about the lack of valid oversight in China when it comes to the health and safety of their products and ingredients (from medicines to food to children's toys...) for me to be comfortable with their products. This is a personal decision because for me, health is paramount in life.<br /><br />Here is part of an email I received from Xlear about their products in answer to my questions about the origin of their products:<br /><br />"Good Afternoon,<br /><br />The raw Xylitol comes from China, shipped to Orem, UT and that is where we make the Xlear Nasal Spray.  Our Gum, Mints and Candies are all made in China. The rest of our products are made here in the states.  I hope that was the information you were looking for. Have a nice day!<br /><br />Xlear Inc."<br /><br />I find this especially troubling because the nasal spray has a big red, white and blue shield that says "Made in the USA." So all the ingredients come from China and are put together in Utah. Can this really be legal? To say "Made in the USA" when all the ingredients are from China?<br /><br />If it is 'legal' to say this (yes, we have big problems with our own FDA)...it is still unethical in my opinion. Deceptive, misleading. Sigh...American business and politics. Maybe we should all just move to China. And get jobs in their factories.
