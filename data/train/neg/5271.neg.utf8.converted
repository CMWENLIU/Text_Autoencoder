I threw out the Natural Balance dog food I had on hand (both the vegetarian and bison/sweet potato formulas)and won't be buying any more after reading complaints on ConsumerAffairs.com website regarding pets that died after eating tainted Natural Balance. A very disturbing aspect is that the company did not recall any of their pet food or even admit the problem even though they were notified multiple pets died or became very ill (with similar symptoms) quite suddenly and soon after eating the product. No more Natural Balance for my dog.
