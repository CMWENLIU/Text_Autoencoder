This product tastes good.  It is technically sugar free, but what it uses effects blood glucose.  It is in no way 0 net carb.  They use maltitol, which has 75% the glucose absorbtion of sugar.  This means, it isn't zero net carbs, but that the 9 carbs per serving are absorbed by the body as 6.75 net carbs.  If you are doing a low carb diet, 6.75 carbs is a lot.  That is fraud, and it isn't okay.  Stay away from this product, it is a lie.
