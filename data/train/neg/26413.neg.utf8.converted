Although, the chocolate was good, and the inside was very creamy; it seemed that every chocolate was Hazelnut-flavored. I was very disapointed in the flavors of this chocolate. Especially after reading such glowing reviews, I was upset recieving something that was decent, but just buying a cheap box of chocolates at the store is just as good. You want delicious chocolates, go for Godiva.
