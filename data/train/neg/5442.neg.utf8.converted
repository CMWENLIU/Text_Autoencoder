The ingredients list on Amazon is incorrect according to the label on the food. I purchased this food through PetFoodDirect, and their website has the same incorrect list, as does the By Nature website itself as of this date (July 17, 2011). The label on the food I bought says that the food also contains pea flour and menadione dimethylpyrimidinol bisulfite (a toxic synthetic vitamin K). I emailed By Nature about this, and received this reply on June 29, 2011 from Ray Devone, Customer Service Coordinator, Kent Nutrition Group:<br /><br />"Thank you for calling these apparent discrepancies to our attention! There has never been Menadione in any of our foods. In fact, we printed labels listing this ingredient and decided to forgo adding this controversial supplement to our foods - after the labels went to print. Obviously, we have not run out of this first printing of labels yet - and I have asked that we put a 'blip' somewhere with words to  that effect.  We did indeed switch from the controversial gums and carrageenan to pea flour and I have further asked that we update websites, as well as labels for accuracy sake.  To answer your question:  The pea flour is new; the Menadione never was."<br /><br />The label on the food also lists guar gum and locust bean gum, so I'm not sure what controversial gums the pea flour replaced.<br /><br />Anyway, if your cats don't like pea flour (mine don't) or you're looking for a low-carbohydrate food, avoid By Nature Organics Chicken & Chicken Liver canned cat food.<br /><br />Truth in labeling matters.
