Great concept, especially since all my local groceries have stopped stocking the Senseo pods in favor of more K-cups.  These do NOT fit the filter holder of the Hamilton Beach Personal Cup machines.  My son, the teenage engineer, attempted to modify one by trimming the rim down; now it almost fits.  I do NOT recommend this product if you have the Hamilton Beach.
