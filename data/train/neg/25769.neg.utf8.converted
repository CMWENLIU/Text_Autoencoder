This was a Godsend a few years back; today, the dispenser fails in two ways:<br /><br />1) the dispenser will fall apart one time in three<br />2) the dispenser will not dispense properly: what used to last for 5 minutes of spray will now take 1/2 an hour for the the bottle to get to 1/2 empty, and try as you might, you'll never get the last 1/4 out<br /><br />Not only does it not dispense, it does not kill mosquitoes any longer, even if I use my Ortho Dial-n-Spray to dispense it.<br />Why does it no longer kill mosquitoes?<br />Because they changed the formula.<br />It used to be 2.5% permethrin; today it's 0.16% Lambda-Cyhalothrin (brand name Cyonara)<br /><br />My father in law shares the same disappointment; he loved it when I introduced him to it, but now he can no longer use his yard after a record rainfall in NY and a bumper crop of mosquitoes.
