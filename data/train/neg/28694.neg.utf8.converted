That's right bleech, like you wanted to get it out of your mouth as fast as possible:<br /><br />I do not like green eggs and spam<br />I do not like it sam-i-am<br />I'd rather eat my athletic sox<br />Than eat this Picnic-in-a box<br /><br />Now:<br /><br />Salmon, not bad if your starving on a desert island  1 star<br /><br />Edamame, bad no matter where you eat it especially if your not near a water source  0 star<br /><br />Crackers, good but how can you ruin crackers  4 star<br /><br />Chocolate, actually pretty good (but you have to like hard, i mean hard chocolate) 4 star<br /><br />Fruit&Nut Mix was the best of the bunch, truly enjoyable  5 star<br /><br />So:<br /><br />Why two overall, I'm being nice.  Since the main part of the meal was the salmon and the edamame how else would you rate it.<br /><br />Anyone want four free boxes?<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
