Based on what other people wrote I thought sure I'd like this.  I was wrong!  The pasta itself is good, but the cheese powder was so incredibly salty I threw most of the finished mac and cheese away.  Now, faced with the other eleven boxes my only option seems to be use the pasta and part of the cheese powder, add my own cheese to the mix and hope it turns out ok.  Which will make the whole thing much less convenient and one whale of a lot more costly!<br /><br />Hodgson Mill usually makes good stuff and this is a real disappointment.
