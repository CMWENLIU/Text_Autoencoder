This is a great deal, in stores around our area it retails for around $12. I must agree with the other reviews. The chocolate does come melted. It may be during the shipping process but this all could have been eliminated by proper shipping and packing. And also to confirm with the other review...there are LOTS of Whoppers. Those things are disgusting, they make up about half of the bag.
