I was so excited by the possibilities of ordering Lavazza via Amazon. Unfortunately the coffee doesn't measure up to what I'm used to in a Lavazza shop. Granted, this was typically espresso based drinks but this coffee is not accpetable to me even as every day coffee. I'm back to my local fresh roasted beans...most of my six bags will go into storage as emergency coffee for when I run out unexpectedly.
