first time: I ordered this on a whim and so far it has worked out.  I have made it in both the air popper and the presto microwave popper and both come out fine.  I won't say it is the BEST I have even had but I bought some GV at WM that was pretty bad and had to use it up.  Other GV I had bought before wasn't as bad as this last batch.  This is SO much better than that or at least the first bag was.<br /><br />I keep my popcorn in the freezer in a sealed container.  It lasts longer that way - we did it as kids growing up and I have continued to do it.  So when I got the big bag, I put some in a couple of ziploc bags and put the rest in the Rubbermaid container I keep in the freezer door.  I keep a 3 T measuring cup by it and that amount works well fin the microwave popper.<br /><br />Getting 50 lbs at once would be too much for my limited freezer space.  I will stick to this size bag or smaller.<br /><br />I ordered this a second time - it came open - slit on the seal of the bag.  The second bag was STALE so who knows how long it had been open.  Amazon did refund my money for the slit open bag.  The popcorn was BAD and ended up being tossed.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.
