I believe this product is good for the beginner and is helpful however when I received mine the two bottles of vinegar were not sealed properly and the wasabi seal was clearly broken. I do not fault amazon as they quickly provided me with a refund. Other than that i think the product was helpful especially the bamboo mat for rolling the sushi.
