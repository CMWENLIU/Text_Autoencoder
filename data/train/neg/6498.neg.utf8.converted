I've been using various truffle oils for the last twenty years.  After reading some good and some not so good reviews I gave the La Tourangelle a try. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. What a waste of money. And with no refund available an even bigger waste. The oil kind of has a slight truffle aroma. The taste of the oil is pure chemical. Just grosse. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PO7FDU">La Tourangelle Infused White Truffle Oil, 8.45-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>
