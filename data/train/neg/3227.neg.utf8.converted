Marshmallow, chocolate, cookie...put it all together and its a visit to my grannys house as a child. Where she would break out the Mallomars (her favorite) and let us grandkids demolish them in seconds. I would always eat the cookie part first than the squishy marshmallow chocolate hat.<br /><br />So we were looking forward to this box arriving from Amazon, we hadnt had these in years.<br /><br />The anticipation was thick, were they going to be as good as we remembered? would they still smell so sweet and chocolatey? Rustle, Rip, Tear...and .....sad face.<br /><br />All the cookies had seperated from the tops, the chocolate coating the cookies and marshmallows had cracked and separated, turning an ashy brown color. I picked up a cookie and bit into it...stale. I picked up a mallow top hat and the chocolate fell into my lap. The expiration date wasnt past, and they were packaged ok, so I dont understand what went wrong.<br /><br />They were just nasty, and broken and disappointing....more sad face.
