I know that there are divided camps when it comes to whether or not shipping issues should be part of a product review.  I generally think that shipping is a separate concern, but I'm not so sure after this purchase!  I purchased this product from D.M.E. ONLINE SALES INC (AKA Medical Supply Superstore), but it was shipped by Amazon.  When the package arrived, more than a quarter of it had leaked through both the padded manilla envelope and the box it was shipped in, staining the other item in the box (gloves), as well as the outside of the box that was delivered.  I contacted D.M.E. and they said that it was not their responsability because they didn't handle the shipping.  Which I would agree with, except that there was NOTHING wrong with the packaging; upon closer inspection, the lid of the bottle (beneath the safety seal) hadn't been properly screwed on -something that the company definitely OUGHT to take responsability for!  When I emailed the company to explain this, they never responded. In this case the shipping is very important for the review because losing nearly a third of the product before you get it makes this a VERY expensive product!  Better to buy at the local store for a few dollars more -it will still be cheaper!
