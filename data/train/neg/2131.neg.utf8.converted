I ordered a case of Cracker Jacks. I selected this product because it showed as the "old school" packaging and that went well with what my client was looking to do. The product arrived quite late (which meant delivery of custom amenity gifts were late to the client). The packaging was incorrect - not the "old school" design that I ordered - just the regular design. The cracker jacks boxes themselves were crushed and looked terrible. The experation date was a month out (which means the product was quite old because cracker jacks have a long shelf life). The product inside the boxes was so hard and stuck together - wach box had a hard rectangular mass of carmel corn.<br /><br />I did send an email when it was late and the apologized for the late delivery.<br /><br />Terrible order experience overall. I spent a lot of money and now wish I had not.
