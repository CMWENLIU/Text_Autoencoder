Bob's Red Mill sells a few varieties of oatmeal, and the one listed (quick-cooking) is not the one pictured, described, or sold (instant). Indeed, Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Rolled Oats is not the same as Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats. This listing sells the Instant Rolled Oats, yet is titled as Quick Cooking. Some people feel that the Quick Cooking Oats is tastier than Instant, and when they place an order for the former, they don't want to receive the latter. I am deliberately giving this listing a low rating to draw your attention, in case this makes a big difference for you.<br /><br />The product itself is very good, of course, and I would gladly give Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats five stars if only it were the item listed. I urge Nutricity to make corrections to its listing as soon as possible.
