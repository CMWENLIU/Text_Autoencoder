I'm always hesitant to write a negative review because tastes are different but with this product I felt I had a duty to alert consumers.  I bought this and out of the box it was pretty until I looked close and found it was infested with tiny white bugs that clung to nearly every branch and leaf.  I hoped they would die on their own but after three weeks they were still there and the plant itself had started to die.  I bought plant insect spray and they killed the bugs.  The plant died two weeks later.  I was very disappointed since I'd always wanted a bonsai tree and gardenia is my favorite scent.
