I have a sweet tooth for jelly beans every now and then.  And since Jelly Belly jelly beans are among my favorite brands and the price was right, I jumped at the chance to purchase Jelly Belly Belly Flops.  After a couple of handfuls, however, I kind of wished I hadn't.  The printed statements on the bag are correct, but they're more than a "little less perfect": for example,  you get quite a few that have no jelly center and consist entirely of candy coating instead.  Then there are some flavors that, for some reason,  taste like they should have come out of a bag of Harry Potter inspired flavors.  In short, this was not an enjoyable experience and it even turned me off jelly beans for a bit.
