So as a espresso fan, and a Nespresso owner for the last few years, I was excited when I heard about these capsules... but after trying them, I was not impressed. If you just want coffee and don't like it strong and don't pay much attention to the flavor, these should be fine. If good flavor and strength matter... don't buy these.
