This used to be my favorite beverage.  Until recently, I drank Ocean Spray Cranapple juice at least twice a day, and on the weekends I guzzled a glass every breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Then I gained 15 lbs over the summer and wondered how that happened despite sticking to a moderate-to-low fat diet and a rigorous workout regimen.  A cup of Ocean Spray has at least 30 grams of sugar, and that's approximately the same amount in a Snickers candy bar. And not only is it sugar, it's high-fructose corn syrup: very bad if you're health conscious and even worse if you're trying to control your sugar intake. Would YOU eat a Snickers candy bar three to four times a day?  Most wouldn't, but that's the amount of sugar I was consuming on a daily basis.  When I learned how this affected my waistline and fitness goals, I immediately switched over from fruit juices to water and I lost 10 lbs in less than a month.  The truth is, fruit juices are so high in sugar and calories, that they're not that good for you, whether they're vitamin-fortified or not.  You're better off drinking them either in moderation or eliminating them from your diet altogether.
