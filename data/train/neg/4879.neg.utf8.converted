I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight.
