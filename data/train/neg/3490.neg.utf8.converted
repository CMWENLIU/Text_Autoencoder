I wish I knew that the noodles were already cooked. I think it was already cooked...it was soft.  The noodles came in a liquid and smelled like fish.  I soaked it in seasoning and olive oil overnight to get rid of the smell...it did.  I cooked it again and mixed with a white sauce.  I am very picky about food textures, and this was the worst I've ever tried.  It had a rubbery texture and was literally like chewing rubber bands.  I couldn't break it apart after chewing for a while.  I ended up throwing it all out, which was a waste of money.  It should NOT be called a noodle, despite its shape!  It tastes NOTHING like a noodle.
