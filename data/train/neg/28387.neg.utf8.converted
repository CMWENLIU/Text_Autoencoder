Glucose syrup and sulphur dioxide were not ingredients at the time of the crusades.  This might technically be called panforte, but it does not taste good - flavors and spices are lame.  Probably carelessly industry-produced.  I will not be purchasing this again.  Is it even really Italian?  If you've ever eaten it in Italy, panforte is delicious, but this stuff does not even come close.
