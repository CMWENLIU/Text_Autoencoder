This is the first time I bought this product and was really excited to receive it. I absolutely love the aroma of vanilla and use it for everything. It arrived promptly and I expected vanilla heaven, however it does not smell anything like vanilla powder, vanilla beans or vanilla extract. Since I don't really know what it is supposed to smell like, please tell me if this is normal, or my product is spoiled.
