I first tried the biscoff cookies on my way to New Orleans. AirTran was serving these as snacks for the travelers. I liked it so much that I decided to order a family size from the Biscoff company. Unfortunately, when they arrived I noticed that most of the cookies were cracked, chipped, essentially crumbled into pieces. Why wouldn't it be when the cookies were just packed in a weak wrapper/packaging box and had been tossed around during the period of shipment?<br /><br />I'm fairly disappointed that I wasted my money on a bunch of destroyed cookies.
