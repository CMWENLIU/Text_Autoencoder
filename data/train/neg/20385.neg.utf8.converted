I ordered this coffee to have the flavor i remembered from Jamaica....what i got was the mildest hint of the flavor i was looking for.  I even brewed it using extra coffee but still the flavor was missing.  I think this was a ripoff....and what made it worse was that i brought it as a hostess gift.  Will never buy it again.
