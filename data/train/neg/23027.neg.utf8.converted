The stars are misleading... the product itself is excellent, but the care in which it was packaged by Amazon caused the plastic bottles to break in transit.  UPS has a habit of throwing things around, and the top layer of bubble wrap did NOT protect the bottles.  (They should be ENTIRELY wrapped!)  This is the third time we've had to "eat" the cost of a food product that was broken in transit, so we figured we should say something.  The caps broke off, so only two of the six bottles were left with intact caps.  The sealing protector came off of one of the bottles without a cap.  Two bottles were "squished".  I have photos if anyone wants to see! Grrrr!
