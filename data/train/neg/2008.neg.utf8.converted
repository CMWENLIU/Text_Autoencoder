Purchased this because it is was less than 1/2 price of the smaller cans.  It tasted decently, though the other commentors are correct that it tastes very different than the smaller cans - the smaller cans have a much more "clean" flavor.  The color of this can's meat is also different (darker, pinker).<br /><br />But my biggest problem is that there is SO much water in the can.  Really, a lot.  (I think someone else called it "soupy", and that is correct).  I cannot help but think this is deliberate, and it disturbs me; it makes me realize that maybe this company is *not* on our side, after all.<br /><br />So, if you are on the fence, go ahead and get a can.  You won't lose too much, and you can make your own judgement.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Placed my second order and the can is completely DENTED on top/side.  It is mangled.  Since I smell tuna juice, I assume this is unsafe to eat.  UGH, I am so frustrated!  I came back here to Amazon to file a claim, but alas no claim can be made (although I am still within 5 days or order receipt).  I cannot "return" the can, either.  Downgraded my 3 stars to 1, until they get this customer service sorted out  :(  Meanwhile, I have a photo of this mangled can on my phone, I will upload it to the photos for this product shortly.
