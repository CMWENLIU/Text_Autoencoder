Amazon is listing "nutritional info" such as protein, calories, etc., but omitting the actual list of ingredients in these supplements.  I would like to see what I will actually be eating should I use these, and that info is not available here.<br /><br />Note: the "1 star" awarded in this review does not reflect on this specific product, of which I have no firsthand knowledge.  It's just that I couldn't post this review without choosing 1 to 5 stars.
