It's probably my fault for being hungry at the time.<br /><br />I was really there to buy coffee. I mean, real robust stuff that would send me ricocheting like a tracer round. But...I'll admit that when I saw the words "Golden French Toast," I immediately conjured up a brisk morning, blessed with the freshly-grilled glory of hot french toast drowned in a viscous flood of rich maple syrup. Mmm mm. Salivary glands, activate.<br /><br />I should have known that french toast had nothing to do with coffee, except for maybe they're ordered together at the local diner. But the words just sounded so good. So enticing that within seconds I had a box in my arms, ready to ring up.<br /><br />I'll tell you though, after popping one of these K-Cups in my B60, disappointment drowned my dreams as much as the diluted, dull flavor that doused my mouth.<br /><br />Yes, my java-jousting friends, "Golden French Toast" is far from golden. Instead, it's like a day-old slab of soggy old toast with syrup, poured over with watery coffee, then mashed together and run through a strainer. What you drink may be slightly recognizable, but then after that unsavory swallow, you may wonder why you bothered trying a coffee that tries to taste like food.<br /><br />All I can say is, if you want Golden French Toast, then make some. Just not in a coffeemaker.
