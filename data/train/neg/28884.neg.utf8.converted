I fed this to my cats (I have 33) and I started having MAJOR problems with urinary infections and blockages from crystals with several male and female cats. I traced it back to the food and found that 1) fish is bad news for cats because of the high mineral content and 2)on top of that Sweet Potatoes are also really bad as they contain a high level of oxalates. People who have bladder and kidney problems due to stones are advised not to eat sweet potatoes so I am going to assume that that is true for cats. Sweet potatoes and herring are not foods a cat would eat in the wild anyway. Bottom line stay away from this food, urinary blockages are serious and your cat can die within 48 hours without expensive intervention (like thousands of dollars expensive). Since I switched foods 6 months ago I haven't had the problem again.
