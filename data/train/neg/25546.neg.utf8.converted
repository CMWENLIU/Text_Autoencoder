I have had mate de coca in recent travels and enjoyed the fact that it gave me energy without messing with any of my other systems as caffeine often does.  There are a few things you'll notice when drinking real mate de coca.  The initial most obvious effect is the slight numbing sensation you experience in your mouth when you take a sip.<br /><br />I recently ordered this product and it has failed to have the same effect that true mate de coca has.  This leads me to believe that this is not real mate de coca.  I'm not sure if this is because this particular re seller decides not to sell the real thing, or if it's because the actual product apparently has some ambiguous legal issues here in the US which forces the real thing to be stripped of the elements which stimulate alertness.  As far as my reading is concerned coca tea is in fact legal in the US, although it seems as if that may not always be the case.
