So I've really liked this product -- basically using it almost every day. However, I'm noticing that whatever silver coating is used in the water tank is coming off. Has anyone else noticed this? It's a huge concern to me as I thought I was beginning to see silver particles in the food. Until I sort this out, I have to give 1 star for safety concerns.
