Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually "NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural.<br />I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it.
