I found this product to be quite displeasing. It's very bitter and tastes of unripe fruit; think "green." That is the only flavor, nuance or otherwise, I could taste. It also caused a formidable burning sensation in my throat. To this product's credit however, its viscosity and mouthfeel are among the best I've tried.<br /><br />I am a true lover of olive oil, and use it nearly everyday. Often, I'll just have a spoonful by itself. I like to try all brands I find, as I enjoy the variety of tastes and textures. To me, this product didn't even taste like olive oil.<br /><br />Since I bought it at Wal-Mart, it might be safe to assume this product was mis-handled during shipment. The packaging date is nearly a year ago, even though I purchased it last weekend. I may try another bottle, at another time, purchased from a reputable grocer.
