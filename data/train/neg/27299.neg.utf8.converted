UPDATE: Diane Sawyer of ABC World News Tonight did a whole segment on this and identified Nature's One as the formula tested. Dr Richard Besser, Chief Health and Medical Editor says that with "infants and children, and developing brains and bodies, doctors simply do not know what levels of arsenic are safe... there are currently no standards in place today". He also addresses Nature One's response. Andrea Rock of Consumers reports also weighs in on this news story. See comments section for all links.<br /><br />This the original article, published by Environmental Health Perspectives.

According to the Today show, "Two of the infant formulas contained organic brown rice syrup as their primary ingredient. These products had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times that of the other infant formulas.. The amount of arsenic consumed by an infant could be significant depending on which formula they drank.. arsenic exposure early in life may increase the risk for health problems later on."<br /><br />The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, indicates that organic infant milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had total concentrations up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit.<br /><br />The formulas tested were not named but a quick search turned up that Baby's Only organic toddler formula - both dairy and soy - uses brown rice syrup as its main source of carbohydrate. I for one will be passing on this product.
