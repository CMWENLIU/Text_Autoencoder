Shipping is way overpriced for this item.  I can get a similar product at efooddepot for a flat $4.99 no matter how many bags I order.  Here I get charged for each bag, even though they will go in the same shipment.  I think they should revisit their shipping charge mechanism.  I placed an order for 6, and the shipping turned out to be $15.99.  I just looked at the shipping tracker and it says it will take almost two months to get to me via USPS.  Doesn't sound like priority shipping to me, so they are making a bundle from shipping.  I'm waiting to see if they appropriately bundle my order, and if they do, I will return with a positive review on how well they manage their shipping prices.
