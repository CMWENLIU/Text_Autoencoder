in that my bags don't break down at all.  I put them in my compost pile each week but over time (approaching 9 months since I put the first bag in) I've ended up with a compost pile consisting of about 40 intact bags - like having 40 separate compost piles.  I actually had to take the waste out of each bag and mix everything then throw out the bags themselves in the garbage.  I'll just get normal small trash bags at this point and empty the waste out of those each week.  That's what I've ended up doing with the "compostable" bags but at a lot higher price.<br />I wished they worked ...
