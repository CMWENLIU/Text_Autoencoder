I'm a bit disappointed in this product.  We do have a moth problem and since we have dogs and cats who don't think twice about anything that looks edible, I really didn't want to deal with smelly and possibly toxic solutions.<br /><br />I used one trap each in two closets.  They've been in there for three weeks now.  One trap has one dead moth in it.  The other trap has three.  That just doesn't do enough of the job to take care of the problem.
