I really liked this Hazelnut coffee when it was sold in canisters as I can take exact qty I want for my cup and it was more or less reasonably priced.<br />Now this one is exact opposite - I can NOT take exact qty I want for my cup and it is NOT reasonably priced.<br />So knowing that it can't compete with their previous (canister) version they just discontinued canisters.<br />DO NOT BUY IT - unless you want to encourage corporate greed and arrogance by Nescafe.<br />Tasters Choice is well on its way to join a list of brands destroyed by greed and stupidity.
