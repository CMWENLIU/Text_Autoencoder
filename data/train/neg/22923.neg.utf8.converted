I saw this at my local grocer and I love deep dish pizzas so I just had to buy this one.<br />I followed the directions to a tee and sadly........the heavy hulking pizza turned out to be a major turd.<br />The crust is way too hard around the edges and the inside of the crust...well have you ever eaten dough that felt like it started to expand in your stomach?<br />Ewww.<br />The sausage tasted like mouse droppings, the sauce was ok but nothing remarkable.<br />The only good thing was the cheese and really?<br />How hard is it to mess up the cheese?<br />All in all I don't recommend this pizza it doesn't cook right even when following the direction word for word.<br />If you want a good frozen deep dish nothing beats Davanni's.<br />For what you're paying you should expect a product that's........you know........EDIBLE.<br />You won't get that here.........unless you like rock hard crust with mouse poop sausage.<br />Not recommended.
