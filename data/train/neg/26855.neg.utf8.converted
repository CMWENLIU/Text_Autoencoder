This is the third stevia sweetener I have tried so I will compare it to those.  I have used NOW Stevia, and Truvia.<br /><br />This tastes the same as Truvia, which you can buy in the grocery store.  It is less bitter than NOW Stevia.<br /><br />What bugs me is this - it is labeled as "stevia" but the first ingredient is agave inulin, which is a fiber product.  Second ingredient listed is stevia extract.  And the last ingredient is silica.  I looked up silica - it is that grainy stuff in little packets they package with electronics - the packets labeled DO NOT EAT.  I read that silica is not actually toxic but that doesn't mean I want to eat it.  Stevia by itself is prone to caking, so I guess the silica is to prevent that from happening.<br /><br />If you are ok with eating silica, this is a tasty sugar substitute.  If you are trying to be healthy and keep weird things out of your diet, I'd suggest you pass.
