Not only does this baking mix contain fructose and turbinado sugar (where is the 'low carb' in those?), it tastes horrible. It is bitter with a very strange texture.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to make, but the results are less than appetizing. It was definitely a mistake on my part to order this on Amazon, since I was only able to purchase in bulk.<br /><br />This is definitely something to avoid if you have Type 1 diabetes. The carbohydrate count is grossly understated and will shoot your blood glucose numbers through the roof.
