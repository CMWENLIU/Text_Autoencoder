I bought this product for my son who is on the Feingold diet and has very bad reactions to artificial colors.  I used it in May to make his birthday cake, luckily he wanted a "stealth bomber that blended with the sky" (he's very particular with his demands, I try to please) which required most of the cake to be sky blue.  These colors will give you nice pastels, but if you are looking for a very rich color, you will not get it from this product, no matter how much color you use.  The cake came out great, and I used the red to do the lettering which came out a nice darkish magenta, and was pleased with the kit in general.  I justified the expense since it was really the only option I could find, the cake came out beautiful, and it worked for my purposes.  Here I am 6 months later, trying to do Halloween cookies (wanted to make orange) and the red is now an ugly brown...the colors are expired.  (Shaking my head, well...they are natural, things in nature do go bad! duh)  So unless you own a natural bakery and are cranking out baked goods weekly and going through this product pretty quickly, its not worth the price.
