I have tried dozens of these packets of snacks over the past 3 years.  Various flavors from various lots.  Some of them a while back tasted fine.  Lately, all I get are ones with a bitter, rancid taste.  Especially on the Friends variety.  Does "all natural" mean "High in THC"?<br />What is up with that sharp nasty taste?  These things aren't expired.  I've communicated with Annie's on numerous occasions and have always recieved coupons for more, but I've given up on ever finding another lot of this product that doesn't taste gross.  My kids won't even eat them anymore.  Its like they are all rancid or something.
