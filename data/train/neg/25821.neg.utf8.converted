my chihuahua mix has renal failure because of these treats.  Here is an FDA warning:<br />The Food and Drug Administration is cautioning consumers of a potential association between development of illness in dogs and the consumption of chicken jerky products also described as chicken tenders, strips or treats.  FDA has received more than 70 complaints involving more than 95 dogs that experienced illness that their owners associated with consumption of chicken jerky products.<br /><br />Please DO NOT GIVE THESE TO YOUR DOGS.<br /><br />I don't know if my dog is going to live.
