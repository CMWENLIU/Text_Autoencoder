When this product became a "Helper Complete Meal" instead of just a regular "Complete Meal", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not "Alfredo" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere. The mexican-style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise, for the same price.
