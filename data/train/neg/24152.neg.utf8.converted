This was really one of the worst purchases I have made online. The fruit would not ripen and finally had to be discarded. The photos are lovely and the description "Guavas have a subtle and floral flavor with sweet and sour undertones. Soft and creamy when ripe, Guavas have a fully edible rind and small seeds that are edible too. No one can resist its rare and irresistible floral aroma. One bite will transport you to a tropical paradise. " was really enticing.<br /><br />Sadly, not only was I not transported to the tropical paradise, no floral aroma and certainly not creamy they never ripened.<br /><br />Of course, had the fruit ripened I would have enjoyed the delightful fragrance that only Guava can give and would have relished every bite.
