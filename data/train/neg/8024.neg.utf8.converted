Good green tea has a subtle, fresh, "green" flavor that's hard to describe.  It's fresh and light, and some describe it as "grassy." This tea is OK, but it has an undertone that is a little off for me. Maybe because it's decaf.  I've tried several brands of green decaf, and none are good.  Maybe green tea just doesn't lend itself to decaffeinating.  I rated this one two stars because I didn't hate it, as one star denotes, but didn't like it much either.  I'm partial to regular (caffeinated) Japanese green teas, and the genuine ones are the best.
