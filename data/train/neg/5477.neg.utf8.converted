I started running a couple years ago, and I ran my first marathon last year.  I always carry PowerGel with me on my long runs.  Yes PowerGel is just sugar and caffine, but when I'm bonking 15 miles into a 20 mile run, I am super glad I have one in my pocket.  I think the benefit comes mainly from the sugar, but I do tend to buy the flavors with 25mg of caffine.  In general I give PowerGel 4 to 5 stars, but I'm giving the Tangerine flavor two stars because I didn't like the taste.  All the other flavors are much better.
