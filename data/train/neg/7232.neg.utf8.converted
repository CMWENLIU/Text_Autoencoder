Cafe Bustelo releases a stale, pungent aroma when the can's seal is broken: you are forewarned by an odor reminiscent of Maxwell House or perhaps Folger's that has been ground together with cigarette butts.  Draw a demitasse of espresso and you can either 1) dissolve the enamel off your teeth by drinking it or 2) water it down to Americano strength where it will merely taunt you, daring you to drink it even when you know you shouldn't.  This is honestly the worst espresso I've ever tasted.  No body, excessive acidity and bitterness, unpleasant chemical aftertaste.  Yes, it's cheap - but the more important question is: are you?
