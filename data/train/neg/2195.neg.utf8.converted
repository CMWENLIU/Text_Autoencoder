First, I would give this bulb 5 stars if the description was correct, and will happily change my rating if that is fixed! The problem is that these are not "super mini" bulbs. Earthmate does make a 2700K super mini bulb that is 4.6" long, but the only 23W full-spectrum bulb they list, at 5" long, is this one. (The actual model number for this bulb is E2357AE on their website, which matches the individual units of the 6-pack.)<br /><br />These bulbs are fairly pricey compared to the average 23 watt full-spectrum bulb, and I paid the extra money partially based on the assumption that these would be smaller.<br /><br />Now, on to actually reviewing the product! The bulbs are average sized, and should fit in most lamps and fixtures; however, I did have one fixture where they were just a bit too long to fit. The brightness and coloration are excellent; they seem to put out a bit more light than other 23W full-spectrum bulbs I have. The CRI is 88; not the highest around but very good. The light is extremely close to my ALZO bulbs, which are still my favorite full-spectrum bulbs (other than the fact that they're huge and don't fit in most things!) The bulbs turn on to a fairly decent brightness and fully warm up very quickly. I've noticed zero buzzing or flickering.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are the best 23W full-spectrum bulbs I've tried that are "normal" sized, which is the only thing that kept me from just returning the 5-pack despite the size issue. (Yes, 5-pack, since one of my bulbs was DOA. Amazon was nice enough to offer a partial refund for that bulb, which I decided was better than shipping all six bulbs back and forth.) They're also a bit expensive as noted; the price would be more in line if they were actually smaller as claimed.<br /><br />(I did contact Amazon with links to the manufacturer's information in hopes that they fix the description and/or stock actual "super mini" bulbs, assuming Earthmate actually makes them in a full-spectrum version! I would love to have this product in a smaller version, if it exists...)<br /><br />Sep 7 edit: Down to 4 working bulbs after having these bulbs in for 4 days. :( The one that just died was in a fixture paired with another of the same... I'm going to give them another couple weeks and see if any more die before I decide whether to return them or have them all replaced. It's possible it was shipping damage since the outer box arrived crushed (though the product box was fine), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Oct 4 edit: I had the bulbs replaced a couple weeks ago. Whoever packed them wasn't too bright, since he or she just stuck a FedEx label on the product box without any extra packaging! Not cool for shipping light bulbs, Amazon. Only 4 bulbs arrived working, certainly due to shipping damage this time. Fortunately Amazon told me to do whatever with the first shipment rather than return it, so I have 8 working bulbs now, which I can't complain about since no more have died since then. (Of course, they're still not "super mini" as listed, so my review remains at 2 stars instead of 5.)
