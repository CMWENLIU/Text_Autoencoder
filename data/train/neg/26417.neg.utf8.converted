I used to love eating butter with everything until my dad had heart surgery and therefore, we only cook and eat food with butter substitute. I do feel that the food taste the same with or without butter buds. I often end up using more than the recipe requires just to get a hint of the taste.  I am not saying this is terrible as it does provide some flavoring after using a lot of product but I wish it was better. However, I am quite pleased that there is no fat or cholesterol regardless of however much I use which is something that real butter or almost all butter imitations can never achieve. My advice: use it if you absolutely must (such as in the case of my dad) but don't expect the same flavor as butter because there is slight taste to these which is nowhere near the real taste of butter.
