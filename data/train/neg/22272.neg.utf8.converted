Well, I'm now truly 'Ratch free.<br /><br />And all I have to say is, "Wow.  I never thought it would happen to me."  I can't believe what's all happened since I was found face-down in the grocery store aisle with a half-full bottle of Sriracha stuck up one nostril and and the other half the bottle dribbling out the other nostril.<br /><br />Worse, my mouth was stuffed full of sirloin tip samples that I - at least this is what I'm told - wrenched from the Sample Lady at the condiment end-cap.  Evidently, I saw how she dabbed her meat bites in a little plastic cup of house-brand barbeque sauce and the rest...is...my shame.<br /><br />The scene I made wasn't pretty. Suffice it to state, 22 people had Sriracha stains on their shirts and...that bottle stuck up my nose?  It was actually the third bottle I abused - the first one  used to drown the sample tray of steak tips and the second...well, I drank it like a little kid drinking Kool-aid on a hot day.<br /><br />My rage-filled rampage against the condiment companies and purveyors of flavorlessness saw no bounds.  I have a hazy memory of running stiff-armed, along an entire row of catsup bottles cascading them onto the linoleum.  The dull thuds of taught red plastic bouncing off the floor still haunts my dreams...<br /><br />Somewhere in the moments that followed, I found a frozen salmon and used it to knock out whole sections of Mexican, Italian, Chinese and fake Wasabi sauces into space - bang!  bang!  bang!  I laughed maniacally whenever the obscenely expensive jars of boutique blech cracked two, three, four aisles away.<br /><br />By then the local news had showed up - virtually none of my howl against the Jalepeno Junta was fit for broadcast.<br /><br />Anyway, I woke up at the Scandinavian Cuisine Sanitarium two days later knowing that I could never touch Sriracha Sauce again.  But the facts were much harsher - I didn't have a choice.  That day, the judge signed the orders authorizing involuntary tastebudechtomy.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, I won't be eating Sriracha any more.  I have a heck of a bill to work off at the Food Mart.<br /><br />Stick to Catsup.
