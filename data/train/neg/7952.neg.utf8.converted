This coffee is bitter, has a nasty bite! It doesn't brew up very strong, either (I use a coffee press). I'm used to Sumatra roasted dark. This is medium roasted. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because of the organic/ fair trade/ shade grown and also...well, at least the beans didn't taste burned.
