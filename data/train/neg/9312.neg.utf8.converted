I thought I would give this one a try as I usually order Timothy's French Vanilla. I thought I would get a much richer vanilla flavor due to the "supreme" on the label. I was disappointed. I has quite a nice aroma but the taste was lacking. There was a bitter after taste. I tried three separate cups...each having that strange after taste. I gave up. Timothy's plain old French Vanilla is much better than this "French Vanilla Supreme".
