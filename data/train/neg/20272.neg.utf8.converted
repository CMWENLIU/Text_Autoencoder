Grossly disappointed with Raspberries & Blackberries.  The initial fruity taste is followed by a strong perfumy aftertaste that made me wash my hands thinking i had something stinky on my hands while i was eating these.  The only reason i even  gave it two stars is that they were fresh, or at least that's what  Jelly Belly Customer Service said when i called, then they proceeded to say that I wasn't the first person to comment about the vile, chemical taste .  I was told it's  "European". My tongue was offended twice!  Once by the nauseating taste, then by they condescending attitude at  Jelly Belly!
