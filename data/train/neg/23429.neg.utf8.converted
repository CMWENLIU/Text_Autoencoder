I believe these Dental Chews caused my dog to get sick. After eating these (no more than 2 a day) for several weeks, she began to vomit and had to spend 2 nights at the vet on an IV. She came home but got worse and her blood work indicated either pancreatitis and/or liver failure.  We had to put her down. She was only 9 years old and had previously been healthy.
