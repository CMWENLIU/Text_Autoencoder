I read the reviews. I read the ingredients list. I thought I hit it all.....Tried it at last and got ripped off by<br />1.) Price is double that of other websites; amazon for shame on you!<br />2.) Sucralose - discovered when experiments with chlorine compounds to produce new pesticides was tasted by a human. Ummm...it wasn't on the list of ingredients! I tried it once and noticed it right away, picked up the box and there it is, sucralose. I threw this away, the bitter taste AND aftertaste isnt worth it. I don't care how much brown sugar they say they added, you cant put both together and expect a postive result.<br />Dont buy this unless you want a bitter taste and the sure to be in your near future-health problems with cancerous after effects of chlorinated fake sugar.....
