I was excited to start making sourdough bread. I followed the enclosed instructions to the letter and I thought it was working. Sadly, by the end of the 3rd day it was evident that it was dead. The second star is for the web address the seller enclosed. It had a ton of information however it was difficult for me, a novice bread maker, to make sense of. I couldn't even find the section listed for maintaining the starter. Unfortunately it didn't  matter, as I had nothing to maintain.
