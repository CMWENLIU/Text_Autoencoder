The grinder itself is fine. The problem is that the nutmeg has almost no  flavor at all compared to a freshly grated whole nutmeg. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the grinder contains chunks of coarsely ground or broken-up nutmeg, not whole nutmeg nuts. I remember (but cannot find) nutmeg grinders into which a whole nutmeg would be inserted and held by a sort of claw, then shaved as needed by a mechanism resembling a pencil sharpener in the principle of its operation.<br />I purchased these grinders as presents but was so disappointed that I still have all three; since what comes out of these grinders is no improvement over what comes out of a container of powdered or grated nutmeg from any supermarket spice rack, I saw no sense in adding them to the clutter of my children's spice racks.
