While I really loved this cereal, I was shocked to see that it is produced in MEXICO. It's sad to know we can't produce breakfast food in this country anymore.  I am boycotting Kellog's products going forward.  I can understand certain foods being imported (i.e. imported olive oil, cheese, etc.) but cereal???? This is just totally insane & it's no wonder so many Americans are out of work.
