Not sure why they advertise these granola bars as chewy. These are not chewy. Glad I have good teeth because it felt like I was chewing a thick stack of cardboard. They had very little taste and I was not interested in eating anymore. But for the sake of writing this review, I ate the rest of the bar.<br /><br />Wish I hadn't. Would not purchase.
