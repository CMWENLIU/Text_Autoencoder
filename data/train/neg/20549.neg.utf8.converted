Would give 0 stars if I could. I ordered these mangoes on the strength of the other reviews and the fact that I had tried and liked the Barefruit cinnamon apple snacks. Unfortunately, the order I recieved was awful. The fruit isn't crispy--it has a tough, leathery texture that is totally unappealing. Worse, there is a strong, bitter aftertaste that is hard to get out of your mouth. No one in my house will eat these, not even my son who loves all kinds of dried fruit. I am very sorry I wasted my money on this product. I was hoping for something light and crispy like the apples. Can anyone give me any suggestions for something better?
