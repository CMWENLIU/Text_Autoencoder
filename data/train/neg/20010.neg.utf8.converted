The quality of Marshalls Creeks Rosemary is less than ideal.  There is more stem than rosemary in the container which makes for a very rough measurement and stem pieces throughout food.  If you don't mind a little rough stem then Marshalls Creeks is just for you.  Also the "sealed" container is not really "sealed at all"  I had spider webs and mold (somehow) in some other herbs I purchased from them.
