It's really nice not having to run to the grocery store and having sugar for my coffee delivered to my door, but the price is a little exorbitant, and a pound really isn't as much as it sounds like. I'm a 24-year old bachelor, so I don't think these things through like I should. If you were as idiotic as me, this is to let you know that.<br /><br />- You can buy sugar about 3 times cheaper at any grocery store.<br />- I realize my own stupidity led to this purchase, but that's why I'm trying to clue you in ;)<br />- By the way, the cardboard container is very poorly designed.<br /><br />- If you're determined to experience the convenience of having sugar delivered to your door, the purchase the five pound bag for a few dollars more here:
