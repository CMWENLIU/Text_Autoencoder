This product contains BPA, which is known to be very dangerous to health.  The following is a quote from the Wikipedia article on BPA:<br /><br />"Bisphenol A is an endocrine disruptor, which can mimic the body's own hormones and may lead to negative health effects.[23][24][25][26] Early development appears to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects.[27] Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety levels are currently being questioned or under review as a result of new scientific studies.[28][29]<br /><br />In 2009 the The Endocrine Society released a scientific statement expressing concern over current human exposure to BPA.[30]"<br /><br />The Wikipedia article is much longer and contains lots of information on BPA.  It's all bad news.  Amy's canned products all contain BPA.  This is unfortunate because Amy's recipes are good tasting.  Amy's is aware of the problem and have been "researching it" for years now.  But they can't seem to get around to removing this dangerous poison from their products.<br /><br />It's not worth the risk to yourself, your children, and your unborn children.  So please avoid this product and any other that contains BPA.  When Amy's does the right thing and stops using BPA in their canned products, they'll be fit to eat.  But not until then.
