These don't taste nearly as flavorful and yummy as regular Haribo bears.<br /><br />Worse yet, consuming a small number of these - 6, I counted - was followed several hours later by an onslaught of gas, just like EVERY OTHER REVIEWER HAS MENTIONED.<br /><br />So buyer beware - if you love the Haribo chewiness, you get that, but not much else, except a lot of flatulence!
