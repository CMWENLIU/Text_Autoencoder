There is a Chinese article from Taiwan (found in yahoo-Hong Kong) that issued a product recall for all Indomie Noodles.  The test result from Taiwanese authorities shows that the product contained excess amount of preservatives. Although damage to human may not be immediate but prolonged consumption could lead to kidney disease.<br /><br />I, myself, used to love this product but I have reduced the consumption of all Instant Noodles from once a day to once every 3 to 4 months.  Best to stay away from these processed food especially one with a recall.<br /><br />([...])
