This "roast" is absolutely horrible. My first thought upon opening the bag and smelling the beans was, "Akk! These smell like charcoal!"  These beans are not simply dark roasted - they're completely burned. Dreading the results, I attempted to pull a few shots on the espresso machine, There was virtually no crema and the espresso itself was bitter and disgusting. I've tasted better espresso pulled from 6 month old ESE pods! Maybe these beans work better for regular coffee in a percolator machine with a fine paper filter to keep the charcoal out of the decanter; for espresso, they're a horrid failure.
