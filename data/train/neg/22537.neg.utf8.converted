This is not a review of the chips themselves, they are really wonderful.<br /><br />This is a review of the seller, Liquid Nation, with whom I had a terrible experience when buying these chips through them.<br /><br />Although it appeared that they had the 9oz packages in stock, I got a message from them saying they had bigger bags in stock instead and I accepted.<br /><br />However, when I received the package, almost all the bags were expired, some for MONTHS!!!<br /><br />I have contacted the seller and they have ignored the issue and did not take care of it.<br /><br />BEWARE OF LIQUID NATION!
