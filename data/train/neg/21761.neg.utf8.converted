I bought this (not from Amazon, but just want to post a review to help)hoping to help out my 7-month old adopted lab puppy (who was kept outside and never housebroken at her last home) to pee outside. She was doing well without the post, but still has some accidents, so I wanted reinforcement to go outside.  Well, because I guess it smells like another dog, and she is totally a non-alpha dog and actually shy about intruding on other dogs' territory, it actually made her training go BACKWARDS. Now she is terrified to go in her "spot", and would rather go inside.  I hate this thing and am sending it back; I wouold give it 0 stars but they make me give at least 1. Maybe it would work with a more alpha dog, but beware if your dog is not.
