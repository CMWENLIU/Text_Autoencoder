I have bought things from this company before and I guess I expected more from their vanilla beans. They have a weird smell, maybe a little burnt? I don't think they are supposed to smell like that. They are plump vanilla beans, but don't have the aroma I expected. Overall, I guess they are just ok. I wouldn't buy them again. And now I have a 1/2 lb. of vanilla beans that I don't really want to use.
