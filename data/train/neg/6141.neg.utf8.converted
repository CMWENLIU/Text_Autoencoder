I bought this product on the strength of the reviews but after one or two days of taking it I had a bad reaction to it including dizziness and the onset of depression and anxiety. Someone mentioned that Maca is a strong her and made their heart race a little after taking it. Another person said their skin broke out in a rash. Yet another reviewer mentioned Alphalpha- which this product has and which is meant to be bad for some reason (I'll do the research later) My only interpretation personally for me as to why my body reacted to it is the chemical additives e.g silica which is a well known neurotoxin. I have a very sensitive central nervous system and thought I would take this to get essential nutrients. But I think the multiple combinations and the large quantities of each herb/veg was just too much. I have since binned it and I'm scared to ever try it again. Since then I've bought a juicer and juice cabbage, cucumber, carrots, celery and other veg everyday and that's worked out much better for me in terms of boosting my energy, memory and concentration than this nightmare powder did.
