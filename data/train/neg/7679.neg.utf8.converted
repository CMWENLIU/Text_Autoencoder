I really was looking forward to loving this food but unfortunately just didn't didn't really enjoy the taste. Mainly the soy meatballs have an odd strong taste that I do not like...which is weird because I generally eat a lot of vegetarian soy products and don't have a problem with them. I would recommend buying the variety without the soy meatballs.
