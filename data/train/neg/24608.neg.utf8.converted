After reading so many rave reviews, I was eager to try Jennie's Coconut Macaroons.  Unfortunately, they were a disappointment.  They were far too sweet (I like macaroons that only have a hint of sweetness in the coconut) and far too moist (they almost tasted wet).  Now I'm stuck with 6 canisters of these macaroons.  Trader Joe's makes a far better macaroon!
