I wanted to try Cameron's Velvet Moon.  I ordered Velvet Moon, Vanilla Hazelnut and Donut Shop, and also a couple of flavors from San Francisco Bay brand.  I liked the idea of the more environmentally-friendly pods for the Keurig and the price was certainly right.<br /><br />I tried the Vanilla Hazelnut first.  I wasn't impressed with it.  It was rather bitter and I won't be ordering it again.  Last night, I gave Cameron's another shot and opened the factory-sealed box of Velvet Moon.  To my surprise, it wasn't Velvet Moon at all.  The box was filled with Donut Shop pods.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, that's two strikes for Cameron's.  The first box didn't taste good, and the second box was packed with the wrong pods.  If I like the Donut Shop coffee, I guess it's no-harm-no-foul.  But it certainly doesn't impress.  (The San Francisco Bay coffee, on the other hand, was superb and I highly recommend it.)<br /><br />UPDATE:  The Donut Shop coffee turned out to be pretty good coffee, although I do still prefer the SF Bay.  It is certainly better than most of the K-cups I've tried.  I am still annoyed about the packaging snafu, but might just try the Velvet Moon next time.  I'll watch to see what other reviewers think.
