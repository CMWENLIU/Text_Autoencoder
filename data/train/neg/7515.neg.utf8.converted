It was great the first couple of times I used it but then over time, I started noticing a brown/black liquid left on the base and driveshaft. At first i thought it was food dripping out and didn't think much of it, then I realized it was coming from the driveshaft and I kept trying to clean it off but more and more comes out every time I use the machine. And now the last time I used the machine, the blade and holder seem to be stained with brown as well. I've been scrubbing and scrubbing those parts as well but it's impossible to clean off. The last batch of green bean I made also ended up getting brown/black liquid leaked in so of course now I'm freaked out as to what the baby has consumed and now am too scared to use this machine at all.
