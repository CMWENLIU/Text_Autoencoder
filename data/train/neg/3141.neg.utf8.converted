The package says buffalo and venison, yet on the ingredients buffalo is number one, then chicken, then lamb.  Venison is way down on the list now.  Apparently, Taste of the Wild is owned by Diamond Pet Foods.  Yes the same Diamond Pet Foods that had their food recalled, where they were using a toxic chemical.  If you lookup Diamond Pet Foods on Amazon you will see that they use lower quality ingredients and none of their foods are in the same league as Wellness or Blue Buffalo.<br /><br />My problem with this food is that they used to use buffalo and venison as the top 2 ingredients, as the label indicates, but now they use chicken and lamb to cheapen the product.  Buyer Beware!
