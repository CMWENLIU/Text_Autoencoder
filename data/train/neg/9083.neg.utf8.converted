I'm a long time aficionado of vegetable juice, especially tomato juice based products. I like the taste of V8 and similar products, but stopped drinking them a long time ago due to the additives, GMO ingredients, and their use of reconstituted juices. I had high hopes for this product, but honestly you can barely tell there's tomato in it, it tastes strongly of broccoli and kale instead, which are not my favorite veggies. It's back to mixing organic tomato juice with bits of other organic juices (and a little soy or vegan worcestershire) sauce for me.
