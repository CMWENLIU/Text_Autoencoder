It was still within the expiration date but they tasted awful. The caramel in it was very hard and chewy, not at all pleasant. They were all "squashed" like they had been under a heavy weight or something, yet the box showed no indication. Some had a really chemically taste.<br /><br />Bought a box before and the candy was fine, was really disappointed this time.
