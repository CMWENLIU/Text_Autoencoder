I love ordering fried mozzerella sticks and dipping them into hot or cold marinara sauce, and I love Pringles. So when I saw that they had this flavor I was excited, well as excited one could get about Pringles.<br /><br />Huge Fail. You can *sorta* taste the Marinara part of it, tangy like tomato sauce can be but the cheese part? not so much. It tastes like a slightly spaghetti flavored Pringle.
