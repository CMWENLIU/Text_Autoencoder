Right up front...I have never tasted these, but noticed an inconsistency in advertising as I was reading about this product.  I found it interesting that the description said..."No added MSG"  This product has MSG - they might not 'add' additional, but be warned, it has MSG.  If you look at the ingredients, the product contains Hydrolyzed Soy Protein.  Anything 'hydrolyzed' or 'autolyzed' creates the harmful portion of MSG--glutamates.<br /><br />For those of us that have to watch our MSG - we have to always be on the lookout for the hidden MSG.
