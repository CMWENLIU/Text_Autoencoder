If it were not so much trouble I would return this product. I am a great blue cheese lover but these olives do not contain anywhere near the blue cheese I am accustomed to. The cheese is so mild it might as well not even be in the olives. The olives are OK but to pretend they are stuffed with blue cheese is a grossly misleading statement.  Purchasing this product is a waste of money.
