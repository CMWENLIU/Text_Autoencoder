I thought this was going to be like the special k blueberry I had while I was in italy, but it is nowhere close!  This only has little flakes of blueberry in it and it is way too sweet.  I looked at the ingredients and it says: sugar, high fructose corn syrup, misc partially hydrogenated items - I though that this cereal is supposed to be good for you, but that is definitely not the case
