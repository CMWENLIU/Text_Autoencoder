I', a fan of lemon and ginger.  I enjoy teas and I will use fresh ginger in recipes.  But this was downright awful.  I followed the instructions, and the smell was so wonderful.  It reminded me of a fancy tea house.<br /><br />Then I tasted it... yuck... burning sensation from the ginger.  I do not recommend this, unless ginger 'burns' are your thing.
