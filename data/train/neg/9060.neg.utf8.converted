Don't trust the program. On the site it promises that you will  get the price of the date that the invoice generate.  But, it only work when it post the regular price.  They still generate invoice at lower price when it goes on sale, but they keep delaying the shipment until you give up and the price goes back up.  You can never take advantage of the price cut that it posts.  It's a trick.
