While I applaud Tiki Cat for using Dolphin safe sources, as well as being high protein, no filler food, I cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />Almost every can containing Salmon and/or Tuna has massive pinbones left in.  I realize that these are digestible, however, the size of these bones has caused both of my cats to gag, choke and then (thankfully) vomit up the food on two occasions.  It's a shame, as they love the formula, and I would love to keep supporting this company, but this is just not safe and needs a serious look over from the company.
