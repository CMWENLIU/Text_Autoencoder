[[ASIN:I purchase these probably 1 year ago.  I was very disappointed with the quality.  I was unable to eat these sardines.  They had scales and hard bones along with a tough texture.  Sorry product.  I'm giving them to the cats.<br /><br />B000EEWZF0 Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines in Pure Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)]]
