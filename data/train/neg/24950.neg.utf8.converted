This is one of the most horrible things I've ever attempted to eat.  It practically sucks the moisture out of your mouth, and the texture is like chewing sand without the crunch.  It has this awful tangy but bland flavor, and is barely swallowable.  I'm glad things like this are available to people who have many allergies and intolerances, but I feel so sorry for them having to eat it.  We only tried this bread during the elimination phase of an oligoantigenic diet, and even if I could never have bread again, I'd rather eat peanut butter and jelly plain, than put it on this disgusting stuff.  Horrid.  Absolutely horrid.
