I like others tried this coffee on the basis of Consumer Reports recommendation so I was very disappointed with how poor I found this coffee to be. I tried these beans in a drip coffee maker and French press. It lacks any kind of body and I found I have had to use 50% more beans per brew to get any decent level of body and taste, so any hope that this would be great-tasting reasonably-priced coffee was also not to be. I bought 4 packs and am half-way through the last bag and can't wait to be done with this bland, bland, bland coffee. (I'm obviously too cheap just to dump it)!<br /><br />I also gave these beans a test in my espresso machine; forget about it! You will get zip in the way of "crema" from these beans (not that they are intended for espresso). An interesting thing I noticed when brewing the beans in my espresso maker was that the coffee stream went to very waterey very fast giving visual evidence to my taste experience of blandness.<br /><br />So in a word, would I recommend these beans? An unequivocal "NO".
