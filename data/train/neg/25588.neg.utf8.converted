As a Green Tea Lover... I do not want to recommend this tea bags.<br />The taste of this tea bag is NOT closed to green tea at all... It is more like lightened black tea...<br />Also, this open style paper package is not good for Green Tea. The taste of Green Tea is getting worse if contacted by direct sunlight, heat or humidity. It should be kept hermetically sealed.<br />If you want to enjoy real green tea with moderate price, I'd like recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Green Tea Matcha Blend 100% Japanese Tea - 100 Tea Bags</a>. It is made by Itoen as well-known Japanese tea company. Taste and clear green color is excellent with well sealed package.
