I read all of the good stuff associated with Chia Seed. My husband and I have been determined to eat healthier, and go organic when possible. We are succeeding in our endeavors, and thought that this product would fit right into our new lifestyle. I have attempted to get this seed into things that we eat regularly. It just does not work for me. I cannot get past the slime and mouth feel. For those of you who are able to, I think that is wonderful, but I am going to pass on any further use of it.
