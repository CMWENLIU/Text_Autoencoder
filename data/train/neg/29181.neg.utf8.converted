I have tried this in many different recipes, all to my dismay and wasted ingredients... It always comes out the same.  It tastes like serious chemicals and is so gross it overpowers everything else.  This is SOOO NOT worth the money or time!  If you're looking for a totally all natural sweetener just buy a lb of dates in the veggies section of your store, cut them in half and take out the pits/stems, soak them in like a cup of water over night (covered well over) then blend them in your blender/food processor. It will make a thick paste that you can store in a jar/container in your fridge for a couple weeks.  I know that may sound like more trouble, but really? You'd be waiting for these things in the mail and when they arrive, I know you'd be dissapointed. Dates are chemical/sugar free, all natural and totally sweet so they DO work in many recipes and even coffee/tea.  Dates, now, after trying many, many sweeteners ( I have a serious sweet tooth) are the ONLY thing I will endorse that is remotely safe for your body and also tastes GREAT.  Peace, hope this helps...
