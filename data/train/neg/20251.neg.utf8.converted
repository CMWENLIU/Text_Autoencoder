Ingredients in order: Pure cane or beet sugar, cocoa, coconut oil, whey, maltodextrin, natural flavour, non-fat dry milk, salt, sodium casinate, mono and di-glycerides (emulsifier), guar gum (thickener), dipotassium phosphate (buffering agent), soy lecithin. I know there's disagreement over the natural label, but this was not what I was looking for. If I'd wanted all the processed stuff and chemicals, I'd have saved some money and bought Swiss Miss.
