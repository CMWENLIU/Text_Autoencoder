I have a difficult time finding BLUE products in our area. And when I do they frequently don't have exactly what I am looking for.<br /><br />So I was thrilled to find Amazon had several products available.<br /><br />How disappointing to receive the product and find that it was several months past the date stamped on the packaging. As a longtime Amazon shopper I was surprised...I have come to expect great delivery and quality product. I won't order the blue again from this source.
