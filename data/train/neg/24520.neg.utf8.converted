I love this coffee a lot because it's mild and has flavor .However I'm shocked at the price of this Van Houtte Costa Rica Tarrazu Coffee .Since Van Houtte wont ship this coffee to the USA and has dismantled their web site ,you only have 1 choice , Amazon .There for around $50 you can buy 48 cups roughly $1.04 per cup .But wait ,and I spent a few hours researching the availabilty of this coffee .I found a web site "tweedandhickory" where they sell 24 k cups or loose coffee in a bag for around $17 , and they do ship to the USA although expensive around $18 .BUT!! here is what you do if you like this coffee so much as I do.The shipping charges while high for 1 order ,increasing your order the shipping is a tiny bit more .SO!! if you buy 5 24 cup boxes and ship to the USA (Boston area) the cost including shipping is $89 thats .74c a cup .This is what I'll do ,maybe we can break the Tarrazu cartel ,because not even Keurig carries it .I hope Amazon will publish this review because it would be a great saving for the readers that like this coffee . I think no one should pay more than .75c a cup .<br /><br />Since I wrote this review I discovered another online site "filterfreshlv.com they sell this Tarraszu for $14.95 for 24 cups plus shipping .Spend $50 ,shipping is free .I can't understand why Amazon my favorite company deals with this company that lists the retail price at $33 which is crossed out and the price is now $45.95 plus tax .<br /><br />Unfortunately a big scam is being is being played here Filter Fresh and the Amazon seller are both advertizing Tarrazu and are delivering Costa Rican coffee .The only similarity is the Van Houtte printed on the box .It's virtually impossible to buy Tarrazu in this country so some sellers are showing a picture of a split label cup which says Tarrazu ,but when you buy and open the box the cups have a black label which says Costa Rican coffee .Folks there is a difference and these sellers are substituting Costa Rican coffee knowingly and charging outragious prices.This should be stopped ,and twice I have bought what was advertized as Tarrazu and wasn't .After pointing out to these sellers they told me to keep the coffee and refunded my money ,but continue to bait and switch the public.The only place to get Van Houtte Tarrazu coffee is in Canada and most companies wont ship to the USA.In conclusion the Costa Rican coffee is good but not as good as Tarrazu ,so you will have to drink this slightly inferior coffee .I just get upset about the games being played.<br /><br />2/26/12<br />At last I found it Tarrazu coffee ,not Van Houtte but from George Howell in Newtonville ,MA web site www.terriorcoffee.com .<br />While it isn't Van Houtte it's a delicious quality coffee in a 12 oz bag (no K-Cup )at $13.75 .I live about 4 miles from their coffee shop and because I bought this bag of coffee ,they gave me a free cup of their coffee of the day .That was El Roble from Colombia  and boy was that delicious .For those people who don't know who George Howell is ,he started Coffee Connections in the Boston area many years ago ,only to be bought out by Starbucks .Well he's back at it brewing great coffee and he carries Tarrazu .
