I absolutely love Nutiva's coconut oil and so I thought I would love their Coconut Manna as well. Unfortunately that is not the case.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the container to soften the product so that I could mix the oil back into the coconut. I ended up using an immersion blender to thoroughly mix it which worked very well.<br /><br />I find it almost inedible. The texture is gritty and very thick. It sticks to the inside of my mouth and leaves an unpleasant dry sensation. It doesn't "melt" in my mouth as described on the container. I don't enjoy the taste either. The pure taste of coconut oil is there, but with another taste mixed in that ruins it and leaves an aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. I'm planning on trying another brand of coconut butter and see if it's a problem with the Nutiva brand or just my own taste/texture preferences. It's not anywhere near the expiration date, it doesn't taste rancid and the container was properly sealed, so I assume that the product is fresh.<br /><br />Update: 2-13-2012 - I purchased some Artisana organic raw coconut butter and compared the two. I have to say that I like the Artisana brand better. It's smoother and the color is lighter. It's also packaged in a glass jar which I prefer. The taste is also somewhat better. I now know that I don't really like coconut butter, it's just not for me. I would recommend that if you buy coconut butter buy the Artisana brand.
