I am laughing while writing this. You would NOT BELIEVE the sounds coming from my body today after eating one of these for breakfast! I feel I could float away, I have so much gas in me! They taste delicious! But this is one heck of a side effect! I've never tooted for 30 seconds straight before so it's quite amusing, but I won't be eating another one. I think I'll give the rest to people as gag gifts.
