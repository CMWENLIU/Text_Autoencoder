I've tried this product in several recipes. Even with the banana bread recipe right off the bag, there is a strong chemical aftertaste. Something I've not experienced with any other gluten free products. Same experience with a simple chocolate cake recipe. The texture is ok, but the aftertaste is overwhelming. And unfortunately you can't return this product.
