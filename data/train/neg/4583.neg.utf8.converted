My family used this product for over 4 years, but last year the recipe was changed, sugar was added. That decision was probably driven by Cascadian Farm's desire to increase profits (cheaper production, more appealing to mainstream sugar junkies). Unfortunately, there aren't many choices right now for nutrition-conscious individuals. Even the so called organic/health cereals are loaded with sweets (all sorts of syrups, juice concentrates). Starting a morning on that note sets you up for a roller-coaster ride of high-low blood sugar. I had nothing else to do but to start cooking whole grain cereals (oatmeal, millet, buckwheat). It takes a bit of planning - you have to allocate time for cooking in the morning or cook the nigh before, but in the process you can save a ton of money. For instance, a pound of organic millet costs from $0.99 to $1.79 depending on the retailer (or $0.06 to $0.11 per oz). In the process of cooking grain absorbs water and increases it mass at least 3 fold. That makes the price of cooked cereal go down as much ($0.02 to $0.04).  Compare that to $0.48/oz price for Purely'Os! Then maybe the recipe change introduced by Cascadian Farms is truly a blessing for your wallet, if you are willing to wait 20 minutes, while you cereal is boiling on the stove. This time is not lost, but gained - you can use it to practice sun salutation to make your morning even more glorious!
