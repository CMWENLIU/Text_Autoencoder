Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore.  Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix.  Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together.
