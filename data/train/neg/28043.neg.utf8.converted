Back in the day I used to love the single use Crystal Light packets that you would pour into a 16.9 oz water bottle and drink. I also used to drink soda, high fructose corn syrup, and a bunch of terrible-for-you preservatives and artificial flavors. Since then I've come to realize the health risks associated with artificial colors and flavors and added chemicals in our food and drink and try to avoid them when possible. Since these pour in drink flavors have become popular I've been looking for one that was natural and good for you. This one isn't it.<br /><br />First you have Sucralose, (best known for Splenda), which is actually not a zero calorie sweetener (2-4 calories per serving or squeeze in this case, but the FDA doesn't require labeling of calories for less than 5 per serving). But calories isn't the problem with Sucralose, it is the possibility of glycemic load, which it does impact although very little per packet. But if you drink this throughout the day you are messing with your sugar. (See nutritiondata.self. com and look it up). Why not go natural with a Stevia extract? Same sweetness, no glycemic load and not a chemical.<br /><br />Also, Sodium Benzoate is a preservative that when mixed with Ascorbic Acid (which is also in this,) forms Benzene a carcinogen (read: poison.) Google it. The people feeding us this poison say it is in such a small dose that it is safe. Poison... safe?<br /><br />And there are more, but one thing you should definitely know is that the ingredient list here at Amazon doesn't show all the ingredients on the label. Consider artificial color Red 40, which "According to research conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a possible link exists between food dyes and childhood health disorders such as hyperactivity, behavior problems and even pediatric cancer" (Live Strong). Also included Gum Acacia, Glyceryl Abietate and Chromium Polynicotinate (which is actually good for you and helps prevent diabetes). Why hide the other ingredients? (Why even have them all?)<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are looking for a natural flavor enhancer to add to water, like I was, then this product will let you down.<br /><br />Oh, and it tastes like Kool-Aid.
