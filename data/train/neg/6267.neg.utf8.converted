While the product is fantastic i do not recommend ordering from Cosmetic Solutions.  The product i received did not match the product description.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift so i called the co. and complained.  I was told i could return the product i received or take a $5 refund.  They could not send me what i ordered as they do not have it in stock!  BIG dissappointment!
