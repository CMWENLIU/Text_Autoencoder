My intention in writing this review is to clarify and warn BUYERS BEWARE that this price is an OUTRAGEOUSLY high price for a SINGLE, 10 oz. bag of popcorn. It looks like you get more than 1 item due to the $2.28/item shown in the listing. But I wrote the seller and found out the listing is for only 1 bag of popcorn. So I asked about what the $2.28/item referred to (since listing is only for 1 item - bag of popcorn), the response was that it represented cups. That's right, you are getting 7 cups @ $2.28 each = one 10 oz bag of popcorn. Yet the $2.28/item doesn't match the way the item is listed, which is in ounces (10oz). If you are selling it by the cup, rather than by ounces, then the listing should be listed in cups ($15.99= 7.013 cups x $2.28 per cup). I wrote the seller and explained that, "THIS LISTING IS CONFUSING AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED. OTHERWISE, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT IT IS INTENTIONALLY CONFUSING, TO THE POINT OF BEING DECEPTIVE."  The seller's response was polite and professional and said they will work to get the issue resolved. However, I see a previous complaint listed here from months ago about the same issue (the high price and the customer not realizing it was for only ONE bag of popcorn). So until they make a change, I am posting this review as a way to clarify and inform all potential buyers that this listing is for ONLY ONE BAG OF POPCORN!!!!
