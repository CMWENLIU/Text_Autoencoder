I ordered greenies dental treats from Entirely Pets for my dog. The item was described as being a package of 40 treats and their mailing rate. What I received was 1 small bone that weighed at least 1/3 of the advertised weight. When I contacted customer service, the response I received was basically "oh well...there's nothing I can do about it." Definitely not "customer service!"
