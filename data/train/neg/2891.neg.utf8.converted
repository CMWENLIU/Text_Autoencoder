I purchased and received a case of these 6 oz items mid-March-2008. I used two cans then and in reflection remember one of them spewing some paste when first pierced by the opener. Tonight I've gone to open another can and this time it really projected out the paste when pierced with the opener. So I decide to check over the others and find 4 of them really BULGING - each end pouched outwards a centimeter or so. And another 8 cans showing 1 to 3 mm bulges at each end!  This case has been in an A/C-ed home in a dark closet.<br /><br />The case of small cans appears to come from 3 different lot numbers (OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1121, OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1122 AND OPJCS 6 ASHX24 1123) Note the 1121/1122/1123 code differs.<br /><br />With just my visual inspection it appears all affected cans are 1122 but I will not be eating any of the remainders. I will be contacting the manufacturer ASAP to see if there has been a recall or known problem.
