It sounded neat but it has some major drawbacks. Only 2 weeks after purchasing it the water level low light came on and won't turn off. Only half of the pods appear to be sprouting - the others died (for a $20 seed kit I expect all to live). The lights are very bright and the motor can be distracting but isn't too bad. Every 6 months you need to replace the bulbs.
