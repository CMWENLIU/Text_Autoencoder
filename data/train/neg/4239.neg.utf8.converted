What does Non-GE mean?<br />One of the most annoying things about Amazon, whether the product be sold by them or through them, are the incomplete descriptions.<br />  The information would be helpful to potential buyers and therefore to the seller.  Incomplete descriptions only lead me to ask: what are they hiding, or, are they trying to dump something on the unsuspecting?
