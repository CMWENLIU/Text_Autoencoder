This product is the straw that broke the camel's back, making me 100% convinced I should not eat anything made in India.  Of course, it helps I have a long history of frequenting Indian groceries for staples such as frozen naan and papadam...and it doesn't help that I frequently find half-exploded cans of botulism-encrusted, expired, imported Indian goo in any random neighborhood Indian grocery.<br /><br />So here's my report on first opening the package:<br /><br />The jaggery looks like unreasonably yellow tofu cube looking sugar blocks; they are not the lovely and natural blond or brunette of colombian panela or mexican piconcillo.  The smell is horrible, something like the plastic on a bad capacitor that has burned out, the smell of a soldering iron, something strangely industrial and/or metallic and/or plastic and/or burning.  Brake dust.  Computer on fire.  Pthalates burning in a trash heap.  Scumdog millionaire sets the pool toy factory aflame next door to the sugar fields.<br /><br />...This is food???<br /><br />Ok, I thought, maybe it's the packaging that I'm smelling, so I drop them in some water to bring to a boil.<br /><br />First thing happens, yellow color starts emanating from the cubes.  "Oh", I think to myself, "It's been hit with yellow #5, or at best, Turmeric".<br /><br />Next I notice the jaggery starts to bubble.  Bubble?  My mexican piconcillo doesn't do that.  It's just sugar, right?<br /><br />Finally, as it dissolves, I waft the scent of brake dust, caramel, something strange like a fake beef or meat flavor, something strangely umami but muskier.<br /><br />Then I dump the whole thing and toss out the 2 lbs of jaggery I bought.<br /><br />No more Indian food.  The irony is that you have a perfect product that nature produces, then you have to adulterate it, overcomplicating it with garbage, making it unacceptable.<br /><br />Attention India and China: I will not participate in your industrial-waste-laundering-through-food scheme.
