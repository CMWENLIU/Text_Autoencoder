The deodorant is a white substance, goes on white, and white clumps remain hours later.  I'm very disappointed that this product specifically states "invisible".  This is NOT invisible and there is nothing on the packaging stating that it is white in color.  Unilever should be reprimanded for falsely representing this product on the packaging.
