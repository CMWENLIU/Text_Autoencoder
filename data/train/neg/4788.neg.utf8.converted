This dinner kit was not at all what I was expecting, was poor in quality, and overly complicated with four separate packages to mix together.  It does, however only take 20 minutes to make, but at the end of it, I found it inedible.  I had somewhat realistic expectations that you weren't going to get broccoli out of a box so had some fresh broccoli on hand.  I'm glad I did, because the separate broccoli packet that came with this dinner kit was essentially smashed broccoli dust.  There's a separate packet for seasoning and for pasta as well, but you add them at the same time.  I couldn't help but wonder why the pasta and seasoning wouldn't be in one packet, but I guess they felt it necessary and more costly.  The pasta was also not what I was expecting.  For some reason I was thinking it would be a substantial pasta, but it was actually orzo that ended up looking and tasting more like rice than pasta.  The last packet was the velveeta cheese packet which looked rich and creamy, but when combined with all the other ingredients, ended up resulting in a slightly sweet chemical taste.  I took a couple of bites and really didn't like it all.  My dogs were not so discerning, but for a family meal, it tastes overprocessed and isn't better than plain macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />If you're going to go through the trouble of making chicken and broccoli with cheese, you could probably add real chicken and broccoli to standard mac and cheese and do much better than this.
