I was supposed to get 12 boxes of wine gums but only received 1.  I sent an e- mail to Amazon and they said that they would replace the order.  3 days later I received another single box of candy. I called on the phone next and spoke to a customer service representative who assured me that all 12 packs were in the single 8 ounce box.  I finally gave up and ordered my wine gums from E bay. The candy was fine but I never received the full order.  I am happy to say that this the only problem that I have ever had with Amazon.
