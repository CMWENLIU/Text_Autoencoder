Good idea........all natural, all meat, no fillers.........but ALL  4 of my cats had terrible digestive issues with this food. We introduced it a little at a time and they ALL had miserable diahrrea!<br />After 9 days of cleaning poop , we are throwing it out. Back to Science Diet and Friskies.<br /><br />Feb. 02, 2012<br />Tried this again for our new kitty......7 month old Bubba......after adding a tablespoon at a time to his commercial food over an 11 day period and spending every day cleaning up diahrea, I again state that this is too rich for my kitties.<br />Back to Science Diet for everybody.
