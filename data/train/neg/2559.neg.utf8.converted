Sorry, folks, but it looks like I'm the only Amazon purchaser of this product who thinks it is absolutely terrible.  The peanut butter flavor is barely discernible, and after every bite, there is an absolutely horrible chemical after taste.  I can't put my finger on it, but it is truly nasty.  (I also bought a box of the Cookies 'n Creme, and they actually tasted even worse!)<br />Please understand, I have no hidden agenda, but honestly if you're looking for a great tasting energy bar I highly recommend the Kashi Go Lean Peanut Butter bars.  Admittedly, they are much chewier, but at least they taste like peanut butter and they don't leave that disgusting after taste.  Sorry, just my opinion.
