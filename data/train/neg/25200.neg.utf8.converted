these are great fruit bars - but this is ridiculous - product indicates 10 Count - leading you to believe that you are getting 10 boxes - you only get 10 fruit bars - for $10! absolutely ridiculous. These are $2 at Target per box! not per fruit bar - this is purposefully misleading and I will not do business with TAJ 4U in the future.
