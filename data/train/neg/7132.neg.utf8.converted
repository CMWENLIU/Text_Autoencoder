Ovaltine has changed its formula, and the change is definitely NOT for the better! True, they now include more vitamins - but at a paltry little 10%, with riboflavin B2, and vitamin B12 at 0%! (Why they even bother to list it on the container is beyond me), and phosporus has been reduced to 4%. The previous formula included higher percentages: vitamin A 45%, vitamin C 45%, calcium 8%, iron 15%, thiamine B1 60%, riboflavin B2 45%, niacin 45%, vitamin B6 45%, and phosphorus 8%. In short, they took something that was fairly healthy, and in the typical manner of American corporations, cheapened it into nothing more than junk-food milk-flavoring! I quoted the above percentages from an Ovaltine container from last year. Ovaltine is worthless now and I refuse to buy it until they return it to its orginial formula. I will be writing the company about this, too. They obviously think we're all stupid, and I boycott any company that acts like it thinks I'm stupid!
