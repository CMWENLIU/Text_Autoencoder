I thought I was getting a great deal with these big cans and thought I would deal with the issue of a bunch of extra tuna for 3 or 4 meals.  The taste is not as good as the small cans.  This big tuna can is packed in water.  With the small cans, even though it is packed in water, it is OBVIOUS that the tuna is cooked in the can.  This must be the difference in flavor.  I will stick with the small cans even though more expensive.  I really appreciate the bpa free cans though with all their products and what they stand for.<br /><br />This tuna really would be sufficient for a large gathering.  It is not bad, just not as good as the small cans.
