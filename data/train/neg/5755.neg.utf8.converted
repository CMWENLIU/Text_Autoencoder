I followed the activation instructions precisely, even to the point of using a high-precision digital thermometer to insure the correct temps for the distilled water and the fermentation. After 24 hours of "fermentation" the flour had settled to the bottom of the container and a clear liquid had risen to the top. The reviews seem to indicate that this product is a hit-or-miss proposition...it either works fine or it's DOA. It's somewhat pricey to find out which one you'll get by having to buy it first.
