I love peach tea, and used to buy these tea bags from my local Fresh Mart.  When they stopped carrying them, I looked around for almost two years to find them in other stores with no luck.  So...I was excited to find them again on Amazon.  But, in that time period, something changed with the product, and the design of the box changed also.  The "peach" flavor is much more artificial now, and is not enjoyable at all.  Also, the tea bags themselves seem to be a lot weaker....I am having to use a lot more of them to create a pitcher of tea that tastes like something other than colored water.  I am highly disappointed, and I will not be purchasing this product ever again.
