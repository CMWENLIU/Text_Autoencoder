I shared this product with a person in my office who drinks tea daily.  (I'm a big coffee drinker, so I don't drink tea every day.)<br /><br />My initial impression was that while this tea smelled good once the bag was opened, the tea itself had almost no aroma once brewed and the tea didn't have much flavor either.  I thought that perhaps I had not brewed it long enough even though I had brewed it a full 5 minutes (the manufacturer recommends brewing 3-5 minutes), so I threw the bag back in my cup of tea.  Despite leaving the bag in the cup as I finished drinking the tea, the tea never got much flavor as far as I was concerned.  Then again I'm used to drinking really strong coffee, so I thought that perhaps my taste buds were simply used to a stronger flavor.<br /><br />Enter my co-worker.  I specifically did not tell her my impression of the tea because I wanted her unbiased opinion.  She was excited by the description of the tea on the box and brewed a cup for herself as she normally does every morning at the beginning of the work day.  She just stopped by my desk to give me her feedback.  Her main description of the tea was "bland."  She said it did not taste bad, but that it did not have much flavor.  In other words, her perception of this tea matched mine.  She further added that she would not buy this tea.  She didn't even want the rest of the box from me, so I'm simply going to put it out in our lunchroom in the hopes that perhaps some people where I work will enjoy it.  Who knows -- maybe this tea will impress at least one of my coworkers and they'll decide to purchase this tea.  I know I wouldn't.
