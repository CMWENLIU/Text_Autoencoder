Most of the time when I give this product to my cat she ends up vomiting it back up.  I asked my vet and she said that several of her patients have experience the same result.  I tried asking on the Internet if others had the same experience and was shocked by the number who said their cats responded the same.  I put the cat on a different product and she stopped her vomiting....  I would suggest that anyone using this product with poor results try a different cat food.  I filed a complain with the Federal Government.
