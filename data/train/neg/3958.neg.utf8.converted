These used to be so good and I used to buy them by the bunch but ever since they switched from Aspartame to Sucralose they are the grossest most disgusting thing out there. Nevermind I hate the taste of Sucralose But I am one of the few I guess where Sucralose makes me violently ill. The Wintergreen ones still are amazing though because they are using Aspartame still but I don't see that lasting very long. Almost every sugar free product is switching to Sucralose.
