This bottle reminds me of the kind of catsup that stands on its top.<br /><br />So, I take the plastic off of the top, and try to take off the inner seal, but it did not remove the way they showed it should come off, so I had to take a knife and go around the bottle opening to take it off.<br /><br />Then things really went downhill from there!!<br /><br />So, I put the top back on and shake the bottle as directed.  I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!  I couldn't even get through the whole bottle, in fact after only a few sips I was done wanting to even drink this drink!<br /><br />I don't know if this company makes other flavors as well, but I won't even be using this bottle, it will be thrown in the trash, where it belongs, at least to me.<br /><br />I thought this would be like Mio, but no, not in any way!!<br /><br />I rarely say the word "hate" period.<br /><br />I have been a member of the Vine Program for several years, and in that time I don't think I have ever said that word as a Vine member, nor in any review that I have given on Amazon, and I have been a customer on Amazon's site since 1998, that is how much I hate this product!!<br /><br />I can't think of one good thing to say about this product, sadly!<br /><br />I would give it a minus one if I could!!
