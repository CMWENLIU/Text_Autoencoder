This item is old and stale. It is so hard that my dog can't even make a dent in it. On top of that this is not a 10 inch flossie. They charge $7 claiming it is a 10 inch bully stick when in fact it is a 6-8 inch bully stick which sell at the store down the street from me for $3.50 and they are not stale.<br />What a rip off.
