this stuff is candy water - if you like sweet sugary drinks, then why even bother with kombucha? - isn't coke zero more what you're looking for? It's completely clear so there aren't any live cultures I can see, though I'm not sure they can survive in the ingredients listed on the bottle anyway - I know I can't. It's cheaper than GT Dave's variety, but it tastes nasty, all bubbly, minty and sweet at the same time. Like a party in my mouth with a bunch of uninvited guests - seriously, stay away!
