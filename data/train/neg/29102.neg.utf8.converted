This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NO6EA2">Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna In Spring Water, No Salt Added, 6 Ounce Tins (Pack of 24)</a> is very expensive and not unusually good. You can do better, even on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVI14">Natural Value Tuna, Solid No Salt Albacore in Water, 6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> but if you have to pay shipping, forget it, go to Costco!
