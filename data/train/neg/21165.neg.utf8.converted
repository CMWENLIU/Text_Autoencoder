This tea, while a step up from ordinary Lipton black tea, is NOT a gourmet tea.  If you want to taste what a great black tea tastes like try Tevana's black pearl or one of the 4-5 star rated black teas on Teaspring.coms website.  Great black tea is expensive, but it is worth it.  By comparison, Lipton's black pearl is quite bland, and lacks depth of flavor.
