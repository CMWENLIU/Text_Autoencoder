I bought this from Walmart (much cheaper there!) I bought the small dog dentastix and gave one to my 10 pound dog and one to the 5 pound dog. They loved them. The next day my little 5 pounder was very bloated in the morning. I freaked out because I've never felt that kind of bulge in her before. I took her to the vet and the bloating was gone by then. But after I returned home she had two more episodes like that that day. She was scared herself and extremely clingy that day and the next two days. The bloating happen once the next day but it was much less severe. I wasn't positive at the time if it was the dentastix but a few days later we did give her 1/4 of a stix and then I new it was that. The next day was bloating again but it was not bad I guess because she had a smaller piece. I also read later that the bag says it's not suitable for under 5 lbs. If it can make her that sick, I will assume it's probably doing something internally to my bigger pooch but just not showing physical symptoms. I would never buy this again.
