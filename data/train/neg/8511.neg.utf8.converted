These boxes are very small! Each is 1.2oz ... yes, you read that right, ONE POINT TWO OUNCES! About the size of a box of raisins. At $5/box you would think you would get something more substantial. I ordered these for a party, thinking the kids could share it. Ha! I'm embarrassed to even bring them out :(
