We were really looking forward to receiving and trying the oatmeal.  The 4-Pack arrived today.  The box in which they were shipped was busted up in a couple of places and the postal people had to tape it up.  One can was busted open and the oats were emptied out in the box. The other three cans were badly dented and the seam on one was coming open with oats leaking out.  I would have expected better packing for the type cans the oats come in.<br /><br />I will send another review after we've tried the oats from the surviving cans. This is a very big disappoinment and I hope future shipments will be packed better for shipping.  Please advise as to what type compensation you would offer.<br /><br />Hoping for better results in the future.
