My dog, a vizsla (50lb, pointer/retriever) loved this - but he also destroyed it.  He broke the rubber/gel molding in a few places within minutes such that he easily removed the included treat part.  I had stuck carrots, hotdogs, etc, in the "trap" center of the ball which gave him a little bit of a project.  Thus it seems to work okay as a puzzle for a little while.  However, I would bet this "trap" will only last a couple more uses as he seems to be able to break the product.<br /><br />I was hoping for a "puzzle" product to add variety to the kong he loves.  Unfortunately I wish now I had saved my money!  20+ dollars for 20+ minutes of dog fun, is not within my budget.<br /><br />Save your money.
