I had always bought Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce because I thought it was the original and the best.  Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.<br /><br />Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?<br /><br />Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS.
