I have followed the instructions provided exactly and the only thing that has grown is mold. The directions say to remove mold with a stick but it just keeps coming back( I think this is going to be the 4th time now.) I wish I had known what a piece of crap this item was. Oh and the dome they provide is a piece of thin plastic that doesn't even fit in the rock.
