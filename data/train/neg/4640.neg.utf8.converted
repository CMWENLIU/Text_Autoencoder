Our dog was getting bored of his food, so we decided to give this a try. I was admittedly drawn to the "Chef Michael's" signature look of the bag. The higher price per pound seemed to lead me to assume that it contained dog food of higher quality than the typical grocery fare.<br /><br />Once this arrived, my dog DID enjoy eating it for a bit-just as I like eating a number of things that aren't good for me, and should eliminate from my own diet-or else suffer the consequences...<br /><br />However, the beautiful, brightly-colored packaging of Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food (made by Purina) could not hide the ingredient list.<br /><br />The most obviously bad ingredients that jumped out at me was "poultry by-product meal" along with added colors (Red 40, Blue 2 and Yellow 5 &6).<br /><br />Beef does not belong as #1 (highest amount of ingredient)*Note:"pink slime" is still listed as beef, even when fed to humans, which further erodes my confidence in the type/form of beef being used here.  Actually, this dog food is mostly comprised of SOYBEANS-as Soybean meal, soybean flour and soybean protein concentrate (listed #2, #3 & #5)., but is broken down into three different categories in order to make it seem like Beef deserves the top slot.<br /><br />I noticed a similar treatment regarding the use of corn (like soybeans, it's another GMO crop when not organic and also serves as a filler that's not great for dogs) is broken down to #6 corn gluten meal & #7 ground yellow corn. Another unhealthy filler for dogs Wheat-was also divided into ground wheat and wheat flour.<br /><br />I did learn a new term for #10, "Animal digest" - A material which results from chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of clean and undecomposed animal tissue. The animal tissues used shall be exclusive of hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice and shall be suitable for animal feed. If it bears a name descriptive of its kind or flavor, it must correspond thereto.'<br /><br />Well, that's a lot of ingredients that scream "junk food!"My vet already told me to severely limit or avoid giving my dog such things. It will shorten a dog's lifespan by contributing to a number of illnesses.<br /><br />I did notice dried beans and potatoes buried in the ingredient list. I think a much better option for me is to boil him a potato and stick it in his dish along with his regular dried food every now and then.<br /><br />Update:<br />I forgot to mention that I didn't completely change his food-I only put a few of those rubbery bits that look like meat in with his other dry food to encourage him to eat his regular stuff. Even that little bit has made his stool VERY pale and the smell (that usually only has a mild odor) is now VERY STRONG!
