At roughly 55 cents (subscribed price) per unit, I unfortunately found out (too late) that this was at least 20 cents more than my local grocery store. I called Amazon and there was nothing they would do about it. I suggest checking out pricing at your local grocery store prior to purchasing this item. Don't make the same mistake I did. Its a good product, but sadly overpriced on Amazon.com
