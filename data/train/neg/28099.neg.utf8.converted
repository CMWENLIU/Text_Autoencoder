We were so excited to get these K-cups when they first came out. We got 1 iced coffee out of about 5 k-cups. For some reason, the glue that holds down the tin foil on the top of the pod does not stay glued during the brewing process and coffee grounds come spilling out into the Keurig and the coffee below every time. We ordered another box thinking it was just a bad batch and they also do the same thing. Its a bummer that these k-cups can't be made better. The one cup of iced coffee that we dd get turned out to be very good!<br /><br />We won't be using these in our Keurig anymore. It is a huge pain to clean up the mess it makes every time we try to brew one. We have tried over 10 different brands of k-cups (teas, hot chocolates, variety coffees, etc...) and have not had a single issue with any other k-cups.
