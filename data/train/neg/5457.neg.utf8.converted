I am writing this review to warn other dog owners of Blue Buffalo for dogs and what it has done to my  5 yr. old Miniature Dachshund named "Calla".  Back in late October 2011 I switched to Blue Buffalo after it was recommended by a family member. By mid-November Calla started to cry out at night.  We thought it might be a back issue and our "Three" yes three Vets agreed that it could be Intervertebral Disc Disease.  We had blood work done in November and everything looked fine with the exceptions that she was a "little" dehydrated. After months of treatments, with little to no improvement we thought it might be a stomach issue and I started to think about the timing of the change to Blue Buffalo, then I went and goggled "Consumer complaints about Blue Buffalo Pet Foods" and started to really connect the dots.  Yesterday she was diagnosed with "Pancreatitis" and needs to be in the hospital for days for treatment.  I have spent over 3K to this point and do not know if Calla will ever recover fully from this.  She was a completely healthy dog before we changed to Blue Buffalo and since have been living in Hell with nighty episodes.  Please read up on this issues people are having with this product before you buy. I wish I could give a product -minus 5 stars!!!!
