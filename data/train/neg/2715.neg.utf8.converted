If you're like my mom and have an intestinal condition that is aggravated by hard rough food or SMALL HARD SEEDS, don't buy this. The product is tasty enough, but she can't eat it due to it being packed with zillions of hard, miniscule seeds!<br /><br />Did someone change the rules? Last I checked, Preserves = ground up fruit. Jelly = seedless, pulpless... JELLY!<br />Red Currant Jelly is easy enough to find in the store, and it doesn't have any seeds. Is making black currant jelly a crime against nature or something? I can't find it anywhere!<br /><br />Is there anyone out there who makes a seedless Black Currant jelly? Anyone? *cricket cricket*<br /><br />Poor mom. She was so disappointed.<br /><br />Both the people who make this and the people who sell this need to find the highest points in their houses and jump off them onto something sharp for labeling fruit preserves as jelly.
