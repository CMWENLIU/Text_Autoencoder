I have never purchased spices online in my life. I've always had great service from Amazon and thought I would buy this product.  It was labeled as sweet, certified organic. First of all, it is not sweet. When added to tomato sauce a bitter after taste results on the tongue that does not go away. It barely smells like basil, it's bitter, and by itself, just placed on the tongue, tasted burned. I am not sure that even if it was not burned it would taste like basil. There is something off that goes beyond whether or not the basil burned in the drying process. Further, the leaves don't look burned or different than basil would generally look. The only way to tell that something is wrong is by noticing that the basil smell is very weak, that there is no basil flavor, and that using this product in sauce caused all the other ingredients to take on a bitter taste.  Even my husband, whose taste is off to begin with, said the product was flavorless. And because I opened the product and used it, I am not sure what to do about returning it. I've contacted Amazon and will wait and see what they say and will add more to this post depending on their response.  It doesn't seem enough to simply give me a refund. This basil was part of a larger batch and I can't see how they can continue to sell the existing items. It seems as if the entire batch/lot should be pulled.
