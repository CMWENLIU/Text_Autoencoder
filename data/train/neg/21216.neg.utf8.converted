The title says it all. I bought this as a secret santa gift for someone thinking it would be pretty neat. However, when I opened the box I was surprised at how much it cost for what is actual presented. If it weren't for the price, it would be an alright gift for someone (mostly a child). The only possitive thing to mention, is it shipped and arrived fast.
