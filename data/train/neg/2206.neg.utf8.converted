I have tried a couple of products from the Newman's Own line and, while I didn't necessarily think they were better than their competitors' products of the same type, they definitely held their own.  I sadly did not find this to be true with the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.<br /><br />When it comes to reviewing edible products, I find it helpful to compare and contrast with a similar product from another brand.  Because I love Dove Dark Chocolate (though I try many different kinds of dark chocolate), I used the Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate Bar as comparison (though I prefer the Dove Promise individual bites, it was easier to compare bar to bar).<br /><br />The Dove Dark Bar is 33 grams and the serving size is the entire bar.  The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar is 64 grams, nearly double the size of the Dove Bar, and still 1 serving is considered the entire bar.  Now, I am as much of a chocolate lover as the next person (probably more, in fact), but there is no way I need nor want to eat to consume 64g of chocolate in one sitting (especially sub-par chocolate).<br /><br />In most nutritional areas, especially fat and sat fat, the 33g Dove bar and the 64g Newman bar are almost equal if you consider that one is double the size of the other.  Newman's only clear win over the Dove bar is on cholesterol, having 0mg even though it is double the size of the Dove (which has 5mg cholesterol).  For those watching sugar, the smaller Dove bar has 17g while Big Daddy Newman has 37g.<br /><br />With the health business out of the way, let's get down to brass tacks--taste and texture:<br /><br />Texture.  I am accustomed to the smooth, creamy texture of Dove dark chocolate--I find its mouth feel luxurious.  My initial thought on biting into and chewing the Newman was waxiness--quite nasty at first but, once I got it chewed, it had a nicer mouth feel.  It is not creamy like Dove, but it loses the waxiness once chewed.<br /><br />Taste.  The only thing particularly pleasant to me about the Newman bar was the finish...the very last taste as you're swallowing it.  That has a deep rich dark chocolate taste and, despite the 37g of sugar in it, is not overly sweet, which is nice.  As for Dove, the entire process of biting into it, chewing it and swallowing it is enjoyable, so there is no contest.<br /><br />In summary, if you have your heart set on contributing to Newman's Own because of the good work they do, or you must have an organic chocolate bar, I suppose this will do.  But it is not, in my opinion, any competition for ANY other brand of good dark chocolate I have tried.
