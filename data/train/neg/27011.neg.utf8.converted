Don't waste your dogs time with these skinny minnie ones. My bulldog puppy shreds any one of these in about 10 minutes.<br />I ordered a pack of these only because Amazon discontinued the prime shipping on 12" Best Bully sticks (by BBS).<br />Absolutely no comparison. These guys dish the sticks out by the pound,not like BestBullySticks by the count, and the sticks by BBS are much thicker and keep my dog happily busy for a long time. Do yourselves a favor and get the good stuff from BBS.
