No doubt with the name John Wayne on the package the surviving Family is getting some coin out of each sale.  Did they taste the product?  I have had this same looking / tasting jerky many a time bought right out of the local Supermarket for the same price or less.. Translucent, soft (high moisture) and sweet.  If you like a dryer, smoked, slightly saltier jerky keep on looking. I should have waited for a few more reviews before pulling the trigger.
