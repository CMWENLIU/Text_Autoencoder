For starters, they didn't even ship the package until the last possible day they could have. To make it even better, the package, which I planned on having in time for Christmas, showed up three days AFTER the last day it should've arrived. And the best part? They didn't send 3x20 bags, they sent 2 boxes. That's one less box than the 3 I ordered and paid for. I'll never buy from them again.
