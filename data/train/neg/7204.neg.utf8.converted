Ordered a package of this cocoa around April 25th 2011.  It was fabulous.  Worthy of the 4 1/2 stars rating. Deep rich color.  Well sealed.  So good we needed to reorder about a month later.  So went back to same amazon site, same picture and did reorder.  This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of "Frontier" it said "Organic Herbal Essence".  Upon further investigation I went to my Amazon history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence.  Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Amazon that is only rated at 2-stars:[...]  I checked and can't return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call.  My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says "Frontier Cocoa" doesn't eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says "Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa".  it certainly doesn't turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa.  My main frustration is it is obviously a different company and different packaging, but no explaination or offer to refund. Seems like a "bait and switch".  My advice; take a pass on this one until they get it sorted out.
