I bought this for my German Shepherd who is a very destructive chewer. Within 10 minutes he'd popped out and eaten the treat, and then proceeded to tear the ball to little bits. If your dog likes to destroy toys I wouldn't recommend this. It definitely is NOT everlasting or durable and is way too expensive for only 10 minutes of enjoyment.
