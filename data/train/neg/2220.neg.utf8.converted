It says Light on Sodium but it should say Light on Flavor.  Grind up some tree bark, soak it in water and you have this this Lentil Couscous.  I put some of this in my dog's bowl to see what he thought of it after I forced three spoonfuls down.  I swear to God my Jack Russell dry heaved.  He walked away with half of the spoonful still in the bowl and he eats EVERYTHING.  If anything, this purchase was worth it just to see my dog do that.  I will never forget the look he game me that said 'Oh man, what did you just give me?!'.  Utterly hilarious.  The five left from the package are in the garbage.
