This candy is terrific especially for sugar free.  My only complaint was I bought three candy items from this vendor and they put them all in a bag which cost little to send it but they charged me an exhorbitant amount to ship it to me.  I won't buy from them again because of this.  they could have put them all in a priority mail box and got them to me faster and cost would have been little to even rush them to me. Terribly disappointed.
