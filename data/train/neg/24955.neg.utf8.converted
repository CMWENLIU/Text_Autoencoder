I gave it only two stars because I was disappointed in the amount of chocolate included in this basket. The packaging and presentation were very nice, but the contents left my wife looking for more. The candy was fresh and tasted good, but the portions were very small. The box and packaging weigh five pounds, but I would estimate there were only about 14 ounces or less of candy. For $39.99 plus $9.99 shipping, you could do much better shopping  at your local HEB or Rite Aid. Next time I will buy her a two pound Whitman's Sampler as they know how to pack a box with chocolates.
