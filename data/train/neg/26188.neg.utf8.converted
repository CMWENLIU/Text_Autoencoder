I bought this as a present for a very good friend. Because of the price I paid for it I was expecting something really nice. I was very disappointed to see that the kit was made up of very cheap items that if bought individually will come up to 1/3 of the price. The kit contains mainly ingredients not sushi making equipment. I would suggest that you look around for a better more reasonable set.
