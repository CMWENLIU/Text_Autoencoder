I wish it were easy for me to get a picture up for this review. The reason is that the mint is gangly to the point that I have not yet harvested it and it has been six weeks. The Cilantro did not even sprout, never mind that one. The dill consists of five little sprites, not exactly harvestable either. The two plants that did well are the regular and the red basil. We have been eating those and they taste good. Overall, I'd say this thing is a mixed bag. It is very easy to do, yes absolutely. It allows you to grow plants all year long in a controlled environment, yes. Does it work? In mcase it does not, I'd say it is pretty bad that it comes advertised a certain way - beautful ful plants and then when you do it yourself and you follow all instructions you will absolutely not get the same results. Personally I think it is not worth it, and I'd gladly take a refund. By the way, the replacement capsules for your next batch are 20 dollars! How do you spell rip off? I'd stay clear from this one.
