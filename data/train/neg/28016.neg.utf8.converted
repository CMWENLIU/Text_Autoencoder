I am a long time daily user of Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk, which is usually excellent. Just got my first case from Amazon, and it doesn't remotely resemble the same product purchased elsewhere. What I just received is very thin and watery, with no flavor, no solids, and no cream at all. Even if refrigerated, entire contents can be easily poured out, no spoon required. If you have used this product before, you understand the difference.<br /><br />So I don't know if this is counterfeit, or mislabeled, or maybe manufacturer sends the bad batches to Amazon? I wrote very polite email to Thai Kitchen just asking what's up with this, and gave batch #'s and purchase data etc. Unfortunately, I did not receive the courtesy of a reply.
