Ok, it's spam and I like spam so there's that.  Cheese? I like cheese too so I figured I should like spam with cheese!  I usually slice up the spam and put it on paper plates and paper towels and zap it for a few minutes in the microwave until the edges are crispy..  well if those little orange balls in the spam are cheese one would think they would melt after being zapped in the micro.. but they never do!  Not sure what they are and I don't really taste much "cheese" flavor in the spam.  Kind of bothers me that they don't melt so this spam won't be re-ordered again.  However I do highly recommend the Spam with BACON, that one's a real winner!
