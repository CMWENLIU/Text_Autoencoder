I have never written a one star review.  Ever.  Now, I've broken that hurdle with these bars.  I'd give them minus stars if I could.  They're that bad.  What putrid cesspool did these come from?  I've seen more appetizing grizzly bear poop that probably would've tasted better.<br /><br />I picked these up from the post office and was hungry and thought I'd try them.  Strawberry, organic and all natural -- sounded really good.  I eat organic and all natural foods, so it's not like I'm  unfamiliar with the concept.  The box said they were vegan.  Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word "super food" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.<br /><br />Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.  I could've gotten a cool book read and instead I opted for this.  Don't buy these, they're nasty.
