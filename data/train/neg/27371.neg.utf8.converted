Thought it would be more inclined toward the mushroom concentrate than any other thing. So when I started the water and put an average amount, the kind I would use on other base products, I was startled by the amount of salt I found myself tasting. Yes, if you use a much smaller quantity it does have its redeeming quality but, really, if I wanted so much salt on a base I would have ordered Salt Base. It works in small amounts and do not get me wrong: I am a dedicated fan of Minor's products but while plenty of others are above average on taste this one exceeds the allotted salt limits. I remember having to amplify my creation by a ratio of ten more cups of water to lessen the salty taste. Somewhere in there, lurking in the broth it made, a mushroom flavor was present. Yes, I agree with the first review (2006) on way too much salt. Therefore, 2 Stars at the most.
