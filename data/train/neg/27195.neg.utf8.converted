I was surprised to find out that Fancy Feast is shorting their 3 ounce can to 2.7 ounces (occasionally 2.8 oz) I was curious when the bulk and weight of other foods felt heaver.  I took a bowl, put it on our digital ounce scale tared it out so that is showd 0.00 ounces. Then I opened and emptied a can of Fancy Feast into the bowl being careful to get every last crumb of food out of the can and all of the liquid from the sides and top. Came out to 2.7 occasionally 2.8 ounces constantly.<br /><br />We purchase our groceries once a month so I have too much on hand considering that it is time for a switch to smething else. No more Fancy Feast unless they can convince me that their cans will contain at least 3.0 ounces from now on. I know it is difficult to change a cat to something else however, a cat will not starve itself.  My cat will be eating something else next month!!
