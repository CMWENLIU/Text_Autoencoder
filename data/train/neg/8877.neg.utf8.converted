I thought that I was buying the Vanilla Silk Soymilk because of the image, which is in the blue package.  I was sent the Very Vanilla, which is in a purple package, and Amazon would not let me exchange the product.  The Very Vanilla is extremely sweet, and my kids do not like it, so now I am stuck with 18 individual packs of Very Vanilla!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0RKG">Silk Soymilk, Very Vanilla, 8.25-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 18)</a>
