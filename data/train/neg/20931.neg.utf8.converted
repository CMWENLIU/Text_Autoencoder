I bought an 18 pack of these a month ago.  Twelve are left.  I cannot get my girls to drink this stuff, even though they just love Quik Chocolate or Strawberry.  To me, it tastes the same (and rather good) albeit sugary.  Fortunately I paid $10 for the pack, and the expiration date is in August (it's now early June), so they'll drink it all eventually ...
