This item was purchased for my mother who really wanted them. Imagine our surprise when worry beads, something meant to be held and rubbed on , broke in less than 3 days. Then imagine when the same breads were returned and you were given 1/3 of what you paid because they are claiming you sent back something with nothing the matter with it. This company sells junk and then lies on top of it. Shop elsewhere or you will have to deal with all kinds of JUNK.
