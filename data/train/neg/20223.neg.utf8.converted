I am sorry to say I recv'd a box of these as a Christmas gift. They were simply awful and I tossd away. However, what saved the day was that my husband and I buy at "TJ's" Trader Joe and you can buy a truffle similar to this-- box looks kinda the same BUT ITS NOT!! texture taste and shelf life (they get eaten quick) are wonderful!!  packaged as a lot (not individually)in a cellophane bag then the cardboard packaging-is fine. We serve them now at all our dinner parties and just for nibbles.. Go to TJ's.
