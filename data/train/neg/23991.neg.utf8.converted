UPDATE - 1 week later: DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY! They still owe me 64oz of Hershey Kisses. They responded to my email stating that they would send me the remainder of my product and they have not.  Then I get an email from Amazon that I can't contact the seller because they are no longer selling with Amazon.  Well hello...they are selling under Amazon just under a different name!  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!<br /><br />I ordered 4 bags of these which would mean I should get 224oz of Hershey kisses. That is not what I received. Instead of four 56oz bags of kisses. I received four 40oz bags. That's 160oz. Ummm. Somebody owes me 64oz of Hershey Kisses!  I ordered them for a baby shower and now I don't have the supplies I need. Did I mention the label stated it was a Walmart order made by someone else and shipped to me?  I don't think I ordered this from Walmart.
