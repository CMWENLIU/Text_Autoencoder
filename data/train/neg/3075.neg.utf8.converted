I tried this after trying the packet.  I was so impressed with the packet, I thought "I can drain this, and for a little less sloth I get more servings for less cost."  It's... not the same.  Upon opening the can, there was a round "thing" looking at me.  I assumed it was just cartiledge, then while eating this on a sandwich I pulled out 5 more, in a row.  Turns out... I think they were spine parts.  Add to that the skin and bones, and I'd rather pay more for the packet thank you very much.  I LOVE salmon, but not enough to eat any more of this.
