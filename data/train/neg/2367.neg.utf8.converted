These are inexpensive rawhide bones. They were of decent quality up until the last batch I bought.<br /><br />The centers don't seem to be made with rolled rawhide any longer, but they seem to be a tube filled with rawhide scrap now.<br /><br />Will not buy any longer unfortunately. They used to be a great buy.
