Although the product is convenient and the taste is good, once I was able to review the ingredients I would not have purchased this product.  The second ingredient is High Fructose Corn syrup and the more troubling third ingredient is partially hydrogenated Oil or trans fat.  All trans fat products, even products that show zero trans fat but have partially hydrogenated oil as an ingredient are products I don't purchase.  Even trace amounts cause metabolic issues.  When will food companies understand that they need to use more natural ingredients and not chemically altered ingredients?  Buyers need to help send the right message and let these products sit on the shelves.  It's voting with your dollar.  Buyer beware.
