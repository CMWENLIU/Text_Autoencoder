I am disappointed to have to give this product an unfavorable review. The licorice has barely a hint of pomegranate yet all the calories associated with a super sweet licorice. Also, the licorice in the package I received in July, 2011, which was dated as "Best Before March 2012" I though was kind of stale and a bit hardened.
