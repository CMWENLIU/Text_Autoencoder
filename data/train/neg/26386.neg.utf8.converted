I have been baking gluten free for years. I normally use a different brand but was trying to save a few bucks. You all know gluten free baking is expensive!  So I make cupcakes to take to a picnic. I have used this recipe 100 times if not more. Never had an issue. Batch 1, a total disaster. I try again because I figure I was distracted. Batch 2 another flop.  I go, cupcakeless to the picnic. I try again Monday morning when everything is quiet and STILL a disaster. I order my normal brand and it gets here Wed. (thank you Amazon Prime ;) ) and use the same recipe and it turned out great!  I was shocked that a different brand could lead to such drastic differences in the final product!
