Beefeater products are made in china. I was fooled when there site info said it was USA rawhide. The first one I gave my Bull terrier, made her sick with diarrhea. I threw away the rest of the package. Please buy only the USA made chews for your pets. They don't have the chemicals & the hide is much thicker & doesen't flake & and break off in little chunks. But , please supervise your dog when they're chewing any rawhide, toy, etc. As they can get a large piece caught in there throat.
