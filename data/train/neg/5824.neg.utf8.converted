I bought five bars of marzipan.  They didn't come in a pack.  There were five in a hand-taped plastic baggie.  They were packed so they didn't rattle around and get broken in shipment, but they weren't air-tight by any means and were very stale.  The almond filling was dry and the chocolate cracked and fell into pieces when I sliced it.  I gave some to friends at Christmas, and was embarrassed to discover the quality.  I have had this product before and it was moist and lucious and the dark chocolate coating was melt-in-your-mouth creamy, so I have a standard for comparison.  I was terribly disappointed and will not be buying it through Amazon again.
