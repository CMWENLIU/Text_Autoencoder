I read many of the reviews on this coffee before purchasing it & the reviews convinced me to buy it. Perhaps these people have never had a good cup of coffee. The name says it all...Poor Man's Blend. It looked & tasted as if they mixed the leftovers from the day & sealed them into a 5 lb bag. Not something I will order again. I look forward to a decent cup of coffee when I wake up. Unfortunately, I had to buy some good beans to mix with this to make it drinkable. Sorry, but I didn't enjoy it. Maybe one of Coffee Bean Direct's other blends would be more suitable.
