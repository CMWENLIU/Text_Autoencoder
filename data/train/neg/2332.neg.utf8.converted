I enjoy tea.  I enjoy ginger-- ginger bread, ginger cookies, ginger in certain food recipes.  I've heard it has alot of nutritional benefits.  So I thought I'd give this tea a try.  The instructions say to mix it with 250 mL of hot water.  I followed the instructions exactly.  Took a sip.  WHOA!!!!  Really, really strong!  I waited it to cool a bit, thinking maybe the hot temperature was affecting my opinion.  When it was warm (not cold), I tried again.  Still too much.  So I added water.  Still too strong.  Added more water.  Nope.  It got to the point that I just gave up.  I didn't like the flavor, and I didn't like the intensity. I'm sure there are those who are experienced ginger tea drinkers who might like this, but I won't be joining them.
