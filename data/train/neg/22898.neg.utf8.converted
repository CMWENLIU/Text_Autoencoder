I tasted these and thought they were the just as good as the sugar ones, THEN,,, about an hour later I was running to a bathroom.  My stomach started cramping and making all sorts of noises. I'll leave the rest out.  I only want to say, try a sample before you buy a big bag of these.  You may or may not have the digestive system to handle this.  Oh, by the way, I only ate about 10 bears...
