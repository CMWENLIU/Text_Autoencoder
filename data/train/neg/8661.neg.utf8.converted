Although I am sure these are tasty, they also have corn syrup in them. If you start going through your panty's you will find corn syrup in the majority of things in there- from<br />breads to cereals to juice drinks. Corn syrup is a contributing factor to diabetes and obesity. There are fruit snacks (annies bunnies) that are all natural and will assure better<br />health. The corn syrup distributers/manufacturerers want you to believe our bodies process sugar the same as corn syrup; that is just not true.
