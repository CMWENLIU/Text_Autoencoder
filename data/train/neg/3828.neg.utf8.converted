Anyone that likes this must have never had coconut water.  Imagine a lovely chilled chunk of watermelon on a hot day, nice and refreshing and slightly sweet - real, fresh coconut water is like that.  Now take a watermelon jolly rancher, drop it in a water bottle, and let it dissolve for a while - that's what Sobe Coconut Water drink is like, just with a sickly sweet coconut taste.  To be fair, it says it's "with" coconut water but I think they decided they could cut cost by adding artificial flavors.  Save your money and go to your local asian supermarket and under a $1 a pop, you can find a brand that suites your dietary needs and taste buds.
