Quick, someone please hand me a towel so I can wipe this off my tongue.  The can says: "It's what soda should always have been".  If all "regular" sodas were like this, sodas would be only tolerated, not drunk by the gallons by a large percentage of the population.  That's not to say that "regular" sodas are good, I don't like them anymore either since eliminating high fructose corn syrup from my diet.  This has a very bland taste & a horrible cling-to-the-back-of-the-tongue aftertaste.  I use stevia all the time & was surprised at the odd flavor.  This also does not taste anything like Mt. Dew.
