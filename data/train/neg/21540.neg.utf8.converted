There is an odd aftertaste with this product that you don't get with fresh key limes.  It ruined 2 pies and I just gave up and went to the store and luckily we still had key limes in Colorado.  Such a shame because I wanted this to work, but if you are looking for the best key lime pie that you can make, stick with the fresh key limes.
