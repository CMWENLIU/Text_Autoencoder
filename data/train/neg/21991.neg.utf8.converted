Just in case you were wondering about the "extra peppermint" that was so important it needed to be added as a selling point - it is no more than a single mint like you get in a restaurant with your check. Really pathetic marketing ploy.<br /><br />Starbuck's K-Cups are way too expensive for what they taste like. Won't buy again and certainly not from this seller and its shameless tactics.
