I was intrigued by the idea of combining cinnamon and blueberry. I was inclined to like the cereal, as those are both things I like quite a bit.<br /><br />I bought a box, brought it home. My wife happened to open it up first. She took a spoonful with some milk--and got that look on her face, and put her bowl and spoon down. "This is disgusting. It tastes like cardboard."<br /><br />You have to understand my wife is a supertaster--it's a real thing, look it up!--and so is supersensitive to flavors. She thinks plain Special K tastes quite sweet. She will happily eat simply a bowl of white rice for dinner.<br /><br />But in this cereal, she detected no flavors at all.<br /><br />Bizarrely, I thought "no, it couldn't be that bad. It's blueberry! And cinnamon! What could possibly go wrong?"<br /><br />The next morning I tried a bowl myself.<br /><br />It's disgusting. It tastes like cardboard.<br /><br />If there's cinnamon in it you could have fooled me. There are some little dried blueberries in it, but if you have anything but them in your spoonful, the blueberry flavor is overwhelmed by the styrofoam taste.<br /><br />Styrofoam plus cardboard plus half-sweetened sugar-smacks cereal. That is what this tastes like.<br /><br />I don't know what the people giving this positive reviews are smoking. Note that most of them even admit they prefer to add their own ingredients though...
