My german shepard can catch treats well so I thought this would be a fun toy since indestructable toys are so hard to come by and this would entertain us both for a bit.  The treats don't shoot far or straight (or sometimes at all) and my dog (who is usually quite a good catcher) hasn't been able to get a one.  Total waste of money!
