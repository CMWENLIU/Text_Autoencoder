Recently tried this milk chocolate k cup from Amazon. The only thing this drink has in common with chocolate is its color.Of the 13 items listed as ingredients  cocoa is number 8.It has a chemical smell and a chemical taste.If you buy this junk don't say you were not warned. It does not deserve ANY stars.
