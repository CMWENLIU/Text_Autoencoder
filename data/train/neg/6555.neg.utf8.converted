When the tree - a gift - arrived, I was thrilled. It is absolutely gorgeous. However, I soon realized that it is a tree that MUST be kept outdoors. The main description on Amazon did NOT say this - I had to read the detailed description. Because there are dozens of bonzais to look at on Amazon, I must have skipped over this. Now, I have a gift for someone who would LOVE to have a bonzai, but who lives in an apartment so cannot keep it outdoors. I'm incredibly disappointed. The problem is not with the quality of the tree, which is wonderful. The problem is with Amazon's description, which has left me in the lurch just a few days before I had to give it as a gift.
