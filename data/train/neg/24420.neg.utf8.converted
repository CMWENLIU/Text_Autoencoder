I love this product for how natural and whole it is. I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.<br />However, I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals, some send, etc. These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it, it will sound crunchy and even painful.<br />Unfortunately, I've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it wasn't just a bad batch, and they all had crystals that don't dissolve.<br />I'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months. The chips are microscopic, but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth. Also, if your teeth are naturally prone to sensitivity, I would presume this product would irritate them even more.<br /><br />Great idea, but the filtration process leaves little bit too much of inpurities behind.
