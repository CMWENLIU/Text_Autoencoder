I had heard so much about this natural sweetener that I was anxious to try it since the artificial ones I didn't want to touch at all, especially with their awful aftertaste. I suppose if it comes down to a choice between this stuff and artificial sweeteners this stuff is better for your body. The taste absolutely turned me off! Using more doesn't make things sweeter, it only makes the taste worse. Since I only use sugar in my coffee which I drink without anything else added, I find no sugar, just black is better than this!
