Is it just me or does there seem to be a LOT of sauce in their spaghetti these days?! In fact, the whole can is practically tomato flavored water and at around $1.40 per can, not a very good deal at all! If you want to give your kids a GOOD spaghetti lunch, buy some tupperware and send them to school with that! In a similar sized container you could pack in about 5 times as much actual spaghetti!  In fact, I dare everyone out there to do this little test at home:  Open up a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti with meatballs, dump it in a collander to drain off the sauce into a bowl. Then look at what is left over. Put this on a plate and then ask yourself if THAT looks like $1.40 worth of pasta!! Nuff said! I won't even go into the taste of this garbage. Give me a break!
