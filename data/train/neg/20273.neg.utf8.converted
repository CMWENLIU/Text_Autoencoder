I can't fault the product, it's very nice.  But this experience is not a happy one.<br /><br />Every once in a while, you get gouged.<br /><br />That is the case here.  $5.77 for the product and nearly $10 for USPS shipping.<br /><br />Come on!  The small flat-price box is less than $5.  You're telling me that there's another $5 in packing and labeling?  Nuh-uh.<br /><br />No tracking (that's worthy of the name) from USPS either.<br /><br />This vendor is on my "never again" list.
