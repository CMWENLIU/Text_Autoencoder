Parthenon Foods shipping from Chicago to here was exhorbitant - it cost much more than I paid for the product.  Only 1 type of shipping was allowed, and I did not need it so fast.  I would have preferred shipping to my mailbox at a lower shipping cost.<br /><br />What arrived was not exactly what I ordered. I ordered 2, 3 liter bottles of sunflower oil, said to be in stock.  I received 6 1 liter bottles, without explanation for the substitution.  I did not complain because the end amount of oil was the same.  However, no-one contacted me about the substitution and asked if it was okay.  Overall, the oil seems okay, but this is not the ideal way to do business !!
