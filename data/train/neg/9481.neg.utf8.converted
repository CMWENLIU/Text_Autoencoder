My cat is pretty laid back, but when it comes to pills, it is a two person job to "pill the cat".  The pill pockets worked exactly two times before the cat got wise to the ruse and refused to have anything to do with them.  He won't even eat a pill pocket as it comes straight out of the package now.  You might improve your odds by making certain that you  pinch the treat shut with the other hand, so that the outside does not pick up the flavor or smell of the pill.  I did this, but I think that the cat still knew that there was something "funny" about this treat.  Maybe my cat really doesn't like Salmon flavor, but he did eat them twice.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />I decided to give the Pill Pockets one more try, this time success!<br /><br />The key, as I hinted above, is that you must take extreme care not to get the flavor or odor of the pill on the outside of the treat. If you are right handed putting the pill in, use your left hand to pinch the treat shut.<br /><br />Even better is this sequence of steps:<br /><br />1. Withhold food from the cat for three to four hours so he is good and hungry.<br /><br />2. Lock the cat in another room so he can't see or smell what you are doing.<br /><br />3. Get out the pill and prepare it (such as cutting in half if this is the doseage given), then set it on the counter.<br /><br />4. Wash your hands carefully, using a soap that the cat doesn't mind, rinse your hands well and dry with a paper towel or clean dish towel.<br /><br />5. Use tweezers to insert the pill into the Pill Pocket, do not use your hands!<br /><br />6. Now pinch the Pill Pocket shut, being careful not to touch the pill.<br /><br />7. Now feed it to the cat.<br /><br />I first thought that when the cat started chewing, he would spit out the pill, but he didn't! He licked his nose, which is a sign that he swallowed everything.<br /><br />Based on this new experience, I have upgraded my rating to three stars. The product would get five stars if the package had given instructions similar to these.
