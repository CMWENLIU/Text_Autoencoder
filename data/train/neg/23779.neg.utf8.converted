I ordered these because they were described online as Brachs brand and I was specifically looking for Brachs.  These are definitely not Brachs candy corn.  They look and more importantly, taste totally different.  They do not look like this display picture, and they have a sweeter, waxy, artificial taste.  I contacted the seller and said that I wanted to exchange them for Brachs and he told me that these were Brachs.  I have to absolutely disagree with him.  It sounds silly, but I know my candy corn and these are definitely not Brachs brand.
