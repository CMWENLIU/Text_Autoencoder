We like mangosteen and we have bought cans of it imported from Asia in our local chinatown.  We tried this Organic product with high hopes.  First we found this mangosteen to be smaller in size than the cheaper stuff we buy locally.  Furthermore, in some cans this mangosteen has a redish tint; in others they are the white color we would expect.  But the last can we openned had an intact insect-apparently a large ant-attached to a mangosteen.  Unless you want to eat insects, there is no reason to buy this product.
