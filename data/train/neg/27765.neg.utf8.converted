I bought this product because I was desperate to find a gluten free, casein free, and nut free product.  I bought a case of this flour and the muffin mix. I've tried cooking it several different ways, and everything stays gooey in the middle.  I even tried a bananna muffin recipe on the bag, and it was not good.  I'm giving it two stars for being a dedicated peanut free facility.  But, I do not like the product.  I have not tried making it into a cookie yet, so I will try to use my four that way since the other reviews say it was good in cookies.  Otherwise I'm stuck with a case of each!!!
