Nutritious and Delicious? I don't think so.<br /><br />it Contains sucralose AKA Splend and Sodium Benzoate. I'd hardly consider these nutritious.<br /><br />Secondly, it tasted like I was drinking a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QQMW">Flintstones Childrens vitamin</a>. Yuck.<br /><br />Third, it's supposed to be an energy drink. it did nothing but give me a bad headache.<br /><br />There's really not much to say. I can't suggest this. it's terrible. Avoid
