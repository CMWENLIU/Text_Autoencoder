I have wanted to try flavored coffee but didn't want to take the chance of buying a whole box and not likely the flavor. This was a good solution. I read the few reviews and took chance. Well I'm a little dissapointed. Most of the box expires by December which isn't to big of deal because I'll have them gone by then, but the assortment sucked. At least a third of them were the same flavor from the same maker. When you add that to the number of "french vanilla" ones that I got it's at least 2/3 of the box. I wanted an assortment, not mostly french vanilla made by a few different companies. I think I have 5 or 6 that weren't french vanilla. Oh and top it off, those 5 or 6 are the only different brands too. The rest of the box is Van Houtte coffee.
