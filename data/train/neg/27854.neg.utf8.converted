I ordered this item in order to get the supposed substantial savings as this item was a special offer.<br />The box arrived and after opening....<br />it was as though there had been a powdered chocolate EXPLOSION inside the shipping box.<br />It was ALL over the place!<br />None of the actual drink mix boxes were opened NOR did they appear to be damaged upon first inspection<br />Upon further inspection, I found that in several of the 6 boxes included in the shipment that  the individual packages of beverage mix had  NON sealed sides on the product envelopes inside the sealed boxes. Apparently during shipping these envelopes leaked out most of the chocolate drink powder which then leaked out of the boxes...<br />Perhaps this is WHY they were on sale as a special?<br /><br />Had to throw 3 of the boxes away...<br />NO savings on this order!!<br />and, apparently no compensation for that either...per Amazon rules.<br /><br />Very disappointed & am contacting the Swiss Miss people accordingly.
