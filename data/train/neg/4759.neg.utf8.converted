I bought some of these from a vending machine at my work today. I want my quarter back. I tasted a red one. It tasted like how horse manure smells. I have no clue why they'd call these Lotsa Sours when they aren't sour in any way shape or form. I thought maybe one of the other flavors would be better. I was wrong. The green one had a slight hint of possibly a different fruit flavor, but it was still overshadowed by that same much stronger flavor remeniscent of roadapples. I handed the rest over to my boyfriend who eats anything including old leftovers rescued out of the garbage. Even he thinks they taste terrible.<br /><br />$45 spent on buying these in bulk is $45 spent on something you'll probably be spending the rest of your life trying to get rid of. Just taste them before you buy them, and you will know precisely what I mean.
