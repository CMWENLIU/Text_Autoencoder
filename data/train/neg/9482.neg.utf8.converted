Our cat is pretty mellow with the exception of taking pills.  We tried pill pockets and it worked only twice.  I was VERY, VERY careful with not contaminating the pill-pocket with the medicine taste.  Cats, unlike dogs, are chewers, and once he chewed the medicine in the pill pocket, he stopped eat them altogether.  Another time he ate around the pocket and left the pill!  Later, I tried with just an empty pill pocket and he gulped that up!  Arghh.  I finally resorted to crushing the tablet and mixing it with a very small amount of baby food (ham or some kind of meat) and now I just smear it on the cat's teeth or put it directly inside his month (he won't eat the baby food with the meds otherwise). SUCCESS!  Thank goodness we found a way to administer the pill, since our cat has to have a daily dose for 60 days!
