I bought both Safer and Pro-pest brands of moth traps for closet moths. Both are basically flypaper with a pheromone purported to attract male moths. I installed Safer moth traps in one closet and Pro-pest in a different closet. After 24 hours the Safer trap had caught NO moths while the Pro-pest trap had caught 12 moths. To make sure this was not due to location I switched the traps between closets. Again after 24 hours the Safer trap had caught NO moths while the Pro-pest trap had caught about 10 moths. It has now been a month and the Safer trap has still caught ZERO moths. I also have regular flypaper in both closets, which also catches moths in both closets. So to sum up ...... Don't buy the Safer traps.
