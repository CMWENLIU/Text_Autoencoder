I was so happy with this food before petcurean changed the ingredients. The salmon and oatmeal was the only dry food I've found (and I've tried nearly all of the quality brands) that worked for my very food sensitive dog. I liked that it had limited ingredients and was perfect for him since it was only salmon, canola oil, oatmeal, and kelp. Petcurean must be getting cheap or have been bought out by someone because now they're including tons of fillers in this food for "sensitivity and shine" that we're not previously there like alfalfa, potatoes, kamut flakes, and quinoa, all of which, other than the quinoa, my dog can not have if I am to avoid him chewing himself up. I am so disappointed! I searched long and hard for a food that worked for him. We went through three big bags with my dog looking his best and then the fourth bag arrived from amazon today and along with the packaging being changed, I noted the ingredients had also. Completely useless as a hypoallergenic food for my dog and not worth giving to him to have him destroy his currently beautiful coat. What a waste of money. The food search continues I guess.<br /><br />On a side note-since petcurean's go recipe has gone to crap I have discovered "back to basics grain free instinct" , another limited ingredient dog food, and so far am happy with the results. I hope they don't change their recipes!
