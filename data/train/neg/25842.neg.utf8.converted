I don't know how everyone feels about products from China, but I am getting sick of seeing "Made in China" on everything we buy. But I draw the line when it comes to food from China! Especially with all the recalled items that were deemed unsafe, so I don't hold much faith on their food safety. Amazon please list the country of origin on food items because if I knew these oranges were from China, I would not have bought them!
