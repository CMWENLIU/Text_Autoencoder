Although these candies did have a very good flavor I was very disappointed.  I had to dispose of almost half because the candies were crushed; I assumed it was poor packaging and didn't go through the hassle of trying to get them replaced.  I just think it is probably something that needs to be purchased locally instead of by mail.
