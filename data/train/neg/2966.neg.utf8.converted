This is outrageous that the compound sold here can be added to meat parts to make them a "whole" product. The separation of parts to be rejoined is HIGHLY likely to cause sickness in people, such salmonella, e coli, etc. This product should be BANNED in the US and everywhere else, as it is a human hazard, not only in chemical composition, but in the practice of butchery in every place worldwide. Really.
