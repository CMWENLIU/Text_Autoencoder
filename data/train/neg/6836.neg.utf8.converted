If you look at the picture for this type of Chex Mix you see the OLD version of Bold Party Blend, which is what I ordered and wanted.<br /><br />What I received instead is the new packaging with the new, far less robust, recipe. (look in your local grocery isle for the new packaging).<br /><br />On top of not getting what I expected, a first from Amazon I might add, there are no returns for food items (probably other items as well, but I haven't run into them yet), most likely for excellent reasons in today's world.<br /><br />I am, however, disappointed. If Amazon had changed the picture I would have known it was the new mix, and wouldn't have ordered it.<br /><br />General Foods, who's product this is, was of no help either.
