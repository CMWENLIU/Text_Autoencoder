This has a very, very strong taste - almost like licorice (?) which I don't like. If you put honey in tea or something similar, it will flavor it noticeably. It's difficult for me to even want to use it because of how the taste stays with me. But it is a very smooth consistency and it hasn't sugared in the time I have had it (several months).
