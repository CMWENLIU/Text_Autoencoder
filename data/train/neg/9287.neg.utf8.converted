Monin did a good job of bait and switch.  No ingredients listed on Amazon.  No artificial ingredients listed on their website.  Lo and behold, the bottle arrived and on the label were both artificial flavor and colors.  Never again will I buy from this company. (They have since updated the list of ingredients on Amazon and their website.)
