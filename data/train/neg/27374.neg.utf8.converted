I was a Mrs. May's regular for years.  I ordered a case of their cashew crunch directly from them and it arrived in a box that said:  Made in China.  I wrote them and, to give them credit, unlike most American companies today, they responded honestly and without the typical excuses. They told me they'd produced their products in China for years with no problems.  My dogs were affected by the Chinese dog food poisoning incident and I did not want to subject my family to the possibility of tainted food purchased in the belief I was giving them something healthy. Also, the fuel used to ship these from China to the U.S. makes them less than viable candidates for sustainability. I already work very hard to ensure than things purchased on Amazon come from areas near my home.
