I found a recommendation of Honest Tea in a book and wanted to try some.  Thought that $ 34.99 for 12 ($2.92 each) was a lot of money but the stuff is all natural.  But then I bought 3 bottles at a local gas station for $2.09 each.  If it can be bought a a gas station convenience store for less than amazon there is a problem.
