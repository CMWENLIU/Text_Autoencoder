Was very disappointed in the taste of this.  I bought it for my 17 year old son for Christmas.  He had always said he would love a giant gummy bear and was surprised when he opened it Christmas morning. That was until he tore it open and took a bit of it. I could tell by his face it wasn't what he expected.  I tried it as well... it taste like medicine. Nothing like a normal gummy bear. Very disappointed that this will be money going in the trash.
