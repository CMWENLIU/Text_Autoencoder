We bought a gallon of this oil, because the market had a promotion($16.50 per gallon).  My wife disliked it immediately, saying it lacked any real flavor. After a taste test, I had to agree. Olive oil has so much flavor, easily recognized by even a young tongue. The other 2 olive oils in our house were brimming with more olive flavor. So now we use the Genco only for cooking, and use it sparingly. When real flavor is called for, we use the other brands. Take your own taste test; you might be surprised. To be fair, maybe we got a batch of Genco that was "off" a bit. I imagine olive oil producers are subject to the whims of nature, and maybe our gallon was from a less than stellar harvest of olives.<br /><br />Larry (Italian in San Francisco)
