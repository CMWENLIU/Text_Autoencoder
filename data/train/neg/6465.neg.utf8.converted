These were my first bully sticks and both my puppy and I were not impressed. The average diameter was less than 0.5" so thick is pushing it. My dog actually wouldn't even finish the things and they were donated to the neighbor's dog. Ordered other "thick" bully sticks from another site and they averaged an inch in diameter and my dog loves them.
