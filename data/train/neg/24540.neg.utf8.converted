I purchased these because the picture on the package looked really good.  You would not believe how awful they are.  If you are set on buying them, you will soon find out. The amount of cake you mix up looks like a tablespoon of cake batter and these have trans fat in them.  They taste awful and do absolutely nothing to satisfy a chocolate lover.<br /><br />There is nothing in them.  Waste of money.
