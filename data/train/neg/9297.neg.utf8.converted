Respect to My-Kap for being the first ones to liberate the Keurig machine for non-Keurig use (I'm brewing Teeccino, woot woot!), but the technology is really dated now compared to the competition.  First of all, using old K-Cups is weak.  The whole point of this product is to brew your own favorite blend, so why would you want to have to buy K-Cups at all?  Second of all, the My-Kaps don't really do much to solve the biggest problem with One-Cup brewing: the trash.  Sure you reuse a K-Cup once or twice, but the filter only lasts so long, and the replaceable one's My-Kap sells are terrible.  Re-useable filter-cups like the Solofill or eKobrew make more sense and are easier to use.<br /><br />If you feel compelled to buy these things nonetheless, don't get swindled into buying an 18-pack, or even a three-pack.  They are selling these in massive quantities, but YOU ONLY NEED ONE.  The Kaps are hard plastic, and there is no reason to buy a bunch unless you want to play Pogs with them.
