I bought this for my baby (since she didn't have teeth at the time) thinking that it would be a good source of iron. Unfortunately, the ingredients did not mention that there are RAISINS in this product. The combination of apples, raisins and cinnamon is not a good idea at all. My baby actually started gagging when I put a spoonful in her mouth. When I tasted it myself, I felt like doing the same. This mixture is just too sweet because of the raisins. There is also a very strong flavor of cinnamon. I usually add some cinnamon to the food she eats so I know that she likes cinnamon if its in a normal quantity. I tried diluting the flavor in several ways, but it's no use. The cinnamon flavor was still too strong. I still have about 8 more jars to experiment with. I'm thinking I'll give it one more try by mixing apple puree with a little bit of this mixture and see if the baby will take it or not. Otherwise, it's all going in the trash. I hate wasting food but there doesn't seem to be another option.
