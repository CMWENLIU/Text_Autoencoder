One of the things I have always done sith Mac n Cheese is add veggies to it. I love the flavor of the cheese with veggies. One of the biggest complaints I have always had with frozen or boxed foods is the one piece of veggie they will put in a container for 4 and call it a dinner. Buy your own veggies and add it yourself. You will then get a complete serving of veggie.<br />I don't even know what they put in this box. It sure did not look or taste like broccoli. How and why do these companies get away with this?
