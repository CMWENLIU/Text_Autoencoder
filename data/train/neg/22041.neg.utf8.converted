The name of the product, "Herbox Granular Sodium Free Beef Bouillon," sounds like it will be healthy for you. You can read the word "Beef" on the front of the jar.  When the product arrived I noticed that the jar clearly says "Beef Flavor."  The picture on the website clearly does not show the word "flavor."<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00473P4X4">Herbox Granular Sodium Free Beef Bouillon, 3.3-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> This product is just a bunch of chemicals and does not have any beef in it. I cannot use this product to flavor my soups and stews because it will make me sick and give me headaches because of the chemicals. I am very disappointed.
