I had ordered 2 bottles of the hot sauce and also paid 1-3 day shipping on it.  I actually paid more for the shipping than I did for the 2 bottles of sauce.  I did not receive my packagae until 9 days later but I was shorted a bottle.  I wrote to the company and told them of this.  They agreed to sending me another bottle free of shipping.  Mind you, this is a $5 bottle of sauce.  Three days later I receive an email stating that they reviewed their camera recording and it was clear that there was 2 bottles shipped together and that the weight of the package was correct for the amount shipped.  So they insinuated I had lied to them.  I am not sure what happened on their end, but there was only 1 bottle of sauce in my package.  Not sure why someone would lie over a $5 bottle of sauce so they could get it for free.  It is a shame because granted, the sauce is hot but good, and they would have received several orders from some from friends, but knowing what the company has accused me of can guarantee no other orders will be placed.  Word of mouth is a company's advertisement, and it is unfortunate this company will not be getting any positive feedback from me.  I have never been accused of lieing and take great insult over it that this company would do so.  You can be assured I will be ordering from some other company in hopes that the shipping rate is equal to the time paid for, and where the company sends the correct amount ordered.  Makes me wonder why the company is so upset to lose the $5 bottle that is owed to me due to their mistake, possibly because they have treated other customers with the same respect which is none!!
