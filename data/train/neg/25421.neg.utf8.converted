Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Ok. While I love Loma Linda/Worthington products I thought perhaps I would give another company a try and ordered the mix pack. I know gluten based veggie meats can be kinda icky but I like the option. We eat vegan at home and we are flexitarians away from home. First can I tried were the breakfast sausage. These are the most edible option they offer. These actually taste good. Then I tried the chicken dinner and the steak dinner and the turkettes and I became disenfranchised with this company's products. The gluten comes out in a watery 'gravy' as they call it which is flavorless and really gross. They could add a thickener and some flavorings but they don't.  The grain meat/gluten product is tasteless and has a very basic texture and is not creative in anyway to conform to the schmeat they are trying to replicate for vegans.<br /><br />Stick with Loma Linda or Worthington, they have some awesome products like ground meat and hotdogs/links that are great for use in everyday cooking. If you are looking for cans of different types of schmeat that all turn out to be the same lumps of brown gluten with no flavor, try Cedar Lake products.
