Not the REAL Ceylon Tea Company. Definately a knock off. Very embarassing to get this for my mom as a gift and have her tell me how aweful it is. I tried one of the strawberry (which was different from the one she told me was aweful) and it tasted like regular black tea. It didn't even smell like strawberry. At this point I am assuming that all of the differnt flavors are the same. The string came off of the tea bag and overall I can honestly say (right down to the packaging) that this tea is really cheap and no good. Don't waste your money. This company is a joke.
