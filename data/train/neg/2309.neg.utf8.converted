I am interested in buying this for personal use.  There is no description at all about what I am buying other than it's Vintage brand seltzer.  What is 28 pounds?  Is it 1 pound of product and 27 pounds of container?  27.9 pounds of seltzer and .1 pounds of container?  How much is a pound of seltzer anyway? Are all 28 pounds in one container,  16 ounce bottles, 1 oz. bottles, one pound bottles?<br /><br />I can't imagine they're moving too much of this product through this ad.
