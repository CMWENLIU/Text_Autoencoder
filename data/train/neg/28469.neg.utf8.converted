I wouldn't have purchased a $30 five pound chunk of gummy bear except it was the perfect silly gift for my college graduating daughter as gummy bears were an important staple of her childhood and we shared many a bag of delicious gummy worms over the years.<br /><br />She and her friends ate the ears and nibbled a bit here and there and then she asked me if she could throw it out...enough is enough and it got stale fast.
