I first purchased a "My KCup" Found it leaked though there were some fixes on the net. I next got one of those Solocups. It worked great for about a month, then the gasket broke, and leaked so I ordered these K-Caps. I'm not at all able to make these work at all without leaking.<br /><br />I've gone back to the My KCup. Of the two solutions I found, placing a washer above the gasket on the needle, or carving a small gasket out of a wine cork, I chose the latter.<br /><br />I used a cork (artificial) from a bottle of Ravenwood Red Zinfandel (Vinter select) I sliced off about 1/6 inch and drilled a hole in the middle slightly larger than the hole in the top of the K-Cup. I didn't need to glue it in as it fits perfectly and stays secure. I've been using this now for 3 weeks with no issues.<br /><br />I just wish the folks at Kuerig would have made sure their own product worked with their own product.
