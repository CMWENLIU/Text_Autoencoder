I have been used to Dunkin and Starbucks. I decided to try something new and picked this one up at local store after reading rave reviews.<br /><br />I was thoroughly disappointed in this one. I whole heartedly agree with another comment posted here.  This is worse than office coffee!!!<br /><br />I found the coffee to be too light compared to Medium Roast of Dunkin and Star Bucks.  The flavour and aroma was akin to hot water run through an already filtered coffee grind.<br /><br />If you are used to stronger blends and richer flavours then you will not miss this one.<br /><br />If you are trying to move off coffee or want to go for a light coffee then you might prefer buying this.<br /><br />I am putting this to compost. This ain't my cup of coffee :(
