I ordered four, one-lb. packages of Imperial Hearts Valentine Candy.  It was HORRID.  I could not even tell who had manufactured this product.  It arrived in homemake-looking 1 lb. bags marked only with a SweetGourmet name.  The candy hearts had no taste that I could discern.  I thought I was buying the traditional Brach Cinnamon Imperial Hearts, but I was fooled.  This stuff went straight into the garbage. I was actually afraid of it.  I'm so glad I opened a bag and tasted it before I offered it to anyone else.  Never again.
