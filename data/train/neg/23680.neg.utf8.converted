My wife and I both agreed that the water has an artificial taste to it (which is not bad) and an aftertaste (which is bad).  The pros of this water are the electrolytes and the ph, but it tastes like a reconstituted water.  The info on the bottle doesn't help. Terms like "purified by reverse osmosis" and "restructured using Ionic Separation Technology" are not consumer friendly terms and reflect a marketing campaign that would only appeal to a scientific mind.  I just poured the rest of the bottle out.
