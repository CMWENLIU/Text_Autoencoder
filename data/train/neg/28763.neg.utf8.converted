This is another chemistry product which has little to do with real food.  Hot...yes.  Good?  Well if hot is all there is then this is hot.  Food?  Not really.  Fine food is made directly from food and not the result of "chemistry."  Flavor?  Not much of any kind other than hot sensation.  I am not fan of chemistry derived food products such as this or many other which are equally synthetic.  This is completely useless to anyone with a desire for other than a hot "free based" oil lacking the subtleties of real food with a vast array of odors and taste which only real food has.  Hotter sensations can be purchased directly from a chemical supplier without all the bother of pretending a product of chemistry is also a food.
