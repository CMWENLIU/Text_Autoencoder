I read the reviews posted on this site and figured I'd give Shed Stop a try. My wife and I have a black pug that sheds like crazy. So far we have been using the product for three months or so and have seen absolutely no change in the amount of shedding. We have hardwood and tile floors so we can easily see the hair our beloved pet leaves behind. Before using Shed Stop we would vacuum three times a week, now, after several bottles of this product my wife and I vacuum....three times a week.<br /><br />We recently found out that my wife's parents use Shed Stop on their very fluffy cat. They have decided to stop buying the product because they too have noticed no change in the shedding. Personally, I think they should just get rid of the cat (I'm a dog guy myself).<br /><br />Maybe this product works for some of you out there or maybe there are a bunch of people who work for the company planting fake reviews on the internet. I don't know, but I do know this; the stuff didn't work at all for us. I have to go now. It's time to vacuum...and then, I think I'm going to wax my dog.
