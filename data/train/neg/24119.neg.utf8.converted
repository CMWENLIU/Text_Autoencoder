NuNaturals Nustevia Pure White Stevia Extract , 1-Ounce ships from and sold by Amazon.com<br /><br />The Good<br />This stuff is amazing.  I use 1/8 of tsp to sweeten practically everything, 20oz tea, cup of oatmeal etc.  There is no bitterness and it truly takes very little to sweeten.  Unfortunately, because I need to use so little of it, (bought in January and still have a lot in September) the hair and gunk was buried.  I just discovered the gunk. and of course it is too late to return.<br />THE BAD<br />Hair and gunk, beyond the obvious grossness, this stuff was expensive, $17.15 for one ounce and did not even get an ounce of it because hair and gunk weigh something.  (The price has come down, but  buying high is story of my life.)  I had bought 4 more when it appeared it was on sale for half price, I have not opened those, so don't know  if they suffered the same lack of quality control.  Will update if they are or aren't.<br />If you buy, dig through it before using.  I don't know if this is their standard quality or if this one jar was a fluke.  But, it was all at the bottom, so took a long time to get to the point of spooning from the bottom and revealing the hair and gunk.
