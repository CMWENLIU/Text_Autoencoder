I was really disappointed with our experience after all the good reviews flossies have. I gave one to my dog and after he finished it he threw it back up and it had blood on it. It either cut his gums or scratched his throat pretty badly. It wasn't in big pieces either. They were pretty small and all soft (chewed). Needless to say I'm still on the search for a nice, safe chew for my dogs.
