This is the second time I have taken the time to review something on Amazon.  This product is so bad that I consider this review to be a public service.  As the title indicates, to say that this coffee is chocolate glazed doughnut flavored is total misrepresentation.  There is a very slight scent of chocolate while it is brewing, but the end product has absolutely no chocolate doughnut  flavor.  The end result is bitter black coffee and nothing more.  I have to wonder if the maker, Green Mountain Coffee, has ever heard of taste testers.  Based on the flavor of this coffee, and flavor of the equally bad "Cinnamon Roll", I have to say no.  I think I will throw them away and take the loss rather than subject my taste buds to continued assault by choking down the remaining 23 cups.  The kindest thing I can say about this product is that it is absolutely terrible.  I intend to express my displeasure to the manufacturer as well.  For a product this bad it should be possible to give a zero star rating or better yet, a negative star rating.<br /><br />Based on my experience with both products I will be very reluctant to purchase another "flavored" coffee.
