I ordered this hoping to get a sampler of the tea kcups available for my Keurig coffee maker. Here's what I got:<br />8 Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime<br />5 Celestial Seasonings Decaf Green<br />4 Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orange<br />2 Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai<br />2 Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger.<br /><br />This is not a sampler, its the leftovers that someone couldn't sell! I was hoping to get a variety of brands and flavors, not this. Eight Sleepytimes? I don't even like Sleepytime! Not one plain black tea in the whole bag.  Oh, yes, they were tossed loose into a paper bag, and several had been bashed in a bit. Nothing serious, but it does suggest that no one actually picked out the selection; they just scooped them out of a bin without regard for the selection. If you're going to do that, you should be offering a 50% discount.
