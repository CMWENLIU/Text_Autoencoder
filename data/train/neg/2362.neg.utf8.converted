when I went to make a larger order of it at Amazon, found it's cheaper and immediately available at the local grocery store ($22.68), though I do have to add tax. (On the other hand, I'm supposed to declare the tax avoided on my state tax anyway.) So, double check on pricing at your local grocery chain, etc. Another problem - turns out my digestive system is allergic to its non-sugar sweetening ingredients.
