I bought this product, because it's slightly less expensive per packet than the Truvia brand, only to discover it's much less sweet per packet, making it more expensive to use.  Worse yet, it doesn't taste as good to me as Truvia, or, for those looking to replace sucralose, as good as Splenda.  Its bitter aftertaste lowers it to the level of saccharine.
