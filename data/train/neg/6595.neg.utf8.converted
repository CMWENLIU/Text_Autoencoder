I have noticed it seems to be getting harder and harder to find Potato Buds.  This new recipe is totally bogus.  I have contacted Betty Crocker and asked about Potato Buds being discontinued and I was told they had no plans to discontinue them.  What they failed to say is that they have completely discontinued the best instant potatoes in the world and are now selling some gummy, gooey mixture in the same packaging.  I have been a loyal customer of Betty Crocker's Potato Buds.  Until now, it was the only instant potatoes my children would eat.  I have tried and tried to make this new recipe work and it just doesn't.  It comes out crappy every time.  Now I am searching for a replacement instant potato.  Boo on Betty Crocker.  Boo.
