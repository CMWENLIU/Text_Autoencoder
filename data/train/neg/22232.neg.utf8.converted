One of the ingredients on the label is "Natural Flavors" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.  For those who are concerned about their pet's health, I suggest the book "Natural Health for Dogs and Cats" by Dr. Richard Pitcairn, D.V.M.
