What I received is not the real Lavazza coffee and I should know since I am from Italy and from the same area where this coffee is produced. When I opened the can, there was no coffee smell and when I made a cup it did not taste like the real thing. In fact, it tasted terrible. I usually buy the product from the local Italian food store and I can assure you what I received from Amazon was not the same thing. I am very disappointed and I will be very careful before I buy any food items from Amazon in the future since, apparently, they cannot be returned.
