Even if I put only one teaspoon in a big smoothie, it simply ruins the taste. It is very bitter and dominant! I am sure it is a good product and it might even work and have lots of health benefits, so if you don't mind the taste, go ahead and buy it but I think I would buy the capsules instead (you swallow the good stuff without having to taste it).
