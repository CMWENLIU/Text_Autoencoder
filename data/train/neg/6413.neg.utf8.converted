This may not have sugar, but it tastes very strongly of SUCRALOSE, the chlorocarbon substitute marketed as Splenda.<br /><br />If you can tolerate Splenda, then you might like this.<br /><br />I cannot, and only upon tasting, and spitting out a mouthful of delicious crust and absolutely terrible filling, did I read the ingredients, having stopped at NO SUGAR ADDED.<br /><br />Big MISTAKE. This tastes plain horrible, to me.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!
