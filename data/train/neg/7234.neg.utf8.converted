I used to buy two cans of this sauce every week because it was affordable, tastes good and organically grown. I was shocked when I learned that the cans are lined with Bisphenol A (BPA)! I called the company directly and they confirmed this. I can't understand why they would use organic tomatoes and then package them this way. I told them that until they change this I would no longer buy their products. In the meantime I switched to Newman's Own organic sauce in a jar. Granted it's not fat-free but I'd rather have some olive oil than BPA.<br /><br />Muir Glen please change your packaging!
