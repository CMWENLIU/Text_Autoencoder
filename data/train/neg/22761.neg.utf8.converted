I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use.
