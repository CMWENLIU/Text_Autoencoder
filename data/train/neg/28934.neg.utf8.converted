These "fruit snacks" are horrible. They are the cheapest worst tasting fruit snack on the market. I bought mine from Wal-Mart at 2.50 a box. First, they taste like they're 2 years old, very hard, not a soft gummy type snack. Second, they don't have any small cut on the packages to tear open. There's no way you're getting into these snacks without some scissors. You would think if they cost that much, they could at least have a way to get the packages open. These are just here to make quick buck off the popularity of the Angry Birds franchise. DON'T BUY THEM, your stomach will thank you.
