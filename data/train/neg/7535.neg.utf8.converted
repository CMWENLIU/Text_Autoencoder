I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.  So easy to operate with very little clean up.  Recently I came across some reviews about the coating in the water reservoir flaking off.  As a result I LOOKED for it during my last meal prep and sure enough, I saw tiny little silver flakes.  It almost looks like oily water but under good lighting you can see the silver bits.  I rinsed it out 5 times and still see the flakes.  I'm very concerned as I just spent $100 on this machine.  Unlike the other parent who wants to know what the coating is chemically made up of, I don't really care. I don't think it's acceptable to have ANY coating come off whether it's 'safe' or not. I have no intention of using this anymore.
