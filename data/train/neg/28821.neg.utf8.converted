I suggest you be careful before ordering this item, I can not see that any cookie is worth $10.50 even if it tastes great! Even if we poor Celiac patients have to make do with much dry backed goods, and I mean some of it is dust-storm-dry, even so, I just can not justify to pay more for the shipping then for the cookies themselves. So make sure you always check the shipping charges before ordering anything, especially since cookies are not a food group, unfortunately. I have been in internet shopping and selling from its start and I know many sellers do try and make some extra income charging unreasonable rates for shipping by calling it HANDLING charges. This cookie bag weighs only 3.7 oz and I don't care how good you pack it this does not cost $5.05 for shipping. Did you know that a 1 oz letter costs $.44?<br />I am sorry if I sound angry, but as a Celiac I am very much upset for being taken advantage of because I have a disease which makes me have to shop for special foods. And this is exactly what is going on here. By the time you have ordered from 4 to 6 sellers you end up paying enough for shipping that you could live off another month, and that is robbery. So I decided enough is enough and I am making sure you know about it before you go through quick check out(worst way to go!) or having to go back after having spent so much time online comparing prices just to find at checkout that you can't afford it because of such excess shipping charges.
