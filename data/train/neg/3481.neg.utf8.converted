I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion.
