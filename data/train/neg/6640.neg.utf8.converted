Eden Organic's tomato canned products CONTAIN BPA.  Their canned beans are BPA free that is why it is confusing.  I called the company to verify. Unfortunately, I bought a whole case of them before I found out they contain BPA.<br /><br />I asked Eden Organics if they had any plans to provide their tomato products in BPA free packaging such as jars but they said no, they are not equipped for it.<br /><br />I think I will call again and let them know I am interested in BPA free tomato products, maybe if they get enough feedback from customers, they will make BPA free tomato products.  Their number if you are interested is 1-888-424-EDEN (3336) or you can email them at info@edenfoods.com. Their website is [...]<br /><br />I have found some tomato products that are not in cans.  I found most of them at the health food store, but have seen some at our regular grocery store now so hopefully the demand for such products is being heard.  I have not used these products yet, but will be doing so this weekend. I wish I had kept track of the prices. I believe they are all BPA free but not sure if maybe the jar lids have some BPA, nonetheless exposure would be considerably less than a whole can lining.<br /><br />Bionaturae - Organic tomato paste (in jars)<br />Bionaturae - Organic strained tomatoes (in jars)<br />Cirio - Passata Rustica, crushed tomatoes (in jars)<br />Lucini - Organics Tuscan Harvest plum tomatoes, whole, peeled (in jars)<br />Pomi - chopped tomatoes (tetra pak - like a milk carton)<br /><br />From what I have been told, the FDA has not approved any BPA free can liners for tomatoes--not sure if this is true.  Tomatoes are very acidic so they leach the aluminum from the cans that is why they are lined by something impervious to the acid hence the lining that contains BPA.  Frankly, I think I would prefer the aluminum over BPA.  I do know that if they went back to the linings they used before BPA was used, it would shorten the shelf life of the product because the lining they used to use disintegrates over time due to the acidity of the tomatoes and the tomatoes would taste like aluminum.
