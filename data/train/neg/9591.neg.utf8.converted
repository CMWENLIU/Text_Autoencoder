I didn't think to check the label when I bought these, as I do not like artificial sweeteners. But as I was drinking the first one I could tell right away that there was something artificial. Turns out these have Sucralose (a.k.a Splenda) in them in addition to real sugar. Why use both?<br /><br />Also, I agree with another reviewer who said it really just tastes like hot chocolate. I could hardly taste any coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />Very disappointing. :(
