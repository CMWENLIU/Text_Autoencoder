We'd been buying the four-pack of Melitta French Vanilla coffee once a month for the past 2 years. We won't be any more. In the last month they changed their packaging, which is fine, but also changed the grind. All of a sudden, these four packs come in "extra fine grind," which simply doesn't work well at all in our drip coffee maker. The whole pot tastes weak until you get to the last couple of cups, which taste more like mud because all of the coffee has settled. Here's hoping they switch back at some point, because this is just bad.
