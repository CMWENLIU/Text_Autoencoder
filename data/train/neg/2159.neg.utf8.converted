Didn't taste at all natural like a real key lime pie.  I recommend that you skip this flavor of this product and instead try the lemon and strawberry flavors, which are much better.  They have a more natural taste.  On the positive side, this product is sugar free, low in calories and easy to make.  In general this company's products are very good.  It is just this particular flavor of the product that is lacking.
