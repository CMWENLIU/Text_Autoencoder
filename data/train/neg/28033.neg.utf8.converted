This Vitamin Squeeze, while touting vitamins that you need in an easy way to get them, is nothing more than a Splenda-laden artificially flavored water enhancer. I followed the directions and added two squirts to my 16 oz water bottle (one squirt for every 8 oz of water) and first of all, you need to empty some water from the bottle before you add this product or you'll overflow onto the counter and second, two squirts were too many. I feel one would have been sufficient. This is really sweet and tastes completely artificial and bad for you, which it is. If you're concerned about your health and feel the need for extra vitamins then I suggest getting a natural supplement from a trusted source. This isn't going to do you any good, in fact just the fact that it is full of Splenda and red dye is enough to make me run from this product.
