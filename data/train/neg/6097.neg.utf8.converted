I was excited to try these as I found them on sale and the flavors sounded yummy!  I didn't even finish my first package of them.  Our family MUCH prefers Annies Homegrown Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks.  These were fruit tasting, yes, but much harder and chewier than Annies.  Annies flavor is superior as well, I think.  Perhaps I got a bad batch of Yummy Earth Organic Gummy Bears, but I don't enjoy fruit snacks that are hard and almost rubbery.  Annies are much softer and somehow "juicier" tasting.  In my opinion.  But as an alternative to the chemically laden and processed fruit snacks out there they are a much better choice!  I'll be sticking with Annies brand, however.
