The reviews for this product are confusing and not accurate.  Mr. Wu, says this is 13.6% Triclopyr which is incorrect since the manufacturer clearly says "Active Ingredients: Triclopyr, triethylamine salt: 0.8%".  Also the description calls this a  "concentrate" yet there is no information about how much working solution this so-called concentrate makes.  The description also says "convenient no mix formula" which implies it is used right out of the bottle so it can't be a concentrate.  Again Mr. Wu says he uses 50 to 100% stronger mix, but this can't be a description of this product since it is a no mix formula and any mixing would reduce the concentration, i.e., there is no way to make it stronger.  It appears that Mr. Wu has pasted his description of another product into the space for this one and that is not helpful.  So it appears that this is NOT a concentrate, but a ready to use solution that is less than 1%.  Very misleading.
