I just ordered a case of these and was horrified to see HUGE dents in all 6 cans. It looks as though someone banged the side of each can with a hammer.  The shipping box, however, was in perfect shape.  Hmmm...<br /><br />What a waste of my time and money.  From now on, I'm going to buy my canned food at the local grocery store.
