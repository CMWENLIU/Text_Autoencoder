I bought this product yesterday, safety seal was intact and expiration date is dec 2011. With three different batches made three different ways, including the directions on the bottle itself, the texture of the popcorn came out the same: chewy and sticks to your teeth as if it is stale. The look of the popcorn was nice, they did come out big and fluffy, but unfortunately everyone was unhappy with the texture. In our opinion, it was not edible.
