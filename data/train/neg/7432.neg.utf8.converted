So out of the 6 packs, 3-4 of them broke open. And since I wanted free shipping and combined my order into one package, my cute books also smelled like spoiled eggs. Three definitely popped open and the fourth one was opened a little bit but I didnt want to deal with contamination or anything so I threw them away. The remaining two were covered with the powder and smelled even though I washed the outside of the plastic so I had to triple pack it so it wouldn't make my kitchen smell ridiculously spoiled. And the bags are way big enough. I thought I was getting a great cheap deal for so much but if I could do this again I would buy it in a sealed jar and just the amount of one pacakage since most recipes only call for a few teaspoons or tablespoons anyways. Spice itself is super eggy in smell and taste so exactly what I wanted it for. Just not worth the clean up and excess waste you have to deal with and throw away.
