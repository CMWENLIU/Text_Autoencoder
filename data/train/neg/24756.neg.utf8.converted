Has a rather awful aftertaste similar to the chocolate ZenSoy product.  No worries though, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V4Q8L0">Silk Soymilk, Organic Vanilla, 8.25-Ounce Carton (Pack of 18)</a> product is good and the same price. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ3GA">Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, Chocolate, 8-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 18)</a> is good too, and both are available for 15% discount and free 2-day shipping by subscription.
