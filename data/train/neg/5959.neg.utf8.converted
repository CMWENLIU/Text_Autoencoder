I wasn't able to obtain my usual Hibiscus tea (Ambassador) and bought this thinking it was ONLY what the label said ... Natural Hibiscus.  Who would think I should read the smallest print on the back of a tin of tea for sugar or Stevia.  Well, after brewing this tea and having a sip, it tasted sweet.  On the back the ingredients are Hibiscus, Sweet Blackberry and STEVIA.  If this was a decent company they would put SWEET on the front label.  I will never buy this brand again.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
