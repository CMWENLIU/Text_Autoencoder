I bought 2 jars of these expecting them to be like Costco cashews, which are whole, delectable nutty works of art but these were crushed into pieces, shriveled like prunes, and to top it all off the " natural sea salt " smelled EXACTLY like the sea, and when I mean the sea I mean the whole jar SMELLED LIKE FISH!!!  THESE WERE THE NASTIEST CASHEWS I HAVE EVER BOUGHT IN MY LIFE,I ENJOY PLANTERS PEANUTS BUT I NEED A FAITH RESTORATION COS OF THE UNHOLY GOD-AWFUL DRIVEL OF A PRODUCT!!! You have been forewarned, STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY!
