Sugar is the FIRST ingredient on the package (Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar), however, when Amazon lists the ingredients they do not list them in the order on the package. Shame on Amazon. I love Amazon and order from them frequently every month and love their service. But regarding this issue I think THEY ARE WRONG not to voluntarily do the same thing. The government requires manufacturers to list ingredients in the order of largest content first. I had ordered this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because it sounded like a great product after reading the ingredient list on the site. Wrong. I had to relunctantly cancel it.<br />They taste great. No wonder with sugar as the largest ingredient.
