Bought a big bag to save $$.. never again.<br /><br /> This stuff is soooooo dusty. My poor cat was sneezing like crazy. And i love perfume but this stuff was  so over the top in smell that even I didnt like it.<br /><br /> And I am the kind of person who people tease because I can never pass a perfume counter without testing everything.<br /><br />Do yourself and your cat a favor and get the expensive but recycled and biodegradable litter that is made from corn. I love that stuff. No dust and it absorbs all the odors.
