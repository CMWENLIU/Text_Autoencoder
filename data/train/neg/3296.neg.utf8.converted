Wish I'd thought to check reviews before buying this, since there seems to be a consensus. This stuff is a far cry from horchata. It has a dull, chemical, plastic taste. My wife says it "tastes like sunscreen," which is spot-on except for the mouthfeel: sunscreen is rich and creamy, and this is just watery.<br /><br />In its defense, the powder smells great. I'll try repurposing it as potpourri.
