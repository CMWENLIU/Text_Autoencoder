Pros:<br /><br />* Very, very cheap<br /><br />* May be healthier than clay-based<br /><br />* Not a bad odor<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Clumps are VERY difficult to remove from the sides and bottom of box<br /><br />* I found white dust everywhere within 5 feet of the box, including on top of the refrigerator, and on pots and pans above the refrigerator<br /><br />I started using this to get away from the possibly harmful clay dust.  I was pleased with how cheap it is.  That helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out.  But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator.  I am now using World's Best, which is more expensive, but worrth it.  Buy it from Amazon or PetfoodDirect.
