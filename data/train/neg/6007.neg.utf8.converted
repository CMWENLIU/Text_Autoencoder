This stuff is where rotten peanut shells go to die. I don't even know how this passed taste tests or if it is even legal to sell. It doesn't taste like peanut butter, and after reading the ingredients I can see why. I'm so upset I passed up the natural peanut butter that was right next to the jar of this muck at the store. I'd much rather have a little bit of full carb/calorie PB than stomach another half teaspoon of this. Caveat emptor everyone.
