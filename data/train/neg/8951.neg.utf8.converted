I drink a lot of herbal iced teas (which I brew myself).  I used to use sugar to sweeten my tea, but I later switched to liquid stevia.  It really took me a long time to find my stevia too, because I tried out a lot of other sugar alternatives (such as Splenda and Sweet-n-Low) and I couldn't stand the taste of any of them.  The first stevia I ever tried had a nasty taste to it, but I've heard that liquid stevia taste can differ depending on the brand, so I kept looking.  I really like my current brand of liquid stevia (Nunaturals) because it's the only stevia I've ever been able to find that doesn't have a nasty taste.  I'm always eager to try out a new sugar replacement product, though, since my stevia is pretty pricey.<br /><br />So, I eagerly tried out the new Nectresse stuff since I'd read so many nice descriptions of how lovely and natural and tasty it is.  Well, each person's taste buds are different, but the Nectresse just doesn't taste good to me.  I tried it in some grits, and in several cups of tea.  It's got a weird unpleasant flavor to it (sort of similar to the weird chemical taste of Sweet N' Low).  Of course, due to differing tastes, your mileage may vary.  Another weird problem I have with the Nectresse is that according to the box, it says that "a packet of nectresse equals two teaspoons of sugar" which seems to imply that the nectresse is sweeter than regular sugar.  Strangely though, I found that it was the opposite.  I felt that the nectresse was NOT as sweet and I had to add more packets of it.  That's rather unfortunate.  I will say one thing in it's favor, though; I does melt in water like it says it does.<br /><br />Well, I can't say that I enjoyed this product or would want to buy more of it, just due to taste alone.  I also can't really speak on it's price since I got it through Vine and it's not available yet (as of this writing) on Amazon to do price comparisons.  So, I certainly wouldn't recommend it based on my own experience, but since everyone's different, if you are searching for a non-sugar sweetener, you might want to buy a small package of Nectresse to try out for yourself.  Who knows, you might like it better than I did.
