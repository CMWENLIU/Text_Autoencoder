I have 2 miniature doxies and a small Sheltie. All three love to wolf down their food. I purchased 3 small bowls hoping it would help. The bowls were huge for the small size. They didn't change a thing. They inhale just the same. Wish I knew what the answer was, aside from feeding them a kernel at a time. I don't even think they taste it when they eat it. So if you have a dog that eats really fast, in my opinion, these bowls don't change a thing.
