Fair Trade, yes. My daughter says they should call it "Fair Trick". I love some of the other Wholesome Sweetener products, particularly the dark brown sugar, but this one is lumpy, tasteless, and grey! Looks and tastes like spackle. Have to sift to remove the mothball-like clumps. I get fooled by this stuff about once a year around the holidays when I'm feeling all joy to the world and making baked goods with organic ingredients I can afford about once a year. And then I remember: organic powdered sugar is kind of like organic Cheeteos. If you're going to do it, might as well go with the real thing. You'll be twice s happy and spend about half as much.
