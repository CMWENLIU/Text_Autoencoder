I went with this because I couldn't find any chocolate cups in my area on short notice for a wine themed gift I was putting together.  Although my biggest initial fear was that they would come shattered into a million pieces, every cup was intact.  Unfortunately, about 3/4 of the chocolate cups in the box where covered in white spots.  Clearly, old chocolate.  Pretty frustrating that the company can't adhere to any kind of expiration policy and is passing off nasty chocolate like this with a potential to make someone pretty sick if they were less discerning, or had never encountered spoiling chocolate before.
