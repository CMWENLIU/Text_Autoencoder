I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan.
