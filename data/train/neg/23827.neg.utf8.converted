This tea set was my reward for the hard work put into my flower gardens and it was with great anticipation that I waited for the package to arrive.  How disappointing!  The musty, dank smell hit me before I ever saw the contents of the box.  It was so bad that I took it outside to open it for fear of releasing mold spores in my house. The tea pot is very small and fragile and I have yet to bring myself to try the tea because of the moldy smell.  I would not give this as a gift.  I am so very disappointed.
