The description says it contains "no stabilizers", yet the case I received on 2/24/10 contains guar gum and stabilizers. The ingredients list reads: "Coconut extract, guar gum, emulsifier, stabilizer".<br /><br />I am very unhappy about this - the ONLY reason I ordered it was because it was advertised as not having any stabilizers.
