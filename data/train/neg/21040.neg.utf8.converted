Very excited to order these....but what a disgusting rip-off. I echo the sentiments of those who compared this to the stuff you get at truck stops- overly sweet and a bit oily....plus it is simply powdered mix in your k-cup....if you want this taste (probably a bit better) for like 25% of the cost buy some instant mix at your grocery store and run your Keuring with no k cup and stir.
