I bought this product because my husband has been raving about a butterfinger coffee that he used to drink while in school.  I have been searching for a good substitute and I found this particular brand on Amazon.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to our expectations.  It didn't taste like butterfingers and the smell was definitely not there.<br /><br />In all fairness, we are not big coffee drinkers but will indulge in a good cup of java anytime.<br /><br />In the meantime...we are still looking for Butterfinger.
