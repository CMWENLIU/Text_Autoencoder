Well, rats.  I finally found a renal cat food that my cat likes, and they change the formula!!  To defend her pickiness, Sabrina has had renal disease for 6.5 years.  She's been through all the mainstream renal cat foods and sooner or later, tired of each of them. No going back, either.  Kitty with a memory - my luck. I read good reviews about Hi-Tor Neo Diet early this year, and ordered a case.  She SCARFED that food down!  Things went along swimmingly until my last order >> hmm, new label, new size, new consistency, doesn't smell the same.  For a week now, Sabrina has consistently taken a few bites, then turns her nose up at it.  She's eating maybe 1/8th of what she used to eat. I'm shipping the remainder back, and the new search begins.....sigh.  Anybody else having this experience?
