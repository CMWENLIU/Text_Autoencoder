I was so excited for this sampler, I had just bought my new Keurig and was looking forward to finding my favorite coffees in this affordable package. I got the box, and was at first super excited while reading through the different types. Then for some reason, I happened to glance at the expiration date on one of the K-cups; what do you know? It expired 3 months ago. Curiosity got the best of me, and I continued to check each one. 35 K-cups later, half of the box contained expired or 1-week-away-from-expiration coffee! I consider myself a coffee-lover, and I'll try anything. BUT! Expiration dates aren't put on food for fun, and I wasn't about to drink $30 worth of old nasty coffee. I hope that this is a random occurance, but I urge everyone to check the expiration dates on their K-cups before you start brewing! Needless to say, these babies are on their way back and I'll be getting a refund.
