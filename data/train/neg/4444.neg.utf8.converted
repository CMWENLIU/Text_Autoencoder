The box arrived on July 22, the date on the coffee bag is Sept 30.  So that doesn't leave much shelf time here.  Thing is, most vacpac coffee has at least a 6 month shelf life, so that is worrisome.<br /><br />Opened the bag, no smell.  That in itself tells the whole story.  Coffee is aromatic.  You open a bag of bean, particularly french roast bean and you're going to smell coffee, even before you grind it.  It's the nature of the oils on the roasted coffee beans, and it definitely affects the flavor and experience.<br /><br />no smell.<br /><br />Brewed up a pot this morning in my cuisinart coffee grinder/brewer:<br />beans were not consistant in roasting, some darker than others<br />no aroma when brewing whatsoever<br />coffee turned out very dark<br />med chicory like flavor<br />coffee flavor not strong or rich.<br /><br />I've been playing with this coffee for a couple of days and after a while it's not terrible.  Compared to a stronger flavored French Roast, it pales.  But on it's own, if this is how you like your coffee, okay.<br /><br />I can't say if it's the blend of bean or if it's fact that it was roasted a long time ago and it's lost it's strength.  But it lacks a rich coffee flavor.  except it has that mild chicory backtaste going.<br /><br />so if you want a mild coffee with a hint of chicory, you found it.
