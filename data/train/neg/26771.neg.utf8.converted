Since this box of Whitman's cost the same amount as the one you would buy at the drugstore, I didn't think twice about staring hard at the picture or really reading what size it is.  This box is TINY!!  It contains 4 chocolates and for that you pay $9.00!!!!!<br /><br />I sadly ordered 2 of these as Valentines gifts for my mother and sister and spent close to $20.00 for them.  I am so frustrated and just wanted to alert others that this box size goes for .60 in the stores.  Stay away!!!
