Bought this pancake mix previously.  This is NOT banana macadamia nut pancake mix.  It is banana macadamia nut FLAVOR pancake mix.  The only place you see that in the product listing is if you look carefully at the item picture, and they even turn the bag sideways in the picture to make the word "Flavor" less obvious.<br /><br />If you're in to artificial flavors, go for it.  I'll keep shopping elsewhere for the real thing.
