I'm generally a fan of 5 gum--to the extent that a person can "have a brand" of gum, it's my brand. But wow, this stuff is gut-churning. Even by fake-green-apple standards, it's bitter and almost rancid-tasting. Maybe that explains why the flavor only holds up through about eight chews. It's a small mercy, but a mercy nonetheless.<br /><br />If you're a gum dealer looking to score big bucks in the collector's market ten or twenty years down the line, you should probably grab a case or two, because there's no way this stuff will be available much longer. Otherwise, you're better off chewing on your fingernails or old gristle or whatever you can find stuck between the sofa cushions. Or any of 5's other delightful flavors. Except maybe watermelon ... oh, sorry, "Prism." I think the person who names these things is the same person who taste-tests them.
