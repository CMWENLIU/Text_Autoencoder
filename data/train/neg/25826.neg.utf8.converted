My yorkie almost died!  He has eaten ONLY organic food his entire life.  I purchase a bag of these (the only store bought food or treat he has ever eaten) and within weeks he became lethargic and refused food of any kind.  He was admmitted to the hospital Nov 2007 for 6 days and was administered IV fluids to prevent his death from<br />*****************Acute Renal Failure*********************************<br />These treat causes kidney failure which can be deadly and there is no medication available to prevent,minimize or repair the damage. The damage is IRREVERSABLE!!!!!! My dog is now damaged for life!!!! If you love your pet DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! The FDA has received over 100 complaints and UC Davis is following over 40 cases....how many have dogs have to die before big corporations stop allowing this toxic stuff from China to be sold in their stores AND stop allowing very deceptive labeling practices that trick consumers into thinking the product is safe and made in the USA?????????????? Save yourself the heartache DON"T BUY THIS IT"S DEADLY!
