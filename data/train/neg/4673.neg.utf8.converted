Should not even be one star! These bars are at best factory seconds - not to mention stale.  Even though the expiration date stamped on the box is still good - the bars are not edible.  I have been eating these bars from my local store for over a year and really enjoy them!  I am exceptionally disappointed because they are one of the few "gluten" free bars out there.  Find a new vendor.
