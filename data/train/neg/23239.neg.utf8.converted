Having used Karo for a half century, I was a bit disturbed a couple of years back to find that the Karo I had used - as had my Grandma before me - is now not pure corn syrup, but full of other stuff.  They've added high fructose corn syrup to this along with "real vanilla" (certainly not of the quality that I use.)  I won't touch the stuff.  Make your pecan pie with honey or golden syrup unless you can find one of the few brands that remains unadulterated.
