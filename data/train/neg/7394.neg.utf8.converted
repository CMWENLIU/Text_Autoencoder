I enjoy my Sodastream machine and have purchased many of the diet flavors. The only one I don't like is the Diet Cream- it is undrinkable. My wife and I both both agreed on what to do with it - down the drain.  We both enjoy cream soda, but not this one.  To make things worse we paid Amazon $11.49 for this- more than twice what we should have paid.  Try any flavor but Diet Crean.
