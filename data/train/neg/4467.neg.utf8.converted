I bought these wipes a month ago and used them every day for a week before tossing them in the trash.  We live in a wooded environment and there are areas where water stands for awhile after it rains.  Mosquito's are everywhere and our only break from them is during the Winter season.  We've tried everything and the only two things that work for us are full coverage clothing and the dark green spray bottle of OFF Deep Woods Repellent.<br /><br />For these particular wipes, we used one wipe per person before going outdoors.  Mosquito's began attacking us immediately.  We returned indoors to use more wipes in case one wipe per person wasn't enough.  The mosquitos still attacked.  So we returned indoors to shower up and apply our anti-itch bug cream.  I continued to go out every day for the rest of the week using these wipes and the same thing kept happening no matter how many wipes I used.<br /><br />My youngest is allergic to Mosquito bites so it's a big deal that we have a good repellent.  She's been to the hospital for mosquito bites (how we found out she was allergic) and has to be put on antibiotics to prevent her skin from becoming necrotic.  Our Pediatrician said that while there is a lot of debate on whether to put Deet containing products on young children, she suggests doing so carefully and properly which we have done.  Once I tossed these wipes, I purchased OFF Deep Woods Repellent Spray.  It's in a dark green bottle with an orange pump top.  That product has worked excellent for us and my youngest hasn't been bitten.<br /><br />I think the idea of wipes is nice for a few reasons but we're going to stick with the bottle of spray.  These wipes may work for others but they didn't work for us.
