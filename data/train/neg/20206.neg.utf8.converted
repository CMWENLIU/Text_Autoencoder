I am surprised by all the positive reviews for these.  We try to buy a lot of organic food so I thought these would be perfect.  First off,  it's hard to tell what flavor they are.  They certainly dont taste like strawberry, maybe more like apple.  And they are much harder than pop tarts.  My kids wont eat them at all so now I have a huge case just sitting here.
