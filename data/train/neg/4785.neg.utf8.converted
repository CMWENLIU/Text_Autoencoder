Normally, I do not use this type of product, but, thanks to Amazon, I had an opportunity to try it.  I kept my mind open as I did not know what to expect, and the picture on the box looked appetizing.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor was barely OK, but the included broccoli package was a joke, I had to add frozen broccoli to make the whole thing decent.  I did not like the type of pasta used in this dish.  It was not the usual elbows that mac-and-cheese is most often made with.  Visually, the pasta reminded me the diamond shaped moth larvae casing.  Larger pasta would have made the texture less mushy.<br /><br />For chicken I used a day-old rotisserie chicken from Costco.  Legs have been eaten the day before, but the breast remained.  I skipped the browning step because the chicken was cooked already, added pasta, seasoning and water and proceeded per instructions.<br /><br />At some point I was instructed to add "broccoli florets".  The contents of the broccoli package were only identifiable as broccoli because that's what the package said it was.  "Broccoli" was very very dry, brown, flat, and most of it was just dust.  Thankfully, I had frozen broccoli that I added and it provided the color, the crunch, and the reasonable amount of the veggie component.  The cheese paste's flavor was good.  It melted quickly, and, once mixed in, it coated all ingredients well.<br /><br />The flavor of the final dish was OK, the texture was poor because of the small pasta used that lumped together.  In my opinion, my final dish's texture and the flavor were helped tremendously by the addition of the frozen broccoli.  Otherwise, I would not eat it.  As a side note, the dish did not reheat well in the microwave the next day.  It solidified in the fridge and reheating it in the microwave caused hot and cold spots and the cheese did not melt.<br /><br />Other than the seemingly low price, I am not sure what the appeal of this kit is.  You have to buy your own chicken, and, potentially, broccoli, so all you are getting as a "bundle" is pasta, seasoning, and cheese paste.  I think you can get the same quantities of these products for the same or lower price, plus you will be able to choose your own kind pasta, and will end up with a better tasting dish with a nicer texture.
