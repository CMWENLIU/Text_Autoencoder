The tea tastes OK, but 80% of the bags are torn in the same place (a crease between the sides, on one side of the bag).<br /><br />If I don't check first, I have a cup of tea leaves floating around.<br /><br />I sure wouldn't buy this again. Typical Chinese quality. Now that I've seen the defective manufacturing process and lack of quality control, I'm kind of scared of what this stuff is made of (in China!).
