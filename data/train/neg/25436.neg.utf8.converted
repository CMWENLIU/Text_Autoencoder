I am a little ticked at an email from Amazon stating that this is not available so they were canceling my order, followed by constantly keeping these bags of Skittles in my recommended items.  I bought some to send to my nieces and nephews, had joked with my brother and sister about how they were going to deal with so much candy.  I'll bring presents next time to make up for the failure of this to appear. I'll remain a huge purchaser from Amazon in the tens of thousands per year between me and my wife, but things like this are annoying enough for me to waste my time writing this post. . .
