Don't buy this product.  Company would like you to think it is healthy, but it isn't.  Made my cat sick, throwing up.  Now I find out it is made by Diamond Foods and is in the recall list just anounced 5/30/2012.  Diamond Foods makes alot of pet food products and has a very poor rating for safe products.  They had to shut down 3 of their plants because of contamination.  I had to throw this product away, and it cost over $30.00.  Save the money and don't buy this crap!!!
