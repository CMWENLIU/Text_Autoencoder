This stuff is as tough as leather. I love jerky and of course I've tried jerky that is tough before but this stuff I literally could barely get my teeth through it. I thought I was going to have to microwave it in some water to soften it.<br /><br />I checked and made sure it was in date and that the packaging wasn't broken anywhere to let air in. Bag was in perfect condition and was well within expiration date.<br /><br />The taste was just average. I would never buy this again. It wasn't just this flavor. I also had a bag of the same brand but a different flavor and it was exactly the same.<br /><br />Worst jerky I have ever had, by far. I bought it because it is a little cheaper than Jack Link's jerky but I would much rather pay a little more and get jerky that is actually edible.
