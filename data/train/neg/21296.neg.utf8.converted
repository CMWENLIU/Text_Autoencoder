The chocolates arrived ruined.  It is clear that they were stored hot and somewhat melted, were then placed on ice and frozen and shipped in ice packs.<br /><br />The result:  A wonderful chocolate ruined since the smooth filling remained hard on thawing....these turned into bad Hersheys with this handling.<br /><br />The company should give up on providing the product, since they ruin it with their handling.<br /><br />(PS...one box was crushed).
