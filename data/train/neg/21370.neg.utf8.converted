I read all the reviews on this product and decided to try it. All I can say is Yuck. The three containers that arrive are really small. Which would be ok if this actually tasted like movie butter. It melts, looks and tastes like oil. I love movie popcorn. I even go to the movie theaters sometimes just to get the popcorn, and take it home :) Don't waste your hard earned dollars. Not sure what other people are tasting but you might as well just pour wesson over your popcorn.
