What more can one say? It's unbelievable how many cans are dented, and not just-a-casual-dent; these are throw-it-away deep dents, bent-can dents, dropped-from-on-high-dents. And the dented ones tend to be in the middle of the case, which means they are happening at the factory. Sometimes, Every Single Can in the case is dented. I suspect Campbell collects cans of soup that are damaged by the machines and sells it at bulk discount to .. whoever sells it to me, but there would be no way to prove it.<br /><br />They won't let me write a second review, but an edit of the existing one is allowed: subsequent shipments, including the latest, continue to be beat to hell. This one was done by the shipper - the cases were busted open and the cans scattered through the packing box. Not that much denting though. So there's that. Wish I wasn't poor, but luckily for Campbells, UPS and Amazon - I am.
