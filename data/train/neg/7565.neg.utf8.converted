I bought this since I had similar freeze dried fruits from Costco, but is disappointed to see that's they are made in China. This means that the fruits are from China and so are the chemicals that were probably used to grow them, they are probably not as healthy as claimed.  For more than 1 dollars for a few pieces per bag, it's better to get fresh fruits.
