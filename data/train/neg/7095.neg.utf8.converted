At first I was happy to find this product in the store, since I am on a gluten free and no white rice diet.  The lable on the package says brown rice.  Thank you Amazon for noting the "brown rice" is actually a combination of white rice and rice bran.  It is amazing the amount of flexibility in labeling standards.
