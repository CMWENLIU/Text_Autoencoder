My kids love these so I thought I would look on Amazon to see if they had them. I was happy to see they did in a multi-pack but was appalled to see how much they were. They are only $.28 at Walmart so for a pack of 12, only $3.36. Even with the subscribe and save, it's more than double the price on here. Very disappointing!
