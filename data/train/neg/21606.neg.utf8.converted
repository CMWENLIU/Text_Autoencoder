I used to be a cook in college making eggs and pancakes for breakfast in the college dining hall.  It wasn't actually gourmet but it at least was a pancake.  I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet.  It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well.  I chucked the rest of the box out.  You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort.  Better to just eat a normal pancake with sugar free syrup than this stuff.
