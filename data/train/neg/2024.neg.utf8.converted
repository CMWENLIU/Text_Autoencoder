I ordered this item as a gift for me dear friend. But unfortunately, Amazon has put the WRONG PICTURE on this item. I ordered this thinking that I would receive brown sugar, as pictured, but instead was very angry and disappointed to find a BLUE box of WHITE sugar. Not brown. And since this is a grocery item, I'm not even allowed to return the product that I never wanted to begin with. This is very unsatisfying, coming from Amazon itself. Very unprofessional. And this is after I went out of my way to promote Amazon to everyone I knew, raving about how fantastic it was, just to be met with a large amount of disappointment. VERY ANGRY.
