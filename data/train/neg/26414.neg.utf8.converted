I bought one box after reading the nice rating/reviews. My hubby gave it a so-so rating. I tasted it, and was ultimately disappointed. I felt that I had to write a review to tell others. The chocolate is simply okay, comparable to $10/lb chocolate I buy at local produce. But the fillings were horrible (most of them). Given it is $36/lb + $18 for shipping, I am sure I will never ever buy another one.
