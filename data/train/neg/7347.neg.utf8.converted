When I had this chicken broth in hospital, it tasted so good. So I bought a pack of 6 from Amazon. But this product tastes so strange and is totally different from what I had in hospital. Then I found out Amazon doesn't allow returns for groceries, so I end up having 6 bottles of these and have no idea how to do with them. I will never again buy any groceries from Amazon, even if I have tried it locally.
