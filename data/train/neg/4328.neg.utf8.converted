I purchased this tea along with several other kcup varieties for a coffee maker that gets occasional use.  Unfortunatley, the expiration date on the Celestial Green Decaf Tea purchased here on Amazon is within one month.  I know I will be throwing away most of this tea because it will expire before it is used.  All the other kcups purchased have at least one year before they expire.<br /><br />The shipping to return the tea would have cost half the price of the tea.  I don't think I will purchase any more food items on Amazon.
