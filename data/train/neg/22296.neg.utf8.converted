As we're being asked to shun the use of throwaway plastic bags, these biodegradable bags seemed like a great idea for my trash, so I bought 200 of them.  What a waste of money!  They may perhaps hold 3 gallons, but the dimensions do not fit any trash receptacle I've ever seen:  they are about 17" wide but only 12" of usable depth, so they really only work in a 1-gallon bucket.
