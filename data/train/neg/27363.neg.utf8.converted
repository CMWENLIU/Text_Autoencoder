This is a nice tea, but who in their right mind would pay this price--as of the writing of this review $41.95 for two boxes of 25 K-Cups --so puleeez -- DON'T pay it!!! It's nearly TWICE what the price should be--I am not joking about this. I know my K-Cups. And also, pay attention to the fact it is coming from a NON-AMAZON store, so you will also be paying shipping on top of everything else! Look elsewhere for this product, because the tea itself is very nice --hopefully AMAZON will get it in stock and sell it themselves rather than outsourcing.
