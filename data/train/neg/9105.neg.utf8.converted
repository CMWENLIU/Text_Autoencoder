Be very careful-realize what you are getting. On both ads to get the buyer to Amazon for this product -Windows Shopper and Yahoo Shopping - they state that there are 12 packages.  But, when you get to the order, it is only 6 packages.  So, when you thought that you were getting a deal on 12, you only get 6.  So you get a regular store price without knowing the use-by date or anything else.
