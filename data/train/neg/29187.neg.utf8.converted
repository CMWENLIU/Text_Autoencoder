When I ordered this chutney, it was supposed to be "Sun" brand, where mangoes were the first ingredient.  What I was sent was "Patak" brand, where sugar is the first ingredient, and which is quite sweet for a chutney.  I don't feel I got what I ordered.  I have bought Patak brand in the past and didn't like it much.
