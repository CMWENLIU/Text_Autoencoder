I love PG Tips, but Online Stores Inc sent me 4 boxes that were one month away from their expiration date and when I sent them back and asked for a refund, they did not give me a full refund.  They charged me for the box that I opened to try the tea (it was stale and tasted like hay) and then charged me for the postage.  They did reimburse me for 3 packs and the return postage.  They did not respond when I wrote them after not receiving a full refund.<br /><br />All around, not a great merchant experience and I would not buy from them again.
