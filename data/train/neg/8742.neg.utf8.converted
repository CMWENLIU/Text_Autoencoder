We have two cats and we were feeding them with "Advanced Pet Diets Select Choice" food but unfortunately it was discontinued so we had to research for another great product. We were recommended this cat food by several people who know what the ingredients suppose to be in it and because this food is made by the same company so we expected same quality.When we got it and opened the bag we noticed different smell (not very pleasant ) and that this food is very dry( the old one was kinda oily ) and both cats didn't like it at all, sometime they don't even want to come and eat it even they are hungry. Now we will have to donate this food to the pet shelter but we learn the lesson, the only way to find the right food is not just by reading the ingredients but buying samples and give them to the pets.
