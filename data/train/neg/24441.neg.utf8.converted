I gave this a try, as I love bacon.  I usually use the crumbled real bacon to put in salads, eggs, sandwiches...<br /><br />So although I am not a big fan of mayonnaise, I figured if it made my sandwich taste like I had a couple of strips of bacon, well that would be really great !<br /><br />The spread tastes like a very salty mayonnaise with smoke flavoring added. Not really like bacon.  I tried it on a sandwich and most of what I could taste was the salt, MSG and a little smoke flavor.  Fake bacon bits sprinkled on the sandwich would have been a better choice.
