What attracted me was the savings over Nespresso capsules...I so wanted to like these, but the extraction is inadequate and espresso is weak and not as nuanced as most Nespresso varieties.  Since I paid $25 for the 5 boxes of 10 each, the price has dropped precipitously...now under $15.  I can only believe that despite the pretty package and the eco-friendly claims, Nespresso users will pay a significant price premium to get the consistenly good (if not great), no mess aspects of using Nespresso capsules.  I am reluctant to try other flavors after my experience with Cremoso.
