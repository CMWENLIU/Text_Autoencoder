Probably geared for the revolution, cutting edge "let's ban mayo-type advertisement". Picked up by mistake and found it sweet and far too intruding to compliment any dish, specially sandwiches or salads. Obviously I am not cool but I can assure you my taste buds know by instinct what is repulsive at first taste and this one, miracle whip, can not compete in my kitchen. Got so aggravated that I returned the product to my local market claiming about a "funny taste" which saved me, cheap cheap me, the money spent.
