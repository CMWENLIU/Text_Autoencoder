What the heck??? I'm so disappointed! I DID NOT receive what I expected! I expected GINGER PEOPLE ORIGINAL GINGER CHEWS, long rectangles w/ the fine powdered sugar INDIVIDUALLY wrapped in the green wrappers, (gee, just like the picture, imagine that!).<br />Instead what I received was a clear bag w/ a generic homemade typed up label. Inside are square candies with coarse sugar crystals on them. What a mess! I live in TX, this is going to clump up into one giant piece of candied ginger. I wanted the INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ones LIKE IN THE PICTURE to have in my purse. I'm looking into returning this mess!
