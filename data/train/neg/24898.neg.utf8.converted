I have the soda stream and love it. So far haven't had any issue with any other flavors. The root beer and pete's choice are really good. The flavored waters are really good as well.<br />The Fountain Mist is vile. Thought the first time I was imagining how much it tasted like bad cough medicine but that's exactly how it tastes.  Has a strong chemical flavor that makes it undrinkable to me.<br />Try your samples that come with the unit before purchasing flavors.
