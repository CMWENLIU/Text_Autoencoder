The tea I recived is about 50% woodie stuff (little sticks) and 50% green stuff.<br /><br />The shipping was nearly the same price as the Tea, so I ended up paying $15.70 for 1/2 pound of Yerba Mate!!<br /><br />After recieving the order, I got smart and googled Yerba Mate, and found lots of sites that offer a lot more tea for a lot less money, like $3.00/lb instead of the $30.00/lb that I paid.  Also, some sites that offer genuine Argentinean brands,  I think I'll try them next.
