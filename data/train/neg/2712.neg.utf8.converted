I ordered a 6-pack of this last fall for about $15, which was a great price, and my toddler loves the cheese powder on popcorn, noodles and broccoli! However, there's no way I'm paying $34 and change for it, and I don't see why the price has more than doubled in less than a year. That's $5.83 for just 3 oz of product!
