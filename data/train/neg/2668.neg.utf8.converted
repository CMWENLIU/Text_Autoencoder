I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.
