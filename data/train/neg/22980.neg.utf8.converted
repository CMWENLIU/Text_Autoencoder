I have been drinking J1 Aloe Pulp Juice for months now.  In October Amazon ran short so I ordered from JVS ($79.04 vs $60.00 from Amazon).<br />I did not receive 24 bottles of J1, I received 24 bottles of JayOne Aloe Juice.<br />They do not taste the same.<br />J1 has the Superior Taste Award on its label, JayOne doesn't.<br />J1 is sweetened with Honey and Organic Cane Juice, JayOne isn't.<br />I am disappointed that JVS is misrepresenting their product.  These are not the only discrepancies, the vitamin contents are different as well as some other ingredients.<br />Believe me, they do not taste the same.
