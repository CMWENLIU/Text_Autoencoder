I'm not exactly an espresso connoisseur, so I have a hard time telling a huge difference between these capsules and the nespresso ones in drinks like lattes. Unfortunately, for less diluted drinks, the weaker flavor in these capsules was pretty obvious. They're not so much weaker that they're undrinkable, but they're definitely have less flavor.<br /><br />At the previous price of 25 cents/capsule, these were an awesome choice for lattes/cappuccinos, but for 50 cents/capsule, I'll just stick with the nespresso capsules.
