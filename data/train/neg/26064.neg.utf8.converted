Horribly disappointed.  The box was busted along the bottom when I received it, I had to open to see if all 24 cans were still in the box.  After opening, every can was dented, even the ones that were in the middle of the case.  I could maybe understand if the outside parameter of cans were dented. I believe from the look of this case they are sending these out of factory already damaged.
