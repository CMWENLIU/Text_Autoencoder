I'm sitting here drinking a big mug of this stuff as I write this--my first mug.<br /><br />I love ginger tea, so I fully expected to love this. I should have been more skeptical of this powdered concoction.<br /><br />When I poured the hot water into my mug, the gingery smell hit me in the face and I was excited. My first couple of sips seemed to confirm what my nose had anticipated: a delicious, pungent, gingery punch. The ginger really is IN-YOUR-FACE, like a good ginger beer, which I happen to love. It's hot on the tongue and has a nice bite in the back of your throat. Honestly, that's how ginger tea, ginger beer, or ginger anything is SUPPOSED to taste. It may be a bit strong for some people, but those people probably don't really like ginger. It's actually a little sweet for my tastes, but not so much that it was a problem for me. My initial thought was that I really liked it.<br /><br />As I kept sipping, though, that sweetness grew, and eventually started to taste... funny. Now, more than half way through my mug, I have a strange, lingering after taste in my mouth that is not very pleasant. I don't know what's in this stuff, but I suspect saccharine, Stevia, aspartame, or some other artificial sweetener... the after taste is almost reminiscent of bubble gum, but not in a good way. I'm not getting so much ginger flavor anymore, only its hotness.<br /><br />I don't think I will finish my mug. But I wonder if maybe it's just me. My girlfriend comes home and I hand her the still warm mug and say "here, Ginger tea!" She sips once. Seems pleased. She sips again a few moments later. Seems to hesitate. By the third sip, she looks at the mug, then looks at me, "I don't think I like this". Down the drain it went.
