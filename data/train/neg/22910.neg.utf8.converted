This product has an ingredient called sodium tripolyphosphate, which is used to make fish look glossier and fresh, even if it's spoiled and expired.  It is a suspected neurotoxin according to the National Institute for Occupational and Health's Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances.  I would recommend reading more about this ingredient before serving it to your animal in canned pet food.
