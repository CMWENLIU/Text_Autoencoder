The regular Extend Bars are great for controlling dips in blood sugar.  The regular bars do not have any sugar; however, all of the "crunch" bars have 10 grams of sugar.  The company should make that very clear in their product description!  I unfortunately purchased the "crunch" bars assuming they were like the other Extend Bars and now seeing that they have sugar in them, cannot use them.
