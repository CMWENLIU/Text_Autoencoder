What are these K-Cups made of?  $1.00 per K-Cup and that is at a discount?  Starbucks came late the the K-cup party and looks like they arrived way over dressed as well.  Don't waste your money on these.  A friend picked up some and I tried them, while they aren't bad, they certainly aren't worth twice the price as the equally good coffee produced by several other K-Cup brands.
