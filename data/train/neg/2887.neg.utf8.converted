I made a mistake in purchasing the olive oil mayo.  Upon further analysis, it appears that the product is still primarily soybean oil (they say and or canola).  The marketing team is pretty savvy and your labeling could be misleading.  It is my fault for not fully examining the ingredient list.  That will not happen again.  They should not be calling it Olive Oil Mayo, but Mayo "with" some olive oil.  even the kraft product has olive oil listed as the primary ingredient, whereas the primary ingredient for this is soybean and or canola oil.  A complete sham
