I purchased this item for party favors for my twins 5 year old birthday party.  I was seriously disappointed with the contents, as I expected a Pixar assortment since that is what the title states.<br /><br />Here is what I received<br /><br />4 Captain Jack Sparrow<br />2 Davy Jones<br />3 Mike (from Monsters, Inc)<br />1 Bruce the shark from Finding Nemo<br />2 Iridessa (one of the Tinkerbelle fairies)<br /><br />What a terrible assortment!  Only 4 out of 12 are actually Pixar, as advertised.  Half are Pirates of the Carribean (which is not Pixar!)  Way too many duplicates and minor characters!  Guess I will be headed to the store today to buy some Pez dispensers, as not many appropriate selections for girls. Buyer beware!!
