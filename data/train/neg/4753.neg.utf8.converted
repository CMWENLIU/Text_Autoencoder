My family couldn't wait to try this out when it came in the mail, but after just one bite, I could tell that no one would have it. This dinner kit is very easy to make but that's the only positive thing to say. It's too salty, doesn't taste like anything pictured on the box, and it has trans fats. There's no way I'll ever have this in my home again.
