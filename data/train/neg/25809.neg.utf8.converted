I am not impressed with this and am planning to return it.  The pods fall over easily and get stuck.  I even punctured a pod just trying to open and close the drawer.  I live it high altitude and my pods tend to bulge more on top with the air pressure so they don't fit in this very well...they are too tall.  Very disappointed.
