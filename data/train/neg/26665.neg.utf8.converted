Received zip-lock bag of black peppercorns.  Label from MoreThanAlive.com merely lists "Black Peppercorns".<br />No way of telling whether these are Tellicherry, or just their bulk black peppercorns.<br />MorethanAlive's website makes NO mention of Tellicherry.  Just Black Peppercorns, in bulk, for $4.80.<br /><br />I ran out of pepper and don't care for a three week wait for a refund.  But I will never order from this company again.<br /><br />BUYERS BEWARE !
