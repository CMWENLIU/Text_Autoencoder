skippy had the salmonella warning. i had via amazon bought two units, each having 6 jars. when i called their number for getting my money back or a way to exchange...they put up a huge hassle, making hurdels to do any of that. if you bought 6 jars there was an added number to call. they wanted photos of the jars, they wanted the labels (ever try peeling those off, they would not accept the sales receipt.<br /><br />i am totally done with any company that treats customers that way. either treat us right or have us not buy your product. i think they are part of unilever company..and so i will avoid any unilever products.
