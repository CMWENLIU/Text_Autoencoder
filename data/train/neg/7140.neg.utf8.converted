I do not buy Ovaltine any more. I used to buy it for years, but when the recipe changed...no longer dissolving in milk and slightly different taste I stopped buying it. I really miss the old recipe. Why did it change? I wonder if the newer version is selling as well as the old recipe? Can the old Ovaltine recipe still be purchased?
