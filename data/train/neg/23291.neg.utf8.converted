I was really looking forward to eating this product but was surprised by the saltieness of it (not in the nice salty sweet way you think of peanut butter cookies).  When I gave it to my daughter (thinking it may just have been me) she did not care for it either and commented that it kind of tasted like dog biscuits.  That is precisely what it became and our dogs LOVE it.  If you buy this be prepared for a salty taste and give it a fair chance as I see by other posts it may be something you love; I just didn't happen to be one of those people, unfortuantely we fell into the hate catagory.
