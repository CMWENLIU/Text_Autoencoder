I really like Chai Latte - this was bad! It's WAY TOO SWEET and it leaves a fake sugar aftertaste. It left a mouthfeel of undissolved powdery stuff. Wow, am I sorry I paid money for this! (It did smell good, and the spice flavor was nice, until the sugar and aftertaste hit, then it only smelled good.)
