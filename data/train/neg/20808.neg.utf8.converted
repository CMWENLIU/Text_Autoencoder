Description of the product says: "Soursop Leaves Tea". Actually, I have received a small bag (about 1/2 once) of Soursop Leaves not the TEA. Besides that, the quality of the leaves is marginal - they were not dried properly and look and smell similar to brownish autumn leaves in the late autumn forest. And to make it all just a bit better: the bag contains in addition to the bad dried leaves - small particles of grass and herbs dust. Now you got the picture - if it describes the product you are willing to brew a tea from - go ahead and order, otherwise STAY AWAY!
