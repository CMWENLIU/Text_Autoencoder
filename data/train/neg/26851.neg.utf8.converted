Candy came "dirty" - red, orange, green, blue dots all over them - And not in TROLLI brand packaging. They come in a sealed (thank goodness) plastic glassine bag with a "sweet gourmet" sticker on the outside. I believe that they are generic brand candies, and not the name brand Trolli's that I was expecting based on the name of the product. I am not impressed.<br /><br />I was buying these to display in a candy bar for a party, and they look terrible as display candy because of all the speckles. It looks like they were in a giant container with tons of other candies, and candy crumbs that then stuck to the outside of each little candy. Definitely not good enough for a glass display jar. Probably fine to eat, but If i were buying them for a gift, I would be mad that they didn't come in Trolli brand packaging. I'm also concerned with how they were handled before they were sealed into the current bag since they were obviously not factory sealed by Trolli.
