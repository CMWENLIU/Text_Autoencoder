Wow! I have one can of Choplets left and decided it was time to order another case from Amazon. No Way. When I first started ordering them from Amazon about 3 years ago, they were $36.00 for a case of 12. Each time I order, I find that the price has increased. A case is now $70. As a couple of previous posters noted, I too have received many dented cans. At $70 a case, I no longer find dented cans acceptable. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase these. I think this product is absolutely delicious and I have been enjoying them since childhood, but I will not order from Amazon solely based on principle.
