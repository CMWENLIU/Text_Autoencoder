I returned this product immediately.  First 2 ingredients were Salt and Monosodium Glutamate.  The website portrays the product as Bonito Fish and Seaweed soup stock - I couldn't find the ingredient list - so mistakenly trusted the discription. I planned to use the product as the base for Miso Soup, a healthy food - it would certainly defeat the purpose to use this product!!
