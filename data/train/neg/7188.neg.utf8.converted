I purchased this tea to make iced tea and found it to be extremely weak in comparison to similar teas from other brands.  My recipe calls for 12 teaspoons of tea.  I used 18 teaspoons of this one and it was still much too weak to really enjoy.<br /><br />Davidson's has some great teas, but this isn't one of them.
