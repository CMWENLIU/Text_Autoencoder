I threw away my bag of chicken jerky after hearing about the FDA warning on chicken jerky products made in China.  Looking on the back of the bag, it says this product is made in China so I will not be buying it again.  It's not worth the future health of my pet, despite how much they may love their jerky treats.  I'm on the lookout now for a USA made alternative.  Put your pets first, not you wallet.  It may cost more to buy USA made, but it is worth it in the long run if your dogs avoid dying an early death that could have been avoided.
