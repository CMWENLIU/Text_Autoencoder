If you are desperately looking for a replacement to all the kombucha that has been pulled off the grocery store shelves lately, this is not the solution.  Rarely do I buy something and just throw it away, but this stuff was undrinkable.  I wish I had researched it a little more.  If you need kombucha, make your own or order real kombucha.
