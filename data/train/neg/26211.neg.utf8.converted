These are larege tea bags, with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags.  When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions, it was just too strong for my taste.  Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition.  After trying it several times, I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands.  They leave me feeling much better than this does.  For those who would need or enjoy it, I'm sure it would be very good.
