I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal for years. I like most of the flavors ( even the plain ) and the banana cream is wonderful but they only sell it in the variety pack. I figured this would taste just as good as the banana cream so I ordered it. That was a mistake. This was terrible ! It had almost no taste and the taste it had was that of a diet after-taste. That's the only way to explain it. It has a chemical and paste taste...if that makes sense. I thought of donating it to my local foodbank but I feel bad giving such a terrible tasting product to a family in need.
