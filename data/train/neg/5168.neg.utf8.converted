This product is no better than any other bottled water brands name or simple tap water. First of all, Glaceau is distilled MUNICIPAL water. Second of all, buying this product for the sole reason that it is  distilled water isn't very advantageous to your health or is a waste of money. Distilled water does more harm than good. Drinking distilled water for a long period will remove necessary electrolytes from your body such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and several trace elements that are absolutely necessary for your health. These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes. The average person is not doing very strenuous activities that requires them to drinks with added electrolytes because he/she is profusely sweating out electrolytes  onto skin. Water has naturally occurring electrolytes. Also, fruits and vegetable are good sources of electrolytes.
