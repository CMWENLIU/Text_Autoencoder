This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!
