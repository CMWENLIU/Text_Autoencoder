Note this is not a rating for the item. If I wasn't mad as h*ll, I would have thought this was some kind of bad joke.  The seller (diapers.com) advertized the item as a pack of six. I ordered two packs and the seller sent just two boxes (which i could have purchased in a grocery store for a lot less).  The product description was probably an error, unless it was an intentional misrepresentation.  Please do your DD before you order.
