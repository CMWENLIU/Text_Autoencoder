I thought my review from the single item listing would carry over to here, but it didn't. I've got to warn guys off of this useless "tool."<br /><br />This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Trying to be "proper" with my comments, women don't have the same "hardware" to be cleaned.<br /><br />It doesn't fit your hand. When you're slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It's useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can't run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.<br /><br />And I'll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male "private parts," it's impossible. Both front and back.<br /><br />My wife's normal pink "poof" is far better.<br /><br />Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a "tool." (Obvious male-directed marketing.) It's still trash. If I were to buy a tool as useless as this, it would be returned to the parts store ASAP.
