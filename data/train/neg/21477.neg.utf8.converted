These DO NOT work. Don't waste your money. I recently purchased three boxes each holding two moth traps. A month ago I put all six all over my house in various rooms because I have been noticing moths. Not one moth has gone into the trap and continue to fly right by and past. I think either they were old products or the teeny tiny moth lure that goes inside each one is totally ineffective. These were a waste of money.
