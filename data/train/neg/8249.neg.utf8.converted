Where, oh where can you find a tea strainer that doesn't leak?  These Tuffy Steepers are cute, look practical and easy to use, but they fail at their basic purpose...straining the tea and keeping leafs out of the brew.  They collapse into easily transportable shapes, come with a little lid that serves as a base for the hot, wet strainer when finished, they're dishwasher safe...but they don't keep the loose tea out of the brew!  Infuriating.  Plus, they're awful big and take up a lot of room in the cup, so when you remove the steeper, you're left with a 1/2 cup of tea.  One other thing, there's a funky clip that you can see in the pictures.  It's a small plastic thing that extends out over the steeper, for what purpose I can't tell.  It might have been better designed where it repositioned to extend out and down, so you could clip it over the rim of the cup to steady the thing.  I was disappointed by these.  Great looks, little function.  My hunt continues.
