Don't waste your money!<br />I drink only peppermint tea and by now I became an expert in it. This is NOT peppermint or anything close to it. I get more flavor from the cheapest tea in the supermarket. The leaves are crushed too small and they smell like grass or weak oregano. No taste, except for some bitterness (grass?). I am trying to see how to return it. OOOPPPSS can't return it. I will give it to my cow : )
