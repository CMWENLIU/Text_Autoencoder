Black Cherry Switch is 100% juice (a mixture of juices actually, but more on that later) combined with filtered sparkling water.  It has no sugar added or corn syrup, no artificial colors or preservatives--these are all positive attributes.<br /><br />I think the concept of combining fruit juice and carbonation in a small-shot serving (8.3 ounces in a slim can) is just fine.  My problem with Black Cherry Switch in particular (the only flavor I have tried) is that cherry juice is listed fourth out of four juices this beverage contains (the other three are apple, grape and acerola juices).  As a result, the cherry flavor ends up battling (and getting trounced by) these other flavors.  The end result was, for me, inadequate cherry flavor.<br /><br />Will I run out to buy more Black Cherry Switch?  No.  Even though the beverage was refreshing, the cherry flavor was too muddled by other juices and too low in the ingredients list to give me the punch of black cherry flavor that I expected and wanted.<br /><br />Would I buy more Black Cherry Switch if it had a more distinct cherry taste?  Yes, it is highly likely that I would buy it at least occasionally.
