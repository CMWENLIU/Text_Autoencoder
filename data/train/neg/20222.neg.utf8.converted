These chocolates may be fabulous -- I hope so, as I sent them as a gift.  I thought that the shipping charges on my order looked high, but I was in a hurry so I ordered a bunch of gifts, including this one, without examining too closely.  Anyway, the shipping charge for this product alone was over $11!! The same price as the product itself.  I am giving 1 star because I think this is TACKY to make the product cost double what you think it will by tacking on a such a ridiculous "shipping and handling" charge.  Beware!
