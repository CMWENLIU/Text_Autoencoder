I WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE.. I OREDERED ON DEC 16 AND IT ARRIVED ON DEC 29TH. IT DOESNT EVEN LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE BEAUTIFUL BASKET THAT IS DISPLAYED AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS MISSING/. NOT ONLY WAS I SO EMBARASED THAT I COULD NOT GIVE MY NEIGHBOR HER PRESENT FOR CHRISTMAS , NOW I HAVE THIS PUNY THING TO GIVE , WHICH IS NOT WORTH $40... IM GONNA TRY TO GET MY $$$ BACK... THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.!!!!
