This is the most epically terrible icing I've ever tried. We tried the White Chocolate Raspberry. It tastes like toothpaste. The $4 spent on it are nothing compared to the amount of REAL toothpaste it will take to wash the taste out of my mouth. Really absolutely awful. Absurdly terrible icing. (PS - I have never written a review of anything before this terrible product. It's that bad.)
