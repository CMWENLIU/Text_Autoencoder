Do your research before buying. These pine nuts have an Italian name on the label and say 'imported' but no country of origin.<br /><br />They are actually from China.<br /><br />Very misleading...<br /><br />You can find Mediterranean and Italian Pine Nuts online at a host of places without having to buy the inferior ones from China...
