Eight dollars a can for an item that normally sells for around four dollars a can is a total rip off. This product was available from Amazon a few months back, but hasn't been in inventory in recent months. Regardless, you can purchase at your local grocery for a little over $4 and on-line in quantity for under that. The price this vendor is attempting to charge is indicative of their lack of business ethics - and Amazon's as well, for letting this vendor do business through their site. The product is wonderful, the vendor is evidently a crook.
