I tried this for my 6 month old Golden Retriever puppy because I was starting to see burn spots on my lawn and was hoping to "contain" the area where she was doing her business. NO LUCK WHATSOEVER. It was totally a waste of money. And, it turns out a little extra watering got rid of the spots...not to mention, she basically goes all over the lawn and not in one particular area. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
