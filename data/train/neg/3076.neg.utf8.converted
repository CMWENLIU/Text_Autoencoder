<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M8KYCK">Jacobs Latte Macchiato, 8-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>I love Jacob's Latte Machiatto for the Tassimo; however, since they came out with the new packaging, every package I have opened has had about 75% of the creamer disks defective.  The barcode reader won't read it, and the machine goes into manual mode.  If I wanted to use manual mode, I'd be using a Dolce Gusto machine!  The problem only occurs with the creamer disks, not the coffee disks, and not with any other brand of beverage.  I have checked and cleaned and cleaned to scanner surface, but that is obviously not the problem - the problem is in the bar code on the packaging of the creamer disks.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed. When you consider what these things cost, it's not fun having 75% of them defective.
