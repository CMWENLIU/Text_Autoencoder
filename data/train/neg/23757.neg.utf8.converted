It was very misleading to me whem the ad on Amazon said pack of 12.  I assumed that meant there were 12 breadsticks in the 3.5 Once box and I ordered 2.  Imagine my surprise when a huge package arrived and I unpacked 24 BOXES of the breadsticks.  We'll be eating them for years (if the shelf life is that long)  I was very disappointed that I spent unneccesary money on something I certainly didn't need.
