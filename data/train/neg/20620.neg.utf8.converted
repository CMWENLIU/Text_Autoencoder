This product contains soy isoflavins, the plant equivalent of estrogen. This has different effects on different people. For some, it makes them more fertile (see articles on soy and fertility). For those who use oral contraceptives with estrogen, this product can make you physically sick, including migraine-like headaches and diarrhea. If you take oral contraceptives and suffer ANY adverse consequences after using this product, STOP and find a non-soy replacement like Biox Whey Isolate.
