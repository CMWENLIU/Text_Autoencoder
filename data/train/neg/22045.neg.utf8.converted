I had high hopes for this product.  Having spent a fair bit of time in Singapore & Malaysia I have come to love the regional cuisine.  Especially Beef Redang which if you have never had it is a very tasty (muslim) dry style curry.  It is a process to make at home - lots of ingredients and slow cooking to yield a savory curry of tender beef.  When prepared correctly it is a knockout dish.  When I saw this product and the great reviews I thought it might be a good way to make a quicker version when the mood strikes.  Having said that  I cannot recommend this to anyone who has had this great dish nor anyone who would like to try it for the first time.  The kit is easy enough - stir fry beef and then add spice paste, coconut milk powder and water.  Simmer until tender and then voila beef redang.  If only - the mix gave off a faintly chemical odor which i found disturbing and off putting.  Beef Redang usually (like many dishes of the region) has a funky (good) smell from the use of fermented shrimp paste or belachan. its strong but pleasant - this in no way smelled of that.  putting aside the off smell I tried the curry and found it to be not just mild but flavorless.  Maybe this was an issue with this batch but I could no way recommend this product to anyone.
