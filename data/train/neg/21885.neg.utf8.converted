Green tea is so good for you, but I don't like the taste of it, but after seeing this tea featured in "O" (Oprah) Magazine and touted as a sweet dessert green tea I had to order it.<br />I have yet to try this tea though, I've placed two orders and both times I only receive one box of 16 tea bags where as this product clearly states six boxes containing 96 tea bags in total.<br />Amazon has gladly refunded me back my money, but I'd really just like to have my tea order fulfilled properly.
