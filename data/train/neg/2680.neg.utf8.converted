I bought this product soley bcuz it said it had 11 of polyunsaturated fat!<br />Received it today and the label says it only has 2.  I'm really ticked off that<br />I wasted my money on this.  Amazon should automatically have to refund anyone that bought this;<br />Even if they don't send it back - RIP OFF!
