I read the reviews and so tried a case of this mix....not happy with it at all.<br />  My dog likes it, that's all I can say.<br />  I made the bread in my Emeril breadmaker, which has turned out loaf after loaf of incredibly perfect bread....until now.<br /><br />It is DENSE, and when you slice it, unless you slice it thick, it falls apart.<br />  I had my husband try it, just telling him it was a new mix...he thought it was ok, he toasted it, with lots of butter, so the flavor is apparntly ok.<br />  I will have to try it for bagels or pie crust. Maybe it will work better for that.<br />Other than being at high altitude (and I followed the high altitude directions) I can't think<br />of anything else that could have gone wrong. I used the ingrediants it asked for....
