I believe your company has pulled a bait and switch as it regards the Callabaut chocolate cocoa powder, which you sell, versus the Callabaut Baking Cocoa Powder, which you do not sell.  I believe the same regarding the 1 pound Valrhona Chocolate Cocoa Powder, which you sell, versus Valrhona Cocoa Powder which you do not sell.  It is deceptive that you added the word chocolate after the brand name and sell to customers a product that is not the genuine product.  I just today opened my order of one of each of your products and found them to be of such low quality in a triple blind tasting with three tasters that I had to research what was wrong.  It wasn't until I went to the manufacturers' websites that I found the genuine products do not come packaged in one pound sizes, the size of your products.  It was my intention to purchase the Cook's Illustrated magazine's top rated cocoa powder, Callabaut. And try the highly recommended Valrhona cocoa powder.  The Valrhona product I purchased from your company was agreed by all three tasters to have an off taste that was chemically and unpalatable.  The Callabaut lacks richness, and other than its color, tastes nothing close to what one would define as chocolate in flavor.<br /><br />I am unhappy that I do not have the products I was so looking forward to receiving, and further I am quite put out that I now have to take my time to deal with returning your substandard products and wait to receive what I really thought I was ordering.  But one learns from experience, and I now know to deal only with the true manufacturer.
