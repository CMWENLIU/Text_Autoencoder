I wish I had bought 11oz instead of 44... read the reviews thinking it would be better, and cheaper, than Starbucks Columbia. Wrongo.<br /><br />It's strong, but too strong. Tastes like super hotel coffee when you grind the beans yourself. I made a few pots and poured the last one out. Gave it away.<br /><br />I'm particular what I put into my body, and this brew offends me. The smell is great though, just great. If only the taste parred with it.<br /><br />It's a taste all of it's own. Way too strong of taste for not enough zing.<br /><br />2 Stars. It's still better than the cheap stuff.
