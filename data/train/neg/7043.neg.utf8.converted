This juice bills itself as organic cranberry juice, but it is actually a cranberry - apple blend, and the bottles are labeled that they contain 95% juice.  If you know that is what you are getting, it is perfectly fine "cranapple" juice.  I used it in punches for a party, and it worked for what I needed.  I prefer my cranberry juices to be a little more tangy and vibrant; this is a little mild and bland for my taste.
