I love regular Sleepytime tea, but I had a bad experience with Sleepytime Extra, I assume because of the valerian.  The tea did not help me sleep at all.  Then in the morning, I couldn't stand without fainting and had a horrible headache.  I had to sleep off the effects for several hours.  I tend to be prone to fainting and have bad reactions to drugs with psychological effects, so my reaction is probably unusual.  However, I would recommend reading up on valerian before trying this tea.<br /><br />On the plus side, it tasted fine, though different from regular Sleepytime.
