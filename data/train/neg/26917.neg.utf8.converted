We have a problem with centipedes and cave crickets in the basement.  I set these traps out for a few weeks, and they barely caught anything.  A couple tiny spiders and maybe one cave cricket.  I had much better success with the large flat glue boards.  The ones that look like mouse traps, but for insects.  The "pheromone" on these Victor traps does not seem to attract anything.  So I would recommend using the bigger flat boards.
