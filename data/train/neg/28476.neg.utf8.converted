I'm giving 2 stars only because I own some responsibility for not finding a way to taste this "sweetener" before ordering 6 bags of it. I bought it for making Kombucha, and when I poured in the "Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar", it looked like I had poured in a cup and a half of dirt. Not to worry. I can take ugly as long as it's healthy, but my batch of Kombucha , after 8 days, is an opaque, sour, slurry of a mess, totally undrinkable, not like any Kombucha you've ever seen, and I'm just hoping I haven't ruined my SCOBY.<br />I'm a health food person, have been for many, many years, so I don't expect organic, healthy foods to taste like a Dairy Queen shake, but it should be somewhat palatable and interchangeable with unhealthy foods, i.e. processed sugar.<br />Since I can't return the 5 sealed, untouched bags, I'll stick them in my WTSHTF disaster preparedness stash. If the economy crashes, or we get some other apocalyptic disaster, I might be glad to have it, even if it tastes like burnt caramel, has little sweetening value, and looks like dirt.
