I have bad news for all you Nances lovers like me. Nances has now changed the formula. They made it gluten free and it is disgusting!!! I accidentally bought a bottle and had to throw it out. I emailed them and asked, they are not making the original formula anymore. Anyone who is upset about this should go to [...].  Click "retail" and "consumer feedback"! I did get an email response and they said that this is there new formula but they will take in to consideration customer feedback! We must get our old nances back!
