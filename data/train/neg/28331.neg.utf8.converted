This cookie was a huge disapointment! The taste was horrible!  I can't even describe my experience of eating just one bite in this appropriately deserved review...$29.00 for a tin of tasteless crap!  Never again will I purchase anything from David's Cookies for fear of encountering another wasted purchase of disgraceful cookies.  In the trash they went!!!!!!!
