Are you serious folks? From the country that sells us poisoned pet food, lead filled products for children? I am not being presumptuous here. There is too much info out there that we should be VERY skittish even for the most innocent seeming products. AND...ORGANIC!? FROM CHINA!? Sorry, not possible. That country is THE MOST POLLUTED TOXIC DUMP. Saw a documentary on this on PBS. A pretty reliable source that cares about our kids, the environment and able to tell the truth. So, this might be the best thing out there for some, but not this Mom. Do your research, don't risk your precious children.
