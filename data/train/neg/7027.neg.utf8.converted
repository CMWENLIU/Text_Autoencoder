I was disappointed, to say the least, in this product. When I prepared it, I ended up with a sticky mass. The package directions don't give much in the way of directions for cooking--just two different recipes. I obviously overcooked the product. It was such a gummy mess that I had to throw it away. I would not try it again unless the package directions were much more specific about how to use it.
