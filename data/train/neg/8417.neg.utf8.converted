I transitioned my dogs into this food. They are both under 15 pounds. They ate it eagerly, like they do with any other new food, but over time, I noticed they both seemed to be getting less and less healthy. It was so gradual that my husband and I both didn't really notice until about a month into the new food. They continued to eat it and around the 5th week, they both started getting diarrhea here and there. But my maltese continued to get sicker and sicker. She lost so much weight that her back resembled a stegasaurus, all of a sudden. She no longer had energy to run around and play any longer. She would lay on her bed listlessly and watch me instead of frolicking around, like she usually does. It was so sad. We left for a vacation and left my dogs with a friend with this food. At this point, we were suspicious that the food might have something to do with it, but we weren't positive there was a correlation. But when we got back, I had definite confirmation with my FRIEND'S dog, who ate plenty of their kibble. Her dog (16 year old beagle) was having diarrhea and vomitting while we were away.<br /><br />I have no proof that it was the food as I threw it all in the trash the moment I came back from vacation. But if it were still in my possession, I would definitely send it away for analysis and let the company know that we would definitely NOT ever take a step towards anything their company makes ever again.<br /><br />I urge you to stay away from this food, and if you do decide to take a chance with it, proceed with extreme caution, and keep the original bag so you can let the company know the batch number should any problems arise. I wish I had done the same.<br /><br />My dogs recovered the moment I switched their food.<br /><br />- Angry 'mom' to two.
