I have had very good sugar free chewy black licorice before but these were not.  Sugar free were the only thing they were.  Otherwise they were hard but flavorless. I was very disappointed as I love a great piece of strong flavored sugar free black licorice.  Now what am I going to do with 5 lbs of this stuff?
