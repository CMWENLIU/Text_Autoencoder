I ordered this product for my diabetic father.  It came in a timely matter, bubble-wrapped.  The box obviously was wet and labeled "Bad condition on pick-up."  I opened the package and one bottle was fine.  The blueberry syrup had leaked from the seal and was half empty and the box and packing material sticky with blueberry syrup.  I contacted the company who immediately sent out another bottle.  I received it a few days later:  IT HAD LEAKED AGAIN!!!  I contacted them stating to credit my account and they immediately credited my account.  I wish I could have gotten the syrup, but the company was easy to deal with.
