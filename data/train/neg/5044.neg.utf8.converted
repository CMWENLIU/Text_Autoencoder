I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was "off" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product "LaraBar" by "LaraBar".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.
