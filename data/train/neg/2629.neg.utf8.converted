If you don't already know, Pu'erh tea has many health benefits. You can read about it at puerh dot tk.<br /><br />I bought Rishi's Pu'erh tuos on sale at a supermarket for $5 per tin. At the time, I considered it to be good quality Pu'erh, but frankly after experiencing much better Pu'erh tea that I bought via mail order from Andao (no, I do not work for them) it is hard for me to recommend Rishi any longer.<br /><br />The difference between superior Pu'erh and Rishi's is very noticeable. I'm now experimenting with buying Pu'erh direct from China and will post my experiences when I have a verdict.
