Ok I know how beneficial all the ingredients are in this dry food are. But my MAIN COMPLAINT is my cat (at least once a week) ends up pushing out STICKY POOP! He can't pinch the last bit off and it sticks to his butt and then he waltzes out into the living room and DRAGS HIS BUTT ON THE CARPET!!!!!!! Our healthy cat is a strictly indoor cat and he has all the access to water and is only fed this dry food by a Le Bistro automatic feeder. Don't tell me I have to supplement his dry food with wet food, that defeats the convenience of the automatic feeder.<br /><br />WHAT CAN I DO???? please email me, mikegunn98 at yahoo.com or leave a comment here.
