I went against the poor reviews when I ordered this product for two reasons: 1)These bars have always been good when I purchased them from local grocery stores and 2)I believed Amazon would have gotten any issues resolved since the time the poor reviews were written. While I don't know what the reason for the problem is, I can indeed report on my own observation. On all of the bars, the chocolate coating looks like it disolved away, leaving behind a grainy and off putting exterior. The taste of the peanut butter bar is nothing like the bars I've purchased elsewhere...these tasted medicinal, stale, and just plain bad. Other Think Thin Bars I've purchased from Amazon are perfect but this one missed the mark by a galaxy.
