BEWARE - This cereal contains a chemical sweetener called Aspartame (aka Sweet'nLow), which is a dangerous chemical food additive shown to cause cancer in lab rats.  In humans, the effects of Aspartame can be felt as either migraine, other headache, dizziness, nausea, anxiety, nervousness, or bloating.  PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON ASPARTAME before you consume any product such as this.  ASPARTAME is rated by the governments as "GRAS - Generally Regarded As Safe" - The History of Aspartame is fascinating and you will find that the scientists at the FDA who tested Aspartame advocated it to be banned.  Donald Rumsfeld served as one of the influential political forces that successfully managed to get the FDA to overrule the FDA's own scientists' recommendation that this product be BANNED.  Aspartame's GRAS status means that the US Gov't will do nothing to regulate or prevent its usage.<br /><br />I first started experiencing problems with Fiber-One when I realized that eating a bowl of it without any other food would cause me to feel nauseous.  On occasion, eating a bowl of Fiber-One would give me a migraine along with a feeling of dizziness.  This is certainly not the way that I want to start off the morning.  There are people who can eat Aspartame-laced foods all day long and who are unaware of any side-effects, but they do creep up on you and if you are not as tolerant as some others, WATCH OUT.  You could become very sick eating this cereal day after day, the chemical builds up in your system.  The insidiousness of Aspartame being in Fiber-One is that, if you are health-counscious, you'll tell yourself that if you're not feeling well that you should maybe eat more healthy food - like the very same Fiber-One cereal that's making you sick!!<br /><br />It is unethical and unconscionable for General Mills, a staple brand in this country, to have resorted to using a dangerous chemical additive simply so their Marketing Exec's can push their cereal upon people who are sugar-sensitive.  People with Diabetes BEWARE - Aspartame is known to also cause aggressive insulin responses.  Just because their chemical sweetener contains no calories doesn't mean that your body won't react in that manner, and you may end up on the bad end of an insulin swing as a result.<br /><br />This product should be pulled immediately from the shelves.  I personally am ashamed that a large reputable company such as GM would target a health-conscious individual like myself and yet perform an underhanded trick as adding a chemical sweetener.  I really wish I had noticed the chemical additive in this cereal before I had experienced the headaches and nausea.<br /><br />SHAME ON GENERAL MILLS - BEWARE FIBER ONE CEREAL - I wish I would have been warned before becoming sickened by this "health cereal".
