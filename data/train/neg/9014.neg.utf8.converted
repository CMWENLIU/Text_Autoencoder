My husband and I are chocoholics. The minute I saw the word "megafudge" I envisioned rich, gooey chocolate melting in my mouth. Sadly, this was not the case. The cookies taste rather dry, they aren't particularly sweet and each one left a strange chalky aftertaste in my mouth. The texture is more like cookie dough than fudge. The little white chocolate chips sprinkled into each cookie don't have any flavor to them. If you had told me these were reduced fat cookies, like SnackWells, I would have believed you. Since they're not, I'd rather indulge in something that actually tastes good since my waistline will be paying for it!
