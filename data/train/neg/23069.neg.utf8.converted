This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts ("nuts" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).  I'd picked up various flavors at small local stores and enjoyed them so grabbed this when it went on sale to try.  I'll not buy this flavor again but do recommend the brand.
