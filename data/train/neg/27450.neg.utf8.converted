This is absolutely the worst coffee I've ever had! I was expecting a dark, full flavored, bold coffee - AN ESPRESSO! Instead what I got was the equivalent of a supermarket, off the shelf, canned coffee. You know the type, weak, no flavor, stale, so thin you can see through it. If you like supermarket, canned coffee then this is for you. If  you're looking for an Espresso, Stay Away! This isn't it.
