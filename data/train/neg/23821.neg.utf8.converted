Only buy this if you like the taste of chinese tea. Actually, if you like chinese tea, you can buy it a lot cheaper than this. Way overpriced for what you get. It does not taste like American tea, if that is what you are seeking, choose another brand. The "flowering" effect is not that dramatic or pretty. And to taste llike full brewed tea, you can only use each one once.
