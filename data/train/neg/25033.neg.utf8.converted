This product is a perfect example for the erroneous notion that the label of "all natural" or "organic" is of higher quality and therefore of good taste.  It seems to me that the makers have not really put much effort into this product.  Before purchasing I looked everywhere on-line  for the ingredients label and could not find it anywhere.  Here it is folks!: Sugar* (evaporated Cane Juice), Citric Acid (provides tartness), Natural Lemon Flavor, Natural Cloud (Maltrodextrin*, High Oleic Sunflower Oil*, Silicon Dioxide), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Everything with the (*) are the organic ingredients. Not a very good list I may add.<br /><br />Sorry to say this, but who ever is giving this product any good review for taste must be either working for Fruit Blooms or has numb taste buds. To describe the taste:  after initially adding two level table spoons to 8fl oz. of water as suggested, the taste was rather flat.  After adding one more table spoon I couldn't help but be reminded of chewable vitamin C tablets which is far from how lemonade should taste.  Fruit Bloom...Get to work!!!
