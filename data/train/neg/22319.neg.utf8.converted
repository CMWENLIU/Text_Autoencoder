This is a good quality Quinoa but it is too expensive. I found it much cheaper (same quality product organic, prewashed quinoa) in a local chain store (Costco). It only cost about $10.00 for 4 LBs in that store. Amazon price is $30.00+ for 6 lbs. we all have to tell Amazon to reduce the price for this product. I don't recommend anyone to amazon.com for this particular product. I received broken package but Amazon was very kind to provide me a replacement with in Two days.
