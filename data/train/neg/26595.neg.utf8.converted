One star for never replying to my email in which I included a photograph of a foreign object I found in the first package (looked like a dark brown chunk of foam, along with a hair). I was very much concerned when reading the labels' country of origin that among three, included China (Somehow I doubt that Canada beat out China for pricing = most likely China). Although I'll never know for sure since they never responded to any of my questions/concerns. I wouldn't recommend this product if your concerned about food quality.
