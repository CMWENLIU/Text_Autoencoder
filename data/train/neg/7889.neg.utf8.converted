K-Cups are defective. Filter collapses and you get a cup full of grounds or a partial cup of coffee. Whwen you try to remove the K-Cup it makes a huge mess dripping grounds and coffee all over everything. Called Tomothy's customer service three times and you get an anwering machine and they DO NOT RESPOND to your complaints. My Kuerig works perfectly with four other brands so it is definitely a defective product.
