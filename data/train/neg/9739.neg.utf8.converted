I ordered this product believing it to be the original premium water I love.  Instead, I received "Essence Water", a version "enhanced" with stevia extract which in my opinion, absolutely ruined this product.  I was sooooooo disappointed.  Kudos to Amazon however, for crediting the cost of the product following my complaints about an additive many still find controversial that wasn't shown in the product information.
