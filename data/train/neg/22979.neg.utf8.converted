I enjoy the pulp in my aloe drinks, and, sadly, the J1 Aloe Drink doesn't contain much of it. Furthermore, there is an oddly chemical taste to the drink, which may be a product of the honey.<br /><br />This drink is also nearly cloyingly sweet, and, though I do enjoy a sweet beverage, something this sweet is a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Of course, drinks are a matter of personal preference, so, to each their own. :)
