A couple of people commented that this candy is the same ORIGINAL product as the ones many of us remember from our childhood. It is NOT! I just received mine, and was expecting the same delightful taste from my childhood in the late 40's...I'm extremely disappointed! The colors are faded, and there is virtually no flavor at all! The packaging reads "original", which I find to be false advertising. This is NOT the original Necco wafers that I grew up with, or that I ate just a couple of years ago. Very sad indeed!
