I ordered this product on a subscription basis, thinking that these were shelled walnuts; that is, not diced or chopped.  The product arrived with all walnuts chopped, not shelled walnuts.  The good news is that customer service gave me full credit without requiring a return.  Now I have six pounds of chopped walnuts to give to the food pantry....
