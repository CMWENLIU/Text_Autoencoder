This is the best taste I have encountered in a K-cup, dark yet mellow, without the bitter finish you sometimes encounter with a french roast.<br /><br />I have cancelled my subscription to this coffee, as much as I enjoy the coffee I just bought a pack with exploding k cups. I am using a shared machine and it makes a terrible mess, filling the cup of coffee and the coffee maker with wet grinds. This happened with 3 k-cups out of the first 5.
