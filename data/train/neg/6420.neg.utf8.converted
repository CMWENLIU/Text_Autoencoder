As of autumn 2010, Lindt has changed the recipe for their "Excellence 70%" dark chocolate. The new recipe is very different--much more sweet and bland. It does not have the delightful intensity of the original recipe, which was my regular chocolate for years. The original recipe was exceptional, but the new one is just another ordinary chocolate. I'd skip it.
