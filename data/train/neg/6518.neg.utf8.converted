These traps work and they require less excavation and knowledge to use than say the black hole. However, I have had three out of six break (the metal just broke) without even a caught gopher. I suspect these are now made in China and therefore are of poor quality. Only buy them from a place where you can return them if they break. Mine broke just because of the tension of setting them ( they were only used for one day!). Buy the more expensive brand of this type of trap which is made by McAfee.
