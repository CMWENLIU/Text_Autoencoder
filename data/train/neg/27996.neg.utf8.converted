As I have already notified Amazon, the lid on one of the jars in this 3-jar pack had not been tightened, so almost all of the molasses in that jar leaked out, soaking the pack and also leaking through the plastic enclosure onto the other products and box the items were shipped in.<br />Amazon has not responded to this packing complaint, which I think is disgraceful.<br /><br />The molasses itself has a rather strong flavor but is quite good.  I ordered it so my wife can make me a shoo-fly pie.  It is dark colored like blackstrap, but not quite as strong. Doesn't taste anything like dates. If you like the taste of a heavy syrup you would probably enjoy this product.  Just tell whoever packs it to tighten the lids before shipping.
