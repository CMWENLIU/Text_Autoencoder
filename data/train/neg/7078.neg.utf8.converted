Boo Amazon!  I thought I loved you for the convenience you offer and the reasonable pricing, but when you raise the price of a recurring item *40%* in two-month's time, I feel like you're scamming me.  The first month I paid about $13, the next month about $15,  Ok, fine, demand goes up, I get it.  Next month: $21!!  And you don't even give me special notice?  And this item costs $0.49/can or $15.68 per 32 in any major grocery store on sale?  Feels like you're preying on the busy, confused, or unaware.<br /><br />Bottom line: Sign up for Subscribe & Save, dear shopper, but keep your eyes on the price!
