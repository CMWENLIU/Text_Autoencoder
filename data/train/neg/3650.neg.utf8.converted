I bought a sampler from this company primarily to sample their fudge. After 3 weeks and 4-5 calls and emails I finally received my order. They would have been better not to send it at all. I received some stale mini cones that taste like cardboard, some chocolate tart cup and spoon chocolate cookies that were simply TERRIBLE and old. If first impressions are everything then I can not lose this companies phone number fast enough. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
