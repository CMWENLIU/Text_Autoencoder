that irresistible dickensian odor as it warms . . .<br /><br />British culinary experience is not world noted. From London's bangers and mash to Liverpool's scouse to Glasgow's haggis, this Isle of Bad Teeth is not normally sought for its kitchen fare.<br /><br />And so within this small can it comes to us.<br /><br />In Dickens we read of the ravenous appetites consuming the most bizarre items, of Tiny Tim's bag of lard boiled with brandy and a plum, of whatever it was Fagin gave his small boys in London's slums. Here we share a taste of those delights.<br /><br />Do not let this discourage you. Let a can of this sit (opened) in a pan of bubbling hot water, alongside a can of evaporated milk. This in itself makes an adequate holiday pot-pourri, filling your house with cozy warmth, and this is undoubtedly the only safe manner to consume it: olfactory rather than gustatory, considering the transfats, sugars and flour. (Remember my child the warm mothering spirit of Adele Davis, she of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451155505">Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit</a>, warning us of the three white poisons: salt, sugar and refined flour, oh yeah and fats).<br /><br />Yet, for those who truly find this "to die for" place the pudding on one bowl, pour the milk on top, add extra cinnamon, and as desired, honey or molasses over all, and enjoy.<br /><br />Best thing since Indian Pudding!
