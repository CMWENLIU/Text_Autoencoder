This cat food is terrible for cats.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the nice handled pail it comes in.  I throw out the food and reuse the pail for for a paint bucket.  Seriously look at the ingredients.  If the food coloring and preservatives dont stop you in your tracks look at how much quality meat goes into this....none.  I fed this to my 2 cats over a year.  The female got extremely fat and fur came out in clumps.  The male which was only 2 years old got sent to the animal hospital with urinary tract blockage.  The hospital bill was $1500 to save the cat.  Moral of the story... spend a little more for quality food like EVO or CORE and save way more by having healthy cats.  There is no doubt that this food and others like it is inappropriate to feed cats and will cause all sorts of maladies over time.
