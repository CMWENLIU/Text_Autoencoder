First - let me say this is far and away the best sugar-free syrup I've ever had.  It's not watery, and has a great mapley flave.  Five stars for Joseph's.<br /><br />However, I have no idea why Amazon charges so much! Go to josephslitecookies.com, their home webpage, and you can get for less than $3.  Seriously.  Google it first if you think I'm making this up.  I've seen it on Amazon for as high as $9 a bottle, and you can get it direct for $3?!?<br /><br />I've lost a lot of my Amazon love since seeing some things like this, and then their whole middle finger to IL (anyone who was an affiliate in IL amazon gave the boot to because of Gov. Quinn's decision to tax them - thanks amazon for adding injury to insult and taking away the little guy's revenues too).
