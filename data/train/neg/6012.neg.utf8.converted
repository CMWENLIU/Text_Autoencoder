The only reason I gave this product one star is because Amazon won't let you give a 'NO' star. I was hoping to find a product that could take the place of peanut butter in my diet. I love peanut butter but it is so high in calories and fat. I should have known better than to think there was something out there to take its place. This stuff was horrible. I can't believe a company would actually produce something so horrendous and take consumers hard earned money for it. I paid $4.99 for it and threw it away after I spit out what was in my mouth.  Shame on you Walden Farms for selling this under the pretense of peanut butter. Even more so, for thinking it to be edible.
