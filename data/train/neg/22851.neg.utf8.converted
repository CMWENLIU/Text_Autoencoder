Why would anyone want to add sugar to coconut water???<br />I mean, what's the point of spoiling it and making to it like all the sugary drinks out there.<br />Can the American palate not tolerate anything that is all natural that does not have added sweeteners?<br /><br />I bet you that no one from the Caribbean or other places that coconuts are indigenous to would appreciate the alteration of this delicious water. We who are used to it do understand that the natural sweetness levels in each coconut varies, so some may be sweeter than others, and we are quite ok with that because it is natural.<br />Please read ingredients people- not all coconut waters are created equal.
