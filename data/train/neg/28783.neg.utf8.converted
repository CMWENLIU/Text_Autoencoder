I ordered 3 belly flop bags about 2 months ago, and all I received were 3 bags that contained the same 4-5 flavors, two of which I hated (black licorice and coconut).  I was really disappointed!  You say that you promise you'll give an "excellent variety of mixes" if we order more than one bag, but that definitely was NOT the case for me.
