I have been buying natural nut butters for YEARS, and I have never, EVER seen on that has so much oil in it. Even when fully mixed, this was too runny to really use on bread, which in itself is ok since I don't EAT bread, but not at all what I expect from anything other than Tahini!<br /><br />Is this NORMAL for this stuff, or did I get a bad batch. Just asking because I won't buy again if this is normal.....
