This product has MSG in it. I felt stupid because after all the " Naturally helps absorb vitamins A & E; Naturally rich in Omega 3 ALA**; No High Fructose Corn Syrup", they still use Mono-sodium Glutamate- MSG. I hate Wishbone now and will tell anyone who loves salad to avoid them at all costs.<br /><br />PS I checked the website for their explanation for this and read, "WE only use MSG when we feel it's necessary for taste"--- Isn't that why everyone used it, before health experts found it to be toxic!<br /><br />Do whats right for yourself and your family--- Avoid this Company!!!
