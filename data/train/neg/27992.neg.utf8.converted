According to Amazon's product description (as of 10/12/2011) this molasses has only one ingredient: dates. However, according to the label it is made from "concentrated date juice, sugar, water, citric acid" (see also the picture of the label with the ingredients that I uploaded). I did not want to buy a sugar sirup with some concentrated date juice in it, I wanted to buy a natural product made 100 % from dates. I will return this product.<br />PS: Once again I can only praise Amazon. The product is not returnable through the online system. But when I called and explained the situation I got immediately offered a refund. I love to buy from Amazon!
