I've tried many different brands of dried fruit and this one was one of the poorest quality.  More than 1/2 of the slices in the package have seeds and they don't come off easily. I either had to cut or bite off the pieces with seeds.  Definitely not worth the money. Some of the other brands on here with individually packaged fruit might be more costly per pound but are much better quality.
