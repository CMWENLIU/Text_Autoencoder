I received this today, and this product is Made in Mexico. This is not mentioned anywhere in the description, and I would not have purchased it if I had known this. I tried to return it, and Amazon website says it is not eligible for return. I am trying to deal with their customer service now to return it, but if you are like me and do not want to eat anything which was made in Mexico, then avoid this product.
