I started ordering the pack of 3 cheerios using the subscribe and save option 6 months ago and the price was reasonable.  It worked out great for a few months and then amazon changed their pricing and it went from ~$7.00/3 boxes to ~$11.00.  I don't know how they can justify a price hike of $4.00 in one month.  I have canceled this subscribe and save option ... along with a couple others.  A reminder to whomever reads this -- when they send you an email reminding you of an order coming soon --pay attention to the previous and the current pricing.  It got me the first month --not paying attention.
