This chocolate covered soy nuts are absolutely NASTY and DISGUSTING!!!!! My husband ordered them because he had some chocolate covered soy nuts on his trail mix and loved them. When he saw these on amazon he thought they would be amazing as well.... What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!! They taste old and not at all close to soy nuts. I couldn't even swallow it. Really disappointed in these!!!Will never buy this brand anymore!
