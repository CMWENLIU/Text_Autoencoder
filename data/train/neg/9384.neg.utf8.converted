I know these are are supposed to be good for you but I can't get over how tasteless these are...even with olive oil. I was expecting the "pure flavor" of sardines considering they're not laden with salt or other additives. But what a dissapointment...I think regular tuna in water tastes better. I give it 2 stars only because they're a healthy alternative for those watching their salt-intake. Other than that, these sardines lack flavor and taste and I definitely won't be buying them again.
