Wabash Valley Farms Kettle Corn All-Inclusive Popping Kits, 3-Count Pouches (Pack of 3), would make one believe that you would be receiving 9 pouches of popcorn kits (3 count pouches X pack of 3).  I received the item yesterday and to my dismay, there was a single box of kettle corn in the USPS box.  The single box contained 3 pouches.  I paid $12.94 for 3 pouches of popcorn ($4.31 a piece).  If you have ever purchased popcorn kits online before you would know that they are not that expensive.  The only complaint that I have here is that if the title of this product not led me to believe I was getting 9 pouches, I would of never purchased this item at such a high price.
