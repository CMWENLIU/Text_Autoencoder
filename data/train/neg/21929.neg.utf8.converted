This company used to be in Georgia.<br />A few years ago a larger company bought them out- closed the factory and they are now made in Mexico.<br /><br />They are not as good as they used to be and they are no longer even made here.<br /><br />Every Candy Cane I have found so far is made either in Mexico or China.<br /><br />Terrific- we don't even make our own Candy Canes anymore.<br /><br />I am not buying lousy Candy Canes made in Mexico or China.
