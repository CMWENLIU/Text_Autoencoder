I almost have tears in my eyes as I type the Truth.  PLEASE READ Before Buying, these were the best Organic based cookies...  Now they should be avoided by all who value quality.  Newman was a Great man, when he was alive the company was better... Since his death they have destroyed their best products by replacing the key organic ingredients w/ non Organic ones.  These cookies used to break apart great, often w/ a circle of chocolate... Now when you break them apart, the chocolate looks like what sticks to rear before wiping.  Nasty taste/texture, its not creamy, broken bits of chocolate.  I got very sick after eating these, causing me many issues trying to do number 2.  I'm considering a refund since I was dumb enough to buy 6 of them... There were no warning or notice that the formula had changed... I had just got them a few months prior so didn't expect anything different.  Please believe there is a huge difference w/ how body handles Organic Chocolate/Coca compared to non organic.  Sadly this is another product the Newman's company has made unconsumable.  It shows that companies do not respect consumer enough to have the main or key ingredients Organic.  For example if you get Organic cinnamon, ginger, cocoa, or chocolate cookies it should be Organic... Not made from Organic Wheat while the named ingredients are non organic unknown chemicals etc.  I'll continue to use their products for my dogs until those are ruined too.  Please realize the positive reviews are for a changed product... You will not receive the 5 star cookies people raved about... Instead there is just the 1 star non Organic Cocoa & Chocolate ones.
