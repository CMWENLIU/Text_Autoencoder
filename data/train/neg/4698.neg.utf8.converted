All of Amazon's food items should have a nutritional guide to view. If I had known the second ingredient on the label was brown sugar with 9 grams of sugar, I never would have purchased the nuggets! The texture of the nuggets is fresh and chewy but too much pepper for our taste and too sweet. My husband likes to take the single serving bag in his lunch for a snack so I thought he'd like to try something other than the strips. Sorry Jack Links but I won't be ordering these beef steak nuggets again!
