I know the effects from this are different for everybody, but this is just how it was for me.<br /><br />Within ten minutes of taking the whole bottle, I noticed that my heart was practically beating out of my chest. Within thirty minutes I felt exhausted to the point that I had to plop down on to the couch. If that was not a crash, then I don't know what is. But within a few hours I felt normal again.<br /><br />I would say that for the money it is not worth it. Just take a multivitamin and a strong cup of coffee.
