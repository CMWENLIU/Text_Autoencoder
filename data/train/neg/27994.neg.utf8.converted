On the two pictures that were taken, one with junk ingredients and one with just dates listed as the ingredient, I noticed the nutritional information remained the same....? If on jar one, sugar is the second ingredient and a serving has 12g of sugar then how can the date only jar still have the same 12g of sugar???  Also where is the fiber?  There are approximatly 1.2g of fiber per 2 dates. This seems like a very misleading product...
