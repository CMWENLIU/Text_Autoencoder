This is a negative 3 star review. The noodles were squid-ish, in both taste and texture. I nearly gagged when trying. Are they bad? Or is it that a no-calorie mush of plant solubles, really tastes this horrific. I have eaten some unique foods. I am no wimp. This would be a water-board-like torture they could use on me, if I ever got into trouble. Yecko bucko.
