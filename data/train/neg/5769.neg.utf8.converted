I bought these because the regular packages of Sunrise Orange Crystal Light were not available in any local stores. The drink mix powder sold in these 2-gallon packets is not the same as the product used in the 2-quart packets that are sold in retail stores. It is whiter and more powdery, and the taste of the resulting drink is, IMO, awful. I would not purchase this product again.
