I am a die-hard Keurig fan, and not too picky about my coffee. I prefer a stronger cup and don't use sugar. This blend was extremely bitter and lacked substance. I've tried 20+ blends for my Keuring and this is the only blend that I would'nt drink. I agree with another rater that compares this to the Jet Feul, but the Jet Fuel has a bit more taste and was tolerable for me. Nothing compares to the Newmann's Own Extra Bold Organic. It is cheaper at BJ's ($33 for 80 cups) versus the BJ's website.<br /><br />I also enjoy the Donut Shop Blend and the Green Mountain Nantucket or Breakfast Blend. Hope this helps!
