I take the tasks of reviewing a product very seriously. I try to be as fair to the manufacturer as possible. I consider that although every product is not for but may be for someone else.  This is the first product that I can't imagine anyone benefiting from. I have ethnic relaxed hair.  My hair is long as it reaches pass my bra strap snaps in the back.  I also put a rinse (semi-permanent color) in my hair.  Initially, I was excited that would find a product that I could use as a hot oil treatment as well as daily maintenance for those in need of a touch-up dry scalp days. This product failed to meet my expectations in every way.  My hair felt oily and weighted down.  After using it as a hot oil treatment, I washed my hair; but because of the oil I had to use extra shampoo and my hair still felt greasy. I had to wash my hair 5 times to get the oil out.  After being frustrated and gravely disappointed, I read the ingredients. MINERAL OIL!  Are you kidding me? Mineral oil is not good for hair. It attracts dirt and clogs your pores / scalp. It does not matter what else is in the product if the first ingredient is mineral oil. I think I'm going to use it as body oil in the winter. If that becomes a problem then I will be using the remaining product as a WD40 substitute. I truly can not recommend this product.  I wish to warn other consumers to use restraint.  There are so many products on the market that are better choices for hair care.
