While I continue to enjoy Dove Dark Chocolate, the order I received was below par. One reason was that they were close to their expiration date and had to be distributed and consumed shortly on receipt. Secondly every other Dove bar I have had was dark in color, smooth and great tasting, these were chalky white, with a bitter taste and some even looked as though the had been melted and poured into the wrapper.
