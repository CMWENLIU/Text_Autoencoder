I purchased this oil as I was thrilled that a local grocer actually carried it.  It was a 20.00 bottle.  What a waste of money.  There is so little truffle flavor that you end up using way more than what is normal.  Now, someone who hasn't been in the kitchen for too long might think that this is "wonderful" but no..Don't buy..End of story
