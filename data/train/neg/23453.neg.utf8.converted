I love Kona coffee.  I have had it in Hawaii, and in nice restaurants in Chicago.  I was very excited to see this coffee at amazon and quickly bought it at its high price thinking it was the Kona I have had before.  Unfortunately, it is not.  It tastes like a bad dunkin donuts coffee.  It does not have that Kona taste at all.  If I had a cup of it at Dennys, I would not know the difference nor comment about it.  Keep your money in your pocket and keep looking, this is notit.
