The flour is grainy and the bread I made with it was gritty.  I wouldn't buy it again. I do a lot of gluten free baking and normally buy a local store's version.  But this was on sale and then with the subscribe and save it was an even better deal.  It is OK in pizza crusts but the banana bread I made had a "crunch" to it.  Not the texture I was looking for.
