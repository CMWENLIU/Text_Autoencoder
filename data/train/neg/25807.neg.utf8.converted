I thought this would be the perfect solution to counter clutter and wrangling the k-cups. WRONG! The drawer doesn't slide easily when it's empty never mind with k-cups. The tops of the cups jam up against the top of the drawer when sliding open AND closed. Great concept but poorly designed. Also, the "feet" of the drawer don't have non-skid, non-scratch rubber coverings. With needing more effort to slide the drawer opened or closed, my granite counter would have been scratched after one use. I took it out of the box, tested it once empty, once with k-cups and packed it right back up for return. Sorry guys...but it's back to the drawing board for improvements. I ended up buying the k-cup spinning tower and it works perfectly, straight out of the box!
