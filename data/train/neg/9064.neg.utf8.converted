I love coconut oil and thought I would try Swanson's since I was placing an order for other items and needed some more oil. I was very  disappointed. There is a nasty chemical taste to it. I tried both Swanson's and my other brand a few times side by side and could tell a big difference in taste. I am sending the two jars of Swanson's back to the company. Though it is cheaper, it is not worth the difference in taste. I would only use this oil as a cosmetic oil but I already have some refined coconut oil for that purpose so I will not even keep this oil for that purpose.
