I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state.
