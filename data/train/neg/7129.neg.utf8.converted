Let's call the company and let them know that they need to change it back!!!!<br /><br />800-442-0099 - call them and let them know!!! CHANGE IT BACK!!!<br /><br />This product has gone from good to horrid. Think Coke to Coke II - and we all know how well that panned out. I called the company and have voiced my extreme disappointment. I have been drinking ovaltine since it was in the brown glass canisters and LOVED it then! Now, it doesn't mix in the milk well and it tastes like vitamins - like a healthfood drink. When I called the company, they said, it was because they made it healthier. Sure, but I want some taste too! Bring back the OLD OVALTINE.
