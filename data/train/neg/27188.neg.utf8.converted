DoNOT Buy this Water. This water used to be delicious but the have recently within the last 3 months started making changes to this water. Cheaper packaging and the water is no longer purchased from New Zealand it is actually now purchased in different parts of the US and they charge the same price at my local Whole Foods as if it was still from New Zealand. The water now tastes horrible....it tastes like it has sediment or contaminents in the water. I inquired about the change in the water and here is the email I rec'd: Although Eternal was previously sourced in New Zealand, there are many reasons for our decision to change to a US-based source. Your naturally alkaline spring source is nestled deep in the Great Smoky Mountains of Eastern Tennessee at the base of English Mountain.<br /><br />I am now searching for another water to drink. SMH!!!
