I ordered several 6 pks. thinking this was going to be great teasting and it was terrible...very strong tasting. My husband is Indian and we both love curry. I made the Chicken Curry with the paste accoring to directions and it tasted stale & flat for lack of a bettr description. Of course we have eaten some of the best chicken curry around so maybe that is why we did not like it. Also the rice mix was the absolute worst, gummy and stuck together..ended up tossing the entire purchase.
