I bought a box of this tea at my local Whole Foods.  If you have never tried this tea, I recommend buying one box, like I did, rather than buying it in bulk here on Amazon.  I am not pregnant, but I heard this tea had good benefits for all women of reproductive age (I'm in my late 20's).  So I made a large cup of this tea and went on with my day.  Within two hours of ingesting the tea, I had MAJOR uterine cramps.  Now, I guess this might be what they euphemistically refer to as "strengthening the female system".  I cannot imagine drinking this when I was 6 weeks pregnant, as it seems to basically cause contractions in me after one cup.  I guess it will be useful at the end of the third trimester, especially if I'm past term.  But for every day use, I don't like it.  It's like having period cramps every day.  Ugh.
