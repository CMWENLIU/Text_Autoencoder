I just received my order today and what came in was NOT what is shown in this picture!!! It is NOT made with organic soybeans. Yes, I should have read the other reviews. Shame on me. This is the same stuff I can buy at my Walmart but don't want because I WANT my soymilk to be organic. I ordered the vanilla too and it says "certified organic" in the details but it is NOT organic either. Shame on you, Silk!!!!!
