I too have noticed the horrible difference in Ovaltine.  Open up the container and you get an instant whiff of the ocean.  It stinks like fish.  Mixing it is like mixing hot cocoa in cold milk.  Clumps floating at the top of the glass, never dissolving.  WHY, OH WHY, do these manufacturers constantly have to cheapen everything at the expense of the consumer.  I am so tired of everything being tampered with or skimped on.  We Americans should really start standing up to these inequities.  We need to make our voices heard and spread the word.
