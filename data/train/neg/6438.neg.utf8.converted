It's really too bad there isn't an option to give 0 stars, or even better in a case like this, negative stars.  I almost never do reviews on products, but I, like so many loyal and long term addicts of the 70% bar am shocked at what Lindt has done.  The new recipe is basically the same thing as those terrible Ghirardelli squares of waxy tasteless "chocolate".  The original 70% was amazing.  It had a great texture, just enough sweet to balance things out, and there was no mistaking the cocoa.  It was also always a bit of a surprise every time I would eat it.  Sometimes it had hints of citrus, sometimes it was a bit nutty.  Maybe that was the vanilla, but whatever it was, there is nothing about the new recipe that even comes close to anything I used to enjoy about the 70% bar.  Now I have to try and find a replacement for what used to be the perfect chocolate experience.  Thanks for nothing Lindt.
