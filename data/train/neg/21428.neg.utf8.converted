This review is specifically on the Ranch dressing, it may not apply to other flavors.  I have to admit that I bought this on a gluten free foods web site and completely missed the zero calorie description.  I don't know what people who eat zero calorie dressing are used to, but I was expecting a tasty gluten free Ranch dressing that is at least recognizable as Ranch(or dressing for that matter).  I can't believe there are reviewers saying this stuff has flavor.  Well, it does but the flavor is something like what you might get if you took a dirty dish rag, dipped it in latex paint and wrung it out on your salad: This is vile and nasty stuff! Don't waste your money on this one.
