We purchased this "Basket/Tower" for our wonderful neighbors as a holiday gift.  The picture on Amazon makes it look like a fantastic value.  What appears to be an overflowing array of Kosher goods in reality is a 8 inch tall stack of 3 tiny boxes full of next to nothing! For $26 you are WASTING YOUR MONEY!  You could go to a grocery store and put together something yourself that would be 3 times as large for the same money.<br /><br />I normally don't leave negative reviews, but for the first time in a long time, I feel taken.  NOT WORTH A DIME, more or less, $26 of your hard earned cash.
