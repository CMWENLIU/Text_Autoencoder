I normally like the Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Venison or Sweet Potato and Bison. But this 14oz bag came busted up and the treats are a bigger size than the size in a smaller bag. The treats were really brittle and broke easily. I wouldn't buy this one any more but will buy the smaller ones in a store.
