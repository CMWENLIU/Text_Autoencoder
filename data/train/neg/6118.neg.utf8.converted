I decided to try Feline Pine because I was sick of the clay cat litter getting everywhere. But after the first day of using it my whole house smelled like cat poop, even when I scooped it out every time my cats went in it. It was disgusting, I can't even believe that I ever tried it. I figured it was to good to be true.
