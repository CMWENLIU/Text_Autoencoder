While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great, I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans, they are mushy; unpleasantly so.  You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans, but I didn't think so.  A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough  - but what isn't.  Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.<br />I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy.  I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product.  Color and size are good.
