Flavors of Sweet Leaf Liquid Stevia that taste really good are: Grape, Plain, Root Beer, Vanilla Cream.<br /><br />Flavors to avoid: Berry and Lemon Drop. These flavors are way to artificial tasting. Waste of money.<br />I would recommend buying organic strawberry flavor/extract and adding it to plain liquid stevia if you want to make this flavor. It tastes much better.<br /><br />Our main use for these is adding them to seltzer to made homemade soda flavors.
