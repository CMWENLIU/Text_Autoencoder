I purchased the Baby Brezza at the end of October, 2011. I immediately fell in love with the machine for its simplicity and ease of use. However, about two weeks later, the blade on the machine started to rust. I hand wash my machine 90% of the time with organic soap - this was alarming and made me question the quality. Shortly after that, the blade began getting stuck in the machine. There are instructions in the manual that tell you what to do if this happens. It worked but I had to do it every time I used the machine. I was constantly splattering food everywhere. Next, I had the black oil leaking from the drive shaft. I removed the drive shaft with every wash and never put it in the dishwasher. I cleaned it up and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Following this, the blade became completely lodged in the machine and unremovable. I did receive a quick call back from customer service and when they asked for the lot number, I lifted up the machine to realize the entire bottom had melted. The plastic was all disformed. The last batch of applesauce I made had the black oil IN IT. The company offered me a new machine but I am refusing. I do not want anything from this maker. I see that it has happened to other parents and it is absolutely inexcusable that a foreign black substance is being leeched into our baby's foods!!! This is the whole point of making homemade food - so that you know everything in it. I nearly cried when I discovered the black substance. Yes, it's easy and yes it's a great idea. But please, please just steam your baby's food and process it with something reliable and without a strange substance in it!<br /><br />*Just to add: Contrary to other reviews, I had an excellent experience with Baby Brezza's customer service. I spoke with two different women who were helpful and seemed truly interested in solving the problem. I may have gotten a rare defect in my machine and I don't want to bash the brand but am very concerned with my experience. I believe that the company will do something about the problems that their customers are experiencing and I hope for future parents that they're able to have a successful machine.<br /><br />*Also: I've used a Beaba and found that the Brezza was a much better machine in terms of proper steaming of food. My experience with the Beaba was that the food almost always came out undercooked when steamed according to the times in the manual. I don't recommend that machine either. Additionally, I've used a Magic bullet for a few years and have never had a perfect blend. I always have to take the cover off and move the food around in order for it all to blend. I am not sure that any of these baby gadgets work but will say that if I didn't have the defective brezza, it would be far superior to a beaba or baby bullet.
