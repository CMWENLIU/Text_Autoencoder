I received the fruit in good time but have a problem with the mixture.  It is advertised as red cherries, green cherries and pineapple.  I ordered two one-pound packages of the fruit mix.  Each one -pound container had no more than 3 green cherries in the entire package.  I have tried twice (e-mail and fax) to contact the vendor but to date have had no response.
