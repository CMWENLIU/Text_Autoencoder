After reading so many great, five star reviews on amazon about this bean, I had really high hopes for Bomard's Torino coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think maybe this bean just isn't really all that well suited for making espresso. It is a medium roast, and the beans do smell very nice, but it just didn't seem to be able to produce a really great shot of espresso for me. Crema production was relatively low and even when up dosing to 15 grams on a single shot, the flavors weren't really all that good. At 8 grams (for 1 oz), the shot was flat and thin.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Torino is a blend or a single origin bean, but for espresso it seems to fall a little bit short. With that said, I could see where this coffee might be better when used for pour over or with something like a french press, etc.<br /><br />Some coffees work well for espresso, some don't. At this stage, after dialing in the grind and pulling a few test shots, it seems like this might not be the best bean for espresso enthusiasts. Crema production is almost zero and the flavors are rather unpleasant when compared to other espresso blends.
