I wanted to love these because calorie-free pasta sounds amazing, but they are just too weird and gross. I didn't mind the fishy smell because it rinses right away and I expected them to have no flavor because they are supposed to absorb whatever sauce. I put a yummy spicy peanut sauce on them, but the texture just sucks. It's like rubber. The clear noodles look exactly like raw squid and the texture is slimy. Yuck. I dumped them out in the trash.
