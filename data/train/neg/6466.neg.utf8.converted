Amazon should have given the option of NO rating, because that is how badly I feel about this product. This product has been tasted with several brewing iterations and were hoping that we were just not brewing the grounds correctly. My family have been to Hawaii, had Kona, and fell in love with it. We certainly are not coffee snobs, but this is absolutely the worst coffee we've ever tasted.  Not sure if this was even Kona. There was absolutely no nutty Kona fragrance to this coffee after brewing. This stuff is just plain nasty in taste. I've had stale coffee before and it was better than this. When I purchased it I couldn't wait to get hold of it and have some. This was one of the most disappointing products purchased. Costco had another brand of 100% Koan last year during the holiday season and it was most wonderful. Will never purchase this product again!
