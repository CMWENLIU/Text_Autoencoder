It's beyond me why this product shows up in the natural and organic section.  What's natural and organic about Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate, Acesulfame Potassium, and worst of all Sucralose (Splenda Brand)- nothing but poison IMHO!  No, I don't own it, and no, I won't buy it for that very reason!
