I bought this as a Christmas present, thinking it would be a cool way to grow tomatos and jalapenos inside (I got the Salsa Garden kit).<br /><br />One of the tomato plants didn't germinate.  Aerogarden was quick to send a replacement, but it was too late to plant it.  I ended up transplanting of the seedlings from the side that germinated to the other side.<br /><br />Within a couple weeks, the pump started rattling.  I called in multiple times and never got to a live person.  Emails went unanswered.<br /><br />Finally a couple weeks ago (it's the last week in March), the pump started to make so much noise I thought the dishwasher was on!  We finally got ahold of someone at Aerogarden (we left a message and they called us back a couple days later).  They said they'd send a new pump.  They also recommended that we switch from tap water to some sort of bottled water.<br /><br />The change to RO water did not help the plants, if anything they really didn't like it.<br /><br />Today the pump finally died.  I've transplanted the plants to dirt, where they'll likely die.  We called AG again, and they said that a pump had been sent and that they would send us another salsa garden kit.<br /><br />To make matters worse, when I tried to pull the pump out following the directions in the manual (I was cleaning out the basin so it wouldn't stink), the pump cover broke!<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />Now I'm using the grow light to help sprout some new seeds to plant outside in my garden.  At $150, it is a heck of an expensive grow lamp!<br /><br />Harvest?  Well, there are about 2 dozen green tomatos and a few ripening ones.  We've only got one pepper that's growing.  Color me disappointed!
