This was a real disappointment. The product is not 100% Parmesan cheese as it shows. It has fillers and 100% is no longer listed on the label,and you can definitely tell it's not as soon as you taste it. The flavor is poor, color is uneven coarse and dark, and it tastes old with very little Parmesan flavor. I would not buy this again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. Avoid!!
