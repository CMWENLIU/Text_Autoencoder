Candy was old and past the expiration date! Plus, I ordered 25-count gift box, but they sent 3 boxes of 10 which looks lousy as a gift. I had to send 2 emails to try to get a response. Finally given a phone call of someone to call, who told me "the candy comes from other countries and it takes a while to get here." Then they place the burden of getting a refund on the customer. They emailed me a return label, but I have to purchase mailing labels or clear plastic tape, print out the label they sent me, pack it up, find a UPS store, and pay for parking so I can wait in line to return their expired candy. They could have easily looked up the lot number to verify that they had sent expired candy, but they intentionally place the burden on the consumer. I have not yet received my refund. BUYER BEWARE.
