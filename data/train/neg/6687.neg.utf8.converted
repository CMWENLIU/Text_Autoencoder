I had high hopes for this as I really like dragonwell tea. Sadly, this did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was old (purchaced as part of Amazon's grocery clearance)and had lost its flavor, as the cup it makes is drinkable, but bland and uninteresting, but all three Tao of Tea products I purchaced disappointed me. If you keep your expectations low, it's an OK tea.
