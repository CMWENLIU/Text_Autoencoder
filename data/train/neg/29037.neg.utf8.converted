Where is the quality control with AMAZON's grocery items?!! Half of the cans I received were SEVERELY DENTED. The product looked like it belonged on a 75% clearance rack at my local market. This is simply appalling and really disappointing. I had intially signed up for the automatic delivery subscription for this item but have since cancelled it if this is indicative of the product Amazon will be sending.
