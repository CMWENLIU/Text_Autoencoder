Bought this because it was suggested to me via email from Amazon.  So disappointed!  I love bold, dark coffees (French Roast from Tully's, Green Mountain, etc), but this tastes like an ash tray.<br /><br />Gave it two stars because the more environmentally friendly design is clever.  Otherwise, it would have been one star for sure.
