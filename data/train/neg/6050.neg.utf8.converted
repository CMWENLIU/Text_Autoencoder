These Bunny Grahams taste terrible. I really hoped my kids would love them because they are organic, but I couldn't even eat them. We threw them all away. They taste like cardboard and also smell like cardboard. I don't know what everyone else is trying and why their reviews are so positive but these are TERRIBLE.
