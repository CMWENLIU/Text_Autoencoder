I haven't even received the product but when I was scrolling down the description page, I noticed something... MADE IN CHINA... really?  don't we make anything in the USA anymore?  At least our food should come from here, grant it other countries would never import our meat because of the hormones and steroids and horrendous living conditions on most large farms.  Don't get me wrong, I eat meat, but it's small farm raised and my beef eats it's natural grass not corn, and my other food, well I think I'd like it to come from somewhere with a better track record for safe products!
