So, I snagged a jar of this at my local Whole Foods, because it had been recommended to me as supplying full peanut butter satisfaction with a fraction of the fat and calories.  Well.  I didn't read the ingredient and nutritional info till I got home.  It has stuff in it like "Grain syrup".  What's that?  Tapioca syrup?  Vegetable glycerin, and dehydrated cane juice (more sugar).  So maybe it's because I've been eating sugar-free peanut butter for a while, but this stuff is REALLY sweet.  Like tooth-achingly, diabetic shock-inducing sweet.  It also has a nasty chemical undertaste, and a LOT of salt.  13 g carbs, 4 g protein, 2 g fat. 190 mg sodium. 100 calories.<br /><br />In the same conversation where so-called "Better'n Peanut Butter" was recommended to me, another person recommended PB2, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>, which is a mixture of defatted peanut flour, sugar and salt.  Three ingredients, in that order.  Granted, it comes in powder form, so you have to reconstitute it, 2 TBSP peanut powder to 1 TBSP water.  Mix it up for a couple seconds, and it tastes like peanut butter.  No discernible sweetness or excessive salinity. No chemical undertaste.  5 g carbs, 5 g protein, 1.5g fat,94 mg sodium, 45 calories.  It's a wee bit more trouble cuz you have to mix it as needed.  But it's also delicious, unlike "Better'n Peanut Butter".  Oh, and available at Amazon at roughly the same price, considering that when a pound of PB2 is reconstituted with water, it makes about two pounds of tasty peanut butter.
