I was pretty unimpressed by this product.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the "broccoli" is dehydrated beyond recognition and might as well have been parsley for all I could tell.  It is probably made from the stems and leaves that are a discarded by-product of broccoli florets.  I am a big fan of Velveeta but I don't think the cheese sauce on this product lived up to their name.  Furthermore if a box says "Chicken Dinner Kit" shouldn't the chicken be included???  They should call it Chicken Helper if you're going to have to add your own chicken.  There are other boxed pasta and chicken dinners that come with a can of chicken.  In my opinion, if you're going to have a convenience food, it ought to be all-inclusive.  I actually used some Costco canned chicken in mine and it was by far the best tasting thing on the plate.  Also the nutrition information is based on there being 5 servings per box.  Perhaps if you are a bird!  I'd say 2-3 is closer to the truth if this is being served as your entree.  So in reality, your portion might be as much as 975 calories with 250 of those being fat.  If you're going to eat something that unhealthy it ought to taste a lot better than this stuff.  I won't be buying it again.
