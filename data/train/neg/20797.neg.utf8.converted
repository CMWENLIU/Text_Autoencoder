Requires multiple applications in order to get moss to start dying off, let alone completely kill. Some areas of treated moss on concrete slab still haven't shown any signs of die-off even after three heavy-dose applications. For some reason, it seems to work better on vertical surfaces. On the whole it's been an unimpressive performer to date.  Not sure what 'Safer' name is supposed to infer, but reading the label there's still plenty of warnings as to how dangerous this stuff is to humans and animals, so beware if you have pets that can get access to any of the treated areas you have. Shipped frozen from the seller I chose, so had to wait a day or so before I could use.
