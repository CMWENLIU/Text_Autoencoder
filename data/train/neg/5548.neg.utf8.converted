I thought the vanilla would be like the yummy original but have a vanilla taste.  Not so, don't know why - it doesn't taste like vanilla and doesn't mix well. I won't buy it again.  I was glad I bought only one can to try it out after reading the reviews on here.  Requires a blender to mix it and doesn't taste very good.  The original stirs straight into my coffee like a creamer and tastes really good straight up as a beverage.
