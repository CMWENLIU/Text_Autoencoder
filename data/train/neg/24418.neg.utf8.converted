horrible.  I could tell as soon as I opened the box.  I am an avid almond eater and I can tell just by looking at an almond how they will taste.  They looked rancid and when I opened the package they smelled bad as well.<br />Amazon is the best however, they issued me an immediate refund.<br /><br />Thanks guys, I would suggest you send this product back to Diamond of California.
