(in response to the last glowing review)<br />Well then, why is what you're saying running totally counter to the care sheet that came with the bonsai boy juniper!?  That plus I'm positive it advertised "eligible for free shipping"--but alas I paid the 8.95 anyway. AND the picture is full and lush. Mine is pretty darn thin compared to that....... But the worst part is, the Bonsai Boy care sheet says specifically if you bring it indoors to keep it DARK. This is saying keep it well-lit while indoors. I live in Northern New England. It's too cold almost 6 months out of the year to keep it outdoors, and I chose Juniper because the reviews I read said it was a good beginner tree. Which is it, lit or dark indoors?
