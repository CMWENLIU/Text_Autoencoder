I'd rate this drink 5 stars because I've loved it so much that I've "subscribed" to have it delivered at least every month, it's always been my tasty treat in the morning or to finish off a day. I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Lately, though, I've been getting cases of the stuff full of bottles with foul-tasting fluids. I mean, RANCID. Make you gag stuff. And not just occasionally. With my most recent case, I drank the first one (squinty-eyeed, I figured it must be something I ate or drank before it) and had indigestion all day, the next two I threw out completely. The fourth one, I have here, and it has a slight foul aftertaste but it's mostly the same delicious sweet juice I originally enjoyed, so I'm drinking it.<br /><br />The frequency of these had me motivated to post here.<br /><br />I also noticed that, at least I think, they've been tinkering with their recipe. Besides the new packaging, I think they changed some ingredients out. The second ingredient is "organic evap cane juice". Cane juice? As in, sugar? I think the Zola I fell in love with several months ago was naturally sweetened by the fruit itself, not by added sugar.<br /><br />Overall, the drink is now okay. But I'm cancelling my auto-order "subscription".
