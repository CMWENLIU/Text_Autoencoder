I decided to try and find a horchata that tasted like the kind I'd drink when growing up in San Diego. So far, this has been the furthest from it. This product has a chalky, almost dry taste to it. It's not awful, but not the taste I was expecting. There is an aftertaste that seems like flour or some other similar flavor. Obviously, liking the flavor is subjective, but I will not be purchasing this brand again. When Amazon has it in stock, the Klass brand horchata is my preference so far.
