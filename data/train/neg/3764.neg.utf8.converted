I wanted to title my review "happy hair" because my 9-year-old loves this conditioner.  My medium-thick long hair could take it or leave it, but counter to my expectations, her baby-fine hair became extra gleamy and managable.  She says it gives her "happy hair."<br /><br />The problem, once I started looking at the ingredients, is that it's chock full of synthetics and silicones, which, oddly enough, can be skin irritants and possibly cause dermatitis in some people.  I'm not so sure that this is what you call "nourishing the scalp"; it's more of a situation in which you apply silicone to the hair shaft to make it shiny.  So, I'm referring to the cyclopentasiloxane, stearamdo propyl dimethylamine, dimethiconol, etc.  It's a long way down the list before you get to the nourishing shea butter and coconut oil.<br /><br />I guess if I want to nourish my scalp, I could always use pure coconut oil, then shampoo it out.  For what it's worth, I try to keep ingredients natural with my kids.
