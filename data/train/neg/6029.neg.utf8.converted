I've tried a few of the salad dressings and they were pretty good all things considered, so I thought I'd give this a whirl because I missed peanut butter. From reading the reviews I sort of knew what to expect, but I wanted to find out for myself. The texture is more like a spread (which I knew), but the flavor is just awful. It's overly sweet and doesn't taste like anything close to peanuts. Lesson learned.
