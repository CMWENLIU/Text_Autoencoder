Oh my gosh, from the moment you put them in your mouth I wanted to gag....  Do NOT, waste your money.  I also heard about these noodles on Dr. Oz and wanted to try them.  Wish I had not.  The texture is horrible and they have a slight fishy taste.  I could not dress them up enough to make them edible.  Tried one package and threw the rest away.
