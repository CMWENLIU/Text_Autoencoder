Like a slimy, chemically-tasting, foamy mousse, with metallic sweetness partially masking a sour undertone. Truly unusable as a food, regardless of how similar it may or may not be to peanut butter (not very similar, by the way - general taste profile, density and mouthfeel are all wildly off-base - only aroma seems to match).
