I usually love these little treats, but the ones i got must have been sitting around at amazon for a year or so, because they were really hard and  unedible. had to give most of them to the dog :(  However, the expiration date had not expired (SELLBY NOV07), so i would say Stonewall's needs to move their expiration date up a few months.
