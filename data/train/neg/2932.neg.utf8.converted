They looked healthy any I bought some at Costco.  I got them home and read on the back (in tiny text) "Product of China."  What the H*ll?  They have poisoned our pets, poisoned our toothpaste... do we really need them attempting to make our "health food"?  Not to mention the fact that China allows sweatshops, child labor, and nothing short of slavery. Then there is the whole communism issue.  Do not buy this product unless you can live with the risks and your conscience!
