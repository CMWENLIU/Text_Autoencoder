The bars I received were crumbled on one end & light tan in color, which indicates OLD chocolate. That end of the bar tasted awful. I have seen that a million times & I recognize what it means. The other end of the bars had melted & reset, but still tasted OK & were the correct color for fresh chocolate. A second set was sent to me at no charge, however, the same was true of those. Also appeared that the company was not too happy with my complaint, as the second set arrived in a small, smashed box with a tiny piece of bubble wrap floating around loose in the box & had not been secured to the bars with tape to protect them.
