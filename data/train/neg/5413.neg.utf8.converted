DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. A week or so ago I ordered this product when it was advertised as a pack of 8 boxes.  When I received my package it was missing 7 of the 8 boxes. I reported this to Amazon and they told me they were giving me a full refund for the purchase amount (instead of prorating the original amount) and then told me that since they couldn't accept a return on a grocery item that I should repurchase the item at the new link (this one).  I wish I was making this up.  When I arrived at this new listed item I saw that the total cost was much higher than my original purchase price and wrote Amazon back and told them so.  They then emailed me and told me to repurchase the item and they would refund me the difference. I am obviously very upset at this point, but I go ahead and do as they suggest. Well, lo and behold, after I purchase the item they tell me that they can't refund any difference at all. So I am not only absent the original product, but have been charged more for it. The company has also changed their DBA name from Lakewood Candies LLC to Carbsmart. If anyone wants more info I have screen captures and all emails.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
