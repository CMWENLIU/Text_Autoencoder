I like the noodles themselves, and as has been written here before, they're relatively plentiful for this sort of product.  The killer for me is that the broth is fairly well pervaded with mushroom taste, which is a real turn-off, and IMHO anomalous for a product describe as miso-flavored.  I'm fortunate that a certain local Japanese place offers fish-free miso soup, but we also make it at home (or use the Miso-cup instant).  For noodle cups, I'll stick with the chicken-flavor variety.<br /><br />Others have written complaining of salt and that the flavor doesn't knock their socks off.  I submit that this is the what you get in the dehydrated instant soup cup arena.  Tasty volatiles by nature aren't going to be captured in a dry broth powder, so there's only so good any product like this is going to be. If there wasn't a fair amount of salt added, it wouldn't taste like much at all -- this is true of anyone's soup cups.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that these are inexpensive, extremely lightweight, and last indefinitely on the shelf.  I use them for late night snacks, and especially when I crew sail races -- the boat owner generally has various processed food items to offer, but they're nearly always laden with animal products.  I can throw a couple of these in my bag and when hot water is available, have something warm to put in my stomach when I'd be otherwise limited to chips or such.  The value of this is not to be underestimated when it's 45 degrees and raining with 20 knot winds.
