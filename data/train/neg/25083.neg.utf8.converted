I love this cereal and have not been able to find it for years. It turns out it's here on amazon as well as only in walmart super stores, which sucks because I hate walmart with a passion and won't go there unless it's something I can't get anywhere else or it's late and I need it.<br /><br />However the problem here is that this products description says it's a pack of 4 but I only got 1 box and it says that it's package 1 of 1 and completes my order.<br /><br />When I seen the normal sized box it came in, I thought "well I'm the noob for not reading. It was probably 4 travel boxes" but it wasn't when I opened it and it was just 1 normal box, bot 4 as described.<br /><br />5 for the cereal, 1 for this service.
