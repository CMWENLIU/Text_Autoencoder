"May contain trace amounts of tree nuts, dairy and wheat." I was ready to order until I saw this info. Not good for a Celiac/Gluten-intolerant person with additional dairy allergy! How can products get away with saying they are gluten-free & then post a little warning that the food may contain wheat???!!! :(
