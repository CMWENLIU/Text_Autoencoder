Many of the packages were opened within the box!  I had to throw away at least 5.<br />Many of the chocolate frogs were broken into pieces as well.<br />Very disappointed also in the size of the frogs.  Very small.<br />This was a treat for my daughter's friends at her birthday party and<br />all were disappointed.<br />Will not buy again.
