The smell of this product once the can is open is terrible. Its worse than bad tuna fish and even drained the meat smells the same. I left a half can in my refrigerator overnight and could barely stand opening the door because that terrible smell would wiff out into the kitchen. I would not serve this to friend or enemy. If you are set on eating it anyway, mash the big chunks up and douse it with lots of pepper,garlic & onion powder because it tastes like stinky mummy meat (yes, it is bland in a really awful way). Make sure you cook it. Save yourself money and do not buy this product.
