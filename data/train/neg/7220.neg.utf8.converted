The overall taste of this sauce was a disappointment to me. I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt.  Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.<br /><br />I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.<br /><br />This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.<br /><br />The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles that well in my view.
