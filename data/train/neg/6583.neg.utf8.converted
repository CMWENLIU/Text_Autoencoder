These new formula Potato Buds are horrible.  Betty Crocker changed the formula recently and the result is the worse instant mash potatoes ever, as compared to their original version that was the best in class.  Now the texture is sticky and gummy, and there is no potato flavor.  To make it even worse, there is a disagreeable aftertaste that remains for several hours.<br /><br />I strongly suggest trying a small box from your local store to try, before committing to this new version.  I think you will find that any other brand is better.  The change by Betty Crocker is a big mistake, and it will result in a loss of customer loyalty, including mine.
