I am sorry to say that I am more than disappointed with this tea. For many years I drank only genuine sencha (and gyokuro) tea shipped directly from Japan and I think I developed quite a good taste for premium Japanese Sencha. But since the Fukashima diaster I am distrustful of the radioactive contamination that has occurred  over all or wide areas of the Japanese  tea growing areas and I certainly do not trust the Japanese governments reports. So I no longer order my delicious premium sencha (no, REALLY premium, not the foil wrapped hyped premiums which are not premium at all, sold in stores). This is a great heartache for me, and of course for the Japanese people and tea growing industry.<br /><br />So I have been looking for a replacement, from another part of the world, thus bringing me to this Dilmah Sencha green tea. Now this is really bad. I see the reviews describing it as the best tea they've ever drunk and so on. Even allowing for differences in taste and taste bud sensitivities, I really think this is crazy. This tea has no taste. It bears no resemblance to Japense sencha. It happens to come from the same plant species apparently but the final product is completely unrelated, tasteless, no aroma, just, I'm sorry, totally worthless. Something is wrong here with these reports. And the brochure describing its many wonders and special cultivation, its just glossy hype.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I opened all the tea packaging so i could put the tea in one place so I am sure I cant return it or I would, for a full refund. I am really sorry to say this because I am desperate for good sencha green tea. This isnt it and will never be.
