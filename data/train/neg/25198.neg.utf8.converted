I didn't enjoy the flavor of this brand of Ganderma coffee. I saw this and thought I'd give it a try. However, my best friend tried it & loved it, so she took it all home with her to drink. She thought it tasted like a cappuccino. I started with Gano Excel Ganoderma coffee, but the price was too high. Now, I use the Diamond brand which is just as good, at less than half of the cost.
