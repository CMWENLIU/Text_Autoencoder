Since when did Mrs. May start importing food from China, a country who's track record with exported goods (i.e. lead on toys, melamine in milk, tainted fruit w/ heavy metal residue and pesticides, molding sheet rock, etc., etc.) that are not doing to well.  I wish Amazon would list where a product is from, especially for food items. I am really upset that a supposedly health food type products are being shipped out to be produced in China, (think Apple Crisps).  Come are profits that important.  Its a shame I have to give this product one star.
