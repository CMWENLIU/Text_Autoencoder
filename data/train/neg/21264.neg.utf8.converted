This is basically misleading advertising. They label it pure, but have a genetically modified ingredient within. Maltodextrin is genetically modified corn sugar. GMO corn is one of the worst things you can put into your body according to my research, along with Canola Oil(no matter how they claim it's healthy), Aspartame, high fructose corn syrum, and other hydrogenated oils.<br /><br />Shame on them for labeling this "Pure". You got my $10, but I will never buy their products again
