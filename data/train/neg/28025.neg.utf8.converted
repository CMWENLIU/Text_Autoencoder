I received a custom open package with green tape all over, tea bags where opened and ripped apart, the box was cut open all around,I can send as many pictures as required..... but the worse part is that with it , I got a Custom, DEA and FDA warning letters that the coca tea box was getting in the United States WITHOUT licences for schedule II substances from a no registered seller for what it was a 100% illegal package from Bolivia that I needed to sign for and get my name registered as importer of ILEGAL GOODS, and the product was not intended for human consumptions because it was not from a FDA certified location. Check the sellers feedback, I am not the only one complaining!!!<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called the other seller whom also sells coca tea at Amazon "Bolivia Stores" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licences and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br />I presented a claim to Amazon today with all the detail<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US???
