I was so very disappointed when I received this in the mail. It is shorter than the picture shows (the braids only intertwine twice, not 3 or 4 times like the picture). And the container it comes in is small and looks cheap.  It doesn't even come with rocks or soil, so it doesn't stand up in said container. It was intended as a Christmas gift, but I ended up throwing it away because it looked so cheap. This was my worst Amazon purchase ever.
