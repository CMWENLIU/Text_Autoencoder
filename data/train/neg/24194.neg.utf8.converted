This is junk food for cats.<br /><br />Cats must eat meat. This food does not contain taurine and other essential vitamins that a cat can't obtain from vegetable sources. Cats that eat this food are facing a horrible death from vitamin deficiencies, possibly including blindness first. I'd feed my cat the cheapest store brand before giving her this stuff.
