Another treat I purchased at the store for my dogs and did not check where they were made. They are made in china. I check everything I buy for my dogs now because most products are made in china. Yes my dogs like them but I am not putting their health at risk. And they are a really strange rubbery texture. Does not look like something they should be ingesting. Anyway, I will never buy these again. Zero stars!
