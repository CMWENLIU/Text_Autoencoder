I think when it comes to cats its hard to tell what they like or do not like.<br />They absolutely love the plastic spring toys so I thought these would be almost the same, just a bit more durable than the thinner spring ones...which have somewhat short life span due to those sharp cat teeth!<br />no luck for my Bengals.<br /><br />so this is not a negative review of the product as much as a heads up ;-)
