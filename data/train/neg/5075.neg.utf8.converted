I was disappointed with the flavor of these. I really love the taste of nutritional yeast (I'm a vegan) but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt. I don't know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non-existent. I think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice "health nuts" and vegans to buy them. It's too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor. If you are a vegan, don't waste your money!! Go makes some popcorn and sprinkle some nutrional yeast over it.... it's much less expensive and healthier than these lousy things, I mean "Tings".
