I love gum- it is good for after dinner or for just a random piece now & then. When my local supermarket had it "buy 1 get 1", I picked up 4 packs of this gum in various flavors. Now I realize why they were selling it for so cheap.<br /><br />First putting it into my mouth, the gum is nice, soft, & tastes fine. The flavor is a little strong at first, but that's OK- it isn't too strong. Unfortunately after a few minutes that range anywhere from 2 minutes to five minutes, the flavor disappears & the gum becomes incredibly tough & rubbery. The claims of "long lasting flavor" are anything but.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this gum again & I wish that I hadn't bought the four packs of it. Maybe the other flavors will be better, maybe they won't. All I know is that I won't be buying it again. I'm giving the gum 2 stars because the initial 2-5 minutes weren't bad, but other than that it is a solidly 1 star experience.
