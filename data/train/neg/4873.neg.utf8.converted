I have been buying tea from another supplier for years, but the shipping has become too expensive.  So, I decided to try this tea.  The cut of the leaves seems good although the color is darker than expected and seems over dried.  I will be going back to my old tea. The tea lacks a full bodied flavor.  The overwhelming taste sensation is a sense of bitterness with not much else.  If I had saved the bag, I would return it.
