This is distinctly different than Gold Label Gran Riserva! While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great. We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva Gold Label and it was amazing. This vinegar is much sharper and thinner. It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva. The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.<br />According to one of the vendors, all that was changed was the label.  They told me that "the year denotation of '12 years' had to be taken off of the bottle" and "the label had to be changed because of Italian government regulation." The vendor and Fattoria Estense are saying the new Gold Label 'Invecchiato Aged' is exactly the same balsamico, but IMHO it sure doesn't taste the same. I wouldn't buy it again - not at this price!
