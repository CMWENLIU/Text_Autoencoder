I find this to be the most offensive-tasting substitute for sugar. It does not resemble 'sweet'. It's a strange taste that made me recoil when tasting it; and, I had to spit it out. Then it left a bad taste in my mouth. The price is expensive compared to other sweeteners. I will NEVER purchase this again. And will continue to use saccharin (Sweet & Low) as it comes the closest to resembling a sugar taste.
