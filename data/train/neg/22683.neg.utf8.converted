This stuff is homeopathic truffle oil.  Truffle isn't even listed as an ingredient --- just truffle aroma (maybe they waved a truffle over the oil??). The first ingredient is grapeseed oil.  I did a blind taste comparison with pure grape seed oil --- three people were unable to taste any difference.  If you want truffle oil this isn't it.
