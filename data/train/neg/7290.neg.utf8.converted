I've tried every flavor now and they have consistently been worse than your typical store bought Bigelow.<br /><br />This tastes like C-grade tea put in a nice package.<br /><br />It isn't a good gift for a tea drinker.  They will spot the poor tea the second they brew it.<br /><br />Aside from the bland taste, except for the Earl Grey which taste like soap, they also don't have the aroma that you get when you brew a good grade tea.  The package sold here comes with 2, but I'm going to try to give the other one away and buy more Bigelow.
