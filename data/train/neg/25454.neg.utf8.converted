My cans arrived last week, and I was a little surprised that most of the cans were dented, but I figured, no big deal, just some rough shipping or something. But no, the cans are all dented from pressurization in the can, which I discovered when I opened one and found a giant bacteria colony inside! They're all like that... either poorly canned or poorly stored or past expiration, I dunno, but I do know I just got an entire pack of inedible cans... and Amazon won't let me return them!<br /><br />Avoid this like the plague...which, incidentally, might be what's inside the cans.
