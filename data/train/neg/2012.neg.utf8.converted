I can't believe the ripoff Gevalia is getting away with in this country. Yes, as a coffee it's OK, certainly better than  most coffees sold in the U.S. But then most Americans don't know what good coffee is.<br /><br />My objection is the price. Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.<br /><br />My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee. If you want your Gevalia but don't like getting ripped off just go to Ikea where it's sold at a reasonable price.
