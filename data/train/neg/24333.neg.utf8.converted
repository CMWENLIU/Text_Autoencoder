I bought one box of these, thinking they would be a lot like the old Sunshine Lemon Coolers cookies.  They are DEFINITELY not them.  No tangy lemon flavor in the powdered sugar.  Though the box says, "COOLER THAN EVER!", they don't have that cool sensation like the originals had.<br /><br />The smell is the same, the look is the same, the texture is the same...but the taste doesn't measure up at all, if you're looking for a substitute for Lemon Coolers. :(
