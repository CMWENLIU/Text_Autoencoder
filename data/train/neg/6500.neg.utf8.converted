When I was a less healthy and natural eater, this sauce was my #1 choice. It is, however, laden with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and preservatives, and when we rid our house of HFCS and hydrogenated fats, this had to go as well.<br /><br />If they made a version with sugar instead of HFCS, I'd buy it, but with our messed up ag subsidies and big business domination, it's unlikely.
