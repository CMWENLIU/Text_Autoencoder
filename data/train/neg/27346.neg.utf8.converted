Powder like chopped tea in a bag.<br /><br />It's cheap, you get a lot, but the tea is the lowest quality one.<br /><br />Even the box looks exactly the same as Starbucks', but those sold in Starbucks are full tea leave and taste better (and more expensive).<br /><br />I should have know this before I buy it, now I have 6 boxes of them I don't know what to do :(
