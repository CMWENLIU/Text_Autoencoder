I was actually pretty disappointed with these, which really is inconvenient now that I have an entire case of them! A bunch of them were all but broken when I opened the boxes, and my kids aren't big fans of them either. They are picky, but pizza or anything even remotely pizza usually never fails... no such luck here. That and plan on having to bake them to warm them (which takes 25 plus minutes), otherwise they come out a bit soggy from the microwave...
