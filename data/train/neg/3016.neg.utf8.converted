I purchased a box of 16 of these half-and-half (black tea and lemonade) k-cups at Bed, Bath & Beyond.  They had a $9.99/box sale, and it was too good to pass up--especially since my better half loves lemonade iced tea.  Sadly, it was a bit of a disappointment.  It was barely different from the "Perfect Iced Tea -- Sweet Lemon Tea," and didn't have the bite of lemonade.  I wasn't expecting perfection--I realize that lemonade in any form is asking a lot from a hot beverage machine, but it was still a bit of a let down.  Also, I prefer to sweeten my drinks with Splenda.  (I don't need 13 grams of carbs from a glass of iced tea.)<br /><br />That said, my Keurig Limited Edition remains the best coffee machine I have owned to date, and the Coffee People "Donut Shop" variety is my favorite every-morning k-cup.
