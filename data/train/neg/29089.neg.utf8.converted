Not the best pine nuts.  Smaller than expected and not entirely fresh --- but edible and sweet although somewhat dry.  The vendor took a full 5 days to process the order and get it to USPS for priority mail shipping.  Very slow by my standards.<br /><br />Honestly, I would not bother to order from this vendor (Candy Express) again.  Marginal product and very slow handling --- unacceptable in my opinion.
