I ordered this product last month and, after removing from outer box, very casually visually inspected plastic-wrapped cartons for major damage before putting into pantry.  Very careless on my part, especially since I've received damaged foodstuffs from Amazon recently. However, I'd ordered a different variety of Swanson's, also in the cardboard cartons, from Amazon earlier in the year with no problem so I foolishly took for granted that this shipment would be okay, as well.  HUGE mistake!<br /><br />When I finally got around to removing the plastic to use the first box tonight I noticed that one of the corners was slightly crushed and worn-looking around plastic outer ring that surrounds inner foil pull off tab and that plastic tab itself looked somewhat off-kilter, as if it weren't seated tightly. The glue, or whatever substance they've used to seal the plastic onto carton apparently failed for some reason, or maybe too little was used?  I gently squeezed carton to see if any air escaped; it did.  This made me take a closer look at the other cartons and some of them were visibly swollen and oozed a bit and released a foul odor when also squeezed gently. Upon opening to pour down the garbage disposal the smell became overwhelming.  However, two of the cartons I checked later did NOT smell noticeably rank when squeezing, even though seal was not intact, as proven by escaping air so I'm concerned that it would be easy for someone to unknowingly use product with a faulty seal.<br /><br />If you've ordered this product, or plan to, PLEASE take time to carefully inspect each carton when it arrives.
