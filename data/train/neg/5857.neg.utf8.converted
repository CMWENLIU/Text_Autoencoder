If you're trying to find an inexpensive alternative to Lyle's Golden Syrup, this is NOT the same thing. True golden syrup is made with pure cane sugar, while this stuff is made with high fructose corn syrup. I tasted both, one after the other, and the taste of this stuff is heavy, highly processed, and not at all flavorful. I bought this to use in candy-making, but I don't have high hopes for it.
