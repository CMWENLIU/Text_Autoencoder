Since my teenagers really liked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, we thought we would try the Grape Flavor.  We were disappointed. Although still drinkable, it is just not the equal of other flavors of Switch.<br /><br />The positive is that the beverage is all-natural, and packaged in the smaller-than-regular-12-ounce soda cans. It also has less carbonation than regular grape soda, which is a nice change.  But the negative is that the Grape flavor cannot hold a candle to the the two other flavors we have enjoyed.  It is on the sour side and leaves a slight unpleasant aftertaste.  Not at all the satisfying, smooth and true fruit taste of the other two Switch flavors which we have tried.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this flavor, although I still like the brand and plan to sample some other flavors.  I would definitely order the Tangerine/Orange and the Black Cherry again.
