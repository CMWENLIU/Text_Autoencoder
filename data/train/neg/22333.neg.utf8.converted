I was really surprised when I looked online and saw that I only found positive reviews about these things!!!!  Quite frankly, I found the orange flavor weak, and it tasted just like the regular orange flavor, except worse.  I can't tell the difference between these and other orange candies, but they are a bit bitter, and again, the orange flavor is rather weak.  I'm not sure why others wrote positive reviews about them, since I am a bit of a candy nut.  I'm looking forward to reading other reviews.<br />I found these a poor value for the money, and the candy was MEDIOCRE at best.<br />Look elsewhere for orange candy!
