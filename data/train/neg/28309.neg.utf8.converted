We love the pouch size and the price but this baby food Is sour, although the banana and pumpkin should be sweet components. The color of the puree is a light yellow and not orange as it appears on the box. There is no pumpkin taste. Lemon juice concentrate and citric acid have been added therefore the predominant taste is sour banana.<br />Ingredients: organic banana, organic pumpkin, organic lemon juice from concentrate, citric acid. The composition list is different than on the company's website.
