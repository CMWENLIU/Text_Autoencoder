They have this listed as RAW. It is not raw and should not be listed as such. There is nothing wrong with it. To be considered raw it should not be heated above about 115 degrees, I believe that is the correct number. Amazon should change the label on this. They used to sell the RAW kind and for some reason, it is not available. The title is therefore misleading.
