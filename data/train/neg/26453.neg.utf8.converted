Very dissapointed. I have chosen to not feed my dog anything Made In China, since all the problems with pet foods using products from there. Many MILO treats advertise they are made in the USA, note that some do not state either way.  Those are the ones clearly printed on packaging that they are MADE IN CHINA.  Del Monte???  Shame on you!
