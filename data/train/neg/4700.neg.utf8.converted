I ordered these supposedly sweet peas from this seller and couldn't wait to try them.  They sprouted well, but were bitter.  I originally thought I had done something wrong in the sprouting process, but I decided to try an unsprouted dry seed.  I rinsed it and it was bitter before I even started the sprouting process.  I contacted the seller directly to let them know they may have a bad batch.  The seller told me that some people rave about the sweetness of her peas and some say they are bitter.  I've gardened for years and the only time peas are bitter are when they are overripe.  The seller should be tasting and testing the batch before buying it.  She did not apologize at all.  The garbanzo bean sprouts I bought tasted fine so I think it's this batch of peas.  I wanted to get a replacement, but was afraid it would be bitter as well.  The seller was nice enough to check the lot number for me and it was the same so I decided to go for a refund instead which I needed to do through Amazon.
