I bought this product to make some vegan milk soap. However, after reading the ingredients "...sodium caseinate (From Milk)..." and that is how it is worded. I thought, does not mean animal milk? So I did a google, and sure enough caseinate is produced from mammals, usually derived from cows for food purposes. Do not waste your money if you are looking for vegan here, it is not. If you care not about vegan, I still do not recommend this product because it comes from Sri Lanka, which means it supports the concentration camps of the Tamil civilians. I know this because my husband is Tamilian. Thank God we do not live in Sri Lanka. Google no to Sri Lanka if you need more evidence.
