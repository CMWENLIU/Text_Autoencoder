As a disclaimer, I have a Senseo coffee pod machine, so of course the Senseo pods fit quite well.  The problem with these pods is that they are not advertised for a specific machine but don't fit the Senseo machines.  I've purchased all sorts of different pods to get different flavors or varieties that have fit the Senseo machine just fine, so why can't Java One make pods that fit?  The pods are really good tasting (er' I mean the coffee in them..) but if you use them with the Senseo they actually become dangerous, breaking the lid seal and popping the top of the machine thus spraying hot water everywhere.<br /><br />So, Senseo owners, seek elsewhere.
