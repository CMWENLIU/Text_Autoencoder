I was really excited to find Bertie Botts Every Flavour Jelly Beans because my kids would love them.  It was a 2-pack, and for $9 I figured that the boxes would be pretty big.  Boy was I wrong.  The boxes are the size of small raisin boxes, and they aren't even filled very full.  I was very disappointed and feel ripped off.  Breaking the cost down, each jelly bean costs about 25 cents, and these are small candies - the size of jelly bellys.  Don't waste your money unless you have a lot to waste...
