I was hoping to find a good granola bar sans HFCS and Hydrogenated oils; Annie's usually makes such great stuff, so this seemed a real no-brainer.  Plus, chocolate, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />However... my daughter won't even eat these.  The oats seem raw, there isn't much sweetness, and they're somehow hard and chewy in a bad way.  They're just kind of weird.  I tried one and couldn't even finish it.<br /><br />Sorry, Annie's!  I still love you!
