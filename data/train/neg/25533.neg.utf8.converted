Numi's Jasmine Green Monkey King is the worst jasmine tea I have ever had.There's no sent of jasmine flowers upon brewing or steeping.If you love jasmine tea stay away from this one.If your new to green tea,never boil your water as it states on the Numi box it will only make your tea bitter.Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.  You want the water just before the boiling point (170-180)degrees Fahrenheit.They got the steeping time right 2 to 3 minutes.Hope this helps you.Beware of prepackaged teas. Buy whole leaf instead.
