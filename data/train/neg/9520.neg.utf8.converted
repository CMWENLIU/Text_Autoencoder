I normally purchase my coffee beans from boutique roasters and have rarely been disappointed. I should have tried a smaller bag of "Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark" because it's not a brew that I like. I've tried brewing it weak and it still has a burnt, stale flavor that lingers far too long. Mixing it 1/3rd to 2/3rd other beans to use it up. Also be aware that these oily beans have a very strong smell. I had to move the grinder out to the garage because the house smelled like burnt coffee.<br /><br />Pros: It's a good price for the amount  of coffee beans you get.
