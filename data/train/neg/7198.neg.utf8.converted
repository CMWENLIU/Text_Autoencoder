I wish I had success with this food. I just purchased it because I read all the great reviews, I have 6 cats, all were formal ferals and rescued by me, along with ,many others I have found homes for. I have had cats my entire life (and other animals), and am older, so have a strong history with their food likes and dislikes. Not one of my six cats will touch this food. They eagerly wait for "dinner" I open the can, they sniff it and walk away. One even made a burying motion over it which was comical. They do have dry Fromm Cat food available at all times, but love canned as well. After reading how bad the supermarket available brands were for cats, I decided to try some "better ones". They have become quite finicky lately for some reason..but they at least will lick other brands. They want nothing to do with this food at all. I even left it in the bowl overnight, removed the dry, and it was untouched in the morning. I still am trying entice my cats with it by mixing in tuna and other cat foods, no luck. I bought a whole case, so have been giving the untouched food to the raccoons that forage in my woods at night, they have been eating it, so it was not a total waste. I know it is a great company and good food, but my cats will not go near it.
