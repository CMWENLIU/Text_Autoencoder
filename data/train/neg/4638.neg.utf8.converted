This food appears attractive and healthy when poured into a bowl - it looks like chunks of dried meat among veggie-rich kibbles. My dog very happily scarfed it down.<br /><br />I, unfortunately, read the ingredient list. It is extremely soy and corn heavy (both almost guaranteed to be GM), and includes nasty items like poultry by-product meal and animal digest. Whatever those chunks are, they are in no way related to real meat.<br /><br />As much as my dog loved this, I will not be making it part of his regular diet - it's just not real food.
