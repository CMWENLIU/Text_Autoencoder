I've purchased Peace Tea several times from Amazon. I liked the taste and was very pleased with the ease of deliery via subscribe and save. However I was disapponted to learn it really isn't all natural even though the can has statements that lead you to beleive it is. My teenage son noticed that it contains sucralose (i.e splenda). I just cancelled my subscribe and save order for this product.
