First of all, one tea bag does not make more than one cup (unless you like the taste of slightly tinted hot water).<br />Second, the price is outrageous.<br />Third, the taste is mediocre.<br />Fourth, where is the list of ingredients?  A list of nutritional values is not an ingredients list!<br />Fifth, the list of nutritional values is for the entire box of tea, not per bag.<br />This expensive tea is a rip off.  Be wise about what you buy and don't buy marketing hype.
