Ordinarily, I love Thai food.  I love peanut sauce.  Recently, I moved to the country and was disappointed that I cannot find peanut sauce in my local stores.  So, I came to Amazon.  I really didn't want 6 jars of peanut sauce even though it was the type I usually use.  Instead, I bought this jar.<br /><br />The price is right.  You only have to buy one jar BUT since the taste isn't good, it isn't such a good bargain.<br /><br />The first sensation to hit your mouth is of a strange sweetness - somehow a little unpleasant.  There is a vague peanut-butter edge but not enough to drown out the sweetness.  After you manage to swallow, there is a surge of spiciness.  All-in-all, all I can see is ick.
