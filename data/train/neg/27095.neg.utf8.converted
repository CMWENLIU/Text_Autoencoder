You've heard about how those crazy kids in Japan love cucumber-flavored things. They've got cucumber pepsi, kit-kats, and candy. The idea of a fresh cool cucumber drink interests you, so you decide to try it. You wrench open the bottle with your sensitive hands and take a sip. Suddenly you are alone on a cloudy, grey day, on a construction site for a new hospital. The hospital is nearing its completion but is obviously unfinished; blue tarps hang in place of drywall in some areas and fiberglass powder is scattered all over the bare concrete floor. The wind gently blows and the tarps sway, sweeping a cloud of insulation-dust and dirt into your face. It's musty and dry and it makes your mouth feel dirty.<br /><br />That is what drinking dry cucumber soda is like.
