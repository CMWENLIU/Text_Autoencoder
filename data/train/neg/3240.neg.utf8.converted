I'm a novice with kefir, but very experienced in kitchen and have worked with fermented foods in past.  The biggest problem may have been the sketchy and unclear instructions.<br />I'd heard about letting grains rest after transport, so I did this, leaving them in package at room temperature.  Man of Genius (questionable!) didn't say to put them in milk right  away, so I waited around five days.  He also didn't say anything about proprotions of milk to grains.  I wound up with a vinegary, smelly milk, so foul my partner said it smelled like someone threw up.  I did a lot of reading on the internet, and kept trying, using more milk.  One day I had these little cauliflowers, then they flopped into little bumps on top of the milk.  I bought more grains, this time from Kefir Lady, who sent a generous quarter cup and excellent instructions.  They're growing like  crazy.  I decided today that Man of Genius grains were a waste of milk and tossed the lot down the sink.
