I bought this in bulk at Costco because I am a college student and needed something I could snack on while studying. These do require a microwavable bowl, as they come in individual packets. After eating it twice, you already get tired of the taste. It is not like regular mac and cheese at all. The noodles are sticky and after microwaving there is barely any water left to make the cheese powder mix work. It gets messy and the powder cheese crusts around the bowl. And you have to soak the bowl once you're done eating if you want to be able to get the mix out.<br />5 months later and I STILL have a few packets left. I just can't fathom to eat it. Only way I would eat the rest is if I had absolutely nothing else to eat. Save your money and buy something else. Hamburger Helper makes great microwavable noodles that taste better than this junk.
