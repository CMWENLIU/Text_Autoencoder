Nielsen-Massey's Orange Blossom Water is dreadful -- primarily because it isn't orange blossom water at all. It's a mixture of chemicals with orange oil added. I bought it and will not use it in my cooking -- I'm afraid it'll ruin what I'm making. If you've used Monteaux in the past, be warned THIS IS NOT MONTEAUX!!
