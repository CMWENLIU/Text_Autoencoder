We've purchased this water about 5 times and up until delivery #5, we received New Zealand Natural Artesan Water, PH 8.0 (outstanding taste).  The other reviewers are correct -- they changed the packaging ever so slightly and now they're shipping vapor distilled water from Walnut Creek, California! The taste difference is night and day, and needless to say the California water is an inferior substitute.<br /><br />This company is misleading in their claims -- they are selling the same Eternal water from California that can be purchased from chains like Fresh n' Easy (at double the price) and trying to pass it off as superior water from New Zealand.<br /><br />We'd ask for a refund, but we got juked on this last shipment and opened the packaging before discovering the truth. Thumbs down ~ not an eternal customer anymore...<br /><br />Where is the seller's integrity? Not sure...<br /><br />Why doesn't Amazon monitor this type of illegal activity? Thumbs down, Amazon.
