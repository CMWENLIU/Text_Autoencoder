I recently had the opportunity to try three flavors of Izzy: Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit.<br /><br />APPLE: There's nothing wrong with this drink ... if it weren't labeled "Apple."  The drink smells of apple, but tastes more like lemon-lime (and not surprisingly, lemon is one of the three juices used for flavoring).  I expect something labeled "apple" to at least remind me of apple when I drink it.  This does not.<br /><br />BLACKBERRY: This flavor is much closer than Apple in flavor approximation.  However, it was also the weakest of the flavors that I tried--that is, it had the least power, and when room temperature, the blackberry hardly came through at all.  Not that I routinely crack a warm beverage!  But even just sitting on the table, waiting for me to finish it, it warms up and loses flavor. Quite tasty when cold, though.<br /><br />GRAPEFRUIT: Oddly, I think this is my favorite of the three.  It tastes like sweet grapefruit--think "grapefruit Jolly Rancher"--and it is the strongest of the three flavors in terms of power.  If I were to buy any Izze on a regular basis,  of these three, this would be the flavor.
