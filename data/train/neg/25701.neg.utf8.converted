I'd become a convert to baking with parchment paper a couple of years ago, and in that time period I've gone through a couple of different rolls - generally just whatever brand was available at the store, none of them being particularly better or worse than the other. Until I decided to try this brand one day. As someone who makes a point to try to shop local & eco-friendly whenever possible, I was really glad to find a more environmentally-friendly parchment paper and really didn't mind paying a little more for it than for the conventional brands. That is, until I used it for the first time. For starters, it's not sized to fit a standard cookie sheet, so to get coverage for a whole pan, you have to use one and a half or two sheets, where the other kinds I've used have just required one sheet to cover the entire pan. Lastly, there's no easy way to tear it - no handy jagged aluminum edge like on most kinds of parchment paper that makes it quick and easy to use. I have no complaints about the quality of the product itself (once I've finally got a patchwork cover made on my cookie sheets), but then I never had a complaint about the conventional brands, either. Really, for me, it's just not wort the hassle. In the future, I'm just going to save myself the frustration and annoyance and just go with the regular kind.
