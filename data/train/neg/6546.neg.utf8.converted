When I first started my 3 cats on Wellness Core, I thought it was fabulous. Suddenly their fur was shiny and bright! They liked it, too! But then reality set in... A couple of bags later, all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts. I'm not talking basic shedding, either. Their fur was falling out..everywhere. This food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies..on ALL my cats!!! I was really worried, because it was bad. The rep at Petco told me when I informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats. I've read other reviews, as well, where people complained about a "hairball problem" with this food. This was no ordinary "hairball" problem, let me tell you. In addition, this food is absolutely NOT for cats with weight gain tendencies. I reduced my 15 lb male cat's daily intake to WELL UNDER 1/2c of this stuff plus a TBS of canned daily, and he STILL gained weight on it! My opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss. Either there is an ingredient in it that should NOT be there, or there is something missing that SHOULD be there.<br />The Wellness regular dry w/ grains caused flakes in my cats, as well. The Wellness canned is the only thing I highly recommend from Wellness.
