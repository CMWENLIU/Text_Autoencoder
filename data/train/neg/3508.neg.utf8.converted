Previously Twinnings had a product called "Indian Spiced Chai Tea" in a golden colored box.  Since I could not find that I went to the Twinnings web site and found Twinnings Chai in a red box listed w/ the same ingredients as the other product.  I ordered it.  It is awful and does not resemble the quality of the previous product.  DO NOT GET THIS TEA IF YOU LIKED THE OTHER TEA. It tastes fishy and there is no distinctive spice flavor. I was soooo disapointed.  It gets a big zero!
