in a tiny little package!!!<br /><br />OMG - Was so excited when I ordered this, and it arrived today...WOW  :(<br /><br />At the price they were advertising, I thought it was a gallon, and bought it over the Paragon for around $20...<br /><br />There is no scale to the photo, so you can't tell the container actually is just under FOUR INCHES TALL AND 3 INCHES WIDE!!!<br /><br />Holy crap did I get ripped of - sure, I should have read closer to figure out they were packing a joke,,,trying to catch somone in a hurry, looking a bargain and take their money and run...<br /><br />Don't care if is the best in the world - will never buy from Wabash valley Farms AGAIN - shame, cuz my popcorn machine is big and my 3 kids have a lot of friends over...
