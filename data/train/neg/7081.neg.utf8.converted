I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Fish, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least the first ingredient is 'fish' and not a by-product or cheap filler, but I find it odd that its not "salmon" or "tuna" just "fish". If they were using quality fish, they wouldn't have to hide behind an ambiguous label. Also, the rest of the ingredients are disgusting! There are many by-products in this food. By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, bones, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that put off an appetizing aroma, and taste good to cats. Also, I usually feed my cats dry food for dental and digestion reasons, so I think they were excited just to have a wet food "treat." I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a marketing company with no regard for the feline diet; thus producing very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats are carnivores and need to eat meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods, such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat- with no added fillers or low quality arbitrary "meats".
