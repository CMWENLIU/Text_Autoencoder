I bought these after hearing they were the best and reading all the good reviews. Previously, I had tried the Wilton markers which were horrible. I was so excited to try these out, but after 4 or 5 cake pops they stopped working. When I cleaned them on a paper towel as recommended on the packaging the markers worked fine, but as soon as I tried to write on the candy nothing would happen. I don't understand why they didn't work for me but seem to work great for others.
