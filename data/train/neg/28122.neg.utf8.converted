I was deeply disappointed at this product because the items are very small. Each sample is roughly the size of an adult males finger. The decorative box, with all the products (large products at that) shown in the picture was not what I got. I got a cardboard box with shredded cardboard in it and a handful of finger sized trial products. Honestly, for the price I should have just gone to the local store and bought a Hickory Farms gift box. If this is the "Heart of Wisconsin" then its a small and frail heart.
