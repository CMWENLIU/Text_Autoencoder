I was so excited to try this cake after reading the reviews and was greatly disappointed. I followed the directions, mixing well, and the cake took longer to bake than the instructions indicated. The cake has a gritty texture and sort of a stale aftertaste. It definitely lacks rich chocolate flavor. ** A suggestion for anyone looking for an excellent gluten free chocolate cake... Pamela's Products is one to rave about, no one else would know it's gluten free.
