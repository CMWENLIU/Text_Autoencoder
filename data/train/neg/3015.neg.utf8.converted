I would say this is mid to poor grade silver needle tea.  There is lots of small particles and pieces, I would say only about 2/3 to 1/2 are full whole leaves, the rest broken bits.<br /><br />The quality and taste (and smell) of the tea is inferior to any silver needle tea I have ever had, by far.  As a comparison I would give Teavana's silver needle tea about 4 to 4.5 stars while this only deserves 2, maybe 2.5 at the most.
