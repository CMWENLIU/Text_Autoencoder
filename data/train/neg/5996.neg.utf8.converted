OK, I am very health concious and watch calories, carbs and fat content. I like regular PB very much but it has a lot of calories so I thought I would try this. Immediately after opening kind of a greenish brown color and pudding consistency. When I first looked at it my thoughts definitely were not of PB but something much worse. Then I tasted it. I would have to say that the taste and texture were the same as that much worse item that comes in about the same color. This stuff is totally GROSS. Do not waste your money. Save the calories and have the real thing. At least with real PB you get some nutritional value. I do think Walden Farms could market this as an appetite suppresant.
