I dont even know if the product taste any good but I need to give only 1 star for them. I opened the box,they were packed very poorly, 2 of the 3 can which were made of cardboard papers broke in half which created flour all over the box. The only good can was all covered and got pretty dirty, too much work . I am very disappointed and I need to say I never gave 1 star to anything , and this product deserves it.I actually want to return them.
