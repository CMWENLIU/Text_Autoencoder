My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it has a slightly stale<br />smell to it -- perhaps they don't wash the quinoa enough before processing it?  I taste everything my babies eat, and have<br />to mention that it does not have the melt in the mouth texture of the other two besides not tasting good.  My babies will eat quinoa for eg<br />when I cook it for family meals.  And amaranth in flakes from their brother's cereals.  Buy a single can from whole foods<br />or target etc before buying a multi pack.  They won't even eat it if I put in one tablespoon to 5 of rice cereal.  Ended up just tossing the open can.<br />Either of these is fantastic. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSTGGW">HAPPYBELLIES Brown Rice Cereal Contains DHA and Probiotics, Organic, 7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO">HAPPYBELLIES Oatmeal Cereal, Organic, Contains DHA and Probiotics, 7-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>
