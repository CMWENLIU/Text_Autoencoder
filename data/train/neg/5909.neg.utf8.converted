This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre, so why not cut back on quality and cruise on the Twinings name. Judging by the stellar reviews of their product, they made a smart business decision. They bought cheap leaves and dumbed down the taste to a brackish, uninteresting non-event.<br /><br />Compare this stuff with Tazo English Breakfast tea; you'll taste a hige difference. There are probably some other good E.B. teas out there, but Tazo is fairly widely available in my area. Sadly, Lipton followed the Twining trend toward mediocrity, so they're no better.
