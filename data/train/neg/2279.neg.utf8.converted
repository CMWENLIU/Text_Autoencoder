These nuts have so many artificial ingredients on them, don't buy them!  Buy some plain natural roasted almonds by Diamond.  These use the dangerous acesulfame and sucralose, two dangerous aspartamine like chemical ingredients.  Unfortunately I bought these without reading the fine print and once I realized I immediately threw them away.  Same goes for their other flavors.  Do yourself a healthy favor and buy natural nuts.
