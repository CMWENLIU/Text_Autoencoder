i don't understand how people can drink this and say it taste like strawberry milk. it has a nasty medicine after taste. (yuck!) i prefer the french vanilla flavor. if you wanna try a strawberry protein shake that actually taste like strawberry milk, try gnc's lean shake strawberries & cream. that's good stuff plus it has more protein than special k's protein shakes.
