I gave it a try. I'm a bodybuilder and am used to slightly off tastes and some weird combinations. I can eat just about anything. However this stuff was so nasty with a very bitter after taste that I had to chuck it. If it's bad in a smoothie, then it won't work with anything. Wish I had tried a 1 pound bag from my healthfood store for trying purposes. Like I said, I can handle a lot of tastes, but bitter will never work for me. Tastes like BCAAs.
