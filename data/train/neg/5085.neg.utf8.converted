My 5-year-old Australian shepherd, Pete, has put on a lot of weight in the last 18 months, so I was curious to see how he would take to a low calorie treat.<br />I placed a regular size Milk Bone, a small Beggin' Strip, and a Zoe treat stick side-by-side on the carpet and invited Pete to help himself.<br />Being wary like most Aussies, he cautiously sniffed each offering, then took the Milk Bone. When he was finished with the Milk Bone, he picked the Beggin' Strip. Finally, when there was only one choice left, he took the Zoe treat stick.<br />I did this test with him four times to see if he would develop a taste for the Zoe treat sticks, but the results were always the same.<br />From a health and caloric point of view, the Zoe treat sticks may be the better choice, but Pete's interested in them only if nothing else is available.<br />I suppose that's true of people and diet food too.<br />At any rate, Pete gives 'em 2 stars.
