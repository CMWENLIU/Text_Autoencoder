The product description reads:<br /><br />...We then package them in our authentic Maxwell House glass jars to seal in that rich flavor and aroma...<br /><br />I ordered these because the description notes that they are packaged in GLASS jars which is my preference for ensuring the freshest coffee taste.<br /><br />These are NOT GLASS jars. They are plastic. I can get plastic at the local Mart.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
