From the box, you might think these bars would be about the standard size of say, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PA6H82">Larabar Original Fruit and Nut Bars 18 Bar Variety Pack 2 Boxes</a> or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0DMME">KIND PLUS, Cranberry Almond + Antioxidants, Nutritional Boost, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a> or even a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N7MYU2">Glutino Chocolate Banana Organic Bars, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)</a>...THINK AGAIN!!<br /><br />The box is mostly full of air, and so are the individual packages. The individual wrapper is about 3.5" long, but literally half of it is inflated with air to maintain shape, because the bar itself is NOT even 2" long. It is literally just 2 bites big. PATHETIC. This is environmentally irresponsible of the Enjoy Life company to create such waste in their manufacturing and packaging processes, consuming that much in raw materials to contain AIR??? Idiotic!<br /><br />That air exposure might account for the stale taste on the outside of the bar. But it doesn't account for the way the bar itself is such a wad in your mouth that just gets stiffer and gummier the more you chew it, and so hard to eat that it won't go down the esophagus at all without gulping an entire drink behind the measly 2 bites.<br /><br />Wasting the packaging space like that also misleads unwitting consumers into thinking they might actually get some *product* for the outrageous prices. Granted, outrageous prices seem to be the hallmark of all things gluten-free, since the consumer has such limited choices...the makers feel fine with padding the profits so heavily, pursuing profit without conscience. You wanna buy a lot of NOTHING and end up trashing what your hard-earned money got you since what little is there isn't edible? Buy this snack!<br /><br />Two words sum it up: IRRESPONSIBLE and DISGUSTING!
