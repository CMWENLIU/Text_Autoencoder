I thought I was picking the best formula I could for my daughter.  Since the breaking news this week I have been horrified to know what is really in this formula...HIGH levels of ARSENIC!!!!!!  And to make matters worse the company is NOT being forth coming at all.  They are posting inaccurate information on their Facebook page and deleting posts from concerned parents who are trying to make them be accountable!!!!!!!  In order to avoid all the hexane formulas here in the US, I suggest you buy from a European company.  DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
