I've bought this item several times before, but now...<br />Less than 1 year ago, this was $6 bucks cheaper, got delivered quickly, and my dogs loved 'em.<br />Now, these are more expensive than steak, take 10 days to get here, and the new strips look more like bleached cardboard than rawhide, and my dogs suggest I not waste my $$ on these again.<br />Oh well, that's progress.
