Immediately after opening a box of Lipton Mandarin Orange tea, I had a feeling it would not be good.  The smell of the tea bags reminded me of orange antacid tablets (Tums, anyone?).  I figured I would still give it a try, since tea doesn't always taste like it smells.  I was correct.  The tea tasted nothing like Tums; in fact, it had no taste at ALL.  I was relieved that I didn't have to drink tums in the form of tea, but the complete lack of taste wasn't much better.  It's rare that I dislike a tea enough to actually come onto Amazon and type a negative review like this, but this tea definitely qualifies.  I enjoy a lot of other Lipton tea - including the Island Mango & Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate, but this tea does not fall under the category of good Lipton teas by a long shot.  If you enjoy eating orange Tums and drinking tasteless tea, go ahead and purchase this one.  Otherwise, stay away!
