This jerky is so hard to chew!  I put one small piece in my mouth and spent literally 2 minutes working it until my jaw started hurting.  And the jerky has a weird gamey taste to it, it doesn't taste like quality beef jerky.  And the color is off.  I just think there are much better quality beef jerkies out there, and this one is overpriced for the quality.  Don't waste your money!
