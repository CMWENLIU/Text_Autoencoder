We'd done without Kadota figs for years because they were no longer to be found on grocery store shelves.  My husband's favorite dessert was Kadota figs with cream cheese, and he asked why we never have that any more (it has been at least a decade!).  So finally I looked on the net.  The normal-sized cans seem to be unavailable even there so I took a chance and got the giant can, choosing light syrup.  Big mistake.  Either these figs have been in the can too long, or I should have gone for heavy syrup.  Too late now: I have a year's worth of nearly tasteless figs in light syrup.  Don't do it, Kadota fig lovers.  No idea why the nice-size cans are no longer made, but apparently we are living off antique Kadota figs.
