the pill pockets are supposed to be little ROUND treats so you can put the pill in the middle. The packaging Amazon used is what they would use for a flat book. This whole package is smooshed and ruined and one big flat sheet of treats. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon's shipping. I will not be ordering this item again from them and I am a little disappointed because this is the best price I have found for these anymore! I guess the cheap price comes with a cost!
