Recipe and cooking instructions don't work.  Tried numerous times to fix and happened on someone commenting to try something that is realistic.  I gave 2 stars because it's sold with nonexistently working instructions but works somewhat if you figure it out eventually.  I've made lots of tapioca over the years...albeit regular and not organic...but this was terrible and I'll never buy it again.  Overpriced and not nearly as good as the normal stuff and I'd appreciate proper instructions.
