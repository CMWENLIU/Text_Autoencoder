I had my 1st baby in Dec 2010 and had alot of trouble produce milk.<br />so at the advise of just about everyone including a lactaction consultant I tried a similar product also containing fenugreek. I researched it online and one of the side effect was "intestinal distress" well it didn't cause any problems for me, but my baby girl started having diarrhea. She also broke out in hives all over her face. So I did a medline search - something we do in the medical field. Needless to say I wish I'd researched this more before I took it. The medline searched stated the main side effect as intestinal distress but also listed the - allergic side effect I hadnt found before. 1st the hives but more distressing was - "difficulty breathing , and loss of consciousness" needless to say I freaked. Pumped and dumped for the next 4 days. It did increase my milk supply but at the potenical cost of my infants health - totally not worth it. Discuss this with your GYN 1st there are medications such as Reglan they can prescribe you that can do the same thing w/o the complications of this awful stuff. To be fair both my sister and sister in law both took this w/o complication but who would want to take the chance of having the same problem I did, or God forbid worse. FYI I'm a NICU nurse (neonatal ICU) and I really wish more people knew not to fool around with this stuff.
