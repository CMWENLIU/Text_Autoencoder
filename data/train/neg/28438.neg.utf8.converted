If you are buying these because they are pictured as the Kosher for Passover Paskesz chips, which do not contain soy -- STOP!  The chips I received are not the ones pictured (the orange bag with the "Kosher for Passover" designation) -- they are the regular Kosher chips (red bag) that contain soy.  I hadn't bothered to scroll down the page to view the ingredients when I ordered because the picture is clearly of the Passover variety.
