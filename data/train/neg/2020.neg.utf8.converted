I guess the people at amazon who decided this Nielsen Massey Orange Flower<br />Water is a good substitute for Monteux can't taste, smell or feel. First, it tastes<br />more like oranges than orange blossoms. And there's a hint of a gasoline-like<br />flavor in there, too. Second, it doesn't smell like orange blossoms. It smells kind<br />of like aged oranges - with a hint of that gasoline again. And it isn't a water. It's<br />actually oily on the fingertips and you need to wash your hands after touching it.<br />Monteux Orange Blossom Water was truly a water. Besides a flavoring, you<br />could use it cosmetically. It had the slight perfume taste and smell of orange<br />blossoms. And no fumes. I have no idea what to buy now that Monteux is so<br />hard to get but I do know that Nielsen Massey isn't it.
