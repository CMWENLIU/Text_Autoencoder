The package says "Individuals sensitive to sugar substitutes may experience a laxative effect." I paid no attention, since there were no ingredients I hadn't eaten before with no problem.<br /><br />That was a serious mistake! Without going into details, I certainly experienced 'a laxative effect'.<br /><br />I don't know if it is the combination of ingredients, or the relative amounts, or what. I would not call myself sensitive to sugar substitutes ordinarily. But I certainly won't be ordering these again!
