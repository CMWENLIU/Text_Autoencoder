Here are the ingredients that are on the label:<br />Ingredients: Gum Base, Maltitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol, Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic, Stevita Stevia extract, Resinous Glaze, Soy Lecithin, Carnauba Wax<br /><br />This is NOT a stevia sweetened product, not as one would expect with something called "Steviadent" and with "Stevia Dietary Supplement" on the front of the package. Stevia shows up #8 on the ingredient list even AFTER Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic. And the term "natural flavor" can mean anything at all. The manufacturer doesn't have to tell you what it is because it is considered "proprietary information"--could be ANYTHING, most likely something artificial, unnatural and most probably, something unhealthy or else the manufacturer would be proud to list it openly.<br /><br />I made the mistake of ordering this gum without checking the ingredients first. I even popped one into my mouth. It was pretty bad both in taste and texture; had to throw away the rest.<br /><br />There's another sugar-free gum that has less nasty ingredients:<br />It's Xlear Inc. Spry Xylitol Gum<br />Ingredients: Xylitol, gum base, natural flavor (spearmint oil), vegetable glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin, beeswax.<br />It still has Xylitol in it which some people's systems can't tolerate but generally most people can and so far, research shows that the only "side effect" is loose bowels in some people. That might be a plus for some folks!<br /><br />Spry Gums have a much nicer texture and taste in my opinion and come in several different flavors and in jars of 100 and even 600. So the savings is phenomenal.<br /><br />Made with non-GMO Xylitol made from corn.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Xlear-Peppermint-Sugar-100-Pieces/dp/B000COIT8Y/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1342563776&sr=8-4&keywords=Xlear+Inc+Spry+Xylitol+Gum<br /><br />PS: there are much better stevia products available anyway.
