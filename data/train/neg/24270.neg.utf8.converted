Pretzel salt, like you find on pretzels at a pretzel shop is compressed salt dust.  The grains are large and white and irregular.  This salt is like uniform kosher salt.  Save your money and buy kosher salt... because this not pretzel salt.  Besides the shipping was $10 for a $1.50 item.  I am really angry about the actual price of this (not pretzel) salt.
