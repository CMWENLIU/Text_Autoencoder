This is an example of why it annoys me when Amazon doesn't post the ingredients for their food items. Honestly, how hard could it be to just scan that portion of the package in? The description didn't tell much about what was in this, so I went to Cat Cora's website. No more info there, just that it contained sun-dried tomato, feta and herbs, so I purchased it. Well, turns out it has a LOT of black olive in it! Sure, most tapenades do, but not always, and you'd expect it to be mentioned. I don't care at all for black olives, so I ended up giving them away to two friends. One reported back that it was "OK" and the other didn't say anything, which I'm assuming means she didn't like it.
