I like the taste of the tea but it is very hard on my digestive system!  I have tried it twice now (for several days) and it completely upsets the balance, won't go into detail but you get the picture! As soon as I stop drinking it (2c. a day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening) I am fine. There must be something in it that I cannot tolerate.  I bought the case....I never have trouble with any other tea!  :(
