There is disgusting, and then there is unconscionably disgusting. There should be a senate subcommittee appointed to investigate how something so catastrophically wretched can ever make it to the tongue of even one unsuspecting consumer. We deserve to be protected against this kind of confectionery terrorism. One bite and your mouth is ground zero.<br /><br />Hot Tamales Cotton Candy. Not Hot. Not Tamales. Not Cotton. Not Candy. Protect yourselves...stay away.
