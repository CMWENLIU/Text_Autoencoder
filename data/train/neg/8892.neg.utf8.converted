My husband and I eat peanut butter by the spoonsful.  We had been buying Skippy Natural Creamy for several years and liked it very much.  Recently, when I bought it I noticed that it is now Skippy Natural Creamy with Honey.  I like honey so I thought it would be the same wonderful peanut butter with honey instead of sugar.  Unfortunately, it is not.  Instead of replacing the sugar with honey, they have added MORE sugar in the form of honey.  It now has 5 grams of sugars per serving instead of the 3 grams it did previously.  And it tastes so sweet now that the sweetness masks the natural peanut flavor. If the old style is not still available at the same price then we will be switching to Jif Natural.
