It does not taste like chocolate, not even a little bit. It does taste fermented. And burned. If it were a good, carmelized kind of burned, that would be understandable. Everyone burns the sugar now and then. This just tastes BAD. Everything I have tried it in has had to be tossed, unsalvagable. My advice: Stay away.
