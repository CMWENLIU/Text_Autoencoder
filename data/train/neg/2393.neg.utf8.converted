I used to buy Stella D'Oro  Anisette and Almond Toast to eat for breakfast all the time,  but have found them to be stale and hard as rocks since corporate greed shut down the ages old Bronx factory.  Quality and care are gone from the Stella D'Oro brand and I will no longer be buying their products.  If you think I'm kidding, try squeezing one of the cookies through the cellophane/plastic bag and you will feel a rock hard, rather than spongy texture, regardless of the date stamped.
