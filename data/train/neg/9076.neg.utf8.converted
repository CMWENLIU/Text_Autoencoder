I buy treats for my dogs in bulk to have them on hand. I opened this package 2 months after purchase, which meant it is too late to return, and found the product to be moldy. This is even though the expiration date hasn't been reached yet. Also, the sweet potatoes are soft, as if they are not fully dehydrated. I've bought this product at local stores and haven't had a problem. This must be part of a bad batch. I won't be buying this product or other dog treats from Amazon again, as now I am out of the money I paid.
