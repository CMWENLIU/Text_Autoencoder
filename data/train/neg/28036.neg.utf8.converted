Throughout the work day, I usually drink about 16 ounces of water just sitting at the desk. The past couple months I've been trying a variety of different energy drinks and supplements. When I had the opportunity to try the VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK through Amazon's Vine Program, I decided to give it a try. I'm drinking a lot of water every day anyway, so I figured I might as well try to mix things up a little.<br /><br />The drink itself comes in a container that looks a little like one of those newer upside-down ketchup squeeze bottles.

So, the user is left to guestimate. It took about a 1/3rd of the bottle over several days before I was able to get close to what I think was the proper amount.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with this energy drink was the flavor. Personally, I think it tastes horrible. It's supposed to be a fruit punch-flavored additive.
