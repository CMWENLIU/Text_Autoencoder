I was so excited to receive these K-cups and had one today. I wasn't very impressed. It tasted watered down and I had to add Stevia and sugar free creamer to make it taste half way decent to drink. I like a stronger tasting coffee and these just don't cut it. I'm giving both boxes to my daughter-in-law. I knew I should have ordered only one box to try first. Oh well...live and learn. I cancelled my subscribe and save too.
