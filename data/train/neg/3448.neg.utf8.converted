I was excited when I saw this hot sauce so I ordered it right away. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to its name sake. I wouldn't even call it hot. Reminds me more of a cocktail sauce. Blair's Ultra Death sauce is what I would call hot... but it also taste like sh*t lol. The Scorpion Sauce DOES taste good but doesn't have the heat you would expect or want. It WILL mess up your stomach though.<br /><br />There was another reviewer that stated hes had hotter sauces that didn't bother his stomach as much as this did and he is absolutely correct. You could easily fill up a large spoonful of this stuff, let it set in your mouth a while, then drink it with no burning or sense of heat.... but your stomach WILL quickly disagree. Actually, just small doses of this stuff really irritated my stomach. I can drink a dipping bowl full of habanero sauce with minimal stomach irritation.. but just a small amount of Trinidad Scorpion bothers my stomach quite a bit. I just wish I felt like I accomplished something when my stomach hurts this bad. It's literally like downing cocktail sauce then feeling like you were bashed in the stomach with a base ball bat repeatedly. I do like the taste but the messed up stomach isn't worth it when there's no heat to justify the irritation.
