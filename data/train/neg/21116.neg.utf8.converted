These claim to be "all natural" and healthy, but they're made in China.  I was feeding these to my dogs for some time, but when upset stomachs and diarrhea started occurring I decided not to buy these anymore.  It may be purely coincidence, but when I switched my dogs to Zukes treats, there were no more digestive upsets.  Why risk it if you don't have to?
