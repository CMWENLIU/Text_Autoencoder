As a child and even as a younger adult I remember being bewildered at how much time, effort and frustration my parents wasted on various coffee and cappuccino machines.  They always seemed to spending inordinate amounts of money on what seemed to me to be a bad and unrewarding habit.  What more, it seemed that the more money they spent on a device, the more often it broke.  This seemed even crazier to me as the $20 coffee mate worked fine - for 10 years.  and there was no discernible difference in taste.<br /><br />Then I had kids.  Everything changed.  I don't want to drink cokes anymore and i can't drink swill coffee.  I like the good stuff.  I now understand why people will pay upwards of a thousand dollars for a good coffee machine.  It's crazy, but I understand.<br /><br />So - we bought this $500 coffee maker & nothing has changed w/ the passing of the torch i guess.  It has been nothing but a headache.<br /><br />When this machine works, I love it.  The coffee is good - the lattes are very good.  I like the footprint.  Use is simple.  The problem is it is completely inconsistent.<br /><br />I turn it on.<br />The hopper is full.<br />The water is full.<br />The grind filter is empty.<br />the drip tray is clean.<br />the brew group is clean.<br />the device is primed.<br />I press the coffee button.<br /><br />Scenario A:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip - red light.<br />I push it again, perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Scenario B:<br />Grind grind grind, drip drip drip -  red light<br />I push it again, no coffee<br /><br />Scenario C:<br />Grind grind grind - No drip, Red light<br /><br />Scenario D:<br />Consistent cups of coffee, first time.<br /><br />Scenario D never happens.  The rest happen about equally.<br /><br />I simply can not figure out what i am doing wrong.  I do the same thing three times and it behaves three different ways depending on its mood i guess. I feel like a lab rat trying to pull a lever for my food pellet.
