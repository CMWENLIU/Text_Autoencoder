I wish I had read the recent review by Aren Tigs before placing my order, or I might have been spared disaster. I didn't realize the first ingredients after salt were merely strong spices; instead I was excited by the reviews I had read in the past that said this tasted like real bacon or at least like facon. When I finally got my order, I tried one of each on some potato chips just to see what the flavor was like.<br /><br />Anyone who says this tastes like real bacon, or even like Bacos, has no sense of taste. If you read any review telling you this tastes anything the least bit like bacon, assure yourself that the author is not to be trusted on any food review and move on.<br /><br />It tastes like strong barbecue seasoning, nothing more. That's fine if you want barbecue salt, but that's not the name on the label. At best, there might be a very very vague hint of bacon buried underneath the overpowering influences of the onion and paprika. This was supposed to taste like bacon? Who puts garlic, paprika, or onions on bacon anyway? Shouldn't bacon salt just taste like bacon? I'm more sensitive to onions than most people, so maybe the flavor came off far worse for me than it would for someone else. Even so the flavor was not only nowhere near the mark, but for me it was outright disgusting. This didn't meet even my lowest expectations.<br /><br />Quite aside from having wasted $15 on this garbage, J&D has earned my everlasting enmity for disgracing the good name of bacon. I hope someday someone will come along who can do this concept justice, but it obviously isn't them.
