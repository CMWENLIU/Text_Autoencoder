There is only one word that can describe this product and that is vile. I like the Walden Farms salad dressings. However, this whipped spread has a weird chemical flavor, like a petroleum based product. I put just a thin coating on a slice of bread and added jelly to it. The taste of the peanut spread totally covered up the flavor of the jelly.I couldn't throw it in the garbage fast enough. Do not waste your money on this product.
