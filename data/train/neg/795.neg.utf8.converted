Bought this with my last bit of money so I could eat for a couple weeks..<br />I assumed this would taste pretty good, because I like canned foods pretty well(as well as someone can like canned foods)... but Chef Boyardee is dreadful when you compare it to generic brands. Walmart brand and stuff that I buy at Save-A-Lot tastes WAY better than this. I had to water down the sauce just to be able to eat it.. It was just... nasty.<br /><br />It did save me from starvation, and one can lasted me all day.. so I can't fault it too much. However, save your money. Buy the cheaper generic brands. They taste way better, and there's more raviolis in a can - even if they aren't "overstuffed".
