Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge / B004U49QU2<br /><br />I received these cookies and their non-chocolate counterparts at the same time, and I'm a little disappointed with both.<br /><br />I was skeptical that packaged cookies would be soft, but these cookies actually are very soft around the edges. Unfortunately, the mouth-feel is very unpleasant to me: they feel a little like wet bread in my mouth. Once the edges have fallen off, you hit the center core of fudge -- it's basically a hard chocolate disk inside the cookie that needs warming for a second or two in the microwave beforehand.<br /><br />These aren't the worst cookies I've ever eaten, but I didn't enjoy them at all and really wanted to throw them away after the first few had been eaten -- there's a strange aftertaste that I don't much care for. There's also a bit of a "fake chocolate" smell to the cookies that is unpleasant -- my husband took one sniff of each package and refused to try any, saying that they "smelled bad".<br /><br />I really like the idea these cookies represent, and I hope that Chips Ahoy can get the recipe right in their next attempt -- it's a good idea, but just doesn't quite come together in execution.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
