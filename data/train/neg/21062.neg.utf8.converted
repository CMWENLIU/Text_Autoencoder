On the back it says "...added pure cane sugar for just the right amount of sweetness." Uhm yeah, who is Starbucks to tell me what the perfect sweetness is? Because my perfect sweetness is ZERO. I like my coffee black or at least have the option to sweeten to taste with Stevia or Agave. I hesitated buying this for a long time because of the added sugar which I hate any product does, but really needed a quick pick-me-up specific for the hot weather. I didn't find any other option for iced instant, so I reluctantly bought this at my grocery store. When I poured the contents, I could barely even see any coffee, it was sugar in practically a 4-to-1 ratio! I check the back, 11 grams of sugar for HALF the packet. Gross. Hopefully something better will come along the way soon... or I should stop slacking and make a pitcher of coffee ahead of time to bring to work, le sigh.
