The Miracle Noodle (AKA Skinny Noodles) are so disgusting to me, that I almost threw up after having tried them. I had no idea they came in water. The noodles themselves are so rubbery, that no matter how I tried to prepare them, up to and including according to the packages directions, they were still awful.It was a total waste of my money, particularly since I could not get a refund. Never again!
