After doing a great deal of research on feline nutrition and the benefits of a grain-free diet, I decided to switch my three cats from their organic low-grain food to Wellness CORE. I'm not sure if it's the size or the smell or the taste or what, but despite doing the slooow transition method between foods none of my cats seem to like CORE very much. They also have a kind of hard time eating it because the pellets are so small and round that they just roll away from their mouths (this could be a good thing for cats that are prone to eating too fast, but that's not the case with my cats).<br /><br />The bigger issue though was that within two weeks of being switched to this food, my male cat developed urinary crystals and a partial blockage and had to be hospitalized. I don't know how much the food contributed to that, but the vet did mention that she has seen several cats develop crystals while on Wellness. In any case, all of my cats are being switched off of this food.
