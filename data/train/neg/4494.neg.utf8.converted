I own a bread machine and use honey for my whole wheat loaves.  This product works great for a few weeks, but then something happens to the honey.  It gets thicker.  (And this was in bottles that were sealed and unopened).  This resulted in my bread not mixing properly.  The dough would get clumpy and would not blend together properly.  I had to throw out half of the honey.
