This company makes two versions of its product.  Version one is labeled natural spring water from New Zealand.  This version 1 has a great taste and justifies its cost.  The second version packaged by the same company with the same product name and appearance is "vaporized water" with minerals added.  This version 2 tastes like distilled water.  They have identical packaging and only by carefully reading the label can you notice the difference.  This company is very disingenuous to its vendors and customers, as I have gone to Whole Foods to purchase this product and they did not know that there is a difference and mixed the two versions on the shelf.  Typically when you see the name New Zealand on the label you are getting true spring water.  What I received was distilled water even though the picture shows the New Zealand name.  Most of the Eternal water  that you find is the distilled version.  Therefore it is impossible to purchase this product without actually seeing it before you buy.  You must assume that if you are purchasing this product over the internet that you are getting distilled water.
