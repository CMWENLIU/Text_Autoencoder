BACKGROUND:  I like coffee.  Especially a nice espresso drink. It may not sound like much of a place to get great beans, but Costco's fresh roasters in some of their locations was my favorite supplier.  But now Costco has closed the roasters and I have to find a decent replacement. Part of the issue is price.  For years I thought that Costco was charging too little for their fresh roasts.  EXAMPLE: $8.99 for 2.5 lbs ($3.60 per pound!) of espresso roast was so incredibly cheap compared to anyone else in the marketplace. AND IT WAS FRESH AND FLAVORFUL!<br /><br />Lavazza Super Crema appeared to be a reasonable & affordable replacement.  $26.23 for 2.2 lbs (through Amazon) was over twice as expensive - but still reasonable IF THE QUALITY WAS THERE. It was not. I found the flavor to be bland and bordering on stale. Even the sound that the beans made in the grinder led me to believe that they were old and dry.  And when the coffee came out of the grinder, it jumped all over the place from the static electricity that had built up while spinning in the grinder. But if it was just a little old - I would have assumed that I'd be able to draw an espresso shot with some flavor - but no.  Stale and boring. Blech!<br /><br />This is the most critical review I've ever done of any product that I've purchased on Amazon. To say I hated Lavazza Super Crema would be an understatement. I'm currently drinking a mug of Peet's Coffee (french roast) to get the taste of Lavazza Super Crema out of my mouth.
