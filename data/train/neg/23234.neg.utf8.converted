Kellogg's Frosted Flakes contain ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. That's right, folks! GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide. Foreign genes have been forced into the DNA which cause every cell of the plant to make its own pesticide. When corn worms bite into it, their stomachs explode. When people bite into it... well who knows! Two recent studies linked the pesticide toxins in the corn to human cell membrane death and the death of neonatal kidney cells. A study done in Canada found the Bt toxins in the blood serum of 93% of pregnant women tested, and 80% of their unborn babies. The FDA lets the chemical companies decide if they're safe - there is no requirement for long term, independent, peer reviewed studies to test it before it gets into your food. There are 50 countries around the world that require products to be labeled when they contain genetically modified ingredients... all of Europe, China (!), Japan, Russia (!), Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, India and more. In the US, there is no labeling law. We hit the jackpot! We have Michael Taylor appointed as our food safety czar and guess where he came from! MONSANTO... the number one chemical company creating and selling GMOs. To make it worse, they have also inserted foreign genes into the DNA of sugar, soy, canola and cottonseed. (POP TARTS contain ALL of these - don't buy them!) They've made ALL of these GMOs resistant to high doses of an herbicide called RoundUp. (Guess who also sells the RoundUp - you got it! Monsanto!) The active chemical ingredient in RoundUp is called Glyphosate. If you google it, you'll find that it's linked to birth defects, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and more. No wonder everyone seems to be getting sick! Kellogg's doesn't want you to know any of this and they have recently contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California, where voters will be voting on Prop. 37 for the labeling of genetically engineered foods on November 6th. They are trying to trick people into voting against labeling by telling them its going to raise their grocery bills by $400 a year and other things which are totally untrue. None on the countries that have labeling laws have seen ANY increase in their food costs. Kellogg's Frosted Flakes are no longer G-R-RRRRREAT. I wouldn't feed them to my family... not to my pets either. BLECH.
