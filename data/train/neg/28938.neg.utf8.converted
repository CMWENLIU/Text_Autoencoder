I purchased this without looking that it was made of flavored cottonseed oil, which has 120 calories per tablespoon.<br />It has almost no flavor and I cannot send it back.  I was looking for an extract or flavoring like vanilla flavoring.<br />Big mistake.  there is almost no odor. I really don't want to add all these fat calories to something I am hoping<br />will be low calorie.
