These pickles are pickled in acetic acid even though the label in English reads brine in large print implying that they are pickled in brine. The can's small print (which is NOT visible in the picture) does report the truth. The use of brine instead of vinegar as a pickling agent results in a tremendous difference in taste. I'm stuck with 12 cans of pickles in vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar pickles I can get anywhere, and besides I hate the taste of vinegar pickles.I bought these on the strength of the large printed brine on the can. Do NOT buy this brand if you want brined pickles. As vinegar pickles go these are no worse than others of their type.
