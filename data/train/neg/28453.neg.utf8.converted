I loved these as a  kid and couldn't wait to try again....WOW these are lousy! There is very little flavor and not remotely HOT. Even tried combining multiple picks, still no flavor. A previous review noted the "splintering of the wood", this is very true so becareful. Spitting out the wood is part of the joy, i guess.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
