I purchased *five pounds* of raspberries and blackberries because I've had Haribo gummi bears before and really enjoyed them, plus the price can't be beat (usually just five ounces is two to three dollars, imagine getting five whole pounds for fifteen dollars!).<br /><br />I DID NOT ENJOY these.  Buy the gold gummi bears instead.<br />These raspberries blackberries are too sweet and have a weird consistency.<br />They are nothing like the Jelly Belly raspberries blackberries (which are lovely little drops of heaven).<br /><br />I was very uncertain buying raspberries blackberries online, because I wasn't sure if I would get cruddy old stale raspberries blackberries that endanger your teeth and taste of old wax.<br /><br />That was not the case with me.<br /><br />These raspberries blackberries seem fresh, and were well packaged and delivered promptly.<br /><br />I purchased the raspberries blackberries on Jan 27 2009.  I received them on Jan 30 2009.  They were fresh and squishy, and well packaged.  They shipped from Indianapolis and arrived in DC three days later.  Terrific.<br /><br />Too bad you have to buy two bags to get free shipping, now I have 10 pounds of candy lying around!  Five pounds of which I really hate.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.  Go for the Haribo standard bearer, the gold gummi bear instead.
