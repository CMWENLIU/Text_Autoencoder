I use the feline pine kitty litter, and I thought it was the same. The kind I buy looks like chips. This looked like little pellets that you would feed to a rabbit or something. I do not see how it could be used as litter. I wasted my money. It is non-returnable so I guess it just goes in the trash and I'm out 16.00 bucks. I thought I was saving money, but actually I wasted money. Not happy.
