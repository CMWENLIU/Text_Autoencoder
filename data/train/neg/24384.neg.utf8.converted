Sauerkraut from Libby's seemed to be a good choice.  Product is usually reliable and tasty.  But when I tried to offer an honest review of these canned products shipped to me by Amazon,their censors  would not allow what I said.  If you like to eat your vegetables out of dented cans, you will not be disappointed with your purchase.  Maybe the food is safe, but I don't eat it.  Waste of money. I will buy locally so I can be sure the cans are not damaged.
