I've been using SWheat Scoop for almost year and thought great product..until I started noticing tiny black bugs infesting flooring around the litter box. Took a while to realize bugs connected to the Swheat Scoop. I tried removing the BOX and keeping litter in air tight container but found More Bugs.  So I examined the litter and its well, Littered w/ tiny BUGS. This isn't one box..its several months of boxes.<br /><br />I am alerting the pet store but likely the Litter is infected. You wouldn't notice these bugs unless sweep them onto white background. Gross...switching litter immediately (have no idea to what). good luck.
