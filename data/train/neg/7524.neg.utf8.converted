I absolutely loved this product at first.  I had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply wouldn't turn on.  I called the company and they sent me a new model.  The steam chamber of the new model smells horrible, I can't quite pinpoint the smell but it is somewhere between metallic and burnt plastic.  All the food I've steamed also has this metallic taste to it.  I've done the cleaning with distilled vinegar and distilled water twice already but the food still tastes metallic.  This freaks me out because I have no idea what is being deposited on the food. Obviously I won't be giving any steamed food to my baby. I've called customer service again and I'm waiting for a call back.
