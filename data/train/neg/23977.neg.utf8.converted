Do not be fooled by the "British Blend" label, this is not British tea! We Brits like our tea with a lot of flavour. I frequently purchase Tetleys decaf tea in the UK and this does not even compare. It is weak and tasteless and even doubling the amount of tea bags per cup doesn't work. Perhaps the regular decaf is better but in my opinion, if you like a more full bodied tea experience,this is not for you.
