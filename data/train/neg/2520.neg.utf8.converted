Let me share my reaction and compare it to my friend's reaction because we have very different eating habits and lifestyles. We both had a terrible reaction to this product and we both used it sparingly.<br /><br />I eat low-carb and have a sensitivity to sugar (insulin resistance), so I need good fiber in my diet. I eat raw and cooked vegetables and so I thought I could handle sprinkling some chia seeds in my plain yogurt once daily. What a mistake. I had a reaction that would have been humiliating if it happened outside the house. Good thing the bathroom was only a few feet away.<br /><br />My friend eats low-fat and is a personal fitness trainer. She eats very clean, high fiber, and she used this product sparingly as well. Her body's reaction wasn't as volitile, but she still felt pain and discomfort.<br /><br />If you want the benefits touted by the marketing of this product, I suggest you proceed with caution and do it over a few days where you won't be in a place where you can't get to a toilet within seconds.
