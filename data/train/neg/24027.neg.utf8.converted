If you think you're getting full boxes of candy as pictured, you will be disappointed! The popcorn box has 5 pieces of miniature versions of candy. There is one microwave popcorn packet, in addition to a plastic clapper that you would use at a sporting event that has basketballs on it?? Is that appropriate for a movie night? I'll keep it and use it as filler for a basket I'm making for a charity event, but I will still have to go shopping for theater-sized boxes of candy. I thought $6.99 was a great deal for this as pictured. I suggest changing the image.
