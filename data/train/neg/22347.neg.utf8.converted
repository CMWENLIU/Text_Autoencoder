This raw organic cacao powder came in one of those electronics static bags you'd normaly see a chipset or hard drive with a recycle symbol 7 & 11-PET, ALU, PE. I was told it was "food-safe" by the seller and that "nestl&eacute; uses the exact packaging."I don't see how ROHS (the restricted use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) can be food safe. I cannot return it for a full refund as there is a restocking fee and shipping charge so I'm writing this review.<br />  At the least, common sense should tell you that organic powderd foods should not be in contact with impregnated aluminum plastics--especially when it's stamped on the bag itself stating (ROHS compliance) "that it contains the minimum acceptable levels of hazardous substances such as cadmium, mercury, and lead." This is no joke. Industry cares not about your health and therefore uses recycled materials containing these hazardous metals. A packaging containing acceptable levels of hazardous materials for a landfill is not food safe!!
