I've never been more dissapointed in an assortment then the package I received today.  Of 34 k-cups, 21 were last years Holiday flavors from Green Mountain.  11 were Gingerbread, 8 Pumpkin Spice and 2 Spicy Eggnog.. Tried these flavors before and HATE all of them.  Seriously... 11 Gingerbread?? This is June...  Plus this is not a "sample" of Gingerbread... that's a box of it.  Coffee was only from Gloria Jean and Green Mountain, when I was supposed to get a "sampler pack"?  Of 34 k-cups only 13 are what I call a variety (6 different flavors) so the rest is money down the drain.  Nothing like trying to pawn off last years bad flavors...
