I'm a raw food person and have used macadamias with no problems for years. This brand, however, is not truly raw. It made me sick eating them. They are hard or stale, and not slightly soft and buttery as macs are when truly raw. And they don't accept refunds, so I'm out the money.<br /><br />If you are seeking truly raw macs, you should look elsewhere. I'm still feeling sick and I tried them yesterday.
