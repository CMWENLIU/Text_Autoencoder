As some of the other reviewers have noted, Baby's Only Organic Formula contains high levels of arsenic. I would love to have exclusively breastfed, but, due to a low milk supply that couldn't meet my baby's needs, I have to supplement with formula. I did a ton of research before buying Baby's Only and thought I was giving my baby the next best thing to breastmilk. I didn't want to buy Earth's Best because it contains hexane. Baby's Only was the only organic formula I could find without hexane. So I was appalled when I learned that Baby's Only dairy formula tested for high levels of arsenic (read the story on the Boston Globe's website: "Arsenic hidden in baby formula, cereal bars, and energy shots?") due to the brown rice syrup in it. Baby's Only hasn't issued a recall, voluntary or otherwise. I cannot believe this formula is still being sold. DO NOT BUY BABY'S ONLY. I ended up ordering another organic formula called Holle from a website in Germany. It's not available in the US, but the international shipping cost was worth it for my baby's health.
