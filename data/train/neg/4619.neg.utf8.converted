When my local Asian grocer stopped carrying the small tin of Japanese matcha green tea powder I'd been purchasing, I searched for a comparable (price/quality) alternative.  Amazon, as always, was my first stop, but to no avail.  Instead, I found this identical green tea powder from The Republic of Tea at Whole Foods Market, for $17.99.  Wondering to myself, "How did I miss this on Amazon?" I came back here to look it up, planning to make all subsequent purchases here.  Imagine my shock to find it listed for twice the price (almost $40) as what is arguably the planet's highest end grocery chain.<br /><br />This is a great, high quality green tea powder, especially for smoothies.  That said, don't fall for this price gouging.  Please visit your local Whole Foods or other health food store first, where you'll find it at half the price.  If they don't stock it on the shelves, go to customer service and I'm sure they'll order it for you, at no extra cost.  Shame on You, [It's A Treasure]!!! (seller)  When they cease their price gouging and bring the price back in line to a reasonable retail price point, I'll change my rating to reflect the actual product, but as it stands there's no way I'm going to award 5 stars and assist this seller in continuing to gouge the public.
