With Tahitian vanilla and a great name (Beanilla), I had high expectations for this product. Alas, it doesn't taste like vanilla and barely even smells like vanilla.  It smells like cheap candy:  a sickening starchy sweetness, almost like Play-Doh mixed with confectioner's sugar, with a hint of McDonald's vanilla shake.  The product melts in your mouth (good), but tastes like sweet powdered clay.<br /><br />I keep the Beanilla in my cupboard and retry it periodically, hoping that my taste buds were off in the past.  But, whether sprinkled on coffee (the main reason I purchased the product) or mixed into icecream, the product is gross.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm not using it as intended or am not thinking of it the correct way.  If you think of it as a powdered creamer like Coffee-Mate (and you like Coffee-Mate), you might like it in coffee.  It might also be better in baked goods (on the label it recommends using the product for "frosting, sauces, puddings, and other recipes as a substitute for vanilla extract").  Liquid vanilla extract contains alcohol and slightly thins what you're making -- I see an advantage in using a powdered vanilla if you want to avoid these characteristics.<br /><br />I'm giving the product a chance and want to like it, but it's the most artificial tasting real vanilla I've had.  I purchased the 12oz. version.  If you think you'd like to try it, I'd advise trying the 4 oz version first.<br /><br />Ingredients on the Label:  "Dextrose, Silicon Dioxide, Vanilla Bean Extractives"<br /><br />I recommended "Authentic Foods Vanilla Powder," also sold here on Amazon for a more genuine vanilla taste.  It's made with:  "Natural Vanilla Bean Extractives, Evaporated Cane Juice, Silica, Cellulose."  I like this for icecream and for coffee drinks.<br /><br />You might also use Raw Vanilla Bean Powder, which is expensive at triple to quadruple the price, but it contains only vanilla.
