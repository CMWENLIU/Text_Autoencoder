They are fun to do and pretty to look at. Just don't eat them while your child is standing there. These were some of the most sickly sweet but NASTY cookies I have ever tasted. I am ashamed to say I let my granddaughter take some of them home to her mother. I just hope they haven't tried to eat them before I can call them in the morning and give them a heads up. I just took a bite and couldn't even swallow it. I was SO glad she wasn't there to see my reaction.<br /><br />She had a blast making them and seeing the dough turn pink. The experience MAKING them was great. Eating them sent me running to my computer to review them.
