Check out this product their is a FDA warning many dogs have gotten deathly sick from eating these treats Made in China. My dog almost died and is still trying to recover from being poisoned by these. They would be recalled by now but the FDA told me that they don't know what the ingredient is that is sickening dogs so they can't recall? This has been going on since 2007. The owner of Dogwell could care less as I have also spoke with him bottom line for him $$$,not your pet. Do a little research google jerky treats from China you don't want your pet to go though what mine has. Bloody stools, vomiting, shaking, back legs became paralyzed he could not walk or stand.
