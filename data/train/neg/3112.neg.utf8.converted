I was looking forward to receiving this product, as from all reviews, contents, etc., it sounded ideal to keep my large and small dog happily chewing on something healthy.<br />  They both chewed, the little one left it. The big one threw up for two days. Since the big one has a cast iron stomach, I can only conclude the product made her sick.<br />  Forewarned...
