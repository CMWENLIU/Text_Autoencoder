I had no problem eating these bars, they tasted ok, and I thought, wow, what a nice addition to my raw diet.<br /><br />However, about 2 hours later, my stomach got real queasy and<br /><br />I threw up (several times)..  Not a great experience.<br /><br />I returned the bars, however, after all postage fees, etc,<br /><br />I was only refunded 12 dollars on a $28 total order.<br /><br />So Buyer beware!!!!
