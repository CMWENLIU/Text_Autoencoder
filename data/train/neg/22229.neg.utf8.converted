I loved the idea of this product until I saw the film "The Big Fix" and learned that the fish from the Gulf of Mexico is probably not actually safe to eat (despite what our government wants us to believe).<br /><br />The 2nd ingredient in this food (which I've been feeding my beloved pets) is "ocean fish meal."  I wrote and phoned Diamond Pet Foods (maker of Taste of the Wild) and confirmed that their "ocean fish meal" indeed comes from the Gulf of Mexico.  I then did my own research and confirmed online that today (April 2012) there are major concerns with the fish and seafood coming from the gulf.  Fish are showing up with black and bright red 'lesions' and crustaceans are showing up with blackened body parts.  This was in some video taken by a journalist and posted on the web.<br /><br />If you watch The Big Fix you'll learn not only about the oil that is likely sitting on the bottom of the gulf, but you'll also learn about toxic chemical dispersant branded as COREXIT, which has been used extensively in the gulf to hide the oil.  This is what's REALLY going on with the fish in the gulf and you can probably assume that pet food is considered a great way to "dispose" of food products within the commerce chain.<br /><br />I'm stopping feeding my pet this food immediately because despite what the bag depicts (wolves and bears in the wild) one of the major ingredients ("ocean fish meal") doesn't come from the pacific northwest at all, but actually comes from the gulf of Mexico which is a suspect source of food for both humans and pets according to the alternative press.<br /><br />For reference check out the following articles.  Amazon won't let me post links so you must google these as key words:<br /><br />1.  Lauran Neergaard's 4/25/12 gruesome photo for AP of fish in a Gainsburg FL paper.  She's a medical writer.<br />2.  Amy Goodman's Due Diligence On Gulf Oil Spill 4/24/12<br />3.  4/23/12 Crustacean biologist Darryl Felder of University of Louisana reports "finding crab and lobster, etc., that had black gills, that had appendages falling off" plus "parasites and other illnesses" setting in.<br />4.  "Gulf Aquatic Wildlife Deformities Alarm Scientists" 4/21/12, Dr. Jim Cowan of Louisiana State University<br />5.  Same article as #4:  Dr Wilma Subra, a chemist and Macarthur Fellow, has conducted tests on seafood and sediment samples along the Gulf for chemicals present in BP's crude oil and toxic dispersants.<br /><br />"Tests have shown significant levels of oil pollution in oysters and crabs along the Louisiana coastline," per Subra.
