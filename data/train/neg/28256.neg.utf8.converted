I love oil based hair treatments.<br />My hair is thick and coarse, so I like the smoothing effect along with the moisture.I am a regular user of Ojan oil  and Argan Oil.<br /><br />However when I received this product I was disappointed to find the first ingredient is mineral oil!<br />Do Cosmetic companies think we consumers are idiots and don't read labels!<br />The scent did not bother me, but don't expect any treatment benefits from this product- who know what percentage of this actually contains more of the nourishing oils like Shea, Argan and coconut?<br />No wonder it is so inexpensive.
