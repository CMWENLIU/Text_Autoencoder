I bought this for my hair after reading some reviews about how good it is for the hair - I think its really good for a pre-shampoo but not as a leave in.  One it makes my curly hair a bit frizzy if I use it as a leave in and two, bees are attracted to it...... not fun running to my car to get away............  but I hear its great for cooking with though :)
