I am a 37 year old male who exercises avidly (6 days a week, both cardio and weight lifting).<br /><br />My review is based on the Tropical Fruit flavor. It tastes nothing like fruit or fruit punch. The only way I could describe this horrible flavor is if you took pink hand soap, diluted it tremendously and then dumped in a bunch of sweetener. That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.  Ultima and Accelerade both look promising. But I'm done with Cyto Max.
