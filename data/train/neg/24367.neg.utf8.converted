I have loved this gum for years. The flavor is great, but it has an absolutely horrible ingredient I just discovered from my doctor and dentist: Aspartame. I strongly advise anyone looking for gum to find one that does not contain Aspartame. It is very hard to find because any gum that is sold at a Wal-mart has Aspartame in it. Do the research on this ingredient and decide if this is the gum for you before you purchase.
