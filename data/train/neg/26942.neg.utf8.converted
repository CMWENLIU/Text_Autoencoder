This product can't possibly be for human consumption. The horribly chemical "chocolate fudge" taste exploded in my mouth after the first chew (and chew vigorously and extensively you must to break it down enough to swallow). It left a metallic tingle and itch on my tounge. I felt nauseated. I needed to brush my teeth immediately to get the taste out of my mouth enough to cease the increasing urge to vomit. I was exciting about ordering this product when I saw it on Amazon's "Today's Deals" and read the description. It sounded perfect for my needs. Now I'm stuck with nine bars whose only use I can see fit is as a form of severe punishment for delinquent children.
