This is the first time we ordered a fruitcake from the Trappist Abbey Monastery. Our family is a rarity in that we usually love fruitcake! As a suprise, I ordered 3 different fruit cakes only one of which we had eaten previously. Well the surprise didn't go over well because no one liked this cake. It is a dense, over-spiced block of dried cake. Actually, it was the worst fruit cake I've ever eaten and we were very disappointed because we had heard so much about it. We wanted to support the work of the Trappist monks by ordering a cake but will find another way to support their wor in the future.
