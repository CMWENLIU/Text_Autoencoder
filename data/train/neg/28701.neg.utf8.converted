OK, I'm all for having some convenience here and there and a 8 point meal by weight watchers standards sounds intriguing, but this "meal" is really only a snack. Most of the items in this box, you would be better off buying in larger quantities and making your own servings from them. Dry roasted Edamame very tasty, trail mix good, crackers - check, but none of them are something you can't buy in a larger quantity, Chocolate same as the everything else in this over priced snack pack. Now, we get to the reason I was interested in trying this "meal"....the salmon spread! YUCK, I couldn't even finish it, it tasted like what I would think cat food taste like(probably worse)! Do yourself a favor and buy some similar items and buy some small reseal-able containers and make you own nutritious snacks or meals, they'll taste better and you'll save a lot of money.
