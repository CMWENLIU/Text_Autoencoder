I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.<br /><br />Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair?<br /><br />It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess.<br /><br />Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!<br /><br />My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p<br /><br />EEWWW!!!
