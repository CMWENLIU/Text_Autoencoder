I ordered several items from Barry Farms to make a holiday dish and my order not only arrived too late but was incomplete.  I got a note inside the box saying my ingredient was not available but I would have appreciated knowing that prior to getting my order so I could have placed an order elsewhere.  I live in a remote area and have to order a lot of ingredients online so I was just out of luck.  A simple email would have sufficed.
