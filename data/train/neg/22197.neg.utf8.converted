I should've paid attention to the reviewers who warned that their coffee arrived shortly before the marked expiration dates on the bags.  Mine did as well.  No way I'll go through the three bags in time.  For that reason, and the fact that this coffee tastes no better than what you'd get at your corner gas station, I'm cancelling my Subscribe and Save order. One other thing I should've checked out: the majority of the five star reviews are the only product the reviewers ever reviewed.  Must be a Community Coffee Employee Incentive Plan.
