For those who are tempted to spend the $14 or so (per 7 oz jar) of this stuff, let me save you the money.<br /><br />We bought a jar at Costco (same $$)  because it just sounded soooooo yummy.  And it IS tasty, but we don't think it worth the price.<br /><br />Basically, it seems like you can make your own by frying some diced real bacon to a medium crisp --keep the melted fat.  Then make a batch of caramelized onions (see the first part of Julia Child's French Onion Soup recipe)  and add a spoon or two of brown sugar.  Throw it all (fat, too) in a blender, add a splash of Balsamic vinegar, blend to a paste.  That pretty much approximates the flavor of this product.  You can doctor it as you like.<br /><br />When we finish this jar, that'll be it.  I'd rather spend the $$ on Umami Paste or something.<br /><br />The cleaned, empty jar is a good size/shape for leftover paint. (Waste not. . .)
