I have been receiving this product for almost a year as a subscribe and save deal. Up until a few months ago Amazon sent the real, original thing. This is unfortunately no longer the case! If you order this you will get Ito En Oi Ocha, yes...but it's made in Thailand and comes in a really weak, pathetic bottle. Ito En HAS NOT changed their suppliers or changed their factory locations completely to Thailand. They still manufacture this product in Japan. Amazon has simply decided to buy the cheaper Thai version of the product, likely due to the strength of the Yen...but I would still gladly pay more to get the original thing...<br /><br />As far as the flavor goes, the Thai version tastes a different, likely due to the taste difference of Thai water vs. Japanese water. You cannot tell if it is VERY cold...but if it is above fridge temperature you can definitely taste (*and even smell!*) a difference.<br /><br />Amazon's image for the product is WRONG. That is not the product you will receive.<br /><br />Unless you have no other options to get this product DO NOT BUY IT until Amazon understands that sourcing "Japanese" green tea from Thailand is wrong and an insult to their customers.
