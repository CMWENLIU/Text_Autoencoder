We bought the gourmet food and snacks gift basket as a birthday present.<br />My wife talked to the recipient on the day of her birthday and she was delighted, but...<br />A second phone call several days later included mention of the gift.<br />"Where did you get this?" she asked. "Don't waste your money again".<br />According to her report, the gift was mostly boxes, boxes within boxes, and little content.<br /><br />Getting accurate feedback from those who receive gift baskets and similar products is problematic--the recipient (unlike our friend!) is usually concerned about hurting the feelings of the giver when they are disappointed.
