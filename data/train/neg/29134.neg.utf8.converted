The kefir grains were delivered promptly so there was no issue with that. However! The milk kefir that they produce is not what I would consider real milk kefir. I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn "Kefirlady" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the "slimy" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that. Personally, I'd recommend getting them from a different vendor as these are woefully inadequate at accomplishing their intended purpose. Looks like I'll have to be getting some new grains...
