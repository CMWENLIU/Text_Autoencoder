This is a tea with a nice flavor and color, but nothing really special. It has a different flavor than green tea and is not strong like black tea. It is not bitter, but pleasant. It comes in 3 separately sealed, airtight bags. I have used about 1/2 half of the box so far.<br /><br />I have noticed that a rather high percentage of the tea bags are missing the staple that holds the string on, or the string is cut in the middle. Without the staple, the teabag opens up in the hot water and lets out the leaves. Another defect that I have found in several of the bags is that the envelope was inaccurately folded and stamped. It causes the envelope to be crooked and in some cases it cuts part of the corner of the teabag so that leaves leak out while steeping.<br /><br />Although I have continued the use the tea I have on hand and I do enjoy it, I now doubt the quality of the tea judging by the quality of the bags. I would think that if the company made high quality tea, they would work a little harder on the quality control of the bagging equipment. I will most likely not order it again.
