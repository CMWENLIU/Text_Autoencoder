In my first shipment, two of three bags were completely broken and therefore the salt was rattling around in the box.  This left me with one bag.  When I contacted customer service they sent me another three.  This time all three had dime size holes in the top of them.  Some was still in the bag, but would you want to eat something that did not come sealed?  Customer service was great again, refunding my money so I can buy another brand of salt.  Packaging needs to be reassessed if they are going to continue to ship this item.
