Just because the list of ingredients seem natural  does not mean it is "healthy". If the fruits,nuts,seeds,syrups etc. are contaminated with heavy metals,pesticides,fungicides etc.etc. and are manufactured somewhere with poor quality control I certainly wouldn't consider the product "healthy"! Also, from an environmental view the greenhouse gases created getting this product transported to/from China are indefensible. Produce the product locally or don't pretend to be an earth friendly company,"Mrs. May's"!
