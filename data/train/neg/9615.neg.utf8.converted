It took 2 kits to get a full garden.  Only  2 seeds grew on the first kit.  I wrote to aerogarden and they sent me a replacement, told me to use distilled water (the kit said not to use distilled water, to use tap water).  I received the replacement kit quickly and was able to get some more growth from new seeds, but took a few more times.  There are 7 spots, 2 grew with first kit, 3 more grew with second kit, and 2 more are still waiting on.  I like this product, but should be as easy as they said.  I really like the customer service that went with the product though.
