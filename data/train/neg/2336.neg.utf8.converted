I love ginger in general & I really like ginger tea, so I expected good things from this drink mix. I was disappointed. The mix dissolved instantly, which was great. The first sip was almost okay, but the flavor seemed to get stronger and less pleasant with every sip. Neither the ginger nor the lemon nor the honey came through. All of thr favors were dark and muddy. The  drink itself was murky, cloyingly sweet & medicinal. It really reminded me of Thera-Flu, which is fine if you have a bad cold and will suffer a kinda awful drink because you know it will knock you out right away. But I wouldn't drink Thera-flu for pleasure, and the same holds true for this drink. I couldn't even finish the cup.
