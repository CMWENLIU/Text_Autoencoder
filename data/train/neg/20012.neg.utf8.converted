This review refers to the plastic "cookie jar."  The cookies are good, but the cheap plastic cookie jar has a lid that is almost impossible to get opened.  I finally managed to open it by working a screw driver under the edge to pop it open.  The jar is not suitable for reuse as either a cookie jar or a kitchen cannister because of the difficulty in opening the top.  If you are buying a gift, I would recommend one of the other products.  I would note that the cannisters all have very tight fitting tops (I ordered two others besides the cookie jar).<br /><br />Maybe this is the latest in childproof lids.  A young child would have extreme difficulty getting the container open.
