My husband and I argue over water frequently.  He can't understand why I buy bottled spring water instead of drinking our local tap water.  On this water, however, we managed to agree quite well.  For the price, it should contain some secret elixir.  The big additive....basically a bit of baking soda.  Baking soda does work for settling stomach upsets, but you could save a ton of money mixing some into a bottle of spring water or glass of tap water yourself.  I'm not sure of the advantage of 9.5 pH, I do wonder if that is just another marketing concept.  I'm going to stick to my bottled spring water, it has no after taste and is much more reasonably priced.
