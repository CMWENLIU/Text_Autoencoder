I am so upset....I fed my baby this giving her 1 to 2 bottles in order to supplement the breast milk.  My child got ill.  She had very bad diarrhea and had blood in her stools.  Tests were taken and came back negative for salmonella and ecoli. My pediatrician had recommended I stop giving this formula because she didn't think it gave my child the nutritional value she needed so I stopped giving it to her.  She got better and recovered.  I didn't know why she got ill, now I'm wondering if it was due to this formula :(<br /><br />Breastfeeding is best, I know this, but I what formula is safe to supplement with?  We don't have many choices so I will continue to try to get my milk supply up.<br /><br />Very upset!
