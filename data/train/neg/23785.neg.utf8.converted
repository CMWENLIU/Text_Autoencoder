I loved the flavor options when I bought this pack, but it took a while to get the blend of my coffee correct.  I made a 6-cup pot of coffee and used an entire pack of Boyer's and still added 1 scoop of my store-bought dark roast coffee to get a robust coffee taste.  The first pot I made was weak as tea, but the added flavors (Vanilla Nut, French Vanilla, etc) were excellent.  If they would darken the roast I would recommend this product.
