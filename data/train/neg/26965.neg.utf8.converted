I never rececieved the second package, only one, 10.5 oz pkg.  Neither the seller or Amazon ever responded to my complaint that I only received one.  I've waited nearly 6 weeks before writing this review in order to give them ample time to take care of the problem.  I'll think twice about amazon in the future too.  THis isn't the first time they've ignored my complaint.
