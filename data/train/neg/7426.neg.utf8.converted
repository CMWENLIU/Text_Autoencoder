These teething biscuits are great, if you HOVER OVER YOUR CHILD THE WHOLE 4 DAYS it takes to eat this mess factory. Holy Crap, my daughter almost needed a Steel Wool pad to get the dried gunk off her body. She had it everywhere, on her nose, in her nose, her eyebrow, her elbow, armpit and legs...plus the high chair needed a pressure washer! I seriously think concrete is mixed in with this recipe. The first time we gave one of these teething jaw-breakers to our daughter we realized we would be up until midnight by the time she finished slurping the brick down. Fortunately, my husband who will eat anything ate it and said it was actually tasty. Kind of like those first generation Power Bars, you know, the ones that tasted like eating your front yard. Needless to say, our daughter did not CHOKE THE FIRST TIME, BUT SHE DID THE NEXT and we have decided that she will not have these anymore, unless they have soaked in a vat of water for three days. These things are so dense they are probably like sea monkeys...they probably expand to the size of our house, so we will soak them in an igloo cooler in the backyard.<br /><br />Still, prior to our daughter choking on these teething bricks we did discover their magical powers. The next morning after her first gnaw session, our daughter was walking, talking and was even potty trained. My husband called me into her room the next morning and to my surprise, there my little 9 month old girl stood there holding her soiled diaper (yes, she undressed herself as well) yelling at my husband how she was sick and tired of having to pee on herself all of the time. We knew right then, the teether had something to do with this. We have been cautious thus far with giving her more since we do not fully understand the powers this biscuit holds! Thinking it would effect adults the same way, my husband bought a case and ate them over the next three days. He did not get smarter, but he has been constipated for the past 3 months and he cannot stop drooling. The second time we provided our daughter with one of these we found her the next morning downstairs watching Good Will Hunting yelling at the screen disproving all mathematical theories presented to the screen. Yep, our daughter then decided to build a nuclear fission reactor in my husbands shower! All I can say is be cautious of the biscuits power...your little Junior might be telling you how to change your oil the next morning or how to cook his eggs!<br />- Show quoted text -
