Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds???
