I purchased the NeCap Nespresso Compatible Refill Capsules a week after purchasing a Nespresso Citiz with Aeroccino milk heater/frothier. The Nespresso Citiz works flawlessly with Nespresso Capsules. Rich coffee with a beautiful crema. However with NeCap capsules the end result is hit and miss at best. I have tried Gevalia espresso ground espresso roast coffee in the NeCap capsules with poor results. I have tried Illy Espresso grind espresso roast with the NeCap capsules also with poor results. I have tried coffee from a local coffee house, freshly roasted and espresso grind with the NeCap capsules with poor results. I also tried India Black tea from a local India grocery with good results! Go figure.<br /><br />Preparing the NeCap capsules is a tedious process at best. Here are the steps:<br />Separate capsules from one another, this can be difficult as they tend to stick together.<br />Then separate the foil seals from one another, this can be difficult as they also tend to stick together.<br />Fill the capsules, press, then remove excess coffee with out accidentally removing the paper tape that protects the adhesive seal.<br />Sometimes the protective paper tape is not sealed carefully around the adhesive and coffee gets under the paper tape and sticks to the adhesive. Which of course needs to be removed for the foil seal to stick.<br />Assuming all goes well to this point one must then peel the protective tape and carefully align the foil seal over the capsule and seal in place.<br />These steps constitute a time consuming process which is not exactly loads of fun.<br />Lastly you must fit a small black rubber ring to the back of the NeCap capsule.<br /><br />In the box that includes all the bits needed to make a capsule is a note that reads: "Nespresso recently modified their new machines after July/August 2010 in order to prevent the use of compatible capsules. Please use the black rings to attach to the capsule for the proper use for the latest model of Nespresso Machines." Seems it may be time for NeCap to update their products.<br /><br />So the capsules aren't made for current machines and must be modified by the customer. Additionally the NeCap capsules are slightly smaller to avoid patent violation. These factors no doubt explain why some of the NeCap capsules won't insert properly in the Nespresso machine, or just fall through the machine to the catch tray. Lastly the coffee they make is not on par in any way, shape, or form with the capsules you purchase from Nespresso. Additionally I have noticed that the coffee made with the NeCap capsules tends to have grounds in it. Grounds don't bother me but it may others.<br /><br />Just so the readers know, I have filled a total of 43 of the NeCap capsules as of this writing. That was enough for me understand and to work through the process.<br /><br />All in all I will keep the NeCap package I bought and when I have time on my hands fill some with black tea. As for coffee, I prefer to buy from the Nespresso club.<br /><br />Summary: This is not a very well executed/designed product. The end result isn't up to the Nespresso standard. OK for Black India tea.
