I was very excited when my Husband ordered my favorite flowers for Valentine's Day. When I received the flowers none had bloomed yet so I thought that I would have them for at least a week or more. I followed the care instructions exactly but they still wilted and died within only a few short days. They also didn't open at the same time so it never looked like the picture at any point in time. I think next time I will order from a local florist so that I can actually get to see a beautiful bouquet like in the picture.
