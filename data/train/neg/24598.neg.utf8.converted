I haved used Fleischmann's yeast for over 30 years and was always happy with it until this year. My breads were inconsistant and the texture was coarse.  I tried a jar of Red Star yeast and what a differrence!  I now get a beautiful rise and flavor that reminds me of fresh baked breads and rolls from the bakery.  If you want the perfect loaf I suggest you use Red Star regular or their bread machine yeast, both are made by the SAF company, the other perfect yeast and all are available through Amazon at a great price!
