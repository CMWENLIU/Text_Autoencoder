I bought two of these gift towers because the product description says that they're certified Kosher.  If this is something that's important to you, you look for the certifying symbol on the product.  Two of the five products enclosed in the package, however, did not have the certifying symbol, meaning they are not -- for all practical purposes (like gift-giving)-- "certified kosher."  Buyer beware.
