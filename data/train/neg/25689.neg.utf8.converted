This bottled water tastes pretty much just like tap water to me. It has no funny or bitter taste to it. My husband, though, didn't like it at all. He thought it had a chemical taste to it. It is made of purified water to which calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate; magnesium sulphate; and sodium bicarbonate are added. I have a hard time believing all the health claims listed in the product description:<br /><br />"Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance. It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br /><br />It sounds like hype to me. If they can prove all this then I may consider purchasing this water in the future, but for now, I will pass.<br /><br />By the way, I did check out the company's website and they just list general claims of why good hydration is important and what electrolytes do. I could not find anywhere on their website where they site any studies to substantiate any health claims.  I'd like to see some 3rd party, unbiased, scientific studies on the matter.
