Although the intention may be good, unfortunately since this product is made from soy it hazardous to long term health.  Contrary to what many companies would have you believe soy is NOT a health food unless it is fermented (which is common in many asian cultures).  Once fermented it has many health benefits, but unfermented it can cause many health issues, can have negative hormonal effects and has been linked to cancer. I won't list all the research here, but there is a recent article mercola.com called "The Truth about Soy Foods" outlining the research.
