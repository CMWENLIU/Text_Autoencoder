Our family used this for years and even despite food allergies, we were able to use this. Now the formula has changed.<br />These ingredients are no longer listed on the label:<br />"Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder, Natural Vanilla"<br /><br />In their place you will now find:<br />"Natural Flavors"<br /><br />A call to the company and I was informed the flavors were a proprietary formula and they would not tell me what the ingredients were now.<br />Sadly, we are no longer able to use this product, as we do not eat anything we cannot know what the ingredients are "exactly".<br />I returned the unopened containers and advised my local grocer about this as well.
