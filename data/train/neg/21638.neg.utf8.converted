I buy and use "Wheat Grass Powder" from Amazing Grass. That product is superior, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. I happen to like the green vegetable juice taste many people do not like, so when I purchased this product I thought it would have the same green taste that goes very well in some diluted apple juice. I was wrong. Though it has excellent green ingredients, all of them organic, the taste is weird because they have included peppermint. The peppermint really takes away from the aromatic flavor of the grasses and introduces a minty aftertaste, kind of like brushing your teeth with a minty toothpaste and then drinking juice right after. Not too tasty. This product would be great if the peppermint was omitted. Buy their "Amazing Grass Organic Wheat Grass Powder, 30 Servings, 8.5-Ounce Container" and write to the company and tell them to get rid of the peppermint.
