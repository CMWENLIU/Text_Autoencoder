I have been a vegetarian for about 17 years and have really loved every other product by Amy's Kitchen that I tried, so I was horribly surprised when I tasted this soup.  The biggest thing I didn't like was how greasy it is; it has way too much oil for someone who is used to a low-fat diet.  Also, the amount of onion in the vegetable broth seems like an over-compensation for the lack of meat stock; it's overpowering.  To make matters worse, the other ingredients came off as soggy (and I did not overcook).  However, if you like oily broth and a lot of onion, you might like this soup.  But I will not be purchasing it again; fortunately for me I only bought a single can at the health-food store rather than buying in bulk online.
