I bought these for my brother last year and he LOVED them and asked for them again this Christmas.  They arrived today and there were no single oysters in the entire box.  There was a big clump that were all grown together and were impossible to try and open most were empty, but some have an oyster on either the one grown to the bottom or to the side - they were impossible to open.  I am beyond disappointed and am humiliated at the gift given my brother.  Last year's batch was wonderful - this year - beyond awful.<br /><br />Definitely won't order and make the mistake again.  Seriously, how do you send people oysters to someone when they are not singularly in the box?  I am so disappointed.  If he hadn't spent hours getting out the few he did, I would have told him to send them back.  So awful!!!!!!!
