I was trying to order Nonni's "Biscotti Dolce Ciocolati" and clicked on the iconic photo of the plastic tub of 25 individually wrapped biscotti (on the photo label on the tub is clearly printed "Dolce Cioccolati"). What I didn't notice was that the linked text to the right of the iconic photo identifies the item as "Nonni's Cioccolati Biscotti." The missing word is "Dolce" and it is an entirely different product.<br /><br />My first complaint is the "bait and switch" issue, and the other is that the product is carelessly packed so that almost all of the individually wrapped biscotti were broken, often in several pieces.<br /><br />Except for that, Nonni's Biscotti products are the best on the market, and I have tried all of them!<br /><br />Why do I suspect that Nonni's is trying to phase out the "Dolce Cioccolati" and perhaps even the plastic tubs of 25 pieces? All our local markets stock only Nonni's Biscotti in small rectangular packages in which the individual biscotti are smaller and more expensive.
