Well, it finally happened. After many, many years happily purchasing products from Amazon, I finally have a complaint. I got ripped off.<br /><br />As pointed out by the other reviews of this product, what is pictured in NOT what is being sold. I've never known Amazon to allow this type of shenanigans, much less silently consent to them after more than one customer complained.<br /><br />Yes, I received a completely different product than the one shown and described. This IS NOT Log Cabin syrup. It is a knock-off. The price seemed compelling -- and now I know why. Like the other reviewer wrote, "I should have read the other reviews first."<br /><br />I've become a bit complacent about that, frankly, because I've so completely learned to trust "my Amazon" to vet the products they sell. Heads up, Amazon, your "slip" is showing. I know you always intended to become the "Wal-Mart of the internet" . . . but don't ACTUALLY turn into them, okay?<br /><br />Sign me,<br /><br />A bit disillusioned
