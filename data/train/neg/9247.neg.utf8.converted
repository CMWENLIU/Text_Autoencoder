I ordered this because I love oat clusters and stuff like this for breakfast with some almond milk.  When I got it the first thing I did was read the ingredients and to my dismay, one of the things in this bag is Chickory Root extract.  :(  This is an ingredient that companies put into their products to bump the fiber content.  But in doing so it causes excess gas and bloating.  This is one of the key ingredients that I avoid when looking for healthy foods to buy.  I did taste the product and it is actually very good and if I didn't know it would upset my stomach I would really enjoy it.  I hope I can find something like this without Chickory root in it.  I would recommend it for the flavor if you don't care about that one ingredient.  (the same one used in all Fiber One products to make them so high in fiber)
