I have enjoyed Prince of Peace's Green and Oolong Teas and was going to order their White and Pu-erh Tea for that reason, but after reading about their shameful move to more than double their price simply because Dr. Oz has pointed out that these teas have health benefits, I won't be buying any more of their tea.  Shame, Shame on the makers of Prince of Peace!!!  You would have benefited far more had you left your price alone because the number of people buying your tea at $6.99 would have been far greater than the number that are able to pay $19.99 will be!
