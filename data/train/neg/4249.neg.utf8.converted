ive had kefir grains in the past and these were never solid.  there was not a clump that I could strain out to save for the next batch.  I tried working with it to make it work hoping they would "grow" so I could have a  grain to strain out.  this never happened.  when i wrote them about it they said i was past 90 days.  well i guess i shouldn't have spent so long trying to make it work.
