I bought saffron advertized on this page from "GourmetFoodStore" - its not good and we didn't like it.<br />When I bought it, they were selling it as "AlTaj" Crown brand saffron which is much better in quality IMO. What I got was "Harvest of saffron" - the one displayed on the page now.<br />I had to send many emails to get a reply, I filed a buyers claim but the seller kept delaying their response and finally amazon close the claim as time-out -- hello amazon , you should have checked with me first<br /><br />So my feedback in short<br /> - I didn't like this "Harvest of Saffron. IMO Al-Taj and Gathering of Saffron are much better brands<br /> - I didn't like the seller. So check other's reivew and feedback about seller before buying.
