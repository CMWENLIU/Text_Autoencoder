The item received is not the item that I ordered, nor the item advertised. They are advertising this as Spelt Sesame Sticks, when in fact I received Cheddar Sesame Sticks. This is not what I ordered, nor was it what I wanted. Also one of the bags was boken in the box.<br />And guess what, the item can not be returned. This is no way to run a business. Do not order this from these people.
