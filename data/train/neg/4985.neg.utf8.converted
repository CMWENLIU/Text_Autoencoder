The description does not describe how thick these bully sticks are but for the price paid I expected a thicker bully stick.  I have bought this brand of chew in the store as singles and that was the size that I was expecting because the price of those is about 3.50 and I thought it would be good value for 6 of them.  These sticks were really really thin and not worth it at all.  I would rather buy the singles.
