To be completely honest, at my house we did not like this shrimp at all ... nope, not at all (shudder). So I tried to send it over to my sister, but after she sampled it she said even her cat wouldn't eat it.  We thought about sending it to a food bank for homeless people but decided against that so as not to disappoint anyone there.  Never again, I swear, never again ... :(
