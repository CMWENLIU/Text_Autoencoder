This cereal has a very nice taste if you like blueberries.  It has huge blueberries and lots of crunch from the different kinds of cereal. I wasn't sure how I would like it when I ordered originally but I couldn't wait to eat more once I tried it. I actually looked forward to having my cereal in the mornings. This is one I will order again.<br /><br />Update 3-2012<br />I lowered my rating on this cereal because the last couple of times I've gotten it there have been fewer and fewer blueberries.  This time, there might have been 6 blueberries in the whole box.  I'm not sure how they can call it blueberry pomegranate anymore.  I won't be ordering it anymore.
