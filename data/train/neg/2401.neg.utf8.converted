Photo of the cake looks good and I was happy I can send a choco cake to someone really far away from me.<br /><br />I called store to make sure they can deliver item on time (about a week). I kept on checking the delivery tracking because I was concerned it might not arrive on time. It did not arrive on time. In fact it didnt arrive at all. Very very disappointed. I ended up sending a gift card.
