This item was purchased and shipped out by Amazon and not a third party company.  I am very disappointed to get this in June 2011 to find out that the expiration listed on the box is Oct 2011.  That is in 4 months.  Truly disappointed in Amazon for selling a product with a short expiration date.  So if you are going to buy in bulk make sure to eat it up quickly because it may be short dated.  But other than that, it is DAMN yummy!
