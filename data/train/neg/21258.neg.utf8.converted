I love almond milk and I always buy the unsweetend variety.  I've tried almond dream twice and both my husband and I dislike it.  We couldn't even finish the carton and I had to call the company to complain about the product so I could get my money back! It taste like they simply added almond flavor (like what you bake with) to water and then are selling it as almond milk!  I recomend you buy almond breeze or Pacific organic almond milk which both taste amazing!
