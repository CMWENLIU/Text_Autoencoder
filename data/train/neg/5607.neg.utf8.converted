I loved Root Beer Fizzies as a kid. I bought some of these Fizzies because I wanted my kids to have the "Fizzies" experience.<br /><br />I know the Fizzies of old weren't great. That wasn't the point. They were fun entertainment. They were basically Root Beer flavored Alka Seltzer (without the aspirin). But they were drinkable.<br /><br />When I got these, my kids were excited. I opened one up. The packaging was similar to what I remembered. The Fizzie was about the same size. When I put it into the water it did its Fizzie thing. It even smelled like the old Root Beer Fizzies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't taste like the Fizzies of old. There is no sugar in these. It uses Sorbital instead. I guess that makes these mom friendly. However, they don't taste very good.  In fact, they are pretty bad.<br /><br />Again, the old Fizzies weren't great. The fun was in the "making" of the Fizzies. But at least the old Fizzies where sort of drinkable. These aren't. I wouldn't recommend the "New" Fizzies unless you want your childhood memories destroyed.
