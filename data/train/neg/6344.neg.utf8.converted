As stated before, these are the most amazing jalapeno chips that money can buy.  The aroma, texture, flavor, and heat factors are all there in spades.  But, don't buy them here, as the price plus shipping is an absolute rip off.  The Tim's website is the best place to get these chips if you live outside the Pacific Northwest where these snacks are made.
