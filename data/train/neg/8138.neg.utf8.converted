I ordered a number of candies for a Christmas present and many were short dated or out of date. The curlywurlys are dated 11 2011 so were out of date when they arrived.<br />The Crunchies are dated 01 2012. I received them in 12/2011. The person I am getting these for will not eat anything out of marked date. Looking at the reviews I see I am not the first to report receiving old candy from them. One of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Mint Crisp had its wrapper mostly off and the foil was broken.<br />The company did agree to refund the Curlywurlys but not the Crunchies or Dairy Milk so poor customer service as well as poor inventory control. I would not purchase from them again.
