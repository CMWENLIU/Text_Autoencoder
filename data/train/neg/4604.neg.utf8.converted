I am on the bandwagon now of believing that coconuts along with products derived from them as being healthy. The problem is that is expensive to keep up a regular supply of coconut oil; this product was cheaper than our local health food store, though. The box arrived with oil stains on one side; it had leaked out from the packaging, so that was disappointing. It is also messy to pour it out of the very wide-mouthed container; it usually drips onto the outside of the canister. I must say that I will be sticking with extra-virgin olive oil and canola oil until the price goes down on coconut oil and more user-friendly packinging is available.
