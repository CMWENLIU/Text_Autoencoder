I'm in the camp that thinks this tastes like kool-aid mixed with cough syrup.  Even worse it has a kind of metallic edge to it.  Put too little in and you get no flavor, just the aftertaste, put too much in and you get cough syrup.<br /><br />If they can make gummy worms with vitamins, why can't they make a drink with vitamins?  YummY Gummy worms!<br /><br />I would not drink this again.  I would not, could not.
