I love bacon however, BIGS Bacon Salt Sizzlin' Bacon Sunflower Seeds, taste nothing like bacon. If anything, they taste more like sucking on a beef boullion cube. I shared the BIGS Bacon Salt Sizzlin' Bacon Sunflower Seeds with other people and they agreed the BIGS Bacon Salt Sizzlin' Bacon Sunflower Seeds doesn't even come close to the taste of bacon. In my opinion BIGS has a good line of flavored sunflower seeds, but failed in the bacon flavor department.
