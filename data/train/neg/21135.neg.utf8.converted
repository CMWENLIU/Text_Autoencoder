I have used World's Greatest Litter for a couple years, and saw this on the shelves.  So I decided to try it.  Here was the result:<br /><br />1.  Swheat Scoop is cheaper than World's Greatest<br /><br />2.  Swheat Scoop is more fun to say.<br /><br />3.  Swheat Scoop is less dusty than World's Greatest<br /><br />Now for the bad part:<br /><br />1.  I am very allergic to the dust Swheat Scoop causes<br /><br />2.  The clumping sticks like glue to the bottom of the box, no matter how deep I filled it.<br /><br />3.  The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.<br /><br />4.  The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.<br /><br />5.  The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more.  Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.<br /><br />So overall, I am not impressed.  Your mileage may vary.
