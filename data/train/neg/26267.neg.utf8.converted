I bought this particular soup because I'd tasted and enjoyed [very much] the black bean and split pea soup.  This one was a disappointment.  It was a little too watery, which I suppose could be solved by not adding the required amount of water, but I didn't care for the taste either.  It was bland and the texture was too hard.  The little bits of vegetable were too hard even after soaking longer than required.
