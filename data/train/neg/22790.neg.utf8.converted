When I ordered this item, I decided to be optimistic despite all of the comments about the "variety" received.  However, I  should have listened.  When I received the "package" it was 35 k-cups just thrown into a paper bag and they have a dusty/grimy feeling to all of the cups as if they have been sitting around on a dirty shelf.  As for the "variety" of k-cups I received 6 spicy eggnog, 6 gingerbread, 6 butter toffee, 6 supreme french vanilla, 6 southern pecan, 3 chocolate glazed donut, 1 golden french toast, and 1 mocha nut fudge!  To say the least I felt like they were just trying to get rid of the winter flavors (both of which I do not care for but now stuck with).  I will take my business elsewhere next time I want a true variety pack.
