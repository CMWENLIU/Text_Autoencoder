I had pretty high hopes for this considering how many people were saying this is a strong cuppa with lots of flavor.<br /><br />While it's better than all of the senseo pods or other mass marketed ones, it doesn't match up to the rich cup of joe from the Baronet Small Village blend pods.<br /><br />Also, the flavor from these is pretty cardboard-like and one dimensional.<br /><br />It's a cup of coffee. It does the job. But it's not something I'd buy again.
