I've got this herb a month ago and checked it for a smell - there was some (not very sharp) when rubbed between fingers. I'd poured a week's worth of use, and close the rest of package tightly, but smell/taste is gone by now completely. I don't know why is it - I have used herbs for a long time, never had this experience. It is dissappointing - it was too good to be true thing.
