I opened the box and discovered that the inner bag of matcha powder was opened and spilling all over.  It was a huge mess.  I called the customer service at SerendipiTea and left a message for them to call me back.  Didn't hear from them.  Called them again later in the week and left a message asking if the inner bag was supposed to be sealed and if I should be concerned that it was opened.  Never heard back from them.  I know that this stuff is hand packed and all, but if it is packaged so that the tea won't stay in the bag...
