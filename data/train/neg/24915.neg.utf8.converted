Back in Germany I would buy organic sunflower oil from Rapunzel or another brand, but now in the USA, I am having a big problem to find an appropriate oil for the autumn months.<br /><br />In a local health food store 3 years ago I actually found Rapunzel Sunflower Oil, and I bought every single bottle they had. But last year I ran out, and the problem began anew. What to cook with potatoe dishes now?<br /><br />Then I saw this offer, and since I know their nut oils are really of good quality (yes really, no sarcasm here), I trusted them and ordered this set of 4 cans. Another reviewer mentioned the cute tins, but hey, what good are cute tins if the product does not keep what the ad promised???<br /><br />OK, maybe it was my own fault to assume the term "organic" must automatically mean "unrefined". Stupid me, I really did assume that! But this oil is refined!<br /><br />It has no taste nor aroma at all! It is just like all other refined industrial oils ("cooking oil") from any american supermarket, only more expensive. I felt betrayed here.<br /><br />I didn't return it, as there was nothing technically wrong with it. I mean, there was nothing spoilt or broken, so I just used the tins up during the autumn and winter.<br /><br />But I will absolutely not order this again, as "organic" is not good enough! It must be "unrefined", and that it is not.
