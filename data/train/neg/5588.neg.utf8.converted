This is the first kit that I've had trouble with.  I love the herb kits in general.  I think I was able to get about 8 - 10 tomatoes TOTAL out of the entire life of these 3 plants.  I followed all directions, manually pollinated by shaking hand over bushes daily, etc.  The plants seemed to grow fine but produced very little fruit.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews that say this is not a good choice for the AeroGarden.
