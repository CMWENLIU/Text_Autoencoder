I am a sugar free, fat free, low calorie junkie!  I have probably tried and loved many low calorie products in the market, which is why I was so excited for calorie free marshmellow dip.  I had planned on making low calorie smores, rice krispy treats and a great sugar free hot chocolate.<br />Well as soon as I opened the product the consistancy bothered me, it wasnt anywhere near gooey or marshmellow like.<br />Then came the taste, it was like chemical plastic! I took one spoonful and immediatly felt like I wanted to be sick.  The taste is horrible and the consistency is even worse!<br />Skip this product until Walden farms can reformulate!<br />(Their Fruit spreads and strawberry syrups are good though)
