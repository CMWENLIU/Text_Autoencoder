I initially had my first Trio Bar this summer given to me by a friend in Colorado.  He said that he gets them at Costco.  The bar he gave me was about twice the size of these bars, the 1.2 oz size, I got from Amazon.  I didn't notice the difference until I got the box and saw the "mini" bars.  Doom on me.  So now I paid quite a bit per bar for mini bars.  The second factor, like some others have written, is that the bar seems stale and very brittle.  I haven't looked at the box to see the "consume by" date, but what do you expect from a Chinese food product.  Needless to say, initially I was excited about this bar, but the price, staleness, and Chinese-ness of it will keep me looking...  How can an organic, American company find it acceptable to have their product made in China?
