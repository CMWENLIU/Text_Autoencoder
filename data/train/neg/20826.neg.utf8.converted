Why can't I give this a negative amount of stars???<br /><br />I love these cookies and have bought them from Amazon before. The expiration date was always just a few months away--but I love them and had no problem eating all six packages in a short time.<br /><br />This time, I got my shipment May 2009 and the cookies all had a "best used by March 09" date on them. So....Amazon has now sunk to shipping goods past their expiration date. I haven't eaten any of them yet---I kind of turned off by the idea they are two month beyond the date they should be taken off the shelf.<br /><br />I will  never buy these from Amazon again unless Amazon can assure me the product will be fresh.
