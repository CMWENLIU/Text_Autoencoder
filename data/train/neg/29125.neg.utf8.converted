The description on this page as of 1/2/2010 state 100% natural honey but the ingredients actually say "Honey & Sugar" when I received the product.  I can't comment on the taste because I basically had it returned because of the added sugar factor.  Perhaps they need to improve their description on their products.  I am basically rating the description versus the actual product with this review and to notify others that this isn't just honey but a honey and sugar combination.
