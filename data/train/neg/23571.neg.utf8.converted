I figured "Jet Fuel," that's perfect!  Expecting a really bold and full-flavored coffee but got instead a highly acidic and poor tasting brew.  I don't recommend this one unless you're used to drinking coffee in the office that was brewed a couple of hours ago, as that's pretty much how I feel it tastes.
