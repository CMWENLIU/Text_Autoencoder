The product description misleads you into believing that these are microwavable single serving cups when in fact they are packaged in individual pouches and need a bowl to be put in. I ordered this because the convenience individually packaged cups would of provided while being deployed in afghanistan, where bowls and time for washing dishes are rare, but i was sadly disappointed.
