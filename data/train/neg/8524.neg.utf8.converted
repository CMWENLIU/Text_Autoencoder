I should have read the one star review first and then Googled it to verify. Normally I do, but this time I just bought it on a whim. I was hoping for just ground up vanilla bean, but this is all sugar. Actual vanilla bean is the 2nd to last ingredient. Really not thrilled and I wish I could send it back.
