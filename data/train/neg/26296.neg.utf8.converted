Ordered the 12 count biscuit mix with Amazon Prime.  Not only did it not come in 2 days, it took 8 days.  Then, when it did arrive, the case had cheese biscuit mix on the outside and had been opened and then retaped.  Inside was 1, yes one bag of biscuit mix and 11 cheese mixes.  Unbelievable. Beware, as food items are not returnable according to Amazon.  This is the 4th unpleasant transaction with Amazon in 2 weeks.  What is going on at Amazon?????? I'm afraid to order the biscuit mix again...who knows what I will get!
