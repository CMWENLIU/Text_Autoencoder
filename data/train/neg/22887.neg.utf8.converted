I gave this two stars only because the shipping was on time and in the end Amazon refunded my money.  First let me say that we eat sugar free candy all the time.  I'm a big fan of nearly any sugar free black licorice! My point in saying this is that we are not unfamilar with the possible known side effects of sugar free candy and some of the artificial sweeteners that are used in them.  I have only ever had an issue with any of them when I over consume them, which most products tell you right on the package not to do so.  These gummy bears however are something very very different from anything we have ever tried, we've even had other brands of sugar free gummy bears without the problems I'm about to describe.  We are a family of five, none of us consume refined sugar, so when we get the craving for candy we opt for sugar free.  Always cautious when trying new sugar free foods all five of us sat down and enjoyed what we believed to be a serving.  Bare in mind there is no serving size on the actual package.  I assumed somewhere between 8-15 gummy bears would be a normal size serving.  We decided to have 15 bears each.  It seemed after about 30 minutes my poor husband reacted first, follwed by each of our children and later myself.  I won't get into all the gory details, but we only have two bathrooms, and if you recall I said five of us ate the gummy bears so I'll let you infer from that what you will, but I think you get the point.  This was a Friday evening, four of us were pretty much back to normal by Saturday morning, but my husband required until late Saturday evening to feel like it was out of his system.  When all was said and done they went up on a shelf for a few days and no one thought much more about them.  Well...a glutton for punishment we tried them again...yes all five of us, as if we didn't know better!  But here was this five pound bag of gummy bears just sitting there and we all wanted something sweet.  We thought that perhaps the issue we had was attributed to having eaten them on an empty stomach the first time around.  NOOOOPE, this time each of us had about 12 gummy bears and 30 minutes later sure enough the results were in...the gummy bears are a no go for this family.  I wondered if maybe the candy had expired, I was unable to find a date on the bag and they were a little harder than I had expected.  I contacted Amazon about a refund, which they did promptly provide and I tossed the gummy bears in the trash.  On a funny side note, my kids now call these things the "diarrhea bears", I mean you have to laugh, we were stupid enough to try them twice!  Also something to know, if you are still brave enough to try these, you might want to know that the first ingredient is Hydrogenated Glugose syrup (Lycasin).  I've never had this before, and since I consider anything "Hydrogenated" to be bad I won't be buying anything like it ever again.
