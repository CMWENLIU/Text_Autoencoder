I paid $7.70 for ONE box. I thought for sure for that price, there would be way more than one. You can get the exact same thing in the grocery store, for less than a dollar. I just cannot believe they charged that much for one box. I was expecting 1 whole package/box of them. At least 8-10 individual ones. Guess that will teach me. So disapointed.
