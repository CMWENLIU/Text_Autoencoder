Canidae has changed their formula and it is also now being made by the Diamond pet food company.  Do your research...many, many users of this new formula have dealt with very sick dogs.  There is nothing on the packaging that states "new formula".  I noticed a change when I opened the package...different color of kibble.  I checked the ingredients llisted on the back and compared to an outdated brochure from the company.  I thought that the new formula would be OK.  I haven't had the severity of problems that others have had, but after reading several postings at different sites, I susupect that the changes I have observed in my senior golden in the last month or so has to be the food!  Time will tell..she gets homemade food tomorrow.
