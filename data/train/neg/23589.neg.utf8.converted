I don't know what happened to my macarons, but they smelled and tasted slightly of moth balls.  I usually buy macarons from a Korean bakery in downtown L.A., but wanted to try "real" French ones.  I'm pretty sure this isn't what they are supposed to taste like.  Even the frozen ones from Trader Joe's have better flavor than these ones.  The only one that had any discernible flavor was the strawberry, and that was because of the strawberry jam filling.  Also, they look so beautiful in the picture, but mine were all jumbled up in the box, and some were even crushed.  Could be a shipping problem, but the FedEx box was intact.
