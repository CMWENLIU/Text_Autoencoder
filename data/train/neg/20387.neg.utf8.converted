I ordered 1 lb. of 100% Jamaican coffee beans and they are not even close to being Jamaican. The taste is bitter and the aftertaste is also bitter. People do know what an excellent cup of coffee tastes like. These beans were probably bought at a local grocery store and transferred to one saying "100% Jamaican". Nice try. I will never buy from you again. But then you don't care, you already took me for $39.99.<br /><br />  dennis
