I bought this product based on the glowing reviews it received.  The only positive thing I can offer is that my Bernese enjoys the taste.  However, every time I have given him one he throws up--which is enough for me to have no choice but to give this a 1 out of 5 stars.  This has happened each of the three times I tried to give him one, and the vomiting occurs within 10 minutes of him eating it.
