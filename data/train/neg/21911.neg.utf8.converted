These are some of the best tasting canned tomatoes you can buy. But why would I buy a case of these @ almost $5/can when I can get individual cans (without having to store an apocalyptic number of them) from FreshDirect for $3.50/can. And be assured, if FD is selling them for that amount, your local midrange grocery store will have them for less. This is NOT a bulk deal.
