We like the vanilla and chocolate and usually like strawberry milk we purchase at the supermarket but this had too strange a flavor. I find Organic Valley's "competitor" on Amazon has a little better flavors in their brand.  This being said...we do like the chocolate flavor the best in Organic Valley.
