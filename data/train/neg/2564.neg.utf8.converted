I buy these bars at Whole Foods all the time but saw them on Amazon for about $5 cheaper and thought "what a deal!"  The bars were covered in a white film and tasted stale.  I could not finish the bar.  I won't be purchasing these from Amazon again!  I guess if it sounds too good to be true, it is.
