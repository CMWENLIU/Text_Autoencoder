Not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. Quick and easy, yes. The cheese sauce tastes like you expect instant mac-and-cheese (i.e. the blue box) to taste; if you like that (which I do), it's good. The pasta is adequately al dente after microwaving... but the "hamburger"? Little brown styrofoam pellets. Next time, I'm sticking with the plain mac-and-cheese singles, and I'll make my HH cheesy burger at home with real meat.
