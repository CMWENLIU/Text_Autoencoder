I also have had real problems with some of these cups. Most work fine, but occasionally (one time out of ten?) the machine cannot push water through the cup. It drip, drip, drips out and finally quits after maybe half a cup of coffee is in the cup.  I have two NEW keurigs, one at the office and both have this problem (they are different models, sorry I can't recall which)<br />This is a mess, since I really love the taste, but I think their quality control may need some work.  If you don't mind an occasional "dud" they make good coffee.
