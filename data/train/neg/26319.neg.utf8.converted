This is, most likely, the worst deodorant ever made. There is no way to make this product any worse unless it makes your break out into a rash or poisons you. The "protection" and I use that term loosely, that this deodorant gives is minimal. I'm not a really active person, nor am I overweight, and yet this fails to mask odor for a few hours, let alone a whole day. On top of this all there is the actual smell of the deodorant itself. It's horrendous. When you apply this deodorant your nose will slightly burn and your eyes will almost water. It's hilarious that their commercials revolve around attracting the opposite sex, when the smell of this would send any female running. I'm not joking when I say this but, I'd rather smell like body odor than smell like AXE deodorant. The few days I wore it, I became completely self-conscious about raising my arms because it smelled so bad and offered almost no protection.<br /><br />Buy Gillette Clear Gel and stay away from this trash.
