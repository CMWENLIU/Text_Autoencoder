I love Cashew nuts and spicy foods, so I thought this would be a good combination.  Unfortunately, the nuts were too salty for my taste.  I have tried other snacks with Sea Salt that I found enjoyable, but I cannot recommend this product.  I will wash the seasonings off of these Cashews and  add them to a spicy soup.
