I love white chocolate. But I have to say, that they should put in the description that the insides of these are not the same as the insides of the regular milk or dark chocolate godiva. Most of them have RASPBERRY OR STRAWBERRY filling. I dont like raspberry or strawberry. I would have much preferred the regular chocolate filling, or caramel/nut filling they have in the milk and dark chocolate pieces.
