When you open the box you'll find 100 tea bags- not individually wrapped, not with tags and strings, but just plain tea bags. When you make a cup of tea the way you normally make a cup of white tea, you'll get a darker color and a stronger flavor than you're probably accustomed to. Yes, it's white tea, and yes it's organic, but unless you're really watching your pennies, you easily can find better white tea.
