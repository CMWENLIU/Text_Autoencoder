I bought this Shilajit thinking it was such a great deal-- wow over 2 pounds for less than 50 dollars!<br />Well we have bought Shilajit before and this is not the real deal!  Its so bad- it tastes actually rancid-- It dosn't act  or taste like real Shilajit either-- real shilajit bunches up together -its first comes in a rock form- and if you grind up that rock it will be a powder- but it will come back together in a solid mass form once again after it has been powdered-- even if you buy capsules of it -if you open the caps you will find it has become solid- this so-called Shilajit is like rancid old flour- with some very bitter thing  added-- IT gave my son a headache!  When I asked them for a refund he flat out refused - bogus product -bogus company!
