I am Russian and was looking for the traditional russian buckwheat. These look right at the first glance, but nothing like what I expected when cooked - the kasha comes out almost a mashed potato like consistency, with most of the groats sticking together and tasting nothing like a normal buckwheat kasha. Perhaps the groats are somewhat polished and their skins are partially missing, resulting it faster cooking time and lumping together? I have not tried the Belarussian advice of toasting it for extra 2-3 minutes, but if that does not work, I'll have to throw it all away :-(
