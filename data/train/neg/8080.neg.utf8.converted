The taste is pretty good, but according to what i have read about canned coconut water, the liquid is pasteurized to a point where all the good stuff - like potassium, magnesium, vitamins- are basically vaporized.<br />Only the tetra packaged coconut waters are able to retain the nutrients as the coconut water is only flash pasteurized.<br />So if you're looking for ok taste, this drink is for you. However if you are looking for good taste and nutritious coconut water, go for one of the tetra pak versions.
