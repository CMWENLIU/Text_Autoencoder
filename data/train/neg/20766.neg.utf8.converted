After applying to the perimeter of the yard, squirrels were walking through the granules in about 15 minutes.  That night, the raccoons were back.  We put some into a small dish, placed it about 2 feet below the birdfeeder, and within minutes, the birds were there (which we wanted, but still) and later that night, the raccoons emptied the birdfeeder.<br />I wasted $30, and since I used it all, I can't seem to return it.<br />Very Very FRUSTRATED.  I think the 5 star reviews MUST be from people associated with the company that makes this product.  Don't be fooled into thinking this stuff is any good.
