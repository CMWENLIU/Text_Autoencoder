I've been using Emergen-C for years. It's one of my favorite products - a really wonderful pick-me-up in the late afternoon. I swear by the stuff. Unfortunately, like so many companies that can't leave a good product alone, they have ruined it by changing it to "New Improved Flavor!". The new flavor is absolutely HORRIBLE. I can barely swallow the stuff. I actually needed a water chaser. I don't know why companies always feel the need to "new and improve" products that they know sell well. The new flavor is overpowering and has an artificial aftertaste that lasts for at least half an hour. I am so sad about this because it's a long-time favorite and I will not be buying it any more because it's nearly impossible for me to swallow, even with my nose plugged. I wish they would bring back the old flavor, which had a less harsh, real raspberry flavor.
