I've been enjoying Jet Fuel for 18 months now - and mostly enjoy the other flavors from the Coffee People - but in the last 2 weeks the prices have skyrocketd (up $5 a box), and most of these are no longer available for subscribe and save (another $3-4 increase).  Gives me a pause to whether this k-cup thing is even worth it.  The good cups went from 35 cents a cup or so, to now over 50 CENTS!
