This salmon would be most appealing to those who like a strong salty taste.  Normally, such as taste would also come with a wood fire taste/smell.  Not here: this fish is a combination of heavy salt and a very light smoke.  It comes packaged in a brine and it has a briney flavor to it.  If you like a heavy smoke taste or conversely a fresh fish taste avoid this product.<br /><br />I give it a subjective 1 star.  Some people might like it but I found that the salt taste obscured all else and left a distinctive salty aftertaste.
