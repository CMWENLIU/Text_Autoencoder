I was dismayed to find the "King Size" Snickers bars are now two small pieces with an anemic layer of chocolate, and half the flavor of the former King Size Snickers bar.  Always bought the king size; the chocolate was thicker and the whole thing just had more flavor, because it was loaded with peanuts and caramel. Really felt like you got your money's worth, which is becoming increasingly rare. Unfortunately, it appears Snickers has jumped on the bandwagon of charging more for less, and now is trying to pass off an inferior item as a "king size" candy bar, hoping the customers will play along. Another terrific product bites the dust.
