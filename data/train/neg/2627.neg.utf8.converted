Picture a straight stick, lopped off at the top, with a few bare branches a few tiny bits of green, and you have this "bonsai" plant. Very well packed, but pathetic when unpacked, the only resemblance to the photos on the Amazon page would be the pot, which is identical. We received this as sympathy gift after death in family. Hard to imagine a more absurd item. Noted this to the sender, who apparently complained and got a second sent, very similar to the first. Deceptive photo, this item needs a strong disclaimer against use as a gift.
