These noodles have a weird texture that takes some getting used to, and they have no flavor whatsoever. They are best used in asian type dishes. I wouldn't recommend tomato, or cream based sauces, they do not work very well with that. Overall, they really shouldn't be used in most cases to replace pasta in a dish, but if you are just looking for something to fill you up with few calories this is a good food to get.
