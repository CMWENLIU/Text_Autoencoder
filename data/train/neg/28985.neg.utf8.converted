I got this for my 22 lb shih tzu who is pretty good at figuring things out. He is totally disinterested in this toy (which I bought at retail for $20). He doesn't find the treat at all appealing and because the flaps seem rather stiff, his kibble doesn't come out. He has a cube that I fill with kibble that he rolls all over the house and he just loves that--but this doesn't do it for him.<br />$20 would have paid for a lot of treats!!
