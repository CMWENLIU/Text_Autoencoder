How can any coffee (latte) with the primary ingredients of sugar and non dairy creamer which is actually hydrogenated oil be marketed as healthy? In order to have a therapeutic dosage of ganoderma (lingzhi), the shell of the spore must be broken and you have to have well over 10g of the lingzhi (ganoderma) based upon the person's weight and condition to be effective. Nice tasting coffee, but not a healthy coffee. You would do better going to get some Folgers and keep the money in your pocket.
