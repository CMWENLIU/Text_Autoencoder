I purchase Florida's Natural apple juice base on the review that if was a Natural Juice, no water, just pressed apples. I was so surprise when I open the box and unwrap the plastic around the bottles.  On the front of the bottle, above the label it say, Contains Concentrate from Argentina. The label ingredients say: Water, Concentrated Apple Juice, Ascorbic Acid (vitaminC.) This juice taste like vinegar water. The expiration date is May of 2012.  I will not buy this juice again.
