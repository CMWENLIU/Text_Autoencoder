Beef might be listed as the first ingredient but that hardly makes it the main ingredient.  After reading the ingredients list this "food" seems to be mostly made up of various forms of soy.  I am not a fan of soy & with all the GMO crap being pushed on us, I like it even less.<br /><br />Upon presenting this artificially flavored & dyed product to my fur babies, they started to eat up.  But then one by one they stopped & looked at me as if to say, "What is this crap?  We don't want this.  Where's the stuff you normally give us?"  I left the food for them.  Several hours later, the food was still in the bowl & a disgusting explosion of black runny vomit was all over everything.  Jerk that I am, I continued to try to get them to eat it.  After all, I have a review to do - that's how I ended up with the food in the first place.  After several days I gave up.  One of my babies simply stopped eating.  That was the final straw.  I am not torturing my pets any longer.  They are back on their usual grub. No more black vomit.  Everyone is once again eating until the bowls are empty & my furbabies are back to their joyful behavior.
