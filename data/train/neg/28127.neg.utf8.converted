The item pictured is NOT what you will receive. I got 8 tiny cheese blocks rather than the 4 larger ones pictured. Only 3 flavors rather than 4. Then there is the sausages...3 of the same flavor rather than 3 different flavors and they were all different brands and sizes. Not to mention its not in the nice package shown. They were literally thrown in a plain cardboard box! I sent these back as I would have been ashamed to give them as a gift. Amazon really needs to check up on its outside vendors!
