I have been drinking Good Earth green tea with lemongrass for years.  I've always loved the special taste of it.  BUT I have to say, I'm very disappointed in the new/latest<br />Good Earth green tea.  I tastes like flowers, of some sort.  I am not a fan and I am stuck with 6 boxes of 20. UGH!  I wish I knew in advance they changed<br />the flavor of the tea.  I do not recommend trying.  It is not at all like the previous tea.
