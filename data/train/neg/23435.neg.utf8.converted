So I bought a pack of ten cans of smoked eel fillets. I still have nine cans left. If anyone wants to buy them, make me an offer. They are OK. Taste like smoked herring, smoked trout or any other type of canned smoked fish. A bit mushy and not very interesting. Not much flavor and looks unattractive when put on a plate.
