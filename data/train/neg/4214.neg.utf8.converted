Again, I had a problem with the product leaking ---  Both my original and replacement order. The manufacturer's packaging simply does not protect the contents enough. The box soaked through and this time, one of the top faces just tore right off because it was so damp.<br /><br />When I buy other liquids from Amazon such as the "Zola Acai drink"<br />([...]), the plastic containers are better equipped to sustain the shipping process unlike these coconut water cartons.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vita Coco's coconut water products. The taste is light, refreshing and hardly sweet at all. And yes, it is thirst-quenching. However, I do not recommend this larger packaging size. The other tetra packaging for the smaller individual cartons is better equipped for impact. Since I lost much of the drink from the leakage on both orders, I cannot give a high rating. However, I will give credit where credit is due and Amazon has been prompt to respond to my concerns.
