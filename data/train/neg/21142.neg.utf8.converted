I like to take good care of my cats -- I feed them organic food and I don't like the dust from regular kitty liter getting in their lungs so I tried this.  I found it to be terrible!  It doesn't clump at all -- just turns to a globby mess and it seems to hold the odor.  I think I'm even going to have to replace the litter boxes entirely because I can't really get them clean after using this just once.  I would love to find something natural but this just doesn't work at all.
