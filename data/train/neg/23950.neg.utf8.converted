I saw all the great reviews on this item and decided to try it out myself.  I couldn't wait to cook up some jerk chicken for my friends.<br /><br />However, I was very disappointed when with the final product.  The paste itself was very salty and VERY VERY vinegary.  I thought cooking will mellow it out. It didn't.  I will not buy or even use this again.  The taste and the sharp scent of vinegar overpowers the other spices and the flavor of the meat.
