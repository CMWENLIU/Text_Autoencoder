I don't know why in the world they do this, but once again the inadequate packaging resulted in the bottom half of the box with broken shells.  Crushed to oblivion to be exact.  They are replacing them no problem, but really, people, just package them better and you won't have to replace them!  UPDATE:  Just got my replacement and once again tons of broken shells.  Aggravated!  No fragile marking whatsoever and just thrown into the box.  Idiots win
