It is against girl scout national policy to sell girl scout cookies online or through other retail channels.  I would suggest that if anyone is looking for cookies here that they should support their neighborhood girl scout instead.  Please buy from girls who are working hard to fulfill their goals and are following the rules.  The rules are there to make it fair for all girls.
