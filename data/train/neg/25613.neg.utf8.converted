I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621
