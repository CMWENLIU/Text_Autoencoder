My dog loves these chews; unlike the Cheweez he enjoys these are a nice - albeit more expensive - alternative to freshen his breath.<br /><br />That being said, I have a 16-pound Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and would not recommend anyone purchasing the Petite chews, even for smaller dogs.  They are so small and stick-like that I would be concerned to have my dog eat these without supervision to avoid choking issues.  Not to mention, they were gone within two minutes.<br /><br />Go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K6I">C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews, Medium-Size Dogs, 30 Chews</a> instead.  They are rectangular and shaped more like flatbread chips instead of beef jerky.  Additionally, they are larger and will last much longer for your dog.
