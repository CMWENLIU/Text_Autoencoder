The description says "no sugar added" but the ingredients are listed as follows:  Ingredients:<br />Whole milk, cream, nonfat milk solids, SUGAR, guar gum, carrageenan, chocolate syrup (HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, water, cocoa processed with alkali, xanthan gum, SUGER, salt), vanilla, strawberry juice, natural and artificial flavors. (Pasteurized/Homogenized).<br /><br />Maybe they mean no sugar added after it is made!
