What is the point of this product? What genius invented it?<br />Actual bacon is healthier than what goes into this product! Yuch.<br /><br />Defatted Soy Flour, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Water, Salt, Sugar, Artificial and Natural Flavor, Red 40 and Other Color Added, Soy Sauce (Water, Wheat, Soybeans, Salt), Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Corn, Soy, Wheat).<br /><br />Soy is not particularly healthy and for men can actually act as the female hormone estrogen. Eat too much and you'll develop man-breasts!<br />Hydrogenated oil is a carcinogen.<br />Sugar is poison.<br />Artificial flavor and colors aren't food, it's chemicals.<br />Hydrolyzed foods are not food.<br /><br />Pure fatty bacon is far healthier in moderation. This is a stupid product consumed only by those who don't look at ingredients and think.
