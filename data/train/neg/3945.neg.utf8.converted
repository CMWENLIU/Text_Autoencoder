This isn't at all what I had hoped for. I absolutely love pretty much everything "pumpkin flavored," but this missed the mark. I was hoping for a flavor similar to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte, but this isn't even close and I've honestly produced better flavor just using sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves in my latte. I appreciate other coffee shops' pumpkin lattes, so if this had tasted good, I could have gotten over the fact that it was different from Starbucks', but I just plain don't like it. I think the spice is too heavy--I'm not sure exactly what spices were used in creating this, but based on pumpkin dessert recipes I've made it seems like maybe there is too much allspice? I have a feeling this is going to wind up down the kitchen sink drain :/
