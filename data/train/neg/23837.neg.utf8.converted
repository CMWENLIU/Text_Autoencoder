This product could have been much better (and healthier). When I bought these chips, I was looking for something healthy to snack on. Unfortunately, the product had tons of corn syrup and cane sugar. It tastes like candy or breakfast cereals like Captain Crunch.<br /><br />Too bad I now have 11 bags of the chips to get rid of.
