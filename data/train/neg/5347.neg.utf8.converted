I bought 4 bags because of the good review.<br />I love coffee and have been a coffee drinker for 30+ years.<br />High expectation which met with very disappointing result.<br />I find this coffee very weak in smell and taste.<br />Folgers easily beats it and far far inferior to Blue Mountain Brand.<br />Now, I got stuck with 4 bags! Don't buy.
