The picture shows pecans in a package that clearly says chopped. These are NOT chopped. They are powder. I was going to make pecans pies with these and am now stuck with a 30 pound box of pulverized pecans. In the heading it says mealy pecans and is followed by the word chopped. They are way past chopped. They also arrived in bulk which again the picture was deceiving as it shows the pecans neatly in bags. I am so disappointed in my purchase.
