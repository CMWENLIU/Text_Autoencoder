(updated) I have the K-Cup brewer at http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-Powered-Brewing-Technology/dp/B003XPHG06 and this is the third box of K-Cups I've purchased.<br /><br />I have some from prior boxes but this Timothy cup at the end of the cycle explodes and sends grounds flying all over.  It looks like the cover is slightly thinner than the Donut Shop cups which leads to the failure.<br /><br />-> It looks like the K-Cup technology isn't quite there to me.<br />Bob<br /><br />UPDATE.  Called Green Mountain and they were nice enough to ask for the product details such as codes that tell about where and when this box product was made but could not replace the product.<br />Called Amazon and Amazon issued a full refund which is very nice but does not address my concerns about how to be sure the next batch is going to function correctly.
