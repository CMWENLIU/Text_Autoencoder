I'm giving this 2 stars because possibly this is just not to my liking for my taste buds.<br />I do not like my coffee with this kind of biting almost citric after taste.  It simply gives me sour stomach and my stomach doesn't get that way easily.<br />I enjoy a strong cup of hearty bold flavor once in a while, but this is too biting for me.  Adding sugar? No help.  It also seems watery. I try to focus my t-disc investments into the flavors I love, and purge the losers.  With a full box remaining I'm going to need to toss these.  Also misleading picture on the cover, which gives the impression of a milk based mixture. Their "Crema" is simply whipped bitter "air".
