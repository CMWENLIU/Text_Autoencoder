This is so bad. I was trying to do a nice thing for my mother, by sharing this so-called "liquid sunshine" with her. Yikes. I took a swig, too. Thought I was going to die. I was under the (false) impression that this was made with natural ingredients. Since when is sucralose a natural additive? It is a synthetic sweetener that causes cancer and dementia in lab rats. It made our mouths taste absolutely dried out, and, soon after, my mom developed a bad headache. Awful!!!!!
