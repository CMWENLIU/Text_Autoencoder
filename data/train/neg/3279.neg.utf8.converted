I have purchased this produce for years, but my last purchase was disappointing.  The liquid inside was more than the salmon itself.  Before when opening the can, it was so packed full of salmon and hardly no liquid. All I can say is that something has dramatically changed in the the packing warehouse, and the customers are being cheated.
