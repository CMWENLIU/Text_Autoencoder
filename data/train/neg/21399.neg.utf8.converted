I usually order Kahlua coffee through Keurig themselves.  This time I ordered the Timothy's brand through Amazon and the coffee I received was labeled MILD.  It certainly was......I could barely tell there was coffee in my coffee!  Are there different lengths of roasting the coffee beans resulting in different strengths?  The Keurig branded Kahlua coffee has always been stronger and that is what I prefer. Maybe it's my own error for not knowing any better but I won't order the Timothy's brand again.
