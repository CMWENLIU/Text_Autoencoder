This is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had. Bar none. The tea is so incredibly weak it is indistinguishable from normal black tea. I kid you not. I often looked at the box and the bags trying to determine if some mistake in packaging was made. The insert says "mild flavor" and they really do mean it. So mild you cannot taste the bergamot oil at all! I ended up using these as black tea filler in my iced tea mix, but I will never buy a Dilmah product again after being ripped off by this substandard tea. I can recommend Bigelow Earl Grey for economy minded folk. Just one of those tea bags has more flavor than an entire box of Dilmah's wretched excuse for an Earl Grey.
