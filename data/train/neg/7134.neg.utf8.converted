When will they learn - if it's a long standing product with a loyal fan base - changing the recipe is NOT a great idea?!<br />If you want a NEW product - create one.  But they have removed a great deal of the vitamins and nutrition - which was what had me drinking it.  Now I might as well just add hershey's syrup.  Not what I'm after!<br />They have lost a loyal customer here.
