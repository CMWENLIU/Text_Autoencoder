I got a batch of these for my children, who love lollipops of all kinds. They disliked every single flavor in the batch. I didn't much care for the flavors either and we ended up throwing them out. Maybe older kids would like these or determined foodies but I'd recommend trying a small batch before investing in a large amount.
