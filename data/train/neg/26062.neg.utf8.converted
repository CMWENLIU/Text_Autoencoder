The product inside the can is very good. I use it for cooking.<br />The packaging is inadequate. Half of the cans arrived severely dented. I opened the most mis-shapen can and saw no breach in the seal of the container; so I still used it despite misgivings.<br /> I saw that Amazon does not accept return of this canned product. Also I got no request for feedback except as to the adequacy of the packaging, so I feel they must be aware of the faulty and inadequate packaging.<br /> Roland Coconut Milk, Organic, 14-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)
