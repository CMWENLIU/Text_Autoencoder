WOW. Kashi has noticeably made the packaging smaller therefore "trying" to trick the consumer into thinking that prices haven't gone up. To top it off, recently came out that there "natural" claim is deceiving<br />and the soy they use in the Kashi cereal is genetically modified and sprayed with chemicals. They just lost me as a customer as well as others.
