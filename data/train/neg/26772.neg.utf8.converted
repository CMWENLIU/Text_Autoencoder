I looked at the size of this item and realized that this is the 1.75 oz box. I thought it was a mistake, but, no - this is really that tiny little box with abut 4 pieces of candy  that sells for a dollar or less at most stores. So if you ordered this item it would cost you $13 with the shipping, at a time when most stores sell the 10-12 oz box for $5. What's more, although this box is less than 2oz in weight, the seller is charging 6 dollars to ship it! I cannot understand why  Amazon is allowing this merchant to get away with such fraud.
