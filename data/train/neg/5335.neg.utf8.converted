Horrible taste. All the packets tastes the same. Same gravy and same kind of spices in all the packets except the palak panner, which indeed does not have any taste to it.  Don't get it. Its not even worth buying even if u get 80% discount on the items. I would grade -5 on 10. When u eat u'll feel oh isnt that taste like the previous packet.
