Purchased two packs to use for a gimmick tasting game at a party, but everyone was disappointed in the pills not working as advertised on ThinkGeek and other sites.<br /><br />Everyone agreed that the pills themselves had a sweet flavor, but didn't alter the taste of anything we tried after the pills had dissolved on our tongues. Didn't ruin the party or anything, just a little aggravating given how expensive they are.<br /><br />Will not be buying again, you shouldn't waste your money on them either.
