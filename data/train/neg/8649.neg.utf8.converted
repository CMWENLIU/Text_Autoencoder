It was suggested that the coffee I prefer tasted like "dish water" so I asked for suggestions regarding a good Colombian Ground Coffee.  I was told that Eight O'Clock Coffee, Colombian would be a great coffee. Although it was pricier than the Folger's Lively Colombian, I decided to buy it along with the Folger's and the Maxwell House Colombians and do a side-by-side taste test.  Results:  Maxwell was bold, smooth, full-bodied dark.  Folger's Lively Colombian was lighter but more complex, smooth, and "lively" and absolutely lovely.  The Eight O'Clock Colombian was dark, flat, bitter even after trying to adjust measurements.  I don't regret spending my money on this adventure and really wanted to see what it was all about. I will donate the remainder of the grounds to an organization that needs really strong coffee.  "Delicious is in the tongue of the taster." To each his own.
