I heard nothing but raves about this bar and how it tastes "just like cherry pie!".<br /><br />Ummm, perhaps people need to eat more cherry pie, because the cherry pie I'm used to tastes nothing like these... These tastes a lot more like someone doused a date and nut bar with sour cherry juice.<br /><br />Too tart and WAY too sweet.
