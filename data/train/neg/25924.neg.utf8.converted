This is DARK roast coffee.  I did not notice this before buying.  I do not like dark roast as the coffee seems burned and strong.  If you like Starbucks coffee then you will probably like this coffee.  I took one taste and dumped the entire pot out.  The smell is very strong which reminds me of a nasty cigar.
