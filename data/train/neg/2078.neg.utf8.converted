So here's my story. First of all, I've no particular interest in promoting any particular mole trap. I just want to let folks know what worked  (and didn't) for me.<br /><br />About five weeks ago I began to notice that I had a new mole problem in my yard. Two to four new mounds would be noticed each morning. I had a similar problem last year and a `professional' mole trapper caught one and the problem went away for several months.<br /><br />I initially bought three different brands of traps (Macabee, Talprid, and Victor)  and set them out following the manufacturers instructions. Because I have a big lawn and wanted to construct a valid `scientific' experiment I set out six of each trap in various locations throughout the lawn. Each morning I would check the Macabee and Victor traps and usually I would see that the traps had been covered by dirt. To me this showed that the holes were active. However, in all these cases the traps failed to trigger despite proof of fresh mole activity. The Talprid trap was occasionally triggered but no evidence of mole demise was found...and fresh mole activity was noted the next day.<br /><br />I then recalled the brand of trap that the mole trapper from last year had employed. A little internet search showed me that it was the Cinch brand mole trap. I purchased several Cinch traps and, after they arrived, began to incorporate them into my experiment.<br /><br />I kept using the Victor and Macabee along with the Cinch traps despite my yard looking like a miniature movie set of a battlefield with mini-craters everywhere. But...success! Two days after beginning use of the Cinch traps I caught the first of three moles. The Victor and Macabee traps continued to be buried, rarely triggered, and never caught anything.<br /><br />Three weeks later I still haven't had moles return. If they do I'll doubt I'll use anything but the Cinch traps.<br /><br />Analysis: I know some writers swear by other brands and I have no doubt that they have a reason for doing so. They didn't work me. The Cinch traps did. I've also had several other friends, neighbors, and acquaintances relay similar success stories with this particular trap.
