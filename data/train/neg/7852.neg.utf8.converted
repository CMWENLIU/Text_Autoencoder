I HAVE PURCHASED NUMEROUS WALNUTS FROM AMAZON BY DIFFERENT VENDORS AND THEY WERE GREAT.  THESE WERE AWFUL.  I PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER BEFORE I OPENED THEM FOR FRESHNESS.  WHEN I OPENED THEM MOST WERE STALE.  HAD TO THROW ALL SIX BAGS IN THE TRASH.  WILL NOT ORDER THESE AGAIN.  A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY.
