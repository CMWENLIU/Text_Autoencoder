Our dogs ate this food perfectly fine, but then again, they eat just about anything. We have a Weimaraner and a Husky. Both seem to love the smell and dove right in. My husband said he thought he saw some of the big chewy pieces in the dogs' poop the next day...maybe they aren't getting digested fully?<br /><br />I, like other reviewers, wasn't impressed with the ingredients list. Lots of soy and corn and by-products. Also, they have added colors! Really? Who is eating this...dogs! Dogs don't need colored bits. This is dog food being marketed toward humans who like colors. Silliness.<br /><br />The "chewy" bits are more rubbery feeling than "tender" and "meaty". Also, it seems pretty expensive for something that is loaded with soy and corn and by-products. The more I think about it and write this review the more I'm thinking it's more like a 2-star dog food. Not impressed.
