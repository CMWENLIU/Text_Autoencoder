Maybe OK for a boston butt, but as a general purpose rub I find it too heavy on the salt. Admittedly, just how salty is "too salty" is a highly subjective thing, and some others obviously like this rub quite a lot. But looking at the nutrition info on the label, the sodium content in this rub is substantially higher than most other commercial rubs/seasons I've tried. So just be forewarned that if your salt preference is more on the conservative side, this may not be the product for you.
