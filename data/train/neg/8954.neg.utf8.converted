I am so disappointed with my candy boxes.  I bought 4 boxes 40, 80, and two 90s.  Each box had pretty much the same candy with the exception of maybe three different ones.  One of my boxes arrived with a torn handle.  I will never order these candy boxes again, and I really wish that I could return them without paying a mountain load of money for the shipping and handling.  I give the boxes two thumbs down.
