I have a several chipmunk holes around my house which go under concrete and am concerned they are going to damage the foundation.  So I bought the spray AND granules neither worked a snot.  I then took the remaining product and COMPLETELY filled the holes with Critter Ridder.  Within hours the chipmunks just pushed it aside and continued using the exact same hole.  Do NOT buy this for chipmunks it is 100% ineffective.  It would be worth the price if it worked, but it was absolutely useless for every chipmunk hole I used it on.  Save your money buy a trap.  I doubt they even tested this on chipmunks.  It may work for squirrels but they are wrong about Chip and Dale.
