I absolutely LOVED EB food...as did my baby.  That is, until I read that EB uses BPA in the sealing of their lids!!!!  How in the world does a company who cares about organic, gluten free, kosher, and products free of being genetically modified think that it is okay to use BPA?!!?  I called EB to verify this information and the lady admitted it.  (But they are "looking into an alternative packaging". That can't happen fast enough!!!!)
