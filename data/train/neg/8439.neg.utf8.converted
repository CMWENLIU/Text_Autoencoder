First let me say I LOVE how they TASTE- but<br /><br />"Warning Warning,, Dont buy canned goods manufactured in China,, there is usually LEAD in the soldering/lining of these cans,, TOXIC TOXIC"<br /><br />yes and thats not even my words, thats someone elses comment that I found when I did a search for "lead cans" and "china".<br />make sure you know what you are getting. the country of origin is clearly labeled as being from china.<br /><br />I ate these and afterwards I didnt feel so hot all day long the next day.<br />Also Its worth noting that I ordered 2 cans, and one of them came severely dented and damaged.<br />Also make sure you realize that if you try to return them , it wont let you, its not allowed to be returned under amazons return policy -it told me that when I clicked on return items. The odds of you getting a dented can seem very high. And im sure that if there is lead in the lining, that denting the can will only make it leech even more.<br /><br />its really a shame that there isnt an american company canning and selling these figs! c'mon american companies , get with the program!<br /><br />taste and texture wise they are great. They come with too much sugar syrup in the can, but if you drain them and give them a bath in pure water you can get most of the sugar to come off, so thats fixable. If there is lead leeching into the fruit though, that isnt fixable, or acceptable. I cant confirm or deny at this time that there is definatly lead, but I personally dont trust canned foods from any country outside of the usa.<br /><br />I know you can get lead toxicity from eating canned foods with lead lined cans, because I used to eat alot of canned papaya that was canned in tailand. I did a hair test a few months after eating tons of canned papaya, and the hair test showed me 23 times the normal limit of lead. Then i got a lead test kit to test the can and sure enough it was lead posative.<br /><br />im going to try to order another lead test kit and see if I can test these cans again myself, and maybe if I can get that done ill update this review with those results .<br /><br />meantime I have 2 more cans already ordered and shipped, and I guess I cant cancel or return them now and im gonna be stuck with the lead! I dont intend to eat them anytime soon, if ever. Id suggest severely limiting the amount of figs that you eat at once, if you do decide to eat them.
