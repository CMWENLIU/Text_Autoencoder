This Ramen is definitely one of the best. I don't eat the American 10 cent ramen, the quality of noodle is so different and the spices are great. I also eat mine with an egg dropped in. It only get 2 stars b/c this is a rip-off on Amazon. I can buy this 20pack for $20 at my local Asian grocery store.
