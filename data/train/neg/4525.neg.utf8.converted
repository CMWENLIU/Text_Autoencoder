We got the order very quickly, which was great.  However, the product is stale.  What should only take 90 seconds to pop takes us twice as long, and still with many unpopped kernels in the bag.  We don't have this issue with other brands, and am surprised this one is of such poor quality, especially since it's more expensive than the other brands.  Save your money!
