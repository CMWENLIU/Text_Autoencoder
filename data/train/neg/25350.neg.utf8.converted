I was looking for whole white wheat and had a hard time finding anything with that title.  I ordered this in hopes that it was whole wheat. I was disappointed that the product contains no nutritional information on it.  If I am paying 12 dollars for a supposedly healthy food item, I feel it should at least have nutritional information and ingredients listed on it!! I still have no idea if what I ordered is whole grain or not!!
