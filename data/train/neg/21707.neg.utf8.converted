I've had a Keuring brewer in one form or another for a few years now, and besides the sample packs, I must say these are the most disappointing K-kups yet.  Mabye I just like my coffee to taste like coffee, but this particular flavor has a very chemical taste to it, and leaves a pretty bad after taste. 1 star for working in my keurig, and one star for being cheap on Amazon.com!
