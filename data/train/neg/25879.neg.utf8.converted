I purchased this because I was in a dorm room without access to a refrigerator. I had a Keurig coffee maker and I thought that this would be a great addition to my morning coffee. Well it was for the first week or so, but this industrial container is very hard to drain on your own. After a few weeks, it started to taste strange and I noticed that each shot of creamer was loaded with trans fats, which grossed me out so much that I threw the rest away and even tossed the second bottle. Yuck.
