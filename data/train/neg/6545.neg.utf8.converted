I got my 2 kittens about a year ago (June 08) and started them on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFEMHK">Innova EVO Cat and Kitten Dry Cat Food (15.4-lb bag)</a>. They both enjoyed EVO and the ingredients are very similar to what is in CORE. But I decided to give Wellness Core a try now that they are older because EVO has a higher fat content and more calories and I didn't think they would need as much fat content now that they are about a year old.<br /><br />They seemed to like the taste of CORE just as much (maybe even a little more), but I will say that CORE has a much stronger, fishier smell than EVO. Also, a 12lb. bag of CORE is about the same price as a 15.4lb. bag of EVO, so CORE winds up being more expensive. Though it is more convenient to just go to PetCo to buy the CORE than it is to go to the specialty feed store to buy EVO.<br /><br />Bottom line: both are excellent dry cat foods, and I will probably wind up rotating between them. Since they are outdoor cats, I plan on feeding them EVO as the weather gets colder so they can build up a layer of fat for the winter, and Core when it's warmer and they don't need as much insulation.<br /><br />UPDATE (10/21/2012): One of our cats started having urinary tract problems. After doing some research online, I found a number of people using this cat food that have complained about urinary problems caused by this food. We have since switched to a different brand (Orijen) and the urinary crystals have gone away.
