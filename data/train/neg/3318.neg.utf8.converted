I like coffee.  I do.  Particularly iced.  Now full disclaimer here: my norm is a cold brewed coffee so I am used to a very different coffee,  but I also partake in the the weekly  coffeehouse drink or rare canned drink like the type I am reviewing here.  When I saw on its page that it was claiming to be "bold" and an "espresso-style coffee drink with a touch of sweetness" at only 45 calories?  Well sign me up!  I figured worse case scenario well I'd dump it into a cup o' milk.  How wrong I was.  It was just bitter and nasty and wrong.  I never did figure out if it was the coffee itself or that "touch of sweetness"  but something in this tiny little can was not right and no amount of milk made it right.  I finally gave up, dumping it out, wasting a perfectly good cup o' milk.<br /><br />Shame, I had high hopes for it.
