I bought this toy because of the company's claim that it will withstand the toughest chewers- which is what one of my Labs is. However, it took my girl about 5 minutes to break through the seam on one of the points of the star.<br />If your dog is anything more aggressive than a medium chewer, don't waste your money on this toy because it can't withstand powerful chewers.
