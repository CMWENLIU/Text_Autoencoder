I dislike how all the flake cereals immediately dissolve into the milk forcing you to eat as fast as possible.. so this one was a good surprise. It's quite crunchy and stays that way in milk, but maybe a little over crunchy?.. They really did not need to glaze it that much. With that much glaze I also expected it to have a lot of flavor but no.. it was like just crunch crunch all the time. Also, where are the clusters?? I see tiny flakes of blue colors oats (like a cluster of 2 oats max) randomly, but no blueberries!! I don't see where you all are seeing these yummy blueberries. Please tell me how my cereal is missing all the clusters. If it's supposed to be that way, why does the picture so clusters so large and claim to have clusters?!?
