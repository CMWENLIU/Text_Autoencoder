Just received these and have not and will not taste them because they contain CITRIC ACID. For those who have a sensitivity to this ingredient it is important to know these contain it before you purchase it. Also that Citric Acid is made from Corn (possibly GMO, since these are from China) and Aspergillus Niger (A fermented fungus combo)and is basically a mold extract and certainly not derived from citrus.<br />The Peaches made by this same company however, do not have citric acid in them and are tasty and very sweet.
