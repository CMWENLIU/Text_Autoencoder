I had high hopes for Blue Buffalo Kitten food. I feed all my animals high quality food, my 3 dogs are on Nutro Ultra Holistic (small breed), and unfortunately there is no equivalent for cats. I narrowed my food choices down to Blue, Innova, and Wellness. You get the most Blue Buffalo for the money so that is what I decided to go with. Within days of bringing my 4 month old kitten home from the humane society he developed diarrhea. I chalked it up to stress and switching foods. Imagine my surprise when the diarrhea never went away. I wanted to see if anyone else was having the same problem. Google "Blue Buffalo kitten diarrhea" and you will see others having the same issue. If it's not diarrhea it's smelly poops in general. I wish I knew what was causing this, if it's an ingredient he's allergic to or something else. I just started him on Innova and will update if the diarrhea subsides.<br /><br />My kitten seemed to enjoy the food though, he would gobble it up no problem, life source bits and all. The small kibbles make it easier for a mess to be made if you have a messy eater. If you are going to try this food, just monitor their feces for changes in consistency and smell, as this food has been shown to cause issues in some cats. If my kitten wasn't having issues on this food I would probably give it 5 stars for value, flavor, and ingredients.<br /><br />Edit: After a few weeks on Inova the diarrhea has completely cleared up and not returned! It was definitely Blue Buffalo that caused his issues. I guess this food really isn't for all cats.
