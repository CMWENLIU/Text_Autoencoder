I am so tired of companies claiming their products are GF when they are not. Most of the items in this product are cross-contaminated, I have celiac ,this is not a diet fad for me.Believe me I miss all my gluten foods. The government needs to step up and regulate the products better. GLUTEN-FREE, should mean just that. NO *&%^ing Gluten !!!!!!!!
