I bought this tea for the health benefits, and although I am not the biggest fan of tea, I knew that this tea was extremely overbearing and is very hard to drink. This team smelled like perfume, as well as tasted like it. It left my mouth smelling like I drank a bottle of perfume and it just wasn't pleasant at all. I can usually handle things that taste bad, but this was an exception. If you can get over the strong taste, however, I'm sure you'll be fine.
