This product is made in China. Although it is distributed by a company in the US, it states "Made In China." I see that nowhere listed on the ad to buy it and thinking I was doing my dog a favor, I did him harm; he has been ill for two days, after eating two of these "treats" when I received them two days ago. Because the label touts health and wholeness does not mean it is made by people with health in mind. It is made in China. The same nation which put melamine in food; melamine reads as protein in analysis of the food so it was a cheap and shameless method to advertise more protein while it caused misery and tears and death to countless. And this is an item Amazon does not accept as a return so purchase at your own (dog's) risk.
