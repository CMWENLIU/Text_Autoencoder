First of all, on opening the bag, the beans were light brown and dry, no great aromas.  I have tried to like it, but it makes horrible espresso drinks (no crema, tastes like weak cheap coffee).  I will go back to San Francisco dark roast for my daily espresso drinks fix. Even though I paid over $20 for the bag, I cannot drink it.
