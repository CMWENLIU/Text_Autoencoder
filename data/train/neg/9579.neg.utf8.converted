These just arrived and I was very disappointed to see that the jars are plastic. I thought Nutiva was a more "green" company than to cut corners like that. Sure, it's recyclable: once. Glass is a better choice, especially since this is an oil and every other day a new study comes out showing how much plastic packaging leaches into food. I wish the product description on Amazon would mention how it's packaged.
