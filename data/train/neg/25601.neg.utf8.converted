I have a 25lb beagle that is a little over a year old. I had previously given 3 drops of the calming treatment but had seen no effect. Recently, a good friend of mine moved into my apartment and caused a bit of anxiety in my dog. I gave her 4 drops and she was fine for the rest of the night. The following day however, she was very lethargic and not very responsive to play and yawned an unusually large amount. As with the other review on this product, my dog also had muscle spasms or tremors. It was not really clear what they were. If purchasing this product, i would definitely be very careful with the amounts and see how dogs react. Honestly, i have been using pet naturals calming treats instead and they work just as well and have no side safest i have seen of.
