A long-time devotee, I don't expect to buy it again. After I tasted the "new improved" and found it much less flavorful than the old, I did a sniff test. The OLDER jar is more aromatic. Then I compared the ingredient lists. The one posted in Amazon is the old one, which begins sugar, chocolate, malt. The new list begins sugar, malt, chocolate. The new packaging looks blander and less robust -- a clue I should have heeded before buying. As far as I'm concerned there is no longer a Chocolate Malt Ovaltine.
