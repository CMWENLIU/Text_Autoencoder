I purchased this item based on a customer review indicating they received approx. 100 oysters. My 20 pound box contained 56 oysters. At $59.00 and free shipping, 100 oysters is a great deal. At 56 pieces, regardless of size, my per piece cost went out the window and suddenly, this is not a good deal. Suggest you buy oysters on a "count" rather than weight basis. I now realize this is the only time I bought oysters this way. I've bought gulf oysters at 100 count per box and 150 count per box. Locally, I buy Pacific oysters at $.67 per piece. These are from Washington state and Vancouver, B.C.. That is a per piece, retail price. Select and bag yourself at a local fish market. Also, the shipment contained no "Harvest Tag". I believe this is a federal requirement. In the event you become ill, the source of the oysters can be traced. Won't buy again.
