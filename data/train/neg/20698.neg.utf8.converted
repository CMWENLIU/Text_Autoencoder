made mistake of my wife and myself trying to revive plant where everything fell off within few days as was stated by another review where exact same thing happened. finally after few tries and we both have many successful bonsai plants and some from seeds my wife declared plant dead and when i called brussel's bonsai they said i was not considered their customer because i purchased plant from amazon and when i looked at amazon return policy i found it no longer covered as period where we tried to revive plant took us past return day(by a lot). total lack of anything that could be called customer service and will never purchase anything from them again. very rude and even swore at me when i tried to explain what had happened. i think amazon should take some of the reviews of this particular plant and realize something is wrong and make it right with both myself and other customers who complained about this product. definitely lots of dependable sources for bonsai on internet but brussel's is not one of them, buyer beware buyer beware buyer beware
