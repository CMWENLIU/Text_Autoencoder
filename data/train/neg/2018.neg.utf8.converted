VERY  WATERY &  NOTICIBLE  ARTIFICIAL  FLAVOR ;  I  DIDNT  LIKE &  WONT BUY  AGAIN , SEEMS  TO BE  VERY "SUBSTANDARD" ;  I  HAVE BOUGHT &  EATEN  MANY  SARDINES IN OVER 30 YRS & these are the "LEAST QUALITY" by FAR ; JUST BECAUSE IT SAYS:  "ORGANIC/SUSTAINABLE/ETC>"  DOSENT SEEM TO REALLY MATTER (JUST SOME SUBJECTIVE SPIN) SO WILL APPEAL TO SOMEONE/GROUP .
