Must say I am so bummed out when I bought the 3 pack of 'artificially flavored' wintergreen....(FIRST CLUE?) from another source to find; not only do I not have real sugar, I am getting blue dye too.  This is obviously not 'original recipe' as states on front of tin so, quit trying to sell it that way Wrigley!!  Not happy and won't buy anymore! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKL0EU">Altoids Curiously Strong Mints, Wintergreen, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>
