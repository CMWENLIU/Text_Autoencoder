Enjoyed upon receiving.  Not a night and day difference, but using with scotch seemed to provide a smoother finish and reduce the "burn" quality (i drink it neat.)  HOWEVER, after about 5 uses, pressing the button to release the scotch through the aerator no longer worked!  I pressed it several times, to no avail - then held it in place to see if it would eventually free itself, also to no avail... poured the scotch into my glass out of the top, so that i could then shake and smack the aerator and the stopper eventually freed itself.  But the stopper - which appears to be magnetic - has not worked well since, and i would inevitably have to smack it a couple of times prior to pouring to get it to work (since you can't smack it while there's anything in the glass.)  Anyways, I call the manufacturer for a replacement and I have to pay to ship it to them.  They pay return shipping for replacement - fair enough - but i'm still paying extra for dealing with the hassle.  Hopefully the next one will not have this issue, as this seems to be the first mention of this problem.  I will update if the next one has this issue.<br /><br />Take note manufacturers, if YOUR product has a fault and it has inconvenienced a customer for a legitimate reason, consider paying for their shipping to soften the hassle of an exchange.
