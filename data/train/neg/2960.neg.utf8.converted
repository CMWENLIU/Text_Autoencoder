I am surprised to be writing that I am disappointed in a Pamela's product having always been a fan.  When the frostings came out I was excited to have a convenient source of frosting in a pinch.  The directions were easy, the prep a breeze but the final product fell short.  The frosting was too sweet with an overpowering vanilla taste-and I love vanilla. I would have to say the vanilla tasted artificial since it was so strong. I make a beautiful vanilla buttercream and although I did not expect a final product of this caliber, I expected better than what I tasted. Skip this product and take a few extra minutes to make your own.
