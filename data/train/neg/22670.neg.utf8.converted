Like the other reviews, it doesn't taste like Pad Thai. I was disappointed that the 'noodles' are actually broken up pieces of noodles...so no long strands here. I think it's how it is supposed to be. : ( It is more of a soup and okay tasting if you weren't expecting pad thai, but I won't buy it again.
