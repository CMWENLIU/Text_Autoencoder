It ain't what I remember, from when I emigrated from good ol Germany in 1976. But it is still better than the caramel colored abomination the bakers over here try to peddle as "pumpernickel". Even though it is a far cry from the real westphalian stuff that used to be baked long and slow with the maillard reaction providing the sweetness and caramelization and not some bottle from the laboratory.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the real stuff from a german noble bakery probably fell victim to industrialization, like so many things in this world. Schade.<br /><br />It will still give you a pleasant source of fibre in your bread, but real Pumpernickel it ain't, more like a very heavy KOMISSBROT.<br /><br />Kuechenmeister Kuntze.
