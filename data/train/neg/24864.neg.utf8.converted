I tried this once. You can get the same thing by buying some popping corn in your local grocery, popping it, pouring it into a bowl, and adding milk. This made me reluctant to try other Kashi products.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't see why people continue to pay an outrageous price for what amounts to popcorn.<br /><br />PS. Amazon should add a zero star rating.
