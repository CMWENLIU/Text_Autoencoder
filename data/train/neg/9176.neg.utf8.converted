I honestly don't know how this item is allowed on store shelves! It's THAT BAD!<br /><br />I was having trouble locating my favorite vanilla nut tea from another tea company and in its absence decided to try Stash's. I cannot even express how 'chemical' and unnatural it smelled and tasted! I had to throw it out! Will never purchase Stash again.<br /><br />Disregard the 1 star rating... I would give it 'zero' if I could!
