I wanted to try these because the name was catchy, the packaging was bright and colorful and I really like the taste and crunch of freeze dried fruit for snacking. I also purchased this item because it contained a variety of flavors to taste test.  Unfortunately, For a variety pack I didn't find a whole lot of variety. Two of the four flavors were primarily bananas -- Purple Funk (bananas with an acai coating) and Bananamon (bananas with a cinnamon). The flavor I preferred was Jivalime (pineapple and lime). It has a very robust flavor.  The lime is strong and makes it very tart. The Carnival mix was just OK. This was a mixture of banana, pineapple, apple, papaya, and raisins. The pieces were very small in this mix.  I would have preferred  bigger pieces of papaya, apple and pineapple.<br /><br />There are several other freeze-dried fruit mixes that I personally like better - perhaps because they have more traditional flavors. The Crispy Green product line is a favorite of mine and is comparable price-wise to the Funky Monkey products. For great peach flavor try Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Peaches, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  I also like the Crispy Green dried pineapple snack  Crispy Green Fruit Snacks, Crispy Pineapples, 2.2-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3).  With Crispy Green you get 3 individual serving bags inside of a bigger bag. You actually get 9 bags of snacks. The extra packaging really does keep the fruit crispy and great tasting for a long time.<br /><br />Sensible Foods also makes a delicious crispy snack called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYRHL2">Sensible Foods Crunch Dried Snacks, Cherry Berry, 0.75-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> - great crunch and flavor.  Cherry Berry is my personal favorite but Sensible Foods has several other tasty flavors, too, including a tropical fruit mix.
