Be warned: although the FDA label claims "0g trans fat" the ingredients tell a different story, as "partially hydrogenated coconut or palm kernel" is the first ingredient listed. This is a poison that is now outlawed in New York restaurants, and if you are careful about what you eat you want to make sure you stay away from this.<br /><br />As it turns out, they can claim "0g trans fat" because the content is less than 1g per serving, but it's a technicality: the product contains a significant amount of trans fat.<br /><br />Obviously, you're not going to drop dead from using a teaspoon in your coffee once, but regular, prolonged use is detrimental to your health. You're better off staying away altogether anyway, and you may want to do what I did and contact Nestle consumer service to complain about their deceptive practices. This product can and should be made with healthier ingredients.
