Now, I like Fresca as much as the next person (which is to say, I'm fairly indifferent to it), but there's no reason this should cost $80.  Is there some kind of Fresca speculation going on where, like, people are driving up the price of Fresca in anticipation of it disappearing?  Has science recently discovered that it can be used as an alternative fuel source?  I understand that you get 6 of these bottles for a grand total of 12 liters, but GAS is cheaper than that, folks.  Friends don't let friends buy $80 Fresca.
