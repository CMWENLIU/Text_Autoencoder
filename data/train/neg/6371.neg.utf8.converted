I bought the variety pack of this brand chip with lime, black bean, and plain. They had to be the most greasy weird gummy tasting chip I have ever had in my entire life!  I am not that picky but these were so strangely bad that I am surprised anyone gave these a good review. Yikes...it all went into the garbage after several attempts to like these. The lime flavor was the least gummy, but why bother?  I will stick to "Garden of Eatin" brand from now on.
