most of these packages came with holes in the plastic, and wierd cobwebby 'dust' around the openings - and winged bugs!  i threw the bad ones out, but the 'good' one soon developed the same symptoms.  it was disgusting.<br /><br />what a waste!  amazon should really list an expiration date for these type of products.  yuck!
