When I saw this product on the shelf at Wal-Mart, I instantly tossed it into my cart (both medium and light roast).  I like to have a supply of different coffees on hand.  I immediately made a cup when I got home from the store.  Actually, I love the flavor.  It is easy on the tongue, and leaves the mouth refreshed.  I thought there was something odd about the K-Cup itself, different sound when shaken, and appeared to be empty after use!  I did some quick surgery on the Cup and realized that I have been duped.  While I would still drink this had it been advertised honestly, because it has great flavor, I do not care to reward dishonesty and deceptive advertising.  It seems that rather than conducting any research to find the best combination of flavors, they chose to use word-tricks and lies.  Shame on them!
