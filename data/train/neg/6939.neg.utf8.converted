I have tried other cake mixes and this is one I will not buy again.  Coming from a mother of a 2 year old son with Celiac, this was not a hit with him.  He ate half a cupcake and didn't want anymore.  I taste tested myself and it was gritty, bland,dry and became even more dry and gritty the next day.  I made this mix a year ago before I found out my son also has an intolerance to soy.  I now purchase pamelas chocolate cake mix which he loves and it doesn't have any soy.  Pamelas also has frosting which you can make into buttercream which is also soy free.
