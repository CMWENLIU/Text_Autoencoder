Ok first of all right when I opened the package which came in two days since I used two day shipping, The can was dented all around and literally punctured in some spots. I have the can in the right temperature and follow the directions, It has been exactly two weeks and not even a sprout is showing. I cannot contact seller for some reason because the option is not there, so this smells kind of fishy. I demand a refund or another NON DENTED/WORKING can.
