I was thrilled to have my new food writers... hearing that these were the best, I had high expectations.<br />They were great for a minute...<br />Then the tip squished immediately (and I was being so careful too!) and the ink ran out right away!<br />They are good if you only need to write one or two things, but for a batch of lady bug cake pops...<br />I'd try something else : (
