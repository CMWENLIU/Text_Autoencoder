Taste good, good/interesting texture -- but from China? No way. The Chinese are excellent not only at putting scary things in their products, but also at hiding those ingredients from the American companies that deal with them. I don't trust any metals [especially] that come from China, I'm sure as heck not going to trust any FOOD coming from there! Try KIND products -- similar bar [better], twice as expensive, but USA made.
