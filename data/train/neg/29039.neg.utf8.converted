The ONE-STAR in no way reflects on the oats, folks--- McCann's gets 5 stars all the way with me- it's pretty much the only breakfast item I must always have on hand (I, too, recommend the crock-pot method- and also recommend freeze-dried fruit to add in- I really like the "Sensible Foods" brands that are available here.)<br /><br />The one-star rating is for the condition in which it was shipped:<br />I thought I'd pick up the cans of this breakfast staple to have something presentable out on the counter since I use it daily--- alas, don't bother.  I've uploaded a photo of how mine arrived- others have commented on this in reviews as well.  I'll probably pick up one nice tin locally instead (which is what I should have done to start with) and just go with boxed oats.
