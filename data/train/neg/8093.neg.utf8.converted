I was very disappointed to receive what I thought would<br />be a quality olive oil in a glass bottle, instead it is in a Plastic<br />bottle. I urge buyers not to buy this product as plastic<br />introduces cancer causing chemicals into the oil, specifically<br />if exposed to heat.  Additionally, plastic is ruining the<br />environment as it never breaks down, and is essentially<br />a permanent stain on mankind for unnecessarily<br />ruining the environment.  Please do not buy this product.
