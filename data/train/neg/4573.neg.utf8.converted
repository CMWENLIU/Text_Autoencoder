This treat has given my 120 pound doberman seizures and diarrhea badly. He is shaking all over and can barely walk as his hind legs are not wanting to stand. The muscles keep contracting. He finally vomited a lot of the bone.<br />I fed him one small busy bone. How can a company allow this to be sold?????????????<br /><br />The chemicals and colors in this treat are off the chart. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THIS TO YOUR DOG. I HAVE REPORTED IT TO PURINA AND THE FDA
