THIS VILE CRUD DESERVES MINUS 50 STARS!!! I saw some negative reviews and read that this was from China, but I went ahead and tried it anyway, since everything we eat and use these days is from China and I thought it might be ok, that they might have learned a lesson and improved their product...but this stuff is vile, disgusting, foul and probably poisonous. I opened 2 cans, they both had a slight strange metallic smell, and then I took a really really really REALLY tiny taste of the stuff and immediately spit it out, its bitter, nasty and foul. I immediately called Amazon to get a refund and tossed this horrid glop into the trash. AMAZON NEEDS TO STOP SELLING THIS DREADFUL STUFF, SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE OF POISON, I FEAR!
