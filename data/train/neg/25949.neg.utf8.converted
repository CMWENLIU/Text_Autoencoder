This item is literally $10 more than what you can buy it for at a store.  They sell it at Target for $3 or $4/box.  I mistakenly thought I was buying a "bulk" item because it was so expensive.  My fault.  But, when I asked about returning the product they said, sorry no, we believe this is a good price for this item, but if you would like we will offer you 10% off on a future purchase!  Hmm..., I don't think so.  Buyer, beware with this company, make sure you do your research first.  I did not and I payed the price.
