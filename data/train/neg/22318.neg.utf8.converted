Forgive me if I'm stuttering while I type - I'm on the run and working with a fever; I'm losing light and the dogs are baying in the distance...they're onto me.<br /><br />It's been...gawd only knows how long.  A day?  A week since I've had my beloved Huy Fong sriracha sauce...?  I don't know - time is irrelevant when your Jack is gone.  And in my case, there is only one Jack.  "The Rach."<br /><br />It was Visitor Day.  I'd been two months Rach-free (RF) and was looking forward to seeing people again - real people, not the sanitized, medicated zombies in the Ward... the stupified, insipid drones and their robotic dips of french fries into the sugared slick called "Ketchup."<br /><br />"Good enough..." the nurses would say.  "Remember, the taste is good enough..."  and nod in prescribed approval at our "progress."<br /><br />I hated the tastelessness of it all.  But what had my yearning gotten me so far?  Here I was, a Pathetic Wreck of man, who's hope and potential, wasted by the addictive pull of the bottle with the white rooster...<br /><br />"Lucille is here to see you, Wily."<br /><br />Oh gawd. Not her!  She was The One - did they not know?!  Was this a sick test of my will?!?!<br /><br />"Hellooo...wiLY!"  She sauntered to table, dismissing the porters with that look - did I see a smirk?!?  No!  In an unconcious flinch I snatched an individual portion-pack of mayo and began squishing it nervously - she slid onto the plastic seat with a sneering contempt and lifted the hamburger bun.  A slab of processed cheese product atop a rapidly cooling foodservice grade grade patty.  Of beef.<br /><br />Her eyes flicked at the condiment tray like a snake tongue tasting the fear of its prey - little packets of red, white, yellow and blue...and then...she... oh gawd...  she reached into her coat...and... damn her!  Damn her!  The shamelessness of it all!<br /><br />"Want...this?"<br /><br />The green nozzle peeked from her bosom and...I swear...it... it... did it laugh?  Did it howl?  Did it...<br /><br />(lightning flash, thunder - the sound of roaring rain, the gutteral humphs of bloodhounds)<br /><br />Time stretched and distorted - the space between the bottle and my reflexive snatch disappeared as if my arm had become the tongue of a chameleon; my hand the sticky  mass, the 28oz bottle of Rach in her coat, the prey...the food...the LIFE...<br /><br />SNAP!<br /><br />Foul, foul temptress...she'd removed the silver seal! But could I care!?  No.  At the moment, the deed was no betrayal of my Rach Sobriety but an act of glorious courtesy, saving myself the precious milisecond that it would have required to remove it before twisting the nozzle, dispensing the red SOUL onto my hamburger patty in a fantastic, psychedelic *splurrrrrrrtppplp!*<br /><br />Mwwwahhhhaaaaa...I shuddered in ecstasy, the wonderful aroma of rich, sensuous, spicy, sweet, delicious, holy Huy Fong Sriracha sauce filled my nostrils as Life itself fills the lungs of a submerged man breaking the surface of water, sucking in breath....<br /><br />Two bites and the cheeseburger was devoured...Rach spread across my face in a Joker-like grin, sprayed across my hospital whites, the result of a gruesome orgy of deliciousness...<br /><br />The alarm sounded like a WW2 air raid klaxon - "Flavor in Ward C!  Flavor in Ward C!"<br /><br />"QUick!  I've left the window open!"  She pointed to..well, one of the windows that was open and with 28oz Huy Fong Sriracha bottle in hand, made my break - landing in a spray of glass (in my haste, I jumped through the wrong window) and ripping of cheap nylon screen.<br /><br />How did I traverse the 100 feet to the fence?  How did I scale the concertina wired confines?  I have no idea.  It's all a blur.<br /><br />So.  Why the One Star (I keep giving Sriracha One-Star and people are starting to get a clue why)?<br /><br />28oz is lame!  It's just not enough!!<br /><br />I'm thinking a 3gallon bag...and a Camelback(tm) pack... this...this...28oz for the worlds most fantastically zesty and (it should be obvious by now) ADDICTING condiments?!?!<br /><br />More, please.
