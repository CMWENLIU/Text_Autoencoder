Well, I have to stay that I was very disappointed in this coffee.  I typically buy whole bean coffee from a local company, and I gotta say that I really enjoy that moment when I break the seal on the bag, and get that rich coffee aroma.  So, always hearing that Kona coffee is the best in the world, I really expected a great experience from this - however that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, there was virtually no coffee aroma.  I don't know if it's been sitting in a warehouse too long (expiration date on back was July 2011 - it's April 2011 as of this writing).  The vacuum seal seemed okay - no tears in the packaging; so I'm at a loss to explain why the coffee seemed 'stale' .  And after brewing my first pot, I gotta say it isn't a great cup of coffee.  At best, it's a mediocre cup of coffee.
