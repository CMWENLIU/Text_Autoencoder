When I saw this I though "I HAVE TO try this." To be honest, it was a waste. It was very watery and definitely NOT "kickin'." I really couldn't taste ANY Dr. Pepper in this product. If I had to do it all over again I would have ignored the novelty of the product and looked for a quality BBQ sauce. This is what I recommend you do. Try Tony Roma's BBQ sauce. Comes in a lot of great flavors and it is nice and thick.
