The first thing I did was check the ingredients because of all the different sweeteners  that claim to be Stevia but have fillers of some sort. I had chosen this brand because it's all natural, no chemicals, but unlike other pure Stevia sweeteners that I've tried, that have Stevia as the Main ingredient and Xylitol(to help with the caking) i.e "Ingredients: Stevia, Xylitol" this one reads, "Ingredients: Inulin soluble fiber, Sweetleaf Sweetener."  I was disappointed and thought you might want to know if you're looking for a real all Stevia sweetener. Amazon does not give refunds on grocery items, though they were gracious on this occassion to give one. I don't know about the taste, my main concern was that it was actually Stevia and then I can look into taste afterwards. One more thing, the description on the bottle label attributes digestive health to the inulin fiber not the stevia.
