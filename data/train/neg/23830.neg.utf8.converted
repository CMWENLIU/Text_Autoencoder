I love ginger candy but would NOT buy Reed's brand anymore. On September 2010, I ordered $42 worth of Reed's products from their online store. They charged my credit card and I generously allowed time for  shipping. Finally after two months, I emailed the Chief Operating Officer that I have not received my order. I was told they do not ship to APO (military address) and yet charged my credit card two months prior. I then asked for a refund as it was too late for charge reversal by the  credit card company. I never heard back (and never got the refund) even after a repeat email and phone message. So much for customer service.
